# Bible Study: From Believer to Converted — The Peter Principle

## Introduction: The Great Distinction

In the Christian world today, the terms "believer" and "convert" are often used interchangeably. However, the words of Jesus to Simon Peter in the Upper Room suggest a startling difference. Peter was the leader of the disciples, a worker of miracles, and the first to verbally recognize Jesus as the Christ. Yet, on the very eve of the crucifixion, Jesus looked at him and said:

> *"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and **when thou art converted**, strengthen thy brethren."* (Luke 22:31-32)

How could Peter be a follower for three and a half years and yet not be "converted"? This study explores the vital difference between intellectual assent and the total transformation of the nature—a lesson essential for God's people in these last days.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word Jesus used for "converted" here is **_epistrephō_**, which means to physically turn around or reverse course. It implies a complete change of direction, not just an improvement of the current path.

## Section 1: The Profile of an Unconverted Believer

To understand what was missing in Peter, we must first appreciate what he possessed. By modern standards, Peter would be considered a "pillar of the church" long before his denial.

### What Peter Had (The "Believer" Status):
*   **He had the right Confession:** *"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God"* (Matthew 16:16). He had correct doctrine regarding Jesus' divinity.
*   **He had Active Ministry:** Jesus sent the twelve out to preach and heal. Mark 6:13 records, *"And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them."* Peter performed miracles by the power of God.
*   **He had Emotional Loyalty:** *"Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life"* (John 6:68). He genuinely loved the Master.

**The Problem:** Peter was a branch grafted into the vine, but self was still the ruling power of his heart. He was a follower of Christ, but he was not yet a partaker of Christ's humility.

[Q] **"Can a person perform miracles or lead in the church and not be truly converted?"**
**Answer:** According to Scripture, yes. In Matthew 7:22-23, Jesus warns that many will say, *"Have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name done many wonderful works?"* yet He will profess, *"I never knew you."* Gifts of the Spirit are given for the work of the church, but the Fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) is the evidence of a converted character. Peter had the gifts, but lacked the fruit of meekness and temperance.

## Section 2: Symptoms of the Unconverted Heart

Why did Jesus say Peter needed conversion? We see the symptoms of the "old man" (self) struggling against the "new man" throughout Peter's walk.

### 1. Self-Confidence
When Jesus warned the disciples they would fall away, Peter declared: *"Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended"* (Matthew 26:33).
*   **The Symptom:** Trusting in one's own love for God rather than God's keeping power. Peter didn't know the deceitfulness of his own heart (Jeremiah 17:9).

### 2. Rejection of the Cross
When Jesus first predicted His death, Peter rebuked Him: *"Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee"* (Matthew 16:22).
*   **The Symptom:** An unconverted heart seeks the Crown without the Cross. It desires the glory of Christianity but shrinks from the suffering and self-denial required by the gospel.

### 3. Carnal Warfare
In the garden, Peter drew his sword and cut off the servant's ear (John 18:10).
*   **The Symptom:** Trying to do God's work with the world's methods. An unconverted spirit meets force with force and heat with heat, rather than the spirit of Jesus which heals the enemy.

[DYK🔎] While the other disciples fled, Peter followed Jesus "afar off" (Matthew 26:58). This is the dangerous middle ground of the unconverted believer—too convicted to go back to the world, but too full of self to stand close to the suffering Christ.

## Section 3: The Process of Conversion (The Sifting)

Conversion is the work of the Holy Spirit, but it often requires a crisis to break the idol of self. For Peter, this was the "sifting" Jesus prophesied.

### The Breaking Point
Peter denied his Lord three times with cursing and swearing. The rooster crowed. Then, a pivotal moment occurred:
> *"And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter... And Peter went out, and wept bitterly."* (Luke 22:61-62)

This was not a look of anger, but of pity and suffering love. That look broke Peter's heart. Judas had **remorse** (fear of consequence), but Peter had **repentance** (sorrow for sin).

**The Change:**
*   Before the fall, Peter was whole in his own eyes.
*   After the fall, Peter was broken.
*   **Crucial Principle:** God cannot use a man who is full of himself. The vessel must be emptied before it can be filled with the Holy Spirit.

## Section 4: The Fruit of a Converted Life

How do we know the change happened? We look at Peter after the resurrection and Pentecost. The difference is stark.

1.  **From Pride to Humility:**
    In John 21, when Jesus asks, "Lovest thou me more than these?" Peter no longer claims superiority. He simply appeals to Jesus' omniscience: *"Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee."*

2.  **From Cowardice to Boldness:**
    The man who cowered before a servant girl stood before the Sanhedrin—the very body that condemned Jesus—and declared, *"We ought to obey God rather than men"* (Acts 5:29). This was not self-confidence, but Spirit-dependence.

3.  **From Self-Exaltation to Self-Sacrifice:**
    Peter's epistle, written years later, contains the very lesson he learned the hard way: *"Be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble"* (1 Peter 5:5).

[DYK🔎] Historical tradition states that when Peter was sentenced to death by Nero, he requested to be crucified upside down, stating he was not worthy to die in the same manner as his Lord. The man who once fought to be the greatest was now content to be the least.

## Conclusion

The story of Peter is a warning and an encouragement to the Remnant Church. It is possible to be an Adventist, a believer, a keeper of the Sabbath, and a worker for God, yet still retain an unconverted heart where self sits on the throne.

**True conversion is not just:**
*   Joining the church.
*   Intellectual agreement with truth.
*   Active participation in ministry.

**True conversion is:**
*   Dieing to self daily (1 Corinthians 15:31).
*   A total shift from self-confidence to Christ-dependence.
*   Having the law of God written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).

### Key Takeaways:
1.  **Examine Yourself:** Do not rest on your past experiences or your current title. Ask, "Is self still alive in me?"
2.  **Welcome the Sifting:** If you are going through a trial that is revealing the ugliness of your own character, do not despair. It is the sifting process designed to break self-dependence so true conversion can take place.
3.  **The Goal:** The purpose of conversion is service. *"When thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren."* We are saved to serve.
