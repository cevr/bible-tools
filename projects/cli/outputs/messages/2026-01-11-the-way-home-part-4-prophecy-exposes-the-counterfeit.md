## Introduction — Why Prophecy Matters (5 min)

- Review: Part 3 exposed the counterfeit system
  - Paganism merged with Christianity
  - Every sanctuary truth systematically replaced
- But how do we *prove* which system is the counterfeit?
  - Not by our feelings or preferences
  - Not by popularity or tradition
  - By the **sure word of prophecy**
- 2 Peter 1:19 — "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed"
  - Prophecy is more sure than even eyewitness testimony
  - [WB]: Write "PROPHECY = God's PROOF" (2 Pet 1:19)
- God gave Daniel detailed prophecies identifying:
  - The exact power that would corrupt sanctuary truth
  - The exact time period of its dominance
  - The exact date when truth would be restored
- [RQ]: If God foretold these events centuries in advance, can we trust the identification? (Isa 46:9–10)
- [EB]: Isaiah 46:9–10 — "I am God... declaring the end from the beginning"

## Section 1 — Daniel 7: The Little Horn Identified (10 min)

### The Four Beasts: World Empires in Sequence

- Daniel 7:2–3 — Daniel sees vision of four beasts from the sea
  - Sea = peoples, multitudes, nations (Rev 17:15)
  - Beasts = kingdoms (Dan 7:17, 23)
- Daniel 7:4 — **Lion** with eagle's wings
  - Babylon (605–539 BC)
  - Wings plucked, made to stand as a man
  - [WB]: Draw lion — "BABYLON" (Dan 7:4)
- Daniel 7:5 — **Bear** raised on one side, three ribs in mouth
  - Medo-Persia (539–331 BC)
  - Persia dominant over Media
  - [WB]: Add bear — "MEDO-PERSIA" (Dan 7:5)
- Daniel 7:6 — **Leopard** with four wings, four heads
  - Greece (331–168 BC)
  - Alexander's rapid conquest; divided among four generals
  - [WB]: Add leopard — "GREECE" (Dan 7:6)
- Daniel 7:7 — **Dreadful beast** with iron teeth, ten horns
  - Rome (168 BC onward)
  - Crushing, devouring power
  - Ten horns = divisions of Western Rome (Europe)
  - [WB]: Add beast with 10 horns — "ROME → 10 DIVISIONS" (Dan 7:7)

### The Little Horn Rises

- Daniel 7:8 — "There came up among them another little horn"
  - Rises *among* the ten — in Europe
  - Three horns uprooted before it
  - "Eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things"
  - [WB]: Draw little horn rising among 10, 3 falling (Dan 7:8)
- Different from the others: religious-political power
  - Not merely political kingdom
  - Claims spiritual authority

### Three Identifying Marks (Daniel 7:25)

- Daniel 7:25 — Three unmistakable characteristics:

**1. "Speak great words against the most High"**
- Blasphemy: Claims divine prerogatives
- Claims to forgive sins (Mark 2:7 — only God can)
- Claims titles belonging to God
- [WB]: Mark #1 — "Speaks against God (blasphemy)" (Dan 7:25)

**2. "Wear out the saints of the most High"**
- Persecution of God's people
- Inquisition, crusades, religious wars
- Millions martyred over centuries
- [WB]: Mark #2 — "Persecutes saints" (Dan 7:25)

**3. "Think to change times and laws"**
- Claims authority to alter God's law
- Changed the Sabbath from seventh to first day
- Removed second commandment (images), split tenth
- [WB]: Mark #3 — "Changes times and laws" (Dan 7:25)

- [RQ]: What power arose in Europe, claimed divine authority, persecuted dissenters, and claims to have changed God's law? (Dan 7:25)
- [EB]: 2 Thessalonians 2:3–4 — Man of sin "sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God"

### The 1260 Years: Prophetic Time Fulfilled

- Daniel 7:25 — "They shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time"
  - Time = 1 year; times = 2 years; dividing of time = ½ year
  - Total: 3½ prophetic years
  - 3½ × 360 days = 1260 prophetic days
- Day-year principle in prophecy:
  - [EB]: Ezekiel 4:6 — "I have appointed thee each day for a year"
  - [EB]: Numbers 14:34 — "Each day for a year"
  - 1260 prophetic days = **1260 literal years**
  - [WB]: Write calculation: 3½ × 360 = 1260 days = 1260 YEARS (Ezek 4:6)

- **Starting point: 538 AD**
  - Decree of Emperor Justinian (533 AD) recognized pope as head of churches
  - Enforced in 538 AD when Ostrogoths defeated
  - Papal supremacy begins

- **Ending point: 1798 AD**
  - 538 + 1260 = 1798
  - Napoleon's general Berthier takes Pope Pius VI captive
  - Papal power receives "deadly wound" (Rev 13:3)
  - [WB]: Timeline — 538 AD → 1260 years → 1798 AD (Dan 7:25)

- [EGW]: "For more than a thousand years, such persecutions as the world had never before known were brought against Christ's followers." (GC 54.1)
- [RQ]: If prophecy specified 1260 years of persecution, and history confirms exactly this period, can we doubt the identification? (Dan 7:25)

## Section 2 — Daniel 8: The Daily and the 2300 Days (8 min)

### The Sanctuary Under Attack

- Daniel 8:9–12 — The little horn in Daniel 8
  - Grows exceedingly great
  - Attacks "the host of heaven" and "the prince of the host"
  - [WB]: Title — "ATTACK ON THE SANCTUARY" (Dan 8:9–12)

### The "Daily" Taken Away

- Daniel 8:11 — "By him the daily was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down"
  - "Daily" = Hebrew *tamid* = continual, perpetual
  - Refers to the continual ministry in the sanctuary
  - [WB]: Write "DAILY (tamid) = CONTINUAL ministry" (Dan 8:11)
- What is Christ's continual ministry?
  - Hebrews 7:25 — "He ever liveth to make intercession"
  - Christ continually intercedes in the heavenly sanctuary
  - [WB]: "DAILY = Christ's continual intercession in heaven" (Heb 7:25)
- How was the daily "taken away"?
  - Not literally removed from heaven
  - *Obscured from view* by the counterfeit system
  - Earthly priesthood and mass replaced heavenly intercession in people's understanding
- [RQ]: When a system claims priests can re-sacrifice Christ daily, what happens to His once-for-all heavenly ministry? (Dan 8:11; Heb 10:12)
- [EGW]: "The daily represents the continual mediation of Christ in the sanctuary above." (4SP 259)
- [WB]: Draw heavenly sanctuary with cloud labeled "COUNTERFEIT SYSTEM" obscuring it (Dan 8:11–12)

### Truth Cast to the Ground

- Daniel 8:12 — "It cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered"
  - Sanctuary truth displaced by counterfeits
  - System prospered despite opposing God
  - But prophecy promised restoration

### The 2300 Days: Longest Time Prophecy

- Daniel 8:14 — "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed"
  - Longest time prophecy in Scripture
  - 2300 prophetic days = 2300 literal years
  - [WB]: Draw long line labeled "2300 DAYS (YEARS)" (Dan 8:14)
- "Sanctuary cleansed" — truth restored, judgment begins
- Daniel didn't understand; fainted at the vision (Dan 8:27)
- Gabriel sent to explain: "Understand, O son of man" (Dan 8:17)
- [RQ]: What event 2300 years from the starting point would "cleanse the sanctuary" and restore truth? (Dan 8:14)

## Section 3 — Daniel 9: The 70 Weeks Unlock the Timeline (10 min)

### Daniel's Prayer and Gabriel's Answer

- Daniel 9:2–3 — Daniel understood from Jeremiah: 70 years captivity ending
  - Prays for his people and Jerusalem
- Daniel 9:21–23 — Gabriel returns to give understanding
  - "I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding"
  - "Understand the matter, and consider the vision"
  - What vision? The 2300-day vision from chapter 8
  - [WB]: Connect Dan 8:14 to Dan 9 with arrow — "GABRIEL EXPLAINS" (Dan 9:23)

### The 70 Weeks "Cut Off"

- Daniel 9:24 — "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people"
  - "Determined" = Hebrew *chathak* = cut off, decreed
  - 70 weeks *cut off from* the larger 2300-day prophecy
  - [WB]: On 2300-day line, mark first portion: "70 WEEKS cut off" (Dan 9:24)
- 70 weeks = 70 × 7 = 490 prophetic days = 490 literal years
  - Special probationary time for Jewish nation
  - To "finish the transgression... make reconciliation for iniquity... bring in everlasting righteousness... seal up the vision and prophecy... anoint the most Holy"
  - Points to Messiah's work

### The Starting Point: 457 BC

- Daniel 9:25 — "From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem"
  - Three decrees to restore Jerusalem:
    1. Cyrus (536 BC) — rebuild temple
    2. Darius (519 BC) — continue temple work
    3. **Artaxerxes (457 BC)** — full civil authority restored
  - Only Artaxerxes' decree restored complete governmental authority
  - [EB]: Ezra 7:12–26 — Artaxerxes' decree with full powers
  - [WB]: Write "STARTING POINT: 457 BC (Ezra 7)" (Dan 9:25)

### The 70 Weeks Subdivided

- Daniel 9:25 — "Seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks"
  - 7 weeks (49 years): Jerusalem rebuilt in troublous times
    - 457 BC – 408 BC: walls, streets, city restored
  - 62 weeks (434 years): To Messiah the Prince
    - 408 BC – 27 AD
  - [WB]: Draw timeline: 457 BC → 49 yrs → 408 BC → 434 yrs → 27 AD (Dan 9:25)

### Messiah Arrives on Time

- **27 AD: Jesus baptized**
  - "Messiah" = "Anointed One"
  - Jesus anointed with Holy Spirit at baptism
  - [EB]: Luke 3:21–22 — Spirit descends; "Thou art my beloved Son"
  - [EB]: Acts 10:38 — "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost"
- Jesus began ministry declaring: "The time is fulfilled" (Mark 1:15)
  - What time? Daniel's prophetic time!
  - [WB]: Circle "27 AD" — write "MESSIAH ANOINTED" (Dan 9:25; Mark 1:15)
- [RQ]: If Jesus arrived exactly when Daniel predicted, what does this prove about the prophecy? (Dan 9:25)

### The Final Week: Messiah Cut Off

- Daniel 9:26 — "After threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself"
  - One week (7 years) remains: 27–34 AD
  - "Cut off" = crucified
  - "Not for himself" = for us

- Daniel 9:27 — "In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease"
  - Midst of 7 years = 3½ years after 27 AD
  - 27 AD + 3½ years = **31 AD (Spring)**
  - Christ's death ended the sacrificial system
  - [WB]: 27 AD → 3½ yrs → 31 AD (Crucifixion) → 3½ yrs → 34 AD (Dan 9:27)

- [EB]: Matthew 27:51 — "The veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom"
  - God Himself declared the earthly sacrifices ended
  - Type met antitype

- **34 AD: Gospel to Gentiles**
  - Stephen stoned (Acts 7)
  - Persecution scatters church
  - Gospel goes to Gentiles (Acts 8–10)
  - 70 weeks (490 years) concluded
  - [WB]: Circle "34 AD" — "70 WEEKS END; Gospel to Gentiles"

### Calculating to 1844

- We now have everything needed:
  - Total prophecy: 2300 years
  - First portion (70 weeks): 490 years, ending 34 AD
  - Remaining: 2300 – 490 = 1810 years after 34 AD
  - 34 AD + 1810 = **1844 AD**
  - [WB]: Calculate: 2300 – 490 = 1810; 34 AD + 1810 = 1844 AD (Dan 8:14)

- [WB]: Complete timeline — 457 BC → 27 AD → 31 AD → 34 AD → 1844 AD

- Daniel 8:14 — "Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed"
  - 1844: Heavenly sanctuary cleansing begins
  - Investigative judgment commences
  - Sanctuary truth restored on earth
  - [WB]: Circle "1844" — "SANCTUARY CLEANSED = JUDGMENT + TRUTH RESTORED"

- [EGW]: "The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disappointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete system of truth, connected and harmonious." (GC 423.1)

- [RQ]: Every date in this prophecy — 27 AD, 31 AD, 34 AD — was precisely fulfilled. Can we doubt that 1844 is also accurate? (Dan 8:14)
