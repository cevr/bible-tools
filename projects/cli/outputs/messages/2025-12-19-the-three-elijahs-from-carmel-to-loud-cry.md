## Introduction — Why “Elijah” Is a Pattern, Not a Mere Person (5 min)
- Malachi 4:5–6 — Elijah promised **before** “the great and dreadful day”
  - [WB]: Write “ELIJAH = message + mission to prepare a people” (Mal 4:5–6)
- Matthew 17:11–12 — Jesus teaches **two fulfillments**: “Elijah truly shall first come” + “Elijah is come already”
  - [RQ]: If prophecy has a past fulfillment and a future “shall,” what does that demand for the last days? (Matt 17:11)
- Proverbs 4:18 — Light increases “unto the perfect day”
  - [WB]: Draw rising line: Dawn → Morning → Noonday (Prov 4:18)

---

## Section 1 — Elijah #1 (Tishbite): Restoring True Worship When Religion Is Corrupted (6 min) [*]
- 1 Kings 18:21 — “How long halt ye between two opinions?”
  - False neutrality exposed; decision demanded
  - [RQ]: What does God call “halting” today—where we try to blend truth and popular religion? (1 Kgs 18:21)
  - [WB]: Two columns: “LORD” / “Baal” = exclusive allegiance (1 Kgs 18:21)
- 1 Kings 18:36–39 — God answers by fire; people confess “The LORD, he is the God”
  - Objective evidence of the true God; public turning point
- 1 Kings 18:30 — “Repair the altar of the LORD that was broken down”
  - Restoration begins with worship, repentance, and obedience
- [EGW]: “The work of restoration and reform… is to be carried forward with zeal and earnestness.” (PK 140.2)
- [Aside]: Carmel wasn’t mainly about spectacle—it was about ending double-minded religion.

---

## Section 2 — Elijah #2 (John the Baptist): Preparing for the First Advent by Heart Reform (7 min)
- Luke 1:16–17 — “Spirit and power of Elias… make ready a people prepared for the Lord”
  - Expansion in clarity: from national apostasy confrontation → **personal repentance + preparation for Messiah**
  - [WB]: “Carmel: Who is God?” → “Jordan: Are YOU ready for Christ?” (Luke 1:17)
- Matthew 3:1–3 — “Prepare ye the way of the Lord”
  - Preparation = removing obstacles to Christ’s reign in the heart
- Matthew 3:8–10 — “Bring forth… fruits meet for repentance… every tree… not good… hewn down”
  - Fruit required, not claims
  - [RQ]: If repentance must bear fruit, what does that say about sin cherished and excused? (Matt 3:8)
- Mark 1:6 — John’s simple life (dress/food) as a witness against indulgence and compromise
  - Reform supports message credibility; not salvation by diet/dress, but a life that matches the call
- [EGW]: “John was a representative of those living in these last days… called upon to bear a special message of warning.” (DA 100.2)
- [EB]: Isaiah 40:3 — Highway preparation language = removing moral impediments (heart-level work)

---

## Section 3 — Elijah #3 (The Remnant): Loud Cry Light and the Everlasting Gospel in Its Fullness (7 min)
- Revelation 14:6–7 — Everlasting gospel + judgment hour + worship the Creator
  - Expansion in scope: from Israel → Judea → **every nation, kindred, tongue, people**
  - [WB]: “Local → National → Global” arc (Rev 14:6)
- Revelation 18:1 — “Earth was lightened with his glory”
  - Noonday brightness (Prov 4:18) reaches its climax
  - [RQ]: What is the “glory” that can lighten the whole earth—mere information, or God’s character reproduced in His people? (Rev 18:1)
- Revelation 14:12 — “Keep the commandments… faith of Jesus”
  - Elijah message reaches its sharpest point: end-time loyalty proven by obedience through living faith
- 1 John 3:2–3 — Hope in Christ produces cleansing “even as he is pure”
  - Everlasting gospel includes more than pardon: it includes purification
- [EGW]: “Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in His church.” (COL 69.1)
- [EB]: Ephesians 5:25–27 — Goal: church “without spot” (not in our strength, but through Christ’s cleansing)

---

## FINAL PEAK SECTION + CTA — The Elijah Decision: Will You Receive the Gospel That Eradicates Sin? (7 min)
- Matthew 17:11 — “Elijah truly shall first come, and restore all things”
  - Restoration reaches its final depth: not only altar repaired, not only people stirred—**character restored**
  - [WB]: “Restore ALL THINGS = worship + doctrine + life + character” (Matt 17:11)
- Titus 2:11–14 — Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness; Christ purifies a “peculiar people… zealous of good works”
  - [RQ]: If grace teaches denial of ungodliness, what gospel are we believing when sin remains our accepted norm? (Titus 2:12)
- 2 Peter 3:11–14 — In view of the end, be “in all holy conversation… without spot”
  - End-time readiness is moral, not merely informational
- Revelation 18:1 + Revelation 14:12 — The world is lightened when God’s glory (His character) is revealed in commandment-keeping faith
  - [Aside]: A lighthouse doesn’t argue the darkness away; it shines because it has power from another source.
- [EGW]: “The final movements will be rapid ones.” (9T 11.2)

### Call to Action — Covenant-Level Response (No Neutral Ground)
- Choose now to stand in the **third Elijah** work—full loyalty to Christ (Matt 17:11; Rev 14:12)
- Surrender every known sin to be **cleansed, not covered only** (1 John 3:3; Titus 2:12–14)
- Commit to practical reform that removes stumbling blocks to holiness and witness—habits under Christ’s lordship (Mark 1:6; 2 Pet 3:11)
- Accept the everlasting gospel as God’s promise to **eradicate sin in the heart** and reproduce His glory in you—so the earth can be lightened before probation closes (Rev 18:1; Rev 14:6–7)
