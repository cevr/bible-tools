## Introduction — Creation Was Purposeful, Not Accidental (5 min)

- Genesis 1:26–27 — “Image/likeness” = moral representation, not mere
  intelligence
- [WB]: Write — **IMAGE → CHOICE → WITNESS** (Gen 1:26–27)
- [RQ]: If God already knows all, why design a world where created beings must
  _see_ and _decide_? (Gen 1:26–27)
- [EGW]: “God created man in His own image… It was His purpose that the longer
  man lived the more fully he should reveal this image.” (Ed 15.2)

## Section 1 — God’s Government Requires Transparent Evidence (7 min) [*]

- Deuteronomy 19:15 — A matter is “established” by witnesses
  - God’s rule is not arbitrary; it is **publicly righteous**
  - [WB]: Draw flow — **CLAIM → WITNESSES → ESTABLISHED** (Deut 19:15)
  - [RQ]: If God ends rebellion by sheer power, what question would remain in
    every mind forever? (Deut 19:15)
- Isaiah 43:7 — Created “for my glory” (glory = character made visible)
  - [WB]: “GLORY = CHARACTER SEEN” (Isa 43:7)
- 1 Peter 2:12 — God is “glorified” when observers see a transformed life
  - Human life functions as **exhibit evidence** of what God’s ways produce
- [EGW]: “The law of love being the foundation of the government of God, the
  happiness of all intelligent beings depends upon their perfect accord with its
  great principles of righteousness.” (PP 34.3)

## Section 2 — The Charges That Made Witness Necessary (8 min)

- Revelation 12:9–10 — Satan = “accuser”; the conflict is over God’s character
  - [WB]: “ACCUSATION → NEED FOR VERDICT” (Rev 12:10)
- Genesis 3:1–5 — Accusations aimed at the foundations of trust
  - Word attacked: “Hath God said?” (Gen 3:1)
  - Justice denied: “Ye shall not surely die” (Gen 3:4)
  - Goodness slandered: “God doth know…” (Gen 3:5)
  - [RQ]: If God is framed as withholding, can love exist—only fear and
    bargaining? (Gen 3:5)
- Job 1:9–11 — Charge: God purchases obedience (“for nought?”)
  - [WB]: “CHARGE: LOYALTY = SELF-INTEREST” (Job 1:9–11)
- Job 2:4–5 — Charge intensifies: under pain, humans will curse God
  - The controversy demands a **real-life answer**, not a claim
- John 8:44 — Satan’s method: lie + murder (character of the accuser revealed)
- [EB]: Romans 3:26 — God shown “just, and the justifier” (God’s mercy is not
  injustice)

---

## Section 3 — Why Humans Were “Needed”: Image-Bearers Under Choice (6 min) [*]

- Ecclesiastes 7:29 — “God hath made man upright” (not a machine)
  - Uprightness must be **chosen and maintained**, not programmed
- Deuteronomy 30:19 — “Choose life” proves moral freedom is essential
  - [RQ]: Why would God command choice unless genuine alternatives exist? (Deut
    30:19)
- John 9:1–3 — Suffering is misused as propaganda against God
  - Christ redirects: God’s works can be “made manifest”
  - [WB]: “TRIAL → REVEALS WHO GOD IS (IN ME)” (John 9:3)
  - [RQ]: When I interpret every hardship as God’s cruelty, whose argument am I
    repeating? (John 9:1–3)
- Romans 12:2 — Restoration happens by renewed mind (unlearning Satan’s picture
  of God)
  - [EB]: 2 Corinthians 3:18 — Restored “into the same image” (creation intent
    recovered)
- [Aside]: A product is “proven” when it holds under pressure; God’s character
  is “proven” when His people trust and obey under pressure.

## FINAL PEAK SECTION — The Public Verdict: Blood + Testimony, and Your Covenant Choice (4 min)

- Revelation 12:11 — “They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
  word of their testimony”
  - Blood answers guilt; testimony answers the accusation that God cannot
    produce loyal love
  - [WB]: Under “OVERCOME” write — **BLOOD (for me)** / **TESTIMONY (through
    me)** (Rev 12:11)
- Revelation 14:12 — Final evidence: “commandments of God, and the faith of
  Jesus”
  - The last conflict exposes whether God’s law is love—or a burden
  - [RQ]: If the universe is watching for a verdict, what does delayed surrender
    communicate? (Rev 14:12)
- [EGW]: “Satan had accused God of seeking merely the exaltation of Himself… But
  the gift of Christ… testified that God is love.” (DA 57.3)

### Call to Action — Covenant-Level Decision (No Neutral Ground)

- Choose Christ wholly **now**—yield the will without reserve (Deut 30:19; Luke
  9:23)
- Reject Satan’s picture of God; trust God’s character in trial and obey from
  faith (John 9:3; Rev 14:12)
- Take your place as God’s needed witness in the controversy—so your life,
  washed in the Lamb’s blood, gives heaven’s public answer that God is true (Rev
  12:11)
