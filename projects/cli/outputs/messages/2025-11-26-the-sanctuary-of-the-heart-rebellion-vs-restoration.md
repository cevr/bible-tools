### Introduction: The Purpose of the Shadows (5 min)
- Sanctuary = God’s visual aid, a system of **True Education** about:
  - Awfulness of sin.
  - Cost of forgiveness.
  - Necessity of heart transformation (Hebrews 8:5; 10:1).
- Misconception: Old Testament as mechanical transaction – "I sin, I pay a goat, I’m good."
- Reality: God uses the sanctuary to teach that restoration of His image is about the heart, not mere ritual (Deuteronomy 10:12-16).
- [RQ]: If the blood of bulls couldn't actually take away sin (Hebrews 10:4), what was God *educating* Israel to see about the condition of their own hearts?
- Transition: Key distinction in the sanctuary system – **weakness vs. rebellion**.

### I. The Provision for Weakness (Leviticus 1–5) (6 min)
- Brief overview of main offerings (Leviticus 1–5):
  - Burnt, Grain, Peace, Sin, Trespass.
- Focus text: Leviticus 4:2, 27 – "If a soul shall sin **through ignorance**..."
  - Category: Unintentional, weakness, blindness, lack of understanding.
  - [WB]: Write: **SINS OF IGNORANCE / WEAKNESS** (Leviticus 4:2, 27)
  - [WB]: Underline: "through ignorance" → "learning stage" in God’s school.
- Educational point:
  - God accounts for our fallen nature and limited light (Acts 17:30).
  - In the school of sanctification, there is a learning curve (2 Peter 3:18).
  - [Aside]: Think of a child learning to walk. Falls are expected as long as the child keeps moving toward the parent; different from turning and running away.
- Restoration emphasis:
  - These sacrifices cover sins where the will is not in open defiance.
  - Grace covers those who are *unlearning* error and *learning* righteousness (Ephesians 4:22-24).
- Confession still central:
  - Leviticus 5:5 – "He shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing."
  - [EB]: Proverbs 28:13 – "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy." (Same pattern: confession + forsaking)

### II. The Danger of the "High Hand" (Numbers 15) [*] (5 min)
- Contrast within same chapter:
  - Numbers 15:27-29 – Provision for sins of ignorance.
  - Numbers 15:30-31 – "But the soul that doeth ought **presumptuously**..."
- Meaning of "presumptuously":
  - Hebrew idiom: "With a high hand."
  - [WB]: Draw/Write: **HIGH HAND = FIST RAISED AGAINST GOD** (Numbers 15:30)
  - Attitude: "I know, I don’t care, I will do it anyway."
- Consequence:
  - "That soul shall be cut off... his iniquity shall be upon him." (Numbers 15:31)
  - Notice: No sacrifice prescribed – no ritual covers deliberate, cherished rebellion.
  - Key idea: Sacrifice assumes a **penitent** heart that wants sin transferred to the sanctuary; a rebel insists on keeping it.
- [RQ]: Why didn’t God provide a ritual for high-handed rebellion? What does this reveal about the limits of **ritual** and the necessity of a surrendered **relationship**? (Numbers 15:31)
- [EB]: Hebrews 10:28-29 – "He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy..." (Same principle carried into New Testament warning.)

### III. David: From High-Handed Sin to Broken Heart (Psalm 51) (6 min)
- Historical context:
  - 2 Samuel 11 – David’s adultery with Bathsheba and murder of Uriah.
  - Not ignorance; it was informed, deliberate sin from a man who knew God’s law.
  - By Numbers 15 standards, David deserves to be "cut off."
- Confrontation and conviction:
  - 2 Samuel 12:7, 13 – Nathan: "Thou art the man." David: "I have sinned against the Lord."
- Heart response in Psalm 51:
  - Psalm 51:16-17 – No confidence in offerings alone; pleads for a "broken and a contrite heart."
  - [WB]: Diagram: **REBELLION (High Hand) → BROKENNESS (Repentance) → RESTORATION (Forgiveness)** (Psalm 51:17)
- Restoration of God’s image:
  - Psalm 51:10 – "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me."
  - Focus is not merely escape from penalty, but inner re-creation.
  - [EGW]: "Genuine repentance is more than sorrow for sin. It is a resolute turning away from evil." (SC 23.2)
- Category shift:
  - Through genuine repentance, David moves from **rebel** to **penitent learner** again.
  - His "high hand" is lowered; he re-enters the school of Christ.
- [RQ]: Seeing David’s case, what does God value most in the judgment – external perfection of performance, or a heart that stays penitent, teachable, and surrendered to His will? (Psalm 51:17; 1 Samuel 16:7)

### IV. Saul: An Example of the High Hand (1 Samuel 15) [*] (5 min)
- Command and disobedience:
  - 1 Samuel 15:3 – Clear command to utterly destroy Amalek.
  - 1 Samuel 15:9 – Saul and the people spare Agag and the best of the sheep and oxen.
- Saul’s attitude vs. David’s:
  - 1 Samuel 15:13 – Saul claims, "I have performed the commandment of the Lord."
  - Exposure: 1 Samuel 15:14 – "What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep...?"
  - Rationalizing rebellion as worship:
    - 1 Samuel 15:15 – "To sacrifice unto the Lord thy God."
- God’s verdict:
  - 1 Samuel 15:22-23 – "To obey is better than sacrifice... rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft."
  - [WB]: Two Columns – **DAVID: Confession & Brokenness** vs. **SAUL: Excuse & Self-Justification** (Psalm 51:3-4; 1 Samuel 15:20-21)
- High-handedness illustrated:
  - Saul knows God’s command yet chooses his own way and then covers it with pious language → classic "high hand."
  - [EGW]: "It is not the greatness of the act of disobedience that constitutes sin, but the fact of variance from God's expressed will." (ST, April 21, 1890)
- Final outcome:
  - 1 Samuel 15:26 – "Thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king."
  - Unlike David, there is no deep, Psalm-51-type repentance recorded.
- [RQ]: What made David restorable and Saul rejected, when both sinned grievously? How does this show that our *response* to reproof is the turning point? (1 Samuel 15:22-26; Psalm 51:4)
- [EB]: Hebrews 3:7-8 – "Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts." (Saul as a sober example of hardening.)

---

### V. The Antitype: Christ & Character (Hebrews 10 & 1 John) (5 min)
- New Testament echo of Numbers 15:
  - Hebrews 10:26-27 – "If we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins."
  - Not about a single slip, but a settled, willful resistance to the Spirit (like Saul).
- Sanctuary and judgment context:
  - Hebrews 8:1-2; 9:24 – Christ ministering as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement (Daniel 8:14).
  - [EB]: Leviticus 16:30 – "On that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you… that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord." (Purpose of present cleansing work)
- Hope and assurance:
  - 1 John 1:9 – "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us..."
  - 1 John 2:1 – "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."
  - [Aside]: If you reject the only Surgeon (Christ) and His only remedy (His blood), there is no "second opinion." But if you submit to His treatment, no wound is beyond His healing.
- Educational action steps (True Education for restoration):
  - [WB]: Action Steps (Education for Restoration – 1 John 1:9; Hebrews 10:22)
    1. **Unlearn:** Excusing "small" sins, treating grace as permission, rationalizing like Saul.
    2. **Learn:** Immediate, specific confession; David-like openness; daily surrender of the will.
- [EB]: Revelation 14:12 – "Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." (End-time people = obedient, trusting, teachable – the opposite of the high hand.)

### Conclusion and Appeal (3 min)
- Summary:
  - Leviticus & Numbers: God distinguishes between weakness and high-handed rebellion.
  - David: Shows that even gross sin can be forgiven when the heart breaks and yields.
  - Saul: Warns that justified, cherished rebellion leads to being "cut off."
  - Hebrews & 1 John: In our Day of Atonement, Christ offers full cleansing to the penitent.
- Great Controversy lens:
  - Satan’s two lies:
    1. Your sin is too great to be forgiven (Despair – "You are like Saul, with no hope").
    2. Your sin is not that serious (Presumption – "You can be Saul and still be saved").
  - Truth: Sin is lethal, but Christ’s blood is sufficient. The only hopelessness is to cling to the high hand.
- Appeal:
  - Today, let every "high hand" be lowered.
  - Invite: Choose David’s path, not Saul’s – bring a broken, contrite heart to Christ.
  - Psalm 51:17 – Let this be our prayer: that God would restore His image in us by keeping us in the school of Christ with a soft, obedient, teachable heart.
