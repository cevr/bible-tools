### Introduction: The Purpose of the Shadows
- **Concept:** The Sanctuary service was God's visual aid—a system of **True Education** designed to teach the awfulness of sin and the cost of restoration.
- **Misconception:** Many view the Old Testament system as a mechanical transaction: "I sin, I pay a goat, I'm good."
- **The Reality:** God never intended the sanctuary to be a "sin-subscription service." He was teaching that the restoration of His image requires a transformation of the heart, not just a ritual payment.
- **[RQ]:** If the blood of bulls couldn't actually take away sin (Heb 10:4), what was God *educating* Israel to see about the condition of their own hearts?
- **Transition:** To understand this, we must look at the specific distinction God made between "weakness" and "rebellion."

### I. The Provision for Weakness (Leviticus 1-5)
- **Review of Offerings:** Briefly identify the five main offerings (Burnt, Grain, Peace, Sin, Trespass) found in Leviticus 1-5.
- **The Key Phrase:** Focus on Leviticus 4:2 and 4:27 – "If a soul shall sin **through ignorance**..."
    - **[WB]:** Write: **Sins of Ignorance / Weakness**.
    - **[WB]:** List: Unintentional, Carelessness, Unaware -> Later Aware.
- **The Educational Process:** God acknowledges our fallen nature. In the school of sanctification, there is a learning curve.
    - **[Aside]:** Think of a child learning to walk. Stumbling is expected and covered by the parent’s care. There is a difference between stumbling while trying to walk to the parent, and running away.
- **Restoration Context:** These sacrifices covered sins where the will was not set in defiant opposition to God. It shows God's grace covers us while we are *unlearning* error and *learning* righteousness.
- **[EB]:** Leviticus 5:5 – Note that even for these sins, "confession" was required before the sacrifice. The animal alone was never enough.

### II. The Danger of the "High Hand" (Numbers 15) [*]
- **The Contrast:** Read Numbers 15:27-29 (Provision for ignorance) vs. Numbers 15:30-31 (Presumptuous sin).
- **The "Presumptuous" Sin:**
    - Hebrew idiom: "With a high hand."
    - **[WB]:** Draw/Write: **High Hand = Fist raised against God.**
    - This is the attitude of: "I know what God says, I don't care, I will do it anyway."
- **The Consequence:** No sacrifice is listed. The penalty is to be "cut off."
    - Why? Because the sacrifice represents a transfer of sin from a penitent heart to the Sanctuary. A rebel refuses to transfer the sin; they hold onto it.
- **[RQ]:** Why didn't God provide a ritual for high-handed rebellion? What does this tell us about the limitations of *ritual* vs. the necessity of *relationship*? (Num 15:31 - "Despised the word of the Lord").
- **[EGW]:** "God does not regard all sins as of equal magnitude; there are degrees of guilt in His estimation, as well as in that of man; but however trifling this or that wrong act may seem in the eyes of men, no sin is small in the sight of God." (SC 30.1)
- **[EB]:** 1 Samuel 15:22 – Samuel to Saul (who sinned presumptuously): "To obey is better than sacrifice." God wants the heart, not the fat of rams.

### III. The Path Back: David’s Restoration (Psalm 51)
- **The Dilemma:** David committed adultery and murder (2 Sam 11). This was not "ignorance." It was willful, high-handed sin.
    - According to Numbers 15, David should have been cut off. There was no specific sacrifice in the Torah for this combination of sins.
- **The Revelation:** Read Psalm 51:16-17.
    - David realized that God wasn't looking for a bull *first*. He was looking for a "broken and contrite heart."
- **The Shift in Status:**
    - **[WB]:** Diagram Flow: **Rebellion (High Hand)** --> **Brokenness (Repentance)** --> **Restoration (Forgiveness).**
    - Genuine repentance moves the sinner from the category of "High-Handed Rebel" back to "Penitent Learner."
    - Once the heart is broken, the "High Hand" is lowered. The rebellion ceases. Now, the Atonement can be applied.
- **Restoration of Image:** David asks for a "clean heart" and "right spirit" (Ps 51:10). He seeks the restoration of God's image, not just the avoidance of the penalty.
- **[RQ]:** How does understanding this change our view of the Investigative Judgment? Is God looking for perfection of performance, or a character that maintains a penitent, teachable connection to Christ?

### IV. The Antitype: Christ & Character (Hebrews 10 & 1 John)
- **The Warning:** Read Hebrews 10:26-27. "If we sin willfully... there remaineth no more sacrifice."
    - This is the NT echo of Numbers 15.
    - It does not mean one mistake damns you. It refers to a *state* of rejecting the Holy Spirit's educational work in your heart.
    - **[Aside]:** If you reject the Surgeon (Christ) and His only instrument (the Cross), there is no second opinion or alternative cure available. You are "cut off" by your own choice.
- **The Assurance:** Read 1 John 1:9 and 1 John 2:1.
    - "If we confess..." — The antidote to the "High Hand."
    - Christ is our Advocate. In the heavenly Sanctuary *right now*, He pleads His blood for every sin that is confessed and forsaken.
- **Urgency of the Hour:** We are living in the great Day of Atonement. The work of the High Priest is to cleanse the Sanctuary *and* the people.
    - **[EB]:** Daniel 8:14 / Lev 16:30 – The goal is to be "clean from all your sins before the Lord."
- **[WB]:** Action Steps (Education for Restoration):
    1. **Unlearn:** The habit of excusing "small" sins or treating grace as a license (Presumption).
    2. **Learn:** The habit of immediate, specific confession and yielding the will (Contrition).

### Conclusion and Appeal
- **Summary:** The Levitical law teaches us that God cannot save a rebel who clings to rebellion. But David’s life teaches us that the deepest stain can be washed away when the heart is broken before God.
- **The Great Controversy:** The enemy wants you to believe either:
    1. Your sin is too big (Despair).
    2. Your sin doesn't matter (Presumption).
    - The Truth: Your sin is lethal (needs a Savior), but Christ's blood is sufficient (Restoration).
- **Application:** Salvation is the restoration of God’s image in you. This is an educational process. Don't drop out of the school of Christ by hardening your heart.
- **Final Appeal:** "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit." Today, if you hear His voice, harden not your hearts. Let us bring our willful, wandering hearts to the only One who can create them anew.
