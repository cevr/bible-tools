Introduction (5 min)
- Progressive disclosure: Scripture reveals “Elijah” as more than one man—an end-time pattern
- Anchor the promise: Mal 4:5–6
  - [WB]: Timeline: (Ahab/Israel) → (Herod/Judah) → (Beast/Babylon/world) (Mal 4:5–6)
  - [RQ]: If God repeats a pattern 3 times, what does He want perfected by the third? (Mal 4:5–6)
- Define “Elijah work” (Bible terms)
  - Turning hearts (Mal 4:6)
  - Calling to decision (1 Kgs 18:21)
  - Preparing a people (Lk 1:17)

Main Study Section 1 (7 min) — Elijah #1: The Tishbite (Personal/National Reform Under Apostasy)
- Setting: God’s people in covenant name, living in Baal practice
  - 1 Kings 16:30–33 (Ahab institutionalizes idolatry)
  - 1 Kings 17:1 (Elijah appears with a word of judgment)
  - [WB]: Two columns: “Covenant Name” vs “Covenant Life” (1 Kgs 16:33; 17:1)
- Qualities & habits: hidden life → bold public testimony
  - 1 Kings 17:2–6 (separation, dependence, training)
  - James 5:17–18 (prayer life is the engine of Elijah power)
  - [RQ]: Do we want Carmel results without Cherith discipline? (Jas 5:17–18; 1 Kgs 17:3–6)
  - [EGW]: 'It was as a refuge from the tumult and strife of the court, and from the contagion of prevailing iniquity, that Elijah was directed to dwell for a time by the brook Cherith.' (Prophets and Kings, p. 120)
- Dress: rough simplicity as rebuke to luxury/idolatry (reform principle)
  - 2 Kings 1:8 (“an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather”)
  - Link: outward simplicity supports inward separateness (cf. 1 Pet 3:3–4)
  - [WB]: “Simplicity ≠ salvation; simplicity = freedom for mission” (2 Kgs 1:8; 1 Pet 3:3–4)
- Food: providence + temperance in training for crisis
  - 1 Kings 17:4–6 (bread/flesh + water; God provides)
  - 1 Kings 19:5–8 (simple food for long endurance)
  - Principle: appetite must not rule the messenger (cf. Prov 23:1–3)
  - [Aside]: An athlete doesn’t “feel” their way into endurance; they eat/train for the event. Elijah’s simple diet wasn’t a badge—it was mission logistics.
- Message: decision and true worship; exposes counterfeits
  - 1 Kings 18:21 (no neutrality)
  - 1 Kings 18:36–39 (God answers by fire—He alone is God)
  - [RQ]: When worship is confused, does God ask for “balance” or for decision? (1 Kgs 18:21)
  - [EGW]: 'The appeal, “Choose you this day whom ye will serve,” is addressed to every soul.' (Prophets and Kings, p. 148)

Main Study Section 2 (7 min) — Elijah #2: John the Baptist (Deeper Heart Work; Preparing for Messiah)
- Identification: same “spirit and power,” greater clarity of mission
  - Luke 1:16–17 (turn hearts; “make ready a people”)
  - Matthew 17:11–13 (John fulfills Elijah-type)
  - [WB]: Compare goals: Elijah #1 = covenant loyalty; John = readiness to receive Christ (Lk 1:17)
- Qualities & habits: wilderness formation; truth without favoritism
  - Luke 3:2–3 (word of God comes in wilderness → public call)
  - Luke 3:18–20 (rebukes Herod; righteousness confronts power)
  - [RQ]: If truth threatens my safety, do I adjust the message or accept the cost? (Lk 3:19–20)
- Dress: explicit reform witness against sensuality and priestcraft
  - Matthew 3:4 (camel’s hair; leather girdle)
  - Function: separation from fashion-driven identity; points away from self
  - [EGW]: 'John the Baptist went forth in the spirit and power of Elijah to call the attention of the people to the coming of the Messiah, and to call them to repentance.' (The Desire of Ages, p. 101)
- Food: health/temperance for mental-spiritual clarity
  - Matthew 3:4 (locusts and wild honey—simple, local, non-luxury)
  - Luke 3:10–14 (practical fruit of repentance—ethics, temperance, justice)
  - [WB]: “Repentance = new appetite + new ethics” (Matt 3:4; Luke 3:10–14)
- Message: repentance + preparation for Christ; exposing religious pride
  - Matthew 3:7–10 (Pharisees/Sadducees; “generation of vipers”; fruit demanded)
  - John 1:29 (points to “Lamb of God”—Christ-centered Elijah work)
  - [RQ]: Do I rely on heritage (“we have Abraham”) or on heart-change fruit? (Matt 3:9–10)
  - [Aside]: A resume can’t substitute for a pulse. John’s test was not “Are you in the right lineage?” but “Is there living fruit right now?”

Final Section (Peak + CTA) (8 min) — Elijah #3: The Remnant (3AM + Loud Cry; Worldwide Scope; Final Character Test)
- The scope expands to the world + final judgment hour
  - Revelation 14:6–7 (everlasting gospel + judgment hour + worship Creator)
  - Revelation 18:1–4 (earth lightened; “Come out of her, my people”)
  - [WB]: Expanding circles diagram:
    - Elijah #1: Israel (worship test at Carmel)
    - Elijah #2: Judah (Messiah reception)
    - Elijah #3: World (Creator worship vs beast worship) (Rev 14:7–9)
- The message intensifies into the 3 Angels’ Messages (worship + judgment + separation)
  - Rev 14:7 (Creator worship = Sabbath/creation loyalty; Ex 20:8–11 implied)
  - Rev 14:8 (Babylon = confused worship/system)
  - Rev 14:9–11 (mark of the beast crisis—no neutrality like 1 Kgs 18:21)
  - [RQ]: If the final issue is worship, what in my week proves whom I worship? (Rev 14:7; Ex 20:8–11)
- The final “Elijah people” description: character maturity under pressure
  - Revelation 14:12 (“keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus”)
  - Revelation 12:17 (commandments + testimony of Jesus)
  - [EGW]: 'In the time of the end every divine institution is to be restored.' (Prophets and Kings, p. 678)
  - [WB]: Two-part identity: “Commandments of God” + “Faith of Jesus” (Rev 14:12)
- Dress/food as reform tools (not merit badges): preparing mind/body for final discernment
  - Romans 12:1–2 (body presented; mind transformed—proof of God’s will)
  - 1 Corinthians 10:31 (eat/drink to God’s glory)
  - 1 Timothy 2:9–10 (modesty as mission-minded identity)
  - [RQ]: If I will not govern appetite and appearance now, how will I stand when buying/selling pressure comes? (Rom 12:1–2; Rev 13:16–17)
- The confrontation: If we are not doing Elijah’s work, what are we?
  - Matthew 23:23–28 (scribes/Pharisees: precise forms, neglected weightier matters; outward/inside mismatch)
  - Luke 11:42 (tithe mint; pass over judgment and love of God)
  - John 5:39–40 (Scripture study without coming to Christ)
  - Tension: “Elijah” restores worship and hearts; Pharisee/scribe can defend truth while resisting its transforming claim
  - [WB]: Diagnostic questions list (Matt 23:25–26)
    - “Am I more concerned with being right than being clean within?”
    - “Do I correct others more than I crucify self?”
  - [RQ]: Is my religion producing repentance fruit (Matt 3:8) or producing arguments (John 5:39–40)?
- Immediate CTA at peak (decision under the “Elijah test”)
  - 1 Kings 18:21 (choose)
  - Revelation 14:12 (be among “they”)
  - Romans 12:2 (refuse conformity; be transformed)
  - Call to action (specific, Scripture-anchored):
    - Choose one “Baal linkage” to unlearn this week (Rom 12:2): appetite, media, fashion-pride, Sabbath neglect, secret sin
    - Adopt one “Cherith practice” starting tonight (Jas 5:17–18; 1 Kgs 17:3–4): fixed prayer time + Scripture memory of Rev 14:6–12
    - Make one “John step” within 48 hours (Matt 3:8; Luke 3:10–14): restitution/apology, break an unethical habit, concrete mercy
    - Publicly align with Creator worship in practice (Rev 14:7): plan Sabbath boundaries and witness
  - End on the decision: Will you answer the Elijah call—now—so you are not found a scribe of forms, but a messenger of reform? (1 Kgs 18:21; Rev 14:12)
