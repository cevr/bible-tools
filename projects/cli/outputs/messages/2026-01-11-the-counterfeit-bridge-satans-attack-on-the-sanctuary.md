- Immortal soul doctrine fully developed in Egypt
  - Soul continues conscious existence after death
  - Prayers and offerings for the dead
- Isis and Horus: Mother-child worship
  - "Queen of heaven" devotion established
  - [WB]: "EGYPT: Immortal soul, prayers for dead, mother worship" (Gen 3:4; Jer 44:17)
- [EB]: Jeremiah 44:17–19 — Israel condemned for worshiping queen of heaven

### Babylonian Mysteries: Counterfeiting Priesthood and Mediation

- Babylonian priesthood: Human mediators replacing divine access
  - Confessional system: Priests hold secrets, control absolution
  - [WB]: "BABYLON: Priesthood mediators, confessional, queen of heaven" (Rev 17:5)
- [RQ]: Why does prophecy trace false religion to *one* ancient source? (Rev 17:5)

### Mithraism: Counterfeiting the Creator's Memorials

- Roman Mithraism: Persian sun worship adapted
  - Dies Solis (Sunday) as sacred day
  - December 25: Birth of the sun god
  - [WB]: "MITHRAS: Sunday sacred, Dec. 25 birth, sun worship" (Ezek 8:16)
- [EB]: Ezekiel 8:16 — Men with backs toward temple, worshiping sun toward the east
- [Aside]: Every pagan system offered what the sanctuary offered—priesthood, mediation, holy days—but through human invention rather than divine revelation.

### Satan's Masterwork: Merge Paganism with Christianity

- [EB]: Jeremiah 10:2–3 — Learn not the way of the heathen; customs are vain
- Counterfeit elements already fully formed *before* merging into the church
  - Corruption from within, not attack from without
  - [WB]: Draw arrow from "PAGANISM" merging into "APOSTATE CHRISTIANITY" (2 Thess 2:7)

  - Hebrew "determined" (*chathak*) = cut off, divided

### The Starting Point: 457 BC

- Daniel 9:25 — "From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem"
  - Three decrees: Cyrus (536 BC), Darius (519 BC), Artaxerxes (457 BC)

  - 62 weeks (434 years): To Messiah the Prince (408 BC–27 AD)
  - [WB]: 457 BC → 49 years → 408 BC → 434 years → 27 AD "Messiah" (Dan 9:25)

  - One week (7 years) remains: 27–34 AD
- Daniel 9:27 — "In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice to cease"
  - 27 AD + 3½ years = 31 AD (Spring)
  - Christ's death ended earthly sacrificial system
  - [WB]: 27 AD → 3½ years → 31 AD (Crucifixion) → 3½ years → 34 AD (Dan 9:26–27)
- [EB]: Matthew 27:51 — Veil of the temple rent from top to bottom at crucifixion
- 34 AD: Stephen stoned; gospel to Gentiles
  - 70 weeks (490 years) concluded

### Calculating to 1844

- 2300 years total; 490 years "cut off" for Israel

  - 34 AD + 1810 = **1844 AD**
