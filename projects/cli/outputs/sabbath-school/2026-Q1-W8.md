# 2026 Q1 W8 - February 14–20
## The Preeminence of Christ

**Overarching Theme:** Christ’s absolute preeminence as eternal Creator-Redeemer demands our total surrender for **restoration into His image** (end-time readiness through abiding union).  
**Central Focus:** Jesus is not merely “important”—He is **God manifested**, the Source, Sustainer, Head, and Reconciler; therefore He must have **first place** in doctrine, church life, and personal character.  
**Key Texts:** Colossians 1:15–20; John 1:1–3, 14; 2 Corinthians 3:18  

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: We all give something “first place” (family, work, phone, health). What happens to the soul when **Christ is not first**?
    -   [DQ]: *(Quick share):* “What tends to crowd out Christ most easily in your weekly routine?”
-   Theme Introduction: Paul’s hymn in Colossians 1:15–20 is not poetry for sentiment—it is a **claim of total lordship** grounded in Creation, Cross, Resurrection, and Church headship.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: `CHRIST FIRST IN EVERYTHING (Col 1:18)`
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: If Christ is Creator-Redeemer and Head, then sanctification is not self-improvement—it is **re-creation** for the final generation’s readiness (restored image, loyal obedience, settled trust).
-   Roadmap:
    -   Christ reveals God perfectly (Image)
    -   Christ owns Creation by right (Creator/Sustainer)
    -   Christ rules His church by love (Head)
    -   Christ initiates new creation (Resurrection/Baptism life)
    -   Christ reconciles all by the Cross (Cosmic peace)

### II. Christ the Visible Revelation of the Invisible God (Image) (15-16 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Our crisis is not lack of information, but a distorted view of God; Christ restores the **true picture**—and that picture changes us.

#### A. “Image” and the restoration of God’s likeness in us (7-8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 1:26, 27
    -   Reading/Context: Humanity originally created in God’s image—capacity for holiness, love, dominion under God.
    -   [WB]: `Gen 1:26-27 = CREATED in His image`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Image is more than appearance—**character/relational reflection**; sin damaged, not erased.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* “What parts of life (thinking, relating, choices) should ‘image’ include—beyond the physical?”
-   **Foundation Text 2:** 2 Corinthians 3:18
    -   Reading/Connection: Transformation occurs by beholding Christ—image restored “from glory to glory” by the Spirit.
    -   [WB]: Draw simple arrow: `BEHOLD → BECOME`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: We become like what we worship; end-time deception targets worship because it targets **character formation**.
    -   [EGW]: “God saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed to portray both His personality and His character. He sent His Son into the world to manifest… the nature and the attributes of the invisible God.” [EGW] (RC 39).
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “How does ‘beholding’ differ from merely ‘knowing facts’ about Jesus?”
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Like standing near a fire—if you stay close, you begin to warm; if you keep stepping back, you stay cold. Nearness changes you.
    -   Connecting to Life: The question is not “Do I believe correct doctrines?” but “Am I **near enough** daily for Christ’s Spirit to reshape my reactions?”
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What is one daily habit that helps you ‘stay near the Fire’ (Word, prayer, meditation), and what blocks it?”
-   **Foundation Text 3 (Christ as the perfect Image):** Hebrews 1:3
    -   Reading/Challenge: Christ is “the express image” and “brightness” of God’s glory—no distortion.
    -   [WB]: `Heb 1:3 = EXACT IMPRINT`
    -   Practical Step: When tempted to fear God, remember: the clearest statement of God’s character is **Jesus’ life**, climaxing at the Cross.
    -   [DQ]: *(Heart check):* “When you fail, do you run from God or to God—and what does that reveal about your picture of Him?”

#### B. Why Jesus alone reveals the Father (7-8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 4:** John 1:1–3
    -   Reading/Context: The Word is eternal, divine, Creator—no “created Christ” can reveal God fully.
    -   [WB]: `John 1:1-3 → Eternal + Creator`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: If Christ made “all things,” He cannot be part of “all things made.”
    -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* “What words in John 1:1–3 rule out the idea that Christ is a created being?”
-   **Foundation Text 5:** John 1:14, 18
    -   Reading/Connection: God becomes knowable: the Word “became flesh”; the Son “declares” the Father.
    -   [WB]: `INCARNATION = God made visible`
    -   [EGW]: “Christ, the Light of the world, veiled the dazzling splendor of His divinity and came to live as a man among men…” [EGW] (RC 39).
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “What does it do to your trust in God to realize He ‘veiled’ Himself to come near?”
-   [SN]: *Illustration:* A doctor doesn’t shout instructions from outside the quarantine; he enters, takes the risk, and treats from within. Christ entered our condition to heal it.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “Where are you tempted to keep Jesus ‘at a distance’—and what would it look like to let Him step into that exact area?”
-   **Application:** End-time holiness is not earned—it is **received** by union with the One who perfectly reveals the Father.
    -   [WB]: `UNION with Christ → TRANSFORMATION`

### III. Christ’s Preeminence by Right: Creator, Sustainer, and Lord (14-15 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Paul piles up absolutes: Christ is not one great being among many; He is the One through whom and for whom everything exists—therefore He owns our allegiance.

#### A. “Firstborn over all creation” = rank, rule, and eternal pre-existence (7-8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 1:15–17
    -   Reading/Context: “Firstborn” here means **preeminence**; reasons given: Creator of all, before all, sustains all.
    -   [WB]: `Col 1:15-17 → CREATED BY / THROUGH / FOR HIM`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Christ is the personal Agent of Creation; even thrones/powers (angelic ranks) are under Him.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* “List Paul’s reasons in the text itself for Christ’s ‘firstborn’ title.”
-   **Foundation Text 2:** Revelation 4:11
    -   Reading/Connection: Worship is grounded in Creation—God worthy because He created all things.
    -   [WB]: `WORSHIP ↔ CREATION (Rev 4:11)`
    -   Character Need: The last conflict is worship; recognizing Christ as Creator anchors Sabbath loyalty and defeats false worship.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “How does believing Christ is Creator strengthen Sabbath conviction and end-time firmness?”
-   [EGW]: “Christ, God’s dear Son, had the preeminence over all the angelic host… The Father… ordained… that Christ… should be equal with Himself.” [EGW] (LHU 18).
    -   [WB]: Quote fragment: `“equal with Himself” (LHU 18)`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “Why would Satan’s original envy of Christ’s preeminence matter for our end-time temptations today?”
-   [SN]: *Illustration:* A building stands because hidden steel holds it together; if removed, collapse follows. Christ is the One who “holds all together.”
    -   [DQ]: *(Personal):* “What area of your life ‘collapses’ fastest when you stop daily dependence on Christ?”
-   Practical Step: Put first-place tests on the board: time, money, appetite, media, relationships—does Christ rule there?
    -   [WB]: List: `TIME / MONEY / APPETITE / MEDIA / RELATIONSHIPS`

#### B. Christ’s lordship over salvation: no human addition, only yielded cooperation (7-8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 3:** Colossians 1:13, 14
    -   Reading/Context: We are delivered, transferred, redeemed, forgiven—verbs of God’s action, not ours.
    -   [WB]: `DELIVERED → TRANSFERRED → REDEEMED (Col 1:13-14)`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Our works are fruit of salvation, never the price; adding human merit insults the infinite cost.
    -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* “Which parts of Col 1:13–14 are entirely God’s doing?”
-   **Foundation Text 4:** Titus 2:11–14
    -   Reading/Connection: Grace not only pardons; it **teaches** us to deny ungodliness and live soberly, righteously, godly.
    -   [WB]: `GRACE = PARDON + POWER (Titus 2:11-14)`
    -   Character Focus: End-time readiness is grace-trained character: zealous of good works because we belong to Him.
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “How have you seen ‘grace’ teach you (not just forgive you)?”
-   **Foundation Text 5:** John 15:4, 5
    -   Reading/Challenge: “Abide in Me… without Me ye can do nothing.”
    -   [WB]: `ABIDE → FRUIT; SEPARATE → NOTHING`
    -   Obstacles: self-trust, discouragement, perfectionism without Christ; Solution: constant union (faith that works by love).
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What is one sign you’re trying to bear fruit ‘separate’ from Christ—and what helps you return to abiding?”

### IV. Christ’s Preeminence in Re-creation: Head, Beginning, and Reconciler (9-10 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** The same Christ who created the universe is rebuilding a people—His church and His saints—fit for eternity.

#### A. Head of the body: unity, value, and function (4-5 mins) [*]
-   **Foundation Text 1:** 1 Corinthians 12:12–27
    -   Reading/Context: Many members, one body—no disposable believers; spiritual gifts are for service, not status.
    -   [WB]: Draw body: `ONE BODY / MANY MEMBERS`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: When Christ is truly Head, we stop competing and start supplying what the body lacks.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* “What repeated phrase shows God’s design for unity in diversity?”
-   **Foundation Text 2:** Colossians 2:19
    -   Reading/Connection: Growth comes by “holding fast to the Head”—disconnect from Christ produces spiritual atrophy.
    -   [WB]: `HOLD FAST = GROW`
    -   [EGW]: “Since His ascension Christ has carried forward His work… The great Head of the church superintends His work…” [EGW] (LHU 288).
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What does ‘holding fast to the Head’ look like when church life is disappointing?”
-   **Foundation Text 3:** Ephesians 4:15, 16
    -   Reading/Challenge: The body grows as every joint supplies—truth in love + connected service produces maturity.
    -   [WB]: `TRUTH + LOVE → GROWTH`
    -   [DQ]: *(Practical):* “What is one small ‘supply’ you can bring to the body this week (encouragement, prayer, practical help)?”
-   [SN]: *Illustration:* A severed branch may look green briefly, but it is dying; connection determines life.
    -   [DQ]: *(Heart):* “Where are you ‘connected’ outwardly (attendance) but drifting inwardly (private life)?”

#### B. Beginning, firstborn from the dead, and reconciliation by the Cross (5-6 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 4:** Colossians 1:18
    -   Reading/Context: Head + Beginning + Firstborn from the dead → Christ initiates the new creation.
    -   [WB]: `BEGINNING → NEW CREATION`
    -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* “Why does Paul connect resurrection (‘from the dead’) with Christ having ‘first place’?”
-   **Foundation Text 5:** Romans 6:3, 4
    -   Reading/Connection: Baptism symbolizes death to old life and resurrection to new life—re-creation is practical holiness.
    -   [WB]: `DIE → RISE → WALK (newness)`
    -   Obstacles: cherished sin, unbelief, delay; Solution: daily surrender to Christ’s resurrection power.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What ‘old life’ habit is Christ calling you to bury, not manage?”
-   **Foundation Text 6:** Colossians 1:19, 20
    -   Reading/Context: Fullness of God in Christ; reconciliation and peace “through the blood of His cross”—cosmic scope.
    -   [WB]: `CROSS = PEACE + RECONCILIATION`
    -   [EGW]: “Heaven viewed with grief and amazement Christ hanging upon the cross… the character of God is revealed to all created intelligences…” [EGW] (DA 760, 764).
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “How does the Cross answer Satan’s accusations in the Great Controversy—and change your view of God’s law?”
-   [SN]: *Illustration:* A peace treaty is signed with real blood-cost; the Cross shows the price Heaven paid to win back rebels without forcing them.
    -   [DQ]: *(Decision):* “If reconciliation cost Christ everything, what ‘reserve’ (half-surrender) does it expose in me?”

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
    -   Christ is the perfect Image of God and restores God’s image in us as we behold Him (Gen 1:26–27; 2 Cor 3:18; Heb 1:3)
    -   Christ is Creator and Sustainer; therefore worthy of worship and allegiance (Col 1:15–17; Rev 4:11)
    -   Christ is Lord of salvation: grace pardons and empowers as we abide (Col 1:13–14; Titus 2:11–14; John 15:4–5)
    -   Christ is Head and Beginning of the new creation; the Cross reconciles and creates a loyal end-time people (Eph 4:15–16; Col 1:18–20; Rom 6:3–4)
-   Character Focus Recap: God’s purpose is restoration—being conformed to Christ’s image through abiding, surrender, and obedient faith.
    -   [WB]: `RESTORED IMAGE = CHRISTLIKE CHARACTER`
-   Call to Action/Decision: Choose one “first place” competitor and surrender it to Christ—asking for resurrection power to walk in newness of life.
    -   [WB]: `“HOLD FAST” (Col 2:19) / “CHRIST FIRST” (Col 1:18)`
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* “Based on God’s Word today, what one area will you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?”
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Christ’s preeminence is not only theology—it is safety in the last days; the One who holds the universe together can hold your life together.
    -   [EGW]: “Our growth in grace… all depend upon our union with Christ… by abiding in Him.” [EGW] (FLB 125).
    -   [WB]: `ABIDE IN HIM → GROW (FLB 125 / 2 Cor 3:18)`
