# 2026 Q1 W6 - January 31–February 6
## Confidence Only in Christ

**Overarching Theme:** End-time **readiness through union with Christ**—His imputed righteousness (justification) and His imparted life (sanctification), producing a people who **have no confidence in the flesh**.  
**Central Focus:** The gospel is not self-improvement but **Christ-in-you**: counting all self-credentialing as loss, rejoicing in the Lord, and pressing on to know Him until character is fitted to stand in the final test.  
**Key Texts:** Philippians 3:3, 8–11; Galatians 2:20; 1 Corinthians 1:30

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: We all trust something when pressure hits—money, health, reputation, willpower. Paul asks: **“Where is your confidence when the final test comes?”**
-   Theme Introduction: **Confidence only in Christ** is not merely a doctrine; it is the **only safe foundation** for a character that can endure the closing crisis.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: `NO CONFIDENCE IN THE FLESH — ALL IN CHRIST`
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: In the Great Controversy, God is forming a people who reveal His character; self-righteousness cannot stand, but Christ’s righteousness can.
-   Roadmap:
    -   Rejoicing vs. flesh-confidence (Phil. 3:1–3)
    -   The “ledger” conversion: gain/loss (Phil. 3:4–9)
    -   Knowing Christ progressively: resurrection power, suffering fellowship, pressing to the mark (Phil. 3:10–16)

---

### II. Rejoicing That Guards the Soul From False Confidence (Phil. 3:1–3) (15-16 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Paul’s first defense against deception is surprising: **rejoice in the Lord**—because joy in Christ displaces boasting in self.

#### A. Rejoicing/Boasting: A Heart-Orientation That Excludes Flesh-Confidence (8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 3:1
    -   Reading/Context: Paul repeats a command: “Rejoice in the Lord…for you it is safe.”
    -   [WB]: `Phil 3:1 — REJOICE = SAFE`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Joy is not denial of hardship; it is **anchoring identity in Christ**, which stabilizes the mind against counterfeit gospels.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "Why would Paul call rejoicing ‘safe’—what dangers does it protect us from?"
-   **Foundation Text 2:** Philippians 3:3
    -   Reading/Connection: True worshipers “rejoice/boast in Christ Jesus” and have “no confidence in the flesh.”
    -   [WB]: Two-column: `BOAST IN CHRIST` vs `CONFIDENCE IN FLESH`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: “Flesh” here is not merely the body; it is **human credentialing**—trusting performance, pedigree, rituals, or reputation to feel accepted by God.
    -   [EGW]: "The Lord Jesus is our strength and happiness, the great storehouse from which, on every occasion, men may draw strength… The unfailing, inexhaustible righteousness of Christ becomes our righteousness by faith." (MLT 171).
    -   [WB]: Quote fragment: `“storehouse… righteousness… by faith”`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What ‘storehouse’ are you drawing from day to day—your own strength or Christ’s?"
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What does ‘no confidence in the flesh’ look like in a church context (titles, heritage, standards, knowledge)?"
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A phone with a dying battery can’t “try harder”—it must **plug into power**. Rejoicing in the Lord is like staying connected to the true source.
    -   Connecting to Life: Many lose joy because they’re living on “self-battery,” then feel condemned or proud depending on performance.

-   **Foundation Text 3 (Warning):** Philippians 3:2
    -   Reading/Challenge: Three “bewares” against false teachers pushing flesh-based religion.
    -   [WB]: `Phil 3:2 — 3x BEWARE`
    -   Practical Step: Joy in Christ must be paired with **discernment**: any teaching that makes acceptance with God rest on human markers is a “mutilation” of the gospel.
    -   [DQ]: *(Discernment):* "How can a message sound ‘religious’ and still shift confidence from Christ to the flesh?"
    -   [DQ]: *(Simple):* "What are modern ‘circumcisions’—external markers people rely on to feel saved?"

#### B. Rejoicing in the Lord: The OT Command for End-Time Stability (7-8 mins) [*]
-   **Foundation Text 4:** Psalm 34:2
    -   Reading/Context: “My soul shall make her boast in the Lord…”
    -   [WB]: `Ps 34:2 — BOAST IN THE LORD`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Biblical rejoicing is **covenant loyalty**—God-centered confidence, especially when self is weak.
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does ‘boasting in the Lord’ humble us and strengthen us at the same time?"
-   **Foundation Text 5:** Habakkuk 3:17–18
    -   Reading/Connection: Joy that survives loss—“Yet I will rejoice in the Lord.”
    -   [WB]: `“YET” JOY — Hab 3:18`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: End-time faith learns to rejoice in God’s character, not circumstances—this is the opposite of Laodicean self-satisfaction.
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A tree with deep roots still bears through drought; shallow roots wither fast. **Joy reveals root depth.**
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What is one circumstance right now that tempts you to lose joy—how would rejoicing ‘in the Lord’ change your response?"

### III. The Great Exchange: From Self-Righteous Ledger to Christ Our Righteousness (Phil. 3:4–9; Rom. 2:25–29) (16-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Paul shows that even the best “religious résumé” becomes a barrier if it keeps us from Christ.

#### A. The Danger of Religious Credentials: When “Gain” Becomes “Loss” (8-9 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 3:4–6
    -   Reading/Context: Paul lists seven credentials (heritage, ritual, sect, zeal, blamelessness).
    -   [WB]: `Phil 3:5–6 — 7 credentials`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: The problem isn’t that these were “bad,” but that they became **substitutes** for Christ—confidence shifted from Savior to self.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "Which of Paul’s credentials would impress people today? Which ones do we subtly imitate?"
-   **Foundation Text 2:** Romans 2:28–29
    -   Reading/Connection: True circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit.
    -   [WB]: `OUTSIDE vs HEART (Spirit)`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: God is preparing a people with **heart religion**—Spirit-produced obedience, not performative religion.
    -   [EGW]: "Faith works by love and purifies the soul. Through faith the Holy Spirit works in the heart to create holiness therein; but this cannot be done unless the human agent will work with Christ." (YRP 60).
    -   [WB]: `Faith → Love → Purity (Spirit + cooperation)`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How do we cooperate with Christ without sliding back into self-righteousness?"
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A resume can get you a job interview, but it cannot produce the skills for the work. Credentials can’t produce holiness—only **union with Christ** can.

-   **Foundation Text 3 (Gospel Ledger):** Philippians 3:7–8
    -   Reading/Challenge: “What things were gain…counted loss…for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ.”
    -   [WB]: Ledger diagram: `GAIN → LOSS` leading to `CHRIST = EXCELLENCE`
    -   Practical Step: Ask God to reveal what you secretly “count” as your worth before Him; surrender it as loss so Christ becomes your all.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What is hardest for you to count as ‘loss’—a strength, a reputation, a role, a past achievement?"

#### B. Justification by Faith: Being Found in Him, Not in My Own Righteousness (8-9 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 4:** Philippians 3:9
    -   Reading/Context: Two righteousnesses contrasted: “my own…from law” vs “through faith…from God.”
    -   [WB]: `MY righteousness` vs `GOD’S righteousness`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: The only righteousness that stands in judgment is **Christ’s imputed righteousness**; this is the entrance into sanctification, not an excuse to avoid it.
    -   [EGW]: "In order to meet the requirement of the law, our faith must grasp the righteousness of Christ, accepting it as our righteousness. Through union with Christ…we may be qualified to work the works of God." (YRP 60).
    -   [WB]: `Imputed → Qualified for works (not saved by works)`
    -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "How does ‘grasping Christ’s righteousness’ both remove fear and remove pride?"
-   **Foundation Text 5:** 2 Corinthians 5:21
    -   Reading/Connection: Christ made sin for us; we become righteousness in Him.
    -   [WB]: `The Great Exchange — 2 Cor 5:21`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Focus: Justification is legal and real; it also opens the way for transformation—God is restoring His image in us.
    -   [DQ]: *(Heart question):* "Do you more often relate to God as a debtor trying to pay, or as a child receiving and then obeying?"
-   **Foundation Text 6:** Galatians 2:20
    -   Reading/Promise: “Christ lives in me… I live by the faith of the Son of God.”
    -   [WB]: `CHRIST IN ME → His faithfulness lived out`
    -   Practical Step: Daily surrender of the will: “Lord, live Your life in me today—in my thoughts, reactions, appetites, words.”
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A glove can’t do work by itself; it must be **filled by the hand**. Our “trying” without Christ is empty-glove religion.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What specific habit or temper shows you you’ve been ‘empty glove’ this week—and how will you invite Christ to fill it?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
    -   Rejoicing in the Lord is **safe** because it anchors confidence in Christ (Phil. 3:1–3).
    -   The converted life counts self-confidence as loss and gains Christ as supreme (Phil. 3:7–9).
    -   Knowing Christ is progressive: resurrection power now, fellowship in suffering, pressing to the goal (Phil. 3:10–16).
-   Character Focus Recap: God’s purpose is a people who reveal Christ’s character—no divided service, no flesh-confidence, but Christ’s righteousness and life.
    -   [WB]: `CHRISTLIKENESS = END-TIME READINESS`
-   Call to Action/Decision:
    -   Choose one area where you’ve leaned on “flesh” (ability, discipline, reputation, tradition) and deliberately transfer confidence to Christ by surrender and prayer.
    -   [WB]: `TRANSFER TRUST: SELF → CHRIST`
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "Based on God’s Word today, what one area will you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope:
    -   [EGW]: "Day by day God works with him, perfecting the character that is to stand in the time of final test." (AA 483).
    -   [WB]: `AA 483 — “character… final test”`
