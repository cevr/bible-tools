# 2026 Q1 W1 - December 27, 2025–January 2, 2026
## Persecuted but Not Forsaken

**Overarching Theme:** The **Great Controversy** refines God’s remnant through persecution into Christlike **character perfection**—a living witness that God can keep a people loyal under pressure.  
**Central Focus:** Trials are not abandonment but divine permission for **restoration of God’s image** in us—teaching surrender, producing steadfast love, and preparing us to stand faithful in the closing crisis.  
**Key Texts:** 2 Cor. 4:7–11; Rom. 8:35–39; Phil. 1:12–14

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: When obedience brings opposition, what does that “prove”—that God left you, or that you have entered the battlefield of the Great Controversy?
-   Theme Introduction: Scripture teaches that God’s people may be **persecuted**, yet never **forsaken**; suffering becomes God’s classroom for sanctification and His platform for mission.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: `PERSECUTED — NOT FORSAKEN (Refined for the Last Days)`
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: End-time readiness is not mere knowledge; it is **settled character**—faithful under pressure (Rev. 14:12), rejoicing in Christ when circumstances threaten faith.
-   Roadmap: (1) Paul’s identity in suffering (Eph. 3:1; Phil. 1:12–14), (2) the theology of weakness and Christ’s life manifested (2 Cor. 4:7–11), (3) unbreakable love and end-time assurance (Rom. 8:35–39; Phil. 4:4).

### II. Chains as Calling: Providence, Mission, and the Training of Loyalty (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Paul reframes imprisonment as Christ-governed assignment; this is the first victory—victory of **interpretation** and surrender.

#### A. Christ owns the circumstances: “Prisoner of Jesus Christ” (8-9 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** Ephesians 3:1
    -   Reading/Context: Paul, unjustly confined, identifies himself not as Caesar’s captive but as “the prisoner of Jesus Christ.”
    -   [WB]: `Eph 3:1 — Who “owns” my trial?`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Faith does not deny injustice; it refuses to interpret life as random. In the Great Controversy, Satan seeks to make hardship look like God’s absence; Paul calls it Christ’s jurisdiction.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* “In Eph. 3:1, who does Paul say he belongs to—Rome or Jesus?”
-   **Foundation Text 2:** Philippians 1:12–13
    -   Reading/Connection: “The things which happened…have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel”—even the palace guard hears.
    -   [WB]: `Phil 1:12 — Hardship → Furtherance`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: God can turn confinement into a pulpit. This kills murmuring and forms the end-time trait of **steadfast witness**.
    -   [EGW]: “It is the privilege of every soul to be a living channel through which God can communicate to the world the treasures of His grace.” (GA 187).  
    -   [WB]: `Channel (flow) vs Reservoir (stagnation)`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “What changes in your attitude when you see yourself as a ‘channel’ in a hard place?”
-   **Foundation Text 3 (Action/Promise):** Philippians 1:14
    -   Reading/Challenge: Paul’s bonds embolden others “to speak the word without fear.”
    -   [WB]: `Courage is contagious`
    -   Practical Step: Ask: “Who is God strengthening through my steady faith?” Then choose one courageous act (a call, a testimony, a prayer with someone).
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “Who might be watching your response to pressure—and what gospel courage could it awaken in them?”
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Like a train forced onto a slower track—but still moving forward—God may slow our pace to reach people we’d otherwise pass by.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “Where has God ‘slowed’ you recently, and what new mission-field appeared there?”

#### B. Suffering is sometimes appointed: training for the last conflict (7-9 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 4:** Acts 9:16
    -   Reading/Context: Jesus: “I will show him how great things he must suffer for My name’s sake.”
    -   [WB]: `Acts 9:16 — Suffering ≠ rejection`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Not all pain is correction; some is commission. God is forming a messenger whose message must be proved by endurance.
    -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* “How does Acts 9:16 correct the idea that hardship always means God is displeased?”
-   **Foundation Text 5:** 2 Timothy 3:12
    -   Reading/Connection: “All that will live godly…shall suffer persecution.”
    -   [WB]: `Godliness → friction (moral contrast)`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Persecution reveals what’s inside: pride, fear of man, impatience. God permits pressure to expose self so Christ can replace it.
    -   [EGW]: “For every soul who is growing up into Christ there will be times of earnest and long-continued struggle; for the powers of darkness are determined to oppose the way of advance.” (YI Nov. 9, 1899).  
    -   [WB]: `Growth → struggle → maturity`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “What current struggle might actually be evidence of growth rather than failure?”
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A muscle grows only against resistance—no resistance, no strengthening. Trials can become God’s “resistance training” for faithfulness.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “If God is strengthening one spiritual ‘muscle’ in you through this resistance, what might it be?”

### III. Treasure in Earthen Vessels: Sanctification Under Pressure (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** The Christian’s endurance is not natural toughness; it is Christ’s life manifested through surrendered weakness—God restoring His image in us.

#### A. Weak vessel, divine power: why God allows pressure (8-9 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** 2 Corinthians 4:7
    -   Reading/Context: “Treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God.”
    -   [WB]: `Vessel (me) ≠ Treasure (Christ)`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: God chooses weak containers so no one credits self. Character perfection is not human perfectionism; it is **Christ reproduced** in the surrendered believer.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* “What two things are contrasted in 2 Cor. 4:7?”
-   **Foundation Text 2:** 2 Corinthians 4:8–9
    -   Reading/Connection: Pressed/perplexed/persecuted/struck down—yet not crushed/despairing/forsaken/destroyed.
    -   [WB]: 4-line chart: `Pressed/Not crushed … Persecuted/Not forsaken`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Faith accepts the first word (reality) but holds the second word (promise). This is how God forms stability for end-time standing.
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “Which pair describes you most right now—and what does the ‘not…’ part ask you to believe?”
-   **Foundation Text 3 (Action/Promise):** 2 Corinthians 4:10–11
    -   Reading/Challenge: Carrying Christ’s dying so that His life may be manifested “in our mortal flesh.”
    -   [WB]: `Death to self → Life of Jesus seen`
    -   Practical Step: Identify one reflex of self (complaining, retaliation, self-pity). Bring it to Christ in prayer, then choose the opposite obedience (silence, kindness, gratitude).
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What ‘death to self’ would most clearly reveal Jesus in your home or workplace this week?”
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A clay lamp is fragile, but the flame is strong; cracks don’t stop light—sometimes they spread it farther.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “If God is allowing a ‘crack’ in your strength, how could His light be seen more clearly through it?”

#### B. Joy and assurance: the soul’s anchor in the closing crisis (7-8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 4:** Philippians 4:4
    -   Reading/Context: Written from prison—“Rejoice in the Lord alway.”
    -   [WB]: `Joy’s location: IN THE LORD`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: The command is not to enjoy pain; it is to rejoice in Christ’s unchanging character, intercession, and soon return.
    -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* “What does it mean to rejoice ‘in the Lord’—what specifically are we rejoicing in?”
-   **Foundation Text 5:** Romans 8:35–39
    -   Reading/Connection: No tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword can separate us from Christ’s love.
    -   [WB]: Center circle: `LOVE OF CHRIST`; around it: `tribulation… sword`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Assurance fuels obedience. Insecurity breeds compromise. Satan’s strategy is to convince us we are abandoned; Paul says Christ’s love is unbreakable for the surrendered soul.
    -   [EGW]: “Only the love of Christ for us can sustain our faith in times of trial.” (SR 317–318).  
    -   [WB]: `Sustained by love, not by ease`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “Which ‘threat’ in Rom. 8 feels most real to you—and how does Paul answer it?”
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A child can walk through darkness if holding the father’s hand. Peace comes more from **presence** than from explanations.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What daily habit helps you ‘hold Christ’s hand’ when your emotions are loud?”

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
    -   God reigns over the prison and advances the gospel through trials (Eph. 3:1; Phil. 1:12–14).
    -   Suffering is often part of discipleship training, not a sign of abandonment (Acts 9:16; 2 Tim. 3:12).
    -   Weakness is the stage where Christ’s life is revealed—sanctification under pressure (2 Cor. 4:7–11).
    -   Joy and endurance rest on Christ’s unbreakable love (Phil. 4:4; Rom. 8:35–39).
-   Character Focus Recap: God’s purpose is restoration—His image in us—patient, joyful steadfastness that can stand in the last days.
    -   [WB]: `RESTORED IMAGE → STEADFAST LOYALTY`
-   Call to Action/Decision: Choose one hardship to reframe as God’s assignment; ask for grace to die to self in one specific reaction; look intentionally for one soul to bless this week.
    -   [WB]: `RE-FRAME → SURRENDER → WITNESS`
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* “Based on God’s Word today, what one area will you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?”
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The same God who permits the trial promises His presence to the end.
    -   [EGW]: “The promise of the Redeemer is, ‘I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.’ ‘I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.’” (YI Nov. 9, 1899).  
    -   [WB]: `Heb 13:5 / Matt 28:20 — NOT FORSAKEN`
