# 2026 Q1 W7 - February 7–13
## A Heavenly Citizenship

**Overarching Theme:** End-time readiness through **heavenly-minded sanctification**—a guarded mind, obedient life, and contented joy that reveal our true citizenship and fit us to stand blameless at Christ’s appearing.  
**Central Focus:** God restores His image in us by daily surrender: **truth in the heart** → **peace guarding the mind** → **Christlike character** that stands fast until Jesus transforms our bodies at His coming.  
**Key Texts:** Philippians 3:20–21; Philippians 4:6–9; Colossians 3:1–4  

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: We all live under a “passport”—what “passport” has shaped your reactions this week: **earthly anxiety** or **heavenly peace**?
-   Theme Introduction: Heavenly citizenship is not a label; it is a **life inwrought with Christ** that shows up in choices, thoughts, and stability under trial (Phil. 3:20; 4:6–9).
    -   [WB]: Title: `HEAVENLY CITIZENSHIP = CHARACTER READY FOR JESUS`
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Paul ties citizenship to the Second Advent transformation (Phil. 3:20–21). The last generation must learn to **stand fast** (Phil. 4:1) with minds guarded and lives obedient.
-   Roadmap:
    -   Role models and the cross-shaped life (Phil. 3:17–19)
    -   Standing fast by hope of glorification (Phil. 3:20–21; 1 Cor. 15)
    -   Peace, thought-life, and contentment as end-time preparation (Phil. 4:4–13, 19)

### II. Models that Reveal the Passport: Cross vs. Belly (Philippians 3:17–19) (15-16 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** The Great Controversy is fought over worship and allegiance; Paul says you can *see* citizenship by who we imitate and what we live for.

#### A. Imitation is Discipleship: Community “Fellow-Imitators” (7-8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 3:17
    -   Reading/Context: Paul calls the church to “join in following my example.”
    -   [WB]: `Phil 3:17 — "FOLLOW" / "MARK"`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: God uses **visible lives** to teach invisible realities. We learn holiness by watching it embodied—yet always measuring by Scripture and Christ.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* “What two actions does Paul command in Phil. 3:17 (join… and note…)? What does that imply about Christian community?”
-   **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Corinthians 11:1
    -   Reading/Connection: “Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ.”
    -   [WB]: Arrow diagram: `PAUL → CHRIST → CHURCH`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The goal isn’t copying personalities; it’s copying **Christlikeness**. True leadership is patterned after the Cross.
    -   [EGW]: “Obedience to the laws of God develops in man a beautiful character… His daily obedience… obtains for him a character that assures him eternal life…” (SD 42).
    -   [WB]: Quote fragment: `“Obedience… develops… beautiful character”`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “Why does [EGW] connect obedience and ‘beautiful character’ with eternal life? How does that protect us from ‘cheap grace’?”
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Like apprentices in a workshop—if you stand near a careless worker, you learn sloppy habits; if you stand near a master, you learn precision.
    -   Connecting to Life: Who is shaping your “habits of holiness”—media, peers, or faithful saints?
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “Name one person (living or biblical) whose life pushes you toward Christ. What specific trait do you want to imitate?”

#### B. The Enemy Identity Test: What Do They Love and Mind? (7-8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 3:** Philippians 3:18–19
    -   Reading/Context: “Enemies of the cross… their god is their belly… set their mind on earthly things.”
    -   [WB]: Two columns: `CROSS` vs `BELLY` (Phil 3:18–19)
    -   Unpacking the Truth: End-time deception often looks “religious,” but the heart is enslaved to appetite, pride, pleasure, reputation. The cross calls for **self-denial** and crucified desires.
    -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* “What does it mean to be an ‘enemy of the cross’ while still being around Christian things?”
-   **Foundation Text 4:** Romans 16:17–18
    -   Reading/Connection: Those who cause divisions “serve… their own belly.”
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Appetite is not only food—it is **self-rule**. The belly is the symbol of uncrucified self.
    -   [EGW]: “We cannot afford by our example to seem to sanction wrongdoing. There is a heaven to win and a hell to shun…” (HP 299).
    -   [WB]: `“Heaven to win / hell to shun”`
    -   [DQ]: *(Heart-check):* “Where is it easiest for you to ‘sanction wrongdoing’ quietly—speech, entertainment, diet, attitudes, business?”
-   **Foundation Text 5:** Matthew 5:13–16
    -   Reading/Connection: Salt and light—citizens of heaven must be visible in earth’s darkness.
    -   [WB]: `SALT = PRESERVE` / `LIGHT = REVEAL`
    -   Practical Step: Choose one “salt” practice this week: a guarded tongue, faithful Sabbath spirit, purity in media, honest work, humble confession.
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A lighthouse doesn’t argue with darkness; it simply stays lit—if the power source is connected.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What ‘power connection’ (prayer, Bible, service) most keeps your light steady?”
    -   [DQ]: *(Application/Group):* “What is one ‘small compromise’ that would actually make our ‘salt’ lose savor in this community?”

### III. Standing Fast: Heaven’s Hope and the Coming Transformation (Philippians 3:20–4:1) (15-16 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Paul anchors stability now in a literal, bodily hope at Christ’s return—this is not escapism; it is endurance and holiness.

#### A. Citizenship is Present Allegiance and Future Rescue (8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 3:20
    -   Reading/Context: “Our citizenship is in heaven… we eagerly wait for the Savior.”
    -   [WB]: `CITIZENSHIP (now) → WAITING (active) → SAVIOR`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Heaven is our commonwealth now: our laws, loyalties, identity. Waiting is not passive; it is watchful obedience.
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* “What does Paul say we do *because* citizenship is in heaven—complain less, or ‘eagerly wait’ more?”
-   **Foundation Text 2:** Hebrews 11:13, 16
    -   Reading/Connection: “Strangers and pilgrims… desire a better country.”
    -   [WB]: `PILGRIMS → BETTER COUNTRY`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Pilgrims travel light. A heavy love of the world makes people unstable in crisis and compromise in temptation.
    -   [EGW]: “The people of God… are on earth but sojourners, whose citizenship is in heaven… Christianity… is a life inwrought with the life of Jesus.” (AG 57).
    -   [WB]: `“life inwrought”`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “How can someone be very ‘churchy’ yet not truly live as a pilgrim? What would ‘life inwrought’ look like at home?”
-   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A traveler at an airport doesn’t redecorate the terminal; he prepares for the flight and watches the gate announcement.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “If Jesus came this week, what ‘terminal behavior’ would you want to change—spending, grudges, secret habits?”
    -   [DQ]: *(Deeper):* “What does it look like to ‘wait’ in a way that actually purifies you rather than merely excites you?”

#### B. The Body and the End: Glorification Fuels Sanctification (7-8 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 3:** Philippians 3:21
    -   Reading/Context: Jesus will transform our “humble body” to be like His glorious body.
    -   [WB]: `TRANSFORMED` / `LIKE HIS GLORIOUS BODY`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: God’s salvation is complete—mind and body. Present sanctification prepares a people to be safely entrusted with immortality.
    -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* “Why does Paul connect Christ’s power over ‘all things’ with transforming our bodies?”
-   **Foundation Text 4:** 1 Corinthians 15:42–44, 50–54
    -   Reading/Connection: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption; mortality puts on immortality.
    -   [WB]: `CORRUPTION → INCORRUPTION` / `MORTAL → IMMORTAL`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: If we want an incorruptible body then, we must seek an incorruptible character now (by grace).
    -   [EGW]: “The truth of God obeyed… is alone sufficient to make any of us stand in these evil times… The truth planted in the heart… will give us discernment.” (TMK 301).
    -   [WB]: `TRUTH (in heart) → DISCERNMENT → STAND`
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “How does believing in a literal resurrection change how we face sickness, aging, and death?”
-   **Foundation Text 5:** Philippians 4:1
    -   Reading/Challenge: “Therefore… stand fast in the Lord.”
    -   [WB]: `STAND FAST = IN THE LORD`
    -   Practical Step: Choose one area where you will “stand fast” by principle, not impulse (speech, appetite, Sabbath, modesty, honesty, forgiveness).
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A fence doesn’t imprison the sheep; it protects it from the cliff. God’s boundaries preserve joy and purity.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What temptation is trying to ‘move’ you off your ground right now, and what Bible promise will you stand on?”
    -   [DQ]: *(Application/Pair-share):* “What does ‘in the Lord’ add to ‘stand fast’—how do we avoid trying to stand fast in mere willpower?”

### IV. Guarded Hearts, Peaceful Minds, and Contented Strength (Philippians 4:4–13, 19) (10-12 mins) [*]
-   **Introduction to Section:** In the last days, anxiety will be a universal weapon. Paul gives heaven’s method: prayer, thought discipline, obedience, and Christ-sufficiency.

#### A. Anxiety to Prayer: Peace as a Guard (6 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 4:4–7
    -   Reading/Context: Rejoice always; be anxious for nothing; pray with thanksgiving; peace guards heart and mind.
    -   [WB]: Flow chart: `ANXIETY → PRAYER+THANKS → PEACE → GUARD`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: Peace is not denial; it is God’s **garrison** around the mind. Thanksgiving is faith treating God’s promise as reliable.
    -   [EGW]: “Those only who are constantly receiving fresh supplies of grace, will have power proportionate to their daily need…” (AG 117).
    -   [WB]: `“fresh supplies of grace… daily need”`
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* “What four parts of prayer are in Phil. 4:6 (prayer, supplication, thanksgiving, requests)? Which one do you neglect?”
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “What is one anxiety you can convert into a specific ‘request + thanksgiving’ today?”
-   **Foundation Text 2:** John 14:27
    -   Reading/Connection: Christ’s peace is not the world’s peace.
    -   [WB]: `WORLD PEACE = CONTROL` / `CHRIST PEACE = TRUST`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The world’s peace depends on control; Christ’s peace depends on **trust and surrender**.
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* “How can you tell the difference between ‘peace’ that is avoidance and peace that is Christ’s gift?”
    -   [DQ]: *(Deeper):* “Why would Satan prefer us to be anxious rather than openly rebellious?”

#### B. Thought Discipline and Practice: The Mind as the Battlefield (4-6 mins)
-   **Foundation Text 3:** Philippians 4:8–9
    -   Reading/Context: Think on the virtues; practice what you learned; “the God of peace” will be with you.
    -   [WB]: List: `TRUE / NOBLE / JUST / PURE / LOVELY / GOOD REPORT`
    -   Unpacking the Truth: You cannot live a holy life with an unguarded imagination. What we entertain becomes what we become.
    -   [EGW]: “If the mind is educated to contemplate heavenly things… emptying from the heart all self-sufficiency… The Lord invites our confidence… Think of the Lord Jesus…” (TDG 300).
    -   [WB]: `MIND → HEAVENLY THINGS` and `NO SELF-SUFFICIENCY`
    -   [DQ]: *(Practical):* “What is one input you could remove (or reduce) this week to obey Phil. 4:8 more faithfully?”
-   **Foundation Text 4:** Psalm 119:165
    -   Reading/Connection: “Great peace have they which love thy law.”
    -   [WB]: `LOVE LAW → GREAT PEACE`
    -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Love for God’s law is not legalism; it is harmony with His character. Peace grows where obedience is cherished.
    -   [DQ]: *(Deeper):* “What is the connection between law and peace—why does rebellion produce mental unrest?”
-   **Foundation Text 5:** Philippians 4:10–13
    -   Reading/Context: Contentment learned; strength in Christ.
    -   [WB]: `CONTENTMENT = LEARNED` / `CHRIST STRENGTHENS`
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A thermostat vs. a thermometer—one only reflects the room; the other influences the room. In Christ, we become “thermostats” spiritually.
    -   [EGW]: “Christian perfection alone will win the spotless robes of character…” (OHC 242).
    -   [WB]: `“spotless robes of character”`
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* “Where do you most need Christ’s strengthening—temptation, patience, forgiveness, endurance, or witness?”
    -   [DQ]: *(Heart-check):* “Is your ‘contentment’ coming from lowered standards, or from Christ’s indwelling power?”

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
    -   Heavenly citizenship is proven by **what we imitate** (Phil. 3:17) and **what we mind** (Phil. 3:19).
    -   Our hope is not earthly systems but Christ’s soon return and **bodily transformation** (Phil. 3:20–21; 1 Cor. 15).
    -   End-time stability comes through prayerful trust, disciplined thinking, and obedient practice—resulting in **guarded peace** (Phil. 4:6–9).
-   Character Focus Recap: God’s goal is restoration of His image—truth in the heart, peace in the mind, obedience in the life, contentment in Christ.
    -   [WB]: `READY = GUARDED MIND + OBEDIENT LIFE + LIVING HOPE`
-   Call to Action/Decision:
    -   Choose one “citizenship practice” for the coming week:
        -   A daily Phil. 4:6 prayer list with thanksgiving
        -   A Phil. 4:8 media/thought cleanse
        -   A Phil. 3:17 choice to seek and follow godly role models
    -   [WB]: `STAND FAST (Phil 4:1)` / `THINK (Phil 4:8)` / `PRAY (Phil 4:6)`
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* “What one area will you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?”
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: We are not preparing merely to survive life, but to meet Jesus and be like Him—inside now, and outside at His appearing.
    -   [EGW]: “The truth of God obeyed… is alone sufficient to make any of us stand in these evil times…” (TMK 301).
    -   [WB]: `TMK 301 — "STAND in evil times"` / `Phil 3:21 — "LIKE HIM"`
