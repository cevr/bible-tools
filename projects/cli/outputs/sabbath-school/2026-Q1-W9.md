# 2026 Q1 W9 - February 21–27

## Reconciliation and Hope

**Overarching Theme:** The Cross restores God’s **moral government** by
reconciling sinners to God, and then ripens a people **perfect (mature) in
Christ**—ready for the final vindication of God’s character in the Great
Controversy.  
**Central Focus:** From alienation to **abiding union** (“Christ in
you”)—justification that leads to Spirit-empowered sanctification, producing a
spotless church.  
**Key Texts:** Colossians 1:21–29; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Ephesians 5:27

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Reconciliation is not merely “God calming down toward us,” but God
  **bringing us back into harmony** with Him—so what would reconciliation look
  like if it truly reached the heart?
- Theme Introduction: The Cross is God’s answer to the Great Controversy—legally
  (pardon), relationally (peace), and morally (a changed people).
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: “Reconciled to Be Made Ready”
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The end goal is not only forgiveness but a
  church Christ can present “without spot or wrinkle” (Eph. 5:27)—end-time
  readiness is **character** through Christ’s indwelling.
- Roadmap: We will trace (1) our alienation and God’s initiative, (2) the
  conditional perseverance of faith/hope, (3) the revealed mystery: “Christ in
  you,” and (4) the gospel’s aim: “present everyone perfect.”

### II. Reconciled by Blood: From Enemies to Holy (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul starts with the bad news (alienation) to
  magnify the good news (reconciliation through Christ’s death) and its purpose:
  holiness.

#### A. Alienation is real, moral, and personal (6-7 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 1:21
  - Reading/Context: “Alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works”—not
    merely ignorance, but a bent of mind expressed in deeds.
  - [WB]: Col. 1:21 -> “Alienated / Enemies / Mind / Works”
  - Unpacking the Truth: Sin is not only broken rules; it is **broken
    loyalty**—a mind hostile to God’s ways.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What words in Col. 1:21 show that the problem is
    deeper than behavior?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Romans 5:8–10
  - Reading/Connection: “While we were… sinners… enemies… reconciled by the
    death of His Son.” God moves first.
  - [WB]: Rom. 5:8–10 -> “While… God acted first”
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Reconciliation begins with God’s
    initiative, not our improvement; yet it aims at changing what we are.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does ‘while we were enemies’ protect us from both
    despair and pride?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A child runs away and is lost; the father searches all
    night. The search proves the father’s love, but the child still must accept
    being carried home.
  - Connecting to Life: God’s pursuit in Christ answers our helplessness, but we
    must stop running.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where do you see ‘running’ from God showing up most
    commonly today—busyness, pleasure, resentment, unbelief?”

#### B. The Cross reconciles with a purpose: present holiness (8-10 mins)

- **Foundation Text 3:** Colossians 1:22
  - Reading/Challenge: Reconciled “in the body of His flesh through death” to
    present you “holy… blameless… above reproach.”
  - [WB]: Col. 1:22 -> “Holy / Blameless / Above reproach”
  - Unpacking the Truth: The atonement is not only to cancel guilt; it is to
    **restore God’s image**—a fitness to stand in His presence.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “Why would Paul tie reconciliation directly to
    being ‘holy and blameless’?”
- **Foundation Text 4:** 2 Corinthians 5:21
  - Reading/Connection: Christ treated as sin, we made “the righteousness of God
    in Him”—substitution that results in transformation.
  - [WB]: 2 Cor. 5:21 -> “He became sin… we become righteous”
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the heart of justification by
    faith—His righteousness credited, and then reproduced in the life by union
    with Him.
  - [EGW]: “[W]e have no righteousness of our own… Christ’s character stands in
    place of your character… **More than this, Christ changes the heart. He
    abides in your heart by faith**… continual surrender of your will to Him.”
    (SC 62–63).
  - [WB]: “Imputed + Imparted (SC 62–63)”
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What’s the danger of accepting ‘Christ’s character
    stands in place of yours’ but ignoring ‘Christ changes the heart’?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Ephesians 5:27
  - Reading/Connection: Christ’s goal for the church: “no spot or wrinkle… holy…
    without blemish.”
  - [WB]: Eph. 5:27 -> “Spotless Bride”
  - Practical Step: Ask God daily for a surrendered will; holiness is not
    self-improvement but Christ living out His law of love in us.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “If Christ is preparing a ‘spotless’ people, what
    habits or attitudes most resist that work in us?”
- **Section Illustration Reinforcement:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A surgeon removes a deadly infection (justification
    removes condemnation) and then prescribes rehab and nutrition
    (sanctification restores strength). Both are part of one plan to make the
    patient whole.
  - [WB]: “ONE PLAN: Pardon -> Power -> Purity”
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection/Application):_ “Where do you tend to separate what God
    joins—wanting pardon without rehab, or trying rehab without trusting the
    Surgeon?”

### III. Continue in the Faith: Hope That Doesn’t Drift (14-16 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Reconciliation is offered freely, but Paul warns:
  it must be **maintained by living faith**, not presumption.

#### A. The Bible’s “if” and the myth of careless security (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 1:23
  - Reading/Context: “If indeed you continue… grounded and steadfast, and are
    not moved away from the hope of the gospel.”
  - [WB]: Col. 1:23 -> “Continue / Grounded / Not moved”
  - Unpacking the Truth: The reconciled life is a **continuing union**; drifting
    is real, so watchfulness is love’s loyalty.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What are the three stability words Paul uses in this
    verse?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Corinthians 15:58
  - Reading/Connection: “Steadfast, immovable, always abounding…”—not passive
    holding, but active perseverance.
  - [WB]: “Steadfast = immovable = abounding”
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Stability grows through consistent
    obedience and service; indifference is spiritual erosion.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What tends to ‘move’ believers away today—suffering,
    offense, false teaching, worldly success?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Proverbs 14:12
  - Reading/Warning: A way can “seem right” but end in death—sincerity is not
    safety.
  - [WB]: Prov. 14:12 -> “Seems right ≠ safe”
  - [EGW]: “The light given me has been very forcible that many would go out
    from us, giving heed to seducing spirits… The Lord desires that every soul…
    shall have an **intelligent knowledge** of what is truth.” (Ev 363).
  - [WB]: “Intelligent knowledge of truth (Ev 363)”
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one practical way a family or young person
    can build ‘intelligent knowledge’ of truth this week?”
- **Section Illustration Reinforcement:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A boat tied to the dock isn’t “trying” to drift—if the
    rope loosens, the current does the rest. Neglect is a decision with
    consequences.
  - [WB]: “DRIFT = neglect + current”
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What ‘rope’ is loosening in your experience—Bible
    time, prayer, Sabbath reverence, media choices, friendships?”

#### B. How we continue: Christ dwelling by faith (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Ephesians 3:17
  - Reading/Context: “That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith.”
  - [WB]: Eph. 3:17 -> “Christ dwells… through faith”
  - Unpacking the Truth: Faith is not a moment; it is a **living
    connection**—the heart becomes His home, not a hotel.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What might show that Christ is ‘dwelling’ rather than
    merely ‘visiting’?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Galatians 2:20
  - Reading/Connection: “Not I, but Christ lives in me”—the secret of victorious
    Christian living.
  - [WB]: Gal. 2:20 -> “Not I… Christ”
  - [EGW]: “We need daily to cultivate faith in a present Saviour… ‘I live; yet
    not I, but Christ liveth in me’… He seeks to… weave into his character.”
    (TDG 62).
  - [WB]: “Daily faith = present deliverance (TDG 62)”
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like a phone that must stay connected to the charger
    to run heavy tasks—disconnected, it still looks fine for a while, then
    suddenly dies.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What ‘daily reconnection’ practice actually works
    for you—morning consecration, Scripture memory, prayer walks, surrendering a
    specific sin?”

### IV. The Mystery Revealed: Christ in You, Maturity for the End (12-14 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The “mystery” is not secret knowledge; it is
  God’s unveiled plan to unite heaven and earth in Christ by forming Christ’s
  character in His people.

#### A. The revealed mystery and the cosmic uniting of all things (6-7 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 1:26–27
  - Reading/Context: “Mystery… now revealed… Christ in you, the hope of glory.”
  - [WB]: “Mystery = Christ in you = hope of glory”
  - Unpacking the Truth: The gospel is God planting heaven’s Life inside
    repentant sinners—this is how He prepares a people to stand and how He
    answers Satan’s accusations.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “According to Col. 1:27, what exactly is the ‘hope of
    glory’ connected to?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Ephesians 1:7–10
  - Reading/Connection: God’s plan to “gather together in one all things in
    Christ”—reconciliation is heading somewhere: final unity under Christ.
  - [WB]: Eph. 1:10 -> “All things in Christ (unity)”
  - Deeper Insight: The Cross is the moral center of the universe; it justifies
    God’s government and becomes the pattern of self-sacrificing love.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does seeing God’s ‘big plan’ help you interpret
    your trials differently?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Romans 8:18
  - Reading/Connection: Present sufferings not worthy compared with glory to be
    revealed “in us”—character glory, not only scenery.
  - [WB]: Rom. 8:18 -> “Glory revealed in us”
  - [EGW]: “The plan for our redemption was… a revelation of ‘the mystery’… not
    an afterthought… unfolding of the principles… foundation of God’s throne.”
    (RC 23).
  - [WB]: “Not afterthought—eternal purpose (RC 23)”
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “If trials are part of God’s shaping work, what trial
    are you tempted to waste by complaining instead of surrendering?”
- **Section Illustration Reinforcement:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A stained-glass window looks dark from outside until
    light shines through it. God’s goal is not merely to label us “His,” but to
    shine His character through us.
  - [WB]: “Light in -> beauty out”
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection/Application):_ “What ‘dark piece’ in your life do you
    want Christ to shine through for His glory?”

#### B. Paul’s goal: present everyone perfect (mature) in Christ (6-7 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Colossians 1:28
  - Reading/Context: “Warning… teaching… that we may present everyone mature
    (teleios) in Christ.”
  - [WB]: Col. 1:28 -> “Teleios = mature/complete”
  - Unpacking the Truth: Biblical “perfection” is completeness in Christ—no
    cherished sin, no divided loyalty; a settled maturity under the Spirit.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “Why does Paul repeat ‘everyone’—what kinds of
    people are included in your mind?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Colossians 1:29
  - Reading/Connection: Paul labors “according to His working which works in me
    mightily”—not human grit, but divine power in cooperation.
  - [WB]: Col. 1:29 -> “His working… in me”
  - [EGW]: “Man cannot be saved without obedience… but his works should not be
    of himself; **Christ should work in him to will and to do**…” (AG 177).
  - [WB]: “Obedience = Christ working within (AG 177)”
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A sailboat cannot create wind; it can only raise the
    sail and align. The Spirit supplies power; we cooperate by surrender and
    obedience.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one ‘sail adjustment’ God is asking you to
    make—something specific you know from Scripture you must obey?”
- **Readiness Link [*] (optional if time):**
  - **Foundation Text 6:** Revelation 19:7–8
    - Reading/Connection: The bride “made herself ready,” yet her fine linen is
      “the righteous acts of the saints”—a life produced by grace and expressed
      in obedience.
    - [WB]: Rev. 19:7–8 -> “Ready Bride = righteous acts”
    - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How do you hold together ‘made ready’ and ‘made
      herself ready’ without falling into legalism or laziness?”

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
  - We were truly alienated enemies (Col. 1:21), yet God acted first (Rom.
    5:8–10).
  - Reconciliation aims at holiness and blamelessness (Col. 1:22; Eph. 5:27).
  - The reconciled life is maintained by continuing faith, grounded in truth
    (Col. 1:23; Prov. 14:12).
  - The mystery is “Christ in you,” producing maturity by His power (Col.
    1:27–29).
- Character Focus Recap: God’s end-time people will reflect Christ’s indwelling
  life—obedience from love, not legalism.
  - [WB]: Write: “CHRIST IN YOU = READINESS”
- Call to Action/Decision: Choose daily surrender and intelligent Bible
  grounding—reject presumption and drift.
  - [WB]: Write: “CONTINUE” / “NOT MOVED”
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ “What one area will you specifically ask Christ
    to ‘move in’ and cleanse—so you can be presented ‘above reproach’?”
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Our only hope is Christ’s righteousness for us
  and in us—this is God’s victory in the Great Controversy.
  - [EGW]: “Our only ground of hope is in the righteousness of Christ imputed to
    us, and in that wrought by His Spirit working in and through us.” (SC 63).
  - [WB]: “SC 63 + 2 Cor. 5:21”
