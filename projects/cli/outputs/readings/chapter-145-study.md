### Q1. For what were all things created?

**“Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.” (Revelation 4:11)**

**Answer:**
The foundation of all true worship is the fact that God is our Creator. We worship Him because He made us, and we exist to fulfill His purpose.

1.  **Created for His Pleasure:** The word "pleasure" here signifies God’s will or desire. We were not created merely to exist, but to bring joy to the heart of God by reflecting His character of love.
2.  **The Basis of Authority:** Because God created us, He has a sovereign right to our service and affection. To refuse Him glory is to deny the very purpose of our existence.
3.  **Connection to the Sanctuary:** In the heavenly sanctuary, the twenty-four elders cast their crowns before the throne, acknowledging that all merit and power belong to the Creator. If the sinless angels acknowledge this, how much more should redeemed sinners?

**[ILL]**
Imagine a master sculptor who creates a vessel to hold pure water. If the vessel refuses to hold water or becomes filled with mud, it is not fulfilling the sculptor's "pleasure" or design. Man was created to be a vessel of God’s glory (His character). When we are filled with self, we defeat the purpose of our creation.

### Q2. Does man in his natural condition carry out the design of God?

**“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)**

**Answer:**
In our fallen state, humanity has failed to meet the Creator's design.

1.  **The Nature of Sin:** To "sin" is to miss the mark or to transgress the law of God (1 John 3:4). It is a deviation from the design of love and holiness.
2.  **Falling Short of Glory:** The "glory of God" represents His character (Exodus 33:18–19; 34:6–7). Man was made in God's image, but sin has marred that image. In our natural condition, we are selfish rather than loving, and rebellious rather than obedient.
3.  **Universal Need:** The verse says "all." There is no human being (save Christ) who naturally possesses the righteousness required to stand in God's presence.

* **Definition—Sin:** Any deviation from the known will of God; a transgression of His law (1 John 3:4).
* **Definition—Glory of God:** His character of perfect love, justice, and mercy.

**[ILL]**
If a ladder is too short to reach the roof of a burning building, it matters little if it is one foot short or ten feet short; it cannot save. All human efforts to reach heaven by our own works fall short. We need a bridge—a Saviour—to span the gulf between our condition and God’s glory.

---

### Q3. While in this state, what did the Lord do for us?

**“But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)**

**Answer:**
This is the heart of the Gospel and the foundation of Righteousness by Faith.

1.  **God’s Initiative:** God did not wait for us to become good before He loved us. He "commendeth" (demonstrates) His love while we were in open rebellion.
2.  **The Cost of Atonement:** "Christ died for us." The penalty of the broken law is death (Romans 6:23). Christ, the innocent Lamb of God, took that penalty upon Himself at the cross (the antitypical Altar of Burnt Offering).
3.  **Substitution:** He took our death so that we might have His life. He was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves (2 Corinthians 5:21).

* **Definition—Atonement:** The work of reconciliation where Christ pays the debt of sin and restores the relationship between God and man (Romans 5:11).

**[ILL]**
A rebel soldier is captured and sentenced to death. The King, instead of signing the execution order, steps down from the throne, takes the soldier's place, and dies in his stead. This is what Christ did. He did not die for friends, but for enemies, to make them friends.

### Q4. Through what is man permitted to come to repentance?

**“Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?” (Romans 2:4)**

**Answer:**
Repentance is not a work we do to earn God's favor; it is a response to realizing His goodness.

1.  **The Source of Repentance:** We cannot generate genuine repentance (sorrow for sin) on our own. It is the "goodness of God"—specifically the revelation of His love at the Cross—that melts the heart.
2.  **A Gift, Not a Purchase:** Many think they must repent *before* coming to Christ. But the Bible teaches that Christ is exalted to *give* repentance (Acts 5:31). We come to Him to receive the heart to repent.
3.  **The Danger of Delay:** To ignore God's "forbearance" (patience) is dangerous. It hardens the heart and creates a "treasure" of wrath.

* **Definition—Repentance:** A godly sorrow for sin that leads to a turning away from it; a change of mind and heart toward God (2 Corinthians 7:10).

**[ILL]**
The sun strikes a block of ice. The ice does not melt itself to invite the sun; the sun shines upon it, and the warmth causes it to melt. The goodness of God is the sun; our hard hearts are the ice.

### Q5. What does Christ become to those who accept Him?

**“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.” (Colossians 1:27)**

**Answer:**
The mystery of the Gospel is not just Christ *for* us (Justification) but Christ *in* us (Sanctification).

1.  **Indwelling Presence:** Righteousness by Faith means that Christ literally dwells in the heart of the believer by the Holy Spirit. He lives His life of obedience through us (Galatians 2:20).
2.  **The Hope of Glory:** The only hope we have of being restored to the "glory" (character) of God mentioned in Romans 3:23 is the presence of Jesus within. He is the pattern and the power.
3.  **Sanctuary Parallel:** Just as the Shekinah glory dwelt in the Most Holy Place of the earthly sanctuary, Christ desires to dwell in the soul temple of man.

* **Definition—Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit imparts the nature of Christ to the believer, transforming their character to be like His (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]**
A glove is lifeless and cannot pick up a Bible or shake a hand. But if a living hand is inserted into the glove, the glove moves and works. The glove takes no credit; the hand does the work. So it is with "Christ in you."

### Q6. When this grace is received, what will it cause one to do?

**“By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.” (Romans 5:2)**

**Answer:**
Accepting Christ’s righteousness brings stability and joy.

1.  **Standing in Grace:** The believer does not stand in their own merit or feelings, which change like the wind. They stand on the solid rock of God’s grace (unmerited favor).
2.  **Rejoicing in Hope:** Because our standing is based on Christ's finished work and His indwelling life, we can rejoice. We are not anxious about whether we are "good enough," because we trust in the One who is.
3.  **Access:** Through our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, we have direct access to the Father.

**[ILL]**
A man standing on a sliding pile of sand lives in fear of falling. A man standing on a granite cliff overlooks the storm with confidence. Grace is the granite cliff.

### Q7. On what condition are we to remain members of Christ's household?

**“But Christ as a son over His own house: whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.” (Hebrews 3:6)**

**Answer:**
Salvation is a relationship that must be maintained by continuous faith.

1.  **Conditional Security:** We are part of His house *if* we hold fast. Faith is not a one-time transaction; it is a daily gripping of Christ’s hand.
2.  **Holding Fast:** This implies there will be forces trying to pull us away—temptations, trials, and discouragement.
3.  **Confidence:** This confidence is not self-confidence, but confidence in the "Son over His own house." We trust His ability to keep us from falling (Jude 24).

* **Definition—Perseverance:** The daily act of surrendering the will to God and trusting in His power to save, continuing until the end.

**[ILL]**
A drowning man is thrown a rope. He is safe as long as he holds the rope. The strength of the rope saves him, not his own muscle, but he must not let go.

### Q8. How often, and for how much, should we render thanks to God?

**“Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Ephesians 5:20)**

**Answer:**
Thanksgiving is to be the atmosphere of the Christian life.

1.  **Always:** In times of plenty and in times of want.
2.  **For All Things:** Not just for the pleasant things, but for the discipline that shapes our character.
3.  **In His Name:** We offer praise through the merits of Jesus. Our praise is accepted because it ascends through our Intercessor.

**[ILL]**
A prism takes ordinary white light and breaks it into beautiful colors. A thankful heart acts like a prism—it takes the common circumstances of life and reveals God's beautiful mercy within them.

### Q9. The "all things" of the last text, includes our trials and disappointments. Why should we give thanks for them?

**“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God.” (Romans 8:28)**

**Answer:**
God is sovereign, and He uses even the difficulties of life to prepare us for heaven.

1.  **The Purpose of Trials:** God does not cause all evil, but He overrules it. He uses trials to burn away the dross of selfishness and to refine our faith (1 Peter 1:7).
2.  **Defined by Love:** This promise is specific "to them that love God." To the rebellious, trials may just harden; to the believer, they sanctify.
3.  **The Ultimate "Good":** The "good" here is not necessarily financial prosperity or health, but conformity to the image of Christ (see Romans 8:29).

**[ILL]**
The weaver sees the upper side of the tapestry, creating a beautiful pattern. The observer underneath sees only tangles and knots. In this life, we see the knots (trials); God sees the pattern He is weaving (character).

### Q10. What did Paul and Silas do when put in prison for their faith?

**“And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.” (Acts 16:25)**

**Answer:**
Paul and Silas demonstrated the victory of faith over circumstance.

1.  **Midnight Praise:** It is easy to sing in the sunlight; it requires genuine faith to sing in the "midnight" of suffering.
2.  **Public Witness:** "The prisoners heard them." How we react to trouble is our greatest testimony to the world. A complaining Christian repels; a praising Christian attracts.
3.  **Victory:** Their spirits were free even though their bodies were in chains.

**[ILL]**
A bird does not sing because it has an answer; it sings because it has a song. The Christian sings because Christ is the song in their heart, regardless of the cage they are in.

### Q11. How did the Lord show His pleasure at their course?

**“And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bands were loosed.” (Acts 16:26)**

**Answer:**
God responds to the voice of faith.

1.  **Power of Praise:** Praise opens the way for God to work. It is an act of faith that invites the presence of God, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (2 Corinthians 3:17).
2.  **Deliverance:** The physical earthquake illustrated a spiritual truth—the Gospel breaks the bonds of sin.
3.  **Salvation of Others:** This event led to the conversion of the jailer. Our praise in trials can be the key to someone else's salvation.

### Q12. After being imprisoned, and then beaten by order of the Jewish Sanhedrin, what did Peter and John do?

**“Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.” (Psalm 42:11)**

*(Note: While the question refers to the experience of the apostles in Acts 5:41, who "departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name," the user has provided Psalm 42:11 as the answer text. We apply the principle of the Psalm to their action.)*

**Answer:**
The apostles practiced the discipline of hope described by the Psalmist.

1.  **Talking to One's Soul:** Instead of listening to their fears or their pain, they spoke to their souls. They commanded their emotions to align with God's truth.
2.  **Choosing Hope:** They refused to be "cast down." They recognized that suffering for Christ is a badge of honor, not a reason for despair.
3.  **Health of the Countenance:** A praising heart changes the very face of a person. The apostles' countenances revealed the presence of Jesus (Acts 4:13).

**[ILL]**
When a captain encounters a storm, he does not let the ship drift; he sets the sails and holds the rudder firm. "Hope thou in God" is setting the rudder against the waves of discouragement.

### Q13. When properly offered, what does praise to God become?

**"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth Me; and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God." (Psalm 50:23)**

**Answer:**
True praise is inextricably partial to obedience.

1.  **Glorifying God:** Praise acknowledges God’s character. It vindicates God against Satan's charges that God is severe or unjust.
2.  **Ordered Conversation:** The word "conversation" in KJV means "lifestyle" or "conduct." Genuine praise is not just lip service; it results in a life ordered according to God’s law.
3.  **Seeing Salvation:** Obedience and praise clear the spiritual vision, allowing us to see and experience God's delivering power.

**[ILL]**
A roadmap is useless if we do not follow it. Praising the map-maker while driving off a cliff is hypocrisy. True praise involves following the path the Master has set.

---

### Q14. Should our praise to God be confined to our secret devotions?

**“My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear Him.” (Psalm 22:25)**

**Answer:**
No, praise is also a public duty.

1.  **The Great Congregation:** We are called to acknowledge God before men. This strengthens the church and serves as a witness to the world.
2.  **Paying Vows:** Public baptism, testimony, and tithe-paying are ways we "pay our vows" and tangibly express our thanksgiving.
3.  **Overcoming Shame:** Jesus is not ashamed to call us brethren (Hebrews 2:11); we should not be ashamed to call Him Lord before the congregation.

---

### Q15. Why ought we thus to praise God?

**“My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad." (Psalm 34:2) "And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, which were come against Judah: and they were smitten.” (2 Chronicles 20:22)**

**Answer:**
Praise encourages the brethren and defeats the enemy.

1.  **Encouragement:** When we boast in the Lord (not in ourselves), the "humble" (struggling saints) hear it and realize that if God did it for us, He can do it for them.
2.  **Spiritual Warfare:** In the story of Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 20), the choir went *before* the army. Praise is a weapon. It asserts victory before the battle is physically won.
3.  **Dispersing Darkness:** Satan cannot endure the sound of genuine praise to God. It drives away his dark suggestions.

**[ILL]**
Fog can cover a valley and obscure the light. But when the sun rises in strength, the fog burns away. Praise is the rising sun that burns away the fog of fear and doubt.

### Q16. How should one approach God in prayer?

**“Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.” (Philippians 4:6; see also Colossians 4:2)**

**Answer:**
We must approach God with trust and gratitude, replacing anxiety with prayer.

1.  **Be Careful for Nothing:** "Careful" here means "anxious" or "full of care." Worry implies that God is not in control.
2.  **Supplication with Thanksgiving:** We should not just ask (supplication) but also thank Him for what He has already done and for the answer He will give. This combines petition with faith.
3.  **The Exchange:** We give God our cares; He gives us His peace (v. 7).

* **Definition—Supplication:** An earnest, humble, and persistent petition for a specific need.

**[ILL]**
A child asks a loving father for bread. The child does not worry or beg in panic; he asks expecting to receive, perhaps thanking his father even before the bread is in his hand.

### Q17. What is the will of God in this matter concerning us?

**“In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18)**

**Answer:**
Gratitude is a divine command and a necessity for spiritual health.

1.  **In Everything:** Not necessarily *for* the evil act itself, but *in* the situation, knowing God is with us.
2.  **God’s Will:** Many ask, "What is God's will for my life?" Here is a clear answer: To cultivate a thankful heart. A thankful heart is a heart that trusts in the Righteousness of Christ rather than its own merits.
3.  **Sanctification:** Gratitude cures pride. Pride says, "I deserve better." Gratitude says, "I have received better than I deserve through Christ."

---

### Q18. What has our Saviour taught us to pray?

**"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven." (Matthew 6:10)**

**Answer:**
True prayer is the surrender of our will to God’s.

1.  **Submission:** The highest form of worship is obedience. We pray that our lives on earth may reflect the perfect obedience of the angels in heaven.
2.  **Harmony with Law:** God’s will is expressed in His law. To pray "Thy will be done" is to pray for the writing of the law upon our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).
3.  **The Pattern of Jesus:** In Gethsemane, Jesus prayed, "Not my will, but thine, be done." This is the path to victory.

**[ILL]**
A musician in an orchestra does not play whatever tune he likes. He watches the conductor and plays the score exactly as written. When the whole earth does God's will as heaven does, there will be universal harmony.

### Q19. What does David exhort all to do?

**"O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together." (Psalm 34:3)**

**Answer:**
We are called to corporate worship and unity in praise.

1.  **Magnify:** We cannot make God bigger, but we can make our *perception* of Him bigger. We act as a magnifying glass, helping others see the greatness of God.
2.  **Together:** There is special power in united prayer and praise. It binds hearts together and to God.

### Q20. What good example did he set which is worthy of imitation by us when with our brethren?

**“Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul.” (Psalm 66:16)**

**Answer:**
Personal testimony of God's internal work is powerful.

1.  **Personal Experience:** David does not just speak of theology; he speaks of experience. "What He hath done for *my* soul."
2.  **Focus on God:** The testimony is not about how great David is, but what *God* has done. This is the essence of Righteousness by Faith—it is all His work.
3.  **Witnessing:** We are the "epistles of Christ" (2 Corinthians 3:2-3). People read our lives to learn about God.

**[ILL]**
A man healed of a deadly disease does not need to be a doctor to tell others about the cure. He simply points to the Physician and says, "I was sick, and He healed me."

### Q21. What became of those, anciently, who were not thankful?

**“Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.” (Romans 1:21)**

**Answer:**
Ingratitude is the first step into apostasy and darkness.

1.  **The Downward Spiral:** First, they stopped being thankful. Then, they became vain (empty) in their thinking. Finally, their hearts were darkened.
2.  **Idolatry:** When man stops worshipping the Creator, he begins worshipping the creature (himself or idols).
3.  **The Shield of Gratitude:** Thankfulness protects the mind from error. It keeps us humble and aware of our dependence on God.

**[ILL]**
If you close the shutters of a house, the inside becomes dark. God is the light. Ingratitude is the act of closing the shutters. God does not withdraw; we shut Him out, and darkness is the inevitable result.

### Q22. What signal deliverance was once wrought for God's people when they offered praise to Him?

**NOTE. - Read 2 Chronicles 20:1-30. It is a most thrilling account of deliverance from the enemies of God and His people.**

**Answer:**
The deliverance of Judah under King Jehoshaphat demonstrates that the battle belongs to the Lord.

1.  **The Crisis:** A "great multitude" came against God's people. They were powerless to save themselves (v. 12).
2.  **The Response:** They sought the Lord, fasted, and admitted their helplessness. "Our eyes are upon thee."
3.  **The Strategy:** They appointed singers to praise the beauty of holiness *before* the army.
4.  **The Result:** "When they began to sing and to praise," the Lord set ambushments. The enemies destroyed one another. Judah did not even have to fight; they only gathered the spoil.
5.  **Practical Application:** When we face the "multitude" of temptations or trials, our victory comes not by our own struggle, but by standing still and seeing the salvation of the Lord, praising Him for the victory He has already secured in Christ.

**[ILL]**
Imagine an army marching into battle not with swords drawn, but with harps playing. This defies human logic, but it defines spiritual victory. Faith is the victory that overcomes the world (1 John 5:4).
