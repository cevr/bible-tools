### Q1. At the death of Christ, what miracle signified that the priestly work of the earthly sanctuary was finished?

> “Jesus, when He had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And,
> behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom."
> Matt. 27:50, 51.

**Answer:** The tearing of the temple veil was a divine signal that the earthly
sacrificial system had met its fulfillment. For centuries, the heavy curtain
separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, barring the way to the
visible presence of God (the Shekinah glory). Only the High Priest could enter,
and that only once a year.

When Christ died:

1.  **The Type met the Antitype:** The earthly lamb was a shadow; Christ was the
    substance. When the true "Lamb of God" died, the shadow was no longer
    needed.
2.  **The Way was Opened:** The tearing "from top to bottom" signified that God
    Himself had removed the barrier. No longer do we need human priests to
    mediate for us; the way to the Father is open through Jesus.
3.  **The End of Levitical Exclusivity:** The earthly sanctuary lost its
    sacredness. It was now merely a building; the true work of atonement shifted
    to the heavenly realm.

- **Definition—Type and Antitype:** In theology, a "type" is a divinely
  appointed symbol or foreshadowing (like the sacrificial lamb). The "antitype"
  is the reality or fulfillment of that symbol (Christ Himself).

[ILL] Imagine a father who keeps a photograph of his son who is away at war. He
cherishes the photo (the type). But when the son returns home and walks through
the door (the antitype), the father puts the photo down to embrace the real
person. To continue talking to the photo when the son is standing there would be
foolish. The earthly sanctuary was the photo; Christ is the Son.

### Q2. Where has the work of the sanctuary been conducted since the ascension of Christ?

> “Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a High
> Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
> heavens." Heb. 8:1.

**Answer:** Since the ascension, the center of the plan of salvation is in
heaven. The Bible is literal, not merely metaphorical, regarding this point.
Just as there was a literal sanctuary on earth, there is a literal, physical
reality in heaven where God rules and where Christ ministers.

- **Christ's Location:** He is at the "right hand" of the Father, a position of
  authority and favor.
- **Christ's Activity:** He is not inactive; He is working as our High Priest,
  applying the benefits of His sacrifice to individual believers who come to Him
  by faith (Hebrews 7:25).

- **Definition—High Priest:** The mediator who represents the people before God.
  In the earthly system, he carried the blood of the sacrifice into the
  sanctuary. In heaven, Christ presents His own blood (His merits and perfect
  life) on our behalf.

---

### Q3. Who is this high priest?

> “But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and
> more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands." Heb. 9:11.

**Answer:** Our High Priest is Jesus Christ. Unlike the sons of Aaron, who were
sinful men subject to death, Christ is the sinless, eternal Son of God.

- **"Good things to come":** The earthly priests dealt with shadows; Christ
  deals with the eternal realities—actual cleansing from sin, the blotting out
  of the record of rebellion, and the restoration of face-to-face communion with
  God.
- **"Not made with hands":** The heavenly sanctuary is not a human construction.
  It is the very dwelling place of God, the command center of the universe.

[ILL] If you are on trial for your life, you do not want a lawyer who is also a
criminal and might die before the verdict is read. You want an advocate who has
never lost a case, who is friends with the Judge, and who lives forever to
ensure your freedom. That is Jesus, our High Priest.

### Q4. Who erected this heavenly tabernacle, of which Christ is the minister?

> “A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord
> pitched, and not man." Heb. 8:2.

**Answer:** The heavenly sanctuary was established by God Himself.

1.  **The Original:** The tabernacle Moses built in the wilderness was a copy.
    The sanctuary in heaven is the original.
2.  **The Scale:** The earthly was small and portable; the heavenly is vast
    enough to accommodate the millions of angels and the throne of the Infinite
    God (Daniel 7:9–10).
3.  **The Minister:** Christ is the _Leitourgos_ (Minister/Public Servant) of
    this true temple. His ministry is essential to our salvation. The death on
    the cross provided the _sacrifice_, but the ministry in heaven provides the
    _intercession_. Both are necessary.

---

### Q5. Could Christ be a priest while He was on earth, and before the old priesthood ceased?

> “For if He were on earth, He should not be a priest, seeing that there are
> priests that offer gifts according to the law." Heb 8:4.

**Answer:** No. While on earth, Jesus could not legally be a priest under the
Mosaic Law.

- **Tribal Lineage:** The earthly law restricted the priesthood to the tribe of
  Levi and the family of Aaron. Jesus was from the tribe of Judah (Hebrews
  7:14).
- **Separation of Duties:** On earth, Jesus acted as the _Sacrifice_ (the Lamb)
  and the _Prophet_ (the Teacher). He could only enter His priestly office
  _after_ He had offered the sacrifice (His death) and ascended to the true
  Sanctuary in heaven.
- **A New Order:** Christ is a priest "after the order of Melchizedek" (Psalm
  110:4)—a priesthood that predates and supersedes the Levitical order.

---

### Q6. What did the service of the earthly priests signify?

> “There are priests that offer gifts according to the law: who serve unto the
> example and shadow of heavenly things." Heb. 8:4, 5.

**Answer:** The earthly service was an object lesson—a "shadow" designed to
teach humanity how God deals with sin.

- **The Shadow:** A shadow has no substance of its own; it only exists because
  of the reality casting it. The earthly rituals (blood, incense, washing) had
  no power to save in themselves (Hebrews 10:4). Their value lay only in
  pointing the worshiper's faith to the coming Messiah.
- **The Lesson:** The daily sacrifices taught that sin results in death
  (justification). The daily washing and incense taught that we need constant
  cleansing and prayer (sanctification). The yearly Day of Atonement taught that
  God will eventually judge and eradicate sin from the universe (judgment).

- **Definition—Sanctification:** The process of being made holy. It is the work
  of God's grace within the believer, transforming the character to be like
  Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

---

### Q7. What was the earthly sanctuary designed to be?

> “The way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first
> tabernacle was yet standing: which was a figure for the time then present."
> Heb. 9:8, 9.

**Answer:** It was a "figure" (parable) for that specific era.

- **A Teaching Tool:** God used the earthly sanctuary to teach the ABCs of
  salvation to a world darkened by sin. It showed that God is holy, man is
  sinful, and a mediator is required for reconciliation.
- **Limited Access:** In the earthly "figure," the common people could never
  enter the sanctuary, and even the priests could not enter the Most Holy Place
  (save the High Priest once a year). This illustrated that the way to full,
  open fellowship with God was not yet fully revealed until Christ completed His
  work.

---

### Q8. Are there different apartments of the heavenly sanctuary in which Christ ministers?

> “For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the
> figures of the true." Heb. 9:24.

**Answer:** Yes. The text uses the plural "holy places" (Greek: _hagia_), and
speaks of the earthly as "figures" (plural) of the true.

1.  **Structural Parallel:** Just as the earthly had a Holy Place and a Most
    Holy Place, the heavenly sanctuary has corresponding phases of ministry.
2.  **Two Phases of Ministry:**
    - **Daily:** In the first apartment (Holy Place), Christ intercedes for us,
      offering the merit of His blood and the prayers of the saints (represented
      by incense). This secures our forgiveness and acceptance (Revelation
      8:3–4).
    - **Yearly (Antitypical):** In the second apartment (Most Holy Place),
      Christ performs the work of judgment and cleansing—the final removal of
      sin (Daniel 7:10; Revelation 11:19).

---

### Q9. Does the heavenly sanctuary contain an ark of the testament (covenant)?

> "And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple
> the ark of His testament." Rev. 11:19.

**Answer:** Yes. The book of Revelation, describing a scene in the heavenly
temple under the sounding of the seventh trumpet, reveals the "ark of His
testament."

- **The Contents:** In the earthly ark, the Ten Commandments (the testimony)
  were stored. If the earthly was a copy of the heavenly, then the original Ten
  Commandments—God's immutable standard of righteousness—exist in heaven.
- **The Significance:** This proves that the Law of God was not abolished at the
  cross. It remains beneath the Mercy Seat in heaven. The Judgment is based on
  this Law (James 2:12).
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** We cannot keep this holy Law in our own
  strength. We need the blood on the Mercy Seat (justification) and the writing
  of the Law in our hearts by the Spirit (sanctification/New Covenant - Hebrews
  8:10).

---

### Q10. The earthly sanctuary was cleansed by a high priest Is it necessary for the heavenly sanctuary also to come to a time of cleansing, or purifying?

> “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should
> be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better
> sacrifices than these." Heb. 9:23.

**Answer:** Yes, Scripture explicitly states it was "necessary" for the heavenly
things to be purified (cleansed).

- **Why cleanse heaven?** Heaven itself is perfect, but the _record_ of the sins
  of God's people is preserved there. When we confess our sins, they are
  transferred, by faith, to Christ and recorded in the sanctuary books.
- **The Day of Atonement:** In the earthly type, the sanctuary was "dirty"
  because the sins of the people were transferred into it all year long. On the
  Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), the sanctuary was cleansed.
- **The Antitype:** Before Christ returns, there must be a work of judgment to
  examine the books, blot out the sins of the righteous, and formally separate
  sin from God's people forever. This is the "cleansing of the sanctuary."

- **Definition—Atonement:** In the SDA understanding, this includes both the
  sacrificial act (the Cross) and the priestly application of that sacrifice
  (Ministry in the Sanctuary). The "Day of Atonement" refers specifically to the
  final work of judgment.

---

### Q11. From what will it be cleansed, or purified?

> “Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest entereth into
> the holy place every year with the blood of others; for then must He often
> have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of
> the world hath He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself." Heb.
> 9:25, 26.

**Answer:** It is cleansed from the record of **sin**.

- **Putting Away Sin:** The verse contrasts the repeated yearly sacrifices with
  Christ's one-time sacrifice, but the _objective_ is the same: to "put away
  sin."
- **The Record:** Sins are recorded in heaven (Jeremiah 2:22; Revelation 20:12).
  Forgiveness covers them, but the final cleansing "blots them out" (Acts 3:19).
  This cleansing vindicates God's justice—showing that those who are saved have
  truly entered into a relationship with Christ and have been "overcomers"
  (Revelation 3:5).

[ILL] A merchant keeps a ledger of debts (the record of sin). When a customer
pays (confession/forgiveness), the merchant might write "Paid" next to the debt.
But the record of the transaction remains in the book. At the end of the fiscal
year, the accounts are finalized and the old debts are closed out completely so
a new year can begin. The cleansing of the sanctuary is the final audit and
closing of the books of sin.

---

### Q12. When the earthly high priest came out to the people after making the atonement, how did he transfer the sins of the people from himself?

> “And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and
> confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their
> transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat."
> Lev. 16:21.

**Answer:** This occurred _after_ the High Priest had finished the work of
reconciliation in the Most Holy Place.

1.  **The Azazel Goat:** He came out and placed his hands on the "scapegoat"
    (Azazel).
2.  **Transfer of Guilt:** He confessed the sins of Israel—which had already
    been atoned for by the Lord's goat—onto the head of the live goat.
3.  **Banishment:** This goat was not killed as a sacrifice; it was sent away
    alive into the wilderness to die alone, taking the sins away from the camp
    forever.

---

### Q13. How will it be when Christ has finished the atonement for his people?

> “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look
> for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation." Heb.
> 9:28.

**Answer:** When Christ finishes His work in the heavenly sanctuary:

1.  **Probation Closes:** He ceases His intercession. The sins of the righteous
    have been blotted out.
2.  **Placement on Satan:** Christ will place the responsibility for the sins of
    the redeemed upon Satan (the antitypical Scapegoat). Satan is the originator
    of sin and the tempter; while Christ paid the penalty for our guilt
    (redemption), justice demands that the instigator of evil bear the final
    consequence of his rebellion.
3.  **Without Sin:** When Christ returns, He does not come to deal with sin
    again (as a sin-bearer). He comes "without sin"—apart from the sin
    problem—to rescue His waiting people.

- **Clarification:** Satan does not save us. The scapegoat was not the
  sacrifice. Christ's blood alone saves. Satan merely bears the final punishment
  for the evil he caused, after the saints are saved.

---

### Q14. When will the sins of the righteous be blotted out?

> "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,
> when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord." Acts
> 3:19.

**Answer:** The "blotting out" of sins is a specific event linked to the "times
of refreshing" (the Latter Rain) and the final judgment work.

- **Prerequisites:** Repentance and Conversion. To have sins blotted out, they
  must first be confessed and forsaken.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot hide one cherished sin. The blotting out
  implies a people who have, by faith, allowed Christ to give them victory over
  every known sin. The "Latter Rain" of the Holy Spirit cannot fall on hearts
  filled with selfishness or rebellion.

---

### Q15. What immediately follows the blotting out of sins?

> “And He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the
> heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things." Acts
> 3:20, 21.

**Answer:** The Second Coming of Jesus.

- **Sequence:** First, the sanctuary is cleansed (judgment/blotting out). Then,
  the mandate is given for Christ to return ("He shall send Jesus").
- **Restitution:** This is the restoration of the earth to its Edenic beauty and
  the restoration of man to God's presence.

---

### Q16. While Christ as high priest is still before the Father, what is given Him?

> “One like the Son of man came... to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him
> near before Him. And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
> that all people, nations, and languages, should serve Him." Dan. 7:13, 14.

**Answer:** At the conclusion of the judgment (which Daniel 7 describes), Christ
receives His kingdom.

- **The Coronation:** He changes His role from High Priest to King of Kings.
- **The Kingdom:** This is not just a spiritual kingdom in the heart, but a
  literal, eternal dominion that will displace all earthly governments. He
  receives the subjects (His people) who have been vindicated in the judgment.

---

### Q17. And when He comes to earth; what is His purpose?

> “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
> of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise
> first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
> them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we everbe with
> the Lord." 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

**Answer:** His purpose is to gather the subjects of His new kingdom.

1.  **Resurrection:** To wake the "dead in Christ."
2.  **Translation:** To catch up the living righteous.
3.  **Reunion:** To take them "in the clouds" (away from the earth) to the
    Father's house (John 14:1–3).

---

### Q18. But before any are thus raised at Christ's coming, what decision must be rendered in their cases?

> “But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the
> resurrection from the dead." Luke 20:35.

**Answer:** A decision of "worthiness."

- **Investigative Judgment:** Before the resurrection occurs, there must be a
  determination of _who_ is to be resurrected. Not everyone rises to life (some
  rise to damnation, see John 5:29). Therefore, a judgment must take place
  _before_ the Second Coming to distinguish the wheat from the tares.
- **Accounted Worthy:** This worthiness is not based on human merit, for all
  have sinned. It is based on:
  1.  Faith in Jesus' atoning blood (Justification).
  2.  A life that demonstrates that faith through obedience (Sanctification).
  - "The robe of Christ's righteousness... can only be worn by those who have
    surrendered their will to God."

---

### Q19. Is there a specified time for the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary?

> “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
> sanctuary be cleansed." Dan. 8:14.

**Answer:** Yes, God set a specific prophetic time: 2,300 prophetic days.

- **Prophetic Time:** In Bible prophecy, a day represents a literal year
  (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). This is a period of 2,300 years.
- **The Event:** At the end of this vast period, the "cleansing" (the
  antitypical Day of Atonement/Judgment) begins. This marks the beginning of the
  final phase of Christ's ministry.

---

### Q20. How may one know that this does not refer to the earthly sanctuary?

> “He said unto me, Understand, a son of man: for at the time of the end shall
> be the vision." Dan. 8:17.

**Answer:** The angel Gabriel explicitly stated that the vision applies to "the
time of the end."

- **Historical Context:** The earthly sanctuary was destroyed by the Romans in
  A.D. 70. The 2,300-year prophecy (starting in 457 B.C. with the decree to
  restore Jerusalem) extends to **1844 A.D.**
- **Conclusion:** Since the earthly temple no longer existed in 1844, the
  prophecy must refer to the _Heavenly Sanctuary_. In 1844, Christ entered the
  Most Holy Place to begin the work of investigative judgment, preparing a
  people for His return.

[ILL] If a navigation app says, "You will arrive at your destination at 5:00
PM," and at 5:00 PM you are not at the old house where you used to live, but
standing in front of a new mansion, you know the destination was the mansion.
The prophecy points to 1844. Since the earthly temple was gone, the
"destination" of the prophecy is the Temple in Heaven.
