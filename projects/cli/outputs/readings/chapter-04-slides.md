## Slide 1 – Q1: The Power of the Word
- **Question:** How powerful is the Word of God when brought into contact with one's life?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 4:12 – “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Living Power and Conviction
- **It is "Quick" (Living):**
    - The Bible contains life, not just history.
    - Receiving it by faith imparts the life of Christ.
    - John 6:63 – “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”
    - It is the seed of the new birth (1 Peter 1:23 – “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”).
- **The Sword and the Sanctuary:**
    - Before the High Priest can heal, the “sword” must cut away self-deception.
    - **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the sacrifice had to be slain before atonement could be made, the “old man” of sin must be slain by the Word (Romans 6:6 – “Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him…”).
- **Discernment and Sanctification:**
    - The Word acts as a mirror to reveal secret sins (Jeremiah 17:9–10).
    - This is essential for **Sanctification**: The work of God’s free grace, whereby we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Surgeon’s Scalpel:**
    - Imagine a surgeon removing a deep-seated tumor to save a life.
    - The scalpel must be sharp to cut accurately between healthy and diseased tissue.
    - If the knife is dull, it causes damage without healing.
    - The Word of God is that sharp scalpel.
    - It hurts to have pride cut away, but it is the “wound of a friend” that leads to healing (Proverbs 27:6 – “Faithful are the wounds of a friend…”).

## Slide 4 – Q2: Peter’s Confession
- **Question:** What was Peter constrained to say about Christ's words?
- **Key Text:** John 6:68 – “Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Source of Life
- **The Only Source:**
    - Eternal life is not inherent in man; it is found only in the Son.
    - 1 John 5:11–12 – “And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.”
- **Total Dependence (Sanctuary Connection):**
    - We do not look to earthly priests or powers.
    - We look to the **High Priest** in the heavenly sanctuary, Jesus Christ (Hebrews 8:1 – “We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens…”).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
    - We cannot generate righteousness ourselves.
    - We must go to Him who “has the words,” receiving His promises by faith.
    - Isaiah 55:11 – “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void…”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Diver’s Air Line:**
    - A diver deep underwater relies entirely on the air line connected to the surface.
    - If he disconnects to find air elsewhere, he dies.
    - Similarly, the Christian is connected to heaven by the Word of Christ.
    - To turn away from His words to human traditions is to cut the air line.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Commandment and Life
- **Question:** What did Jesus declare regarding His Father's commandment?
- **Key Text:** John 12:50 – “And I know that His commandment is life everlasting.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Law and Gospel Harmony
- **The Law is Life:**
    - The Ten Commandments are a transcript of God’s character of love.
    - God gave the law to protect life, not to burden it (Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”).
- **Harmony with the Gospel:**
    - The Gospel does not abolish the commandment; it restores the power to *keep* it through the Spirit (Romans 8:3–4).
- **The New Covenant Promise:**
    - God promises to write the law on our hearts.
    - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make… I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts…”
    - When the law is internal, obedience is a delight (Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Train Tracks:**
    - Think of a train. The tracks are the “commandments” directing its path.
    - Are the tracks a restriction? No, they are the condition of its freedom and speed.
    - If the train jumps the tracks to be “free,” the result is ruin.
    - God’s law is the track upon which the believer’s life runs smoothly to eternity.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Lesson from the Manna
- **Question:** What great truth did God wish to teach us, when He gave the daily manna to feed the children of Israel?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 8:3 – “And He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna… that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Dependence and Faith
- **Dependence on the Word:**
    - Physical manna was a type (symbol). Without the Word, our souls wither.
- **"Every Word":**
    - We are not to pick and choose commandments.
    - Character requires submission to *every* word God has spoken.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
    - God allowed hunger to teach helplessness.
    - True faith realizes we have no spiritual food in ourselves.
    - Matthew 5:6 – “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration
- ** The Prescription Dosage:**
    - A prescription often comes with a specific dosage.
    - If a patient takes only half the ingredients, or takes it once a month instead of daily, the cure will not work.
    - We cannot expect spiritual victory if we neglect the daily “dosage” of God’s instruction.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Feeding on the Word
- **Question:** What happens when we feed upon the true, heavenly manna?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 15:16 – “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, O Lord God of hosts.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Internalization and Justification
- **Internalization ("I did eat them"):**
    - Reading is not enough; we must meditate until the Word becomes part of us.
    - As food builds tissue, the Word builds character.
- **Joy and Rejoicing:**
    - The Christian finds abiding joy in God’s promises.
    - Psalm 119:103 – “How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!”
- **Identity and Justification:**
    - We are "called by Thy name." This is **Justification**.
    - We are covered by His name and merit; the Father sees the Son in us.
    - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration
- **Eating vs. Reading the Menu:**
    - If a person is starving, looking at a picture of a banquet will not help.
    - Reading a menu will not sustain life.
    - They must take the food and swallow it.
    - Having a Bible on the shelf does not feed the soul; we must "digest" its meaning by faith.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Jesus and the Word
- **Question:** What reference did Jesus make to this same life-giving manna?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 4:4 – “But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Weapon of Victory
- **Using "It is Written":**
    - Jesus overcame Satan not by using divine power, but by using the Word.
    - He met the tempter with Scripture.
- **Example for Humanity:**
    - Jesus showed that a human, filled with the Spirit and relying on the Word, can resist temptation.
    - He condemned sin in the flesh (Romans 8:3 – “God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.”).
- **Spiritual Priority:**
    - Obedience to God is more necessary than physical life itself.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Soldier’s Sword:**
    - A soldier in battle does not invent a new weapon on the spot.
    - He uses the sword he has been trained with.
    - When temptation strikes (pride, appetite, anger), we must instantly wield the specific “It is written” for that situation.

## Slide 19 – Q7: God’s Will as Food
- **Question:** How did God's will for Christ's life become His food?
- **Key Text:** John 4:34 – “Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His work.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Obedience and Strength
- **Obedience as Sustenance:**
    - Doing God’s will refreshes the spirit.
    - Supernatural strength comes to the believer who obeys in faith (Isaiah 40:31 – “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength…”).
- **Finishing the Work (Atonement):**
    - Christ’s "meat" was to live a perfect life and offer a perfect sacrifice.
- **Rest for the Soul:**
    - When we align our will with God’s, the struggle ceases.
    - Matthew 11:29 – “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me… and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Musician:**
    - A musician who loves their art may practice for hours yet feel energized, not exhausted.
    - They are doing what they love.
    - When God’s law is written in the heart (Hebrews 8:10), doing His will becomes our passion and energy.

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Revealer of God
- **Question:** What name is given to Jesus, since He was the Revealer of God's thought to mankind?
- **Key Text:**
    - John 1:1 – “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God.”
    - Revelation 19:13 – “And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and His name is called The Word of God.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: The Living Word
- **Medium of Communication:**
    - A “word” is a thought made audible. God’s thoughts are revealed in Christ.
    - John 14:9 – “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father…”
- **The Creator:**
    - Psalm 33:6 – “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made…”
- **The Victor in the Great Controversy:**
    - In Revelation 19, the "Word of God" judges and makes war against sin.
    - The Word triumphs over Satan’s rebellion.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration
- **Thought vs. Speech:**
    - If you have a thought in your mind, no one knows it.
    - If you speak, your thought enters another person's mind.
    - Jesus is God “speaking” Himself to humanity, so we can know His heart.

## Slide 25 – Q9: The Word Made Flesh
- **Question:** What did this Word become?
- **Key Text:** John 1:14 – “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Incarnation and Sanctuary
- **Tabernacling Among Us:**
    - "Dwelt" implies "pitched His tent."
    - **Sanctuary Connection:** Christ is the true Tabernacle where God meets man (Hebrews 9:11 – “But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle…”).
- **Partaking of Flesh:**
    - He took our fallen nature but without sin, bridging the gap.
    - Hebrews 2:14 – “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same…”
- **Jacob’s Ladder:**
    - Christ is the ladder connecting earth to heaven (Genesis 28:12; John 1:51).

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration
- **The King and the Peasants:**
    - A king in a castle cannot fully understand his suffering subjects.
    - But if the king puts on peasant clothes, lives in their huts, and eats their food, he understands.
    - Jesus did more: He became one of us to save us.

## Slide 28 – Q10: Life and Light
- **Question:** What was in this Word that we so much need?
- **Key Text:** John 1:4 – “In Him was life; and the life was the light of men.”

## Slide 29 – Q10: Original Life and Righteousness
- **Original Life:**
    - In Christ is life “original, unborrowed, underived.”
    - He has power to resurrect the spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1).
- **Life as Light:**
    - This life brings moral clarity, exposing sin and revealing righteousness.
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
    - We need a new principle of life (regeneration).
    - This comes from being in Christ, like a branch in the vine.
    - John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit…”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Flashlight:**
    - A flashlight with dead batteries is useless, even if the bulb is perfect.
    - The human soul is like that flashlight.
    - Without the “batteries”—the life of Christ within—we give no light to the world.

## Slide 31 – Q11: The Word of Life
- **Question:** What is Jesus therefore also called?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:1 – “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life.”

## Slide 32 – Q11: Tangible Reality
- **Historical Reality:**
    - The disciples "handled" Him. Our faith is based on fact, not myth.
- **Experiential Faith:**
    - We must "touch" Him spiritually by faith.
    - Like the woman who touched the hem of His garment and drew power (Mark 5:34 – “Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole…”).
- **Resurrection Power:**
    - As the Word of Life, He guarantees our resurrection.
    - 1 Thessalonians 4:14 – “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.”

## Slide 33 – Q12: The Bread of Life
- **Question:** What did Jesus declare Himself to be?
- **Key Text:** John 6:35 – “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst.”

## Slide 34 – Q12: Satisfaction and Sanctuary
- **True Satisfaction:**
    - The world’s "bread" (wealth, fame) does not satisfy (Isaiah 55:2).
    - Only Christ fills the void.
- **Sanctuary Type (The Shewbread):**
    - In the Holy Place, the **Table of Shewbread** stood before God (Leviticus 24:5–9).
    - Jesus is the true "Bread of the Presence," sustaining His people daily.
- **The Invitation:**
    - Righteousness is not achieved by works, but by coming to a Person.

## Slide 35 – Q12: Illustration
- **Salt Water vs. Living Water:**
    - A man trying to quench thirst with salt water only becomes thirstier.
    - Sin is salt water.
    - Jesus is the fresh, living spring.
    - Drinking of Him ends the craving for the world.

## Slide 36 – Q13: Partaking and Living
- **Question:** What did He say would be given to those that partook of this God-given bread?
- **Key Text:** John 6:57, 58 – “As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: so He that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me. This is that bread which came down from heaven… he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.”

## Slide 37 – Q13: Union and Atonement
- **Union with God:**
    - Jesus lived by total dependence on the Father.
    - We are to live by total dependence on Jesus.
- **At-one-ment:**
    - **Definition:** The condition of being at one with God.
    - Through eating the Bread of Life, the believer becomes one with Christ (John 17:23 – “I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one…”).
- **Transformation:**
    - As we feed on His truth, we are changed into His image.
    - 2 Corinthians 3:18 – “But we all… are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”

## Slide 38 – Q14: Eating His Flesh
- **Question:** What did Jesus really mean when He said that we should eat His flesh?
- **Key Text:** John 6:63 – “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”

## Slide 39 – Q14: Spirit and Life
- **Word = Spirit = Life:**
    - The life of Christ is in His teachings and promises.
    - Believing a promise conveys the Spirit's power.
- **The Flesh Profiteth Nothing:**
    - Human works and legalism cannot produce righteousness.
    - Isaiah 64:6 – “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags…”
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
    - Receiving the Word by faith is receiving the very character of God.

## Slide 40 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Seed:**
    - A seed looks like a dry, dead pebble.
    - But inside is a germ of life with the DNA of the plant.
    - The Word of God is the seed (Luke 8:11 – “The seed is the word of God.”).
    - When planted in the heart, it releases Christ’s life and produces the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23).

## Slide 41 – Q15: Tasting the Future
- **Question:** What is it that God will let us taste right now?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 6:5 – “And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come.”

## Slide 42 – Q15: Foretaste and Preparation
- **Tasting the Future:**
    - We can experience the peace and victory of heaven now.
    - It is a "down payment" of our inheritance (Ephesians 1:14).
- **Preparation for Translation:**
    - Those who see Christ return (the 144,000) must have His character reproduced in them.
    - They must taste victory over sin *now* (Revelation 14:5 – “And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.”).
- **The Good Word:**
    - We taste God's promises by claiming them in trial and finding them true.

## Slide 43 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Wedding Banquet Tasting:**
    - Before a banquet, cooks taste the food to ensure perfection.
    - In the Christian life, the Holy Spirit gives us a “foretaste” of heaven.
    - We get a sample of heaven’s peace in our hearts today.

## Slide 44 – Q16: Experience Over Theory
- **Question:** Tasting it, what do we learn?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 34:8 – “O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in Him.”

## Slide 45 – Q16: Trust and Character
- **Experience over Theory:**
    - You cannot know a fruit by a painting; you must bite into it.
    - The believer *knows* God is good through experience.
- **The Third Angel’s Message:**
    - The “blessed” man trusts entirely in God.
    - This links to the patience of the saints and the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12).
- **Refuting Satan’s Lies:**
    - Satan portrays God as severe. The Word reveals He is “abundant in goodness and truth” (Exodus 34:6).

## Slide 46 – Q17: Daily Dependence
- **Question:** Does God want us to ask for this Bread daily?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 6:11 – “Give us this day our daily bread.”

## Slide 47 – Q17: Fresh Grace
- **No Stored Manna:**
    - In the wilderness, hoarding manna bred worms (Exodus 16:20).
    - We cannot live on yesterday’s experience.
- **Daily Renewal:**
    - We need a fresh conversion and a fresh look at the Cross every morning.
    - This keeps us in humble dependence, killing pride and fostering faith.

## Slide 48 – Q17: Illustration
- **Breathing:**
    - We breathe constantly.
    - We do not take a deep breath on Sunday and hope it lasts all week.
    - Prayer and the Word are the breath of the soul.
    - To stop is to faint and die.

## Slide 49 – Summary Note
- **The Two Revelations:**
    - The Word revealed in **Flesh** (Christ).
    - The Word revealed in **Language** (Scripture).
- **The Mystery:**
    - Both are the union of the Divine and the human.
    - Both are called the Word of God and the Word of Life.
- **Conclusion:**
    - He who fails to find Christ in the Scriptures will not be able to feed upon the Word as the life-giving Word.
