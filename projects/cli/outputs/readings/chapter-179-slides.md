## Slide 1 – Q1: A Prepared Home
- Question: Has God prepared a dwelling place for His people?
- Key Text: Hebrews 11:16 – “But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Preparation & Grace)
- **Not a Disembodied Existence:** The reward is a tangible, real city, not floating on clouds.
- **Prepared Place for a Prepared People:**
  - Just as God prepared Eden, Christ is preparing the heavenly sanctuary (John 14:1–3 – “I go to prepare a place for you.”).
  - **Physical:** A glorious environment for eternal life.
  - **Spiritual:** As High Priest, He prepares *us* by cleansing our characters.
- **God is Not Ashamed:**
  - This is a marvel of grace.
  - When we accept Christ’s righteousness, God sees His Son in us and claims us as family.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** The earthly tabernacle was a shadow; the New Jerusalem is the fulfillment of Exodus 25:8 – “Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Wealthy Father and the Lost Son:**
  - Imagine a father building a magnificent estate for a son lost in a war-torn land.
  - The father spares no expense; the home is perfect.
  - The home is a free gift, entirely "prepared" by the father.
  - However, the son must leave the rebellion of the "far country" to inhabit the home.
- **Lesson:** We must journey out of sin to receive the gift prepared for us.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Location and Name
- Question: Where is this city? And what is it called?
- Key Text: Galatians 4:26 – “But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Two Covenants)
- **Jerusalem Above:**
  - Located in heaven, distinct from the earthly Jerusalem.
  - The headquarters of God’s government and location of the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1–2).
- **The City of Freedom:**
  - **Earthly Jerusalem (Hagar):** Represents the covenant of works—trying to save oneself by human effort, leading to bondage.
  - **Heavenly Jerusalem (Sarah):** Represents the covenant of grace. Citizens are born of the Spirit.
- **Justification Defined:**
  - A legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous.
  - It grants the *title* to the city based solely on Christ's merits (Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **Counterfeit vs. Pardon:**
  - Two women stand before a judge.
  - **Woman 1:** Tries to pay for freedom with counterfeit coins she made herself (Works/Legalism).
  - **Woman 2:** Presents a pardon signed by the King himself (Grace/Faith).
- **Lesson:** Only the one with the King's pardon is free to enter the City.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Abraham’s Hope
- Question: After sojourning in the land of promise as a stranger and a pilgrim, to what did Abraham look forward?
- Key Text: Hebrews 11:10 – “For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (The Divine Builder)
- **A City with Foundations:**
  - Tents are temporary and easily moved; God's city cannot be shaken.
  - Represents the unchangeable nature of God’s Kingdom and Law (Psalm 111:7–8).
- **Builder and Maker is God:**
  - Salvation is not a human construction project (like Babel).
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** We do not construct our own character to merit heaven; we submit to the Master Builder.
  - Ephesians 2:10 – “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works...”
- **The Pilgrim Mindset:** We use the things of this world, but our true citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Hotel Guest:**
  - If you stay in a hotel for one night, you do not repaint the walls or buy new furniture.
  - You settle in lightly, knowing you are leaving in the morning.
  - Your real investment goes into your permanent home.
- **Lesson:** Christians live in this world as guests, investing their true treasure in the world to come.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Access by Faith
- Question: When we embrace Christ, unto what do we come by faith?
- Key Text: Hebrews 12:22 – “But ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Sanctuary Access)
- **Access by Faith:**
  - We do not wait until death to connect with heaven.
  - Through prayer and faith in our High Priest, we "come unto" the heavenly sanctuary now.
- **Communion of Angels:**
  - We are never alone in the struggle against sin.
  - The forces of heaven ally with the believer who trusts Jesus.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Old Covenant: People stood far off at Sinai in fear (Hebrews 12:18–21).
  - New Covenant: The blood of Jesus opens the way into the Holiest (Hebrews 10:19).

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Descent of the City
- Question: What did John see concerning this city?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:2 – “And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (The Bride)
- **Coming Down from God:**
  - The city is a gift of grace descending after the millennium.
- **Prepared as a Bride:**
  - The city contains the Bride of Christ (His church).
  - **Adorned:** Not with outward jewelry, but with "the righteousness of saints" (Revelation 19:8).
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - A bride does not design her own dress; it is given to her.
  - We are clothed in Christ’s robe—His perfect life covers us, and His Spirit beautifies us.
- **The Marriage:** The final, inseparable union of Christ and His people.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Wedding Day:**
  - At a wedding, the bride is radiant, spotless, and joyful.
  - She has laid aside work clothes and is dressed in white.
- **Lesson:** This represents the church after the judgment—cleansed of all sin, trusting wholly in Christ, and ready for eternal union.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Old and New United
- Question: Is this the city for which Abraham looked?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:14 – “And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (One Faith)
- **Yes, it is the same city.**
  - Abraham looked for the city built by God; the Apostles preached the same city.
- **Unity of the Faith:**
  - Old Testament believers (Gates/Tribes) and New Testament believers (Foundations/Apostles) are saved by the same plan.
- **The Foundation:**
  - The church is built upon the apostles and prophets, with Jesus as the Chief Cornerstone (Ephesians 2:20).
  - To build on the teachings of Jesus is to build on the rock (Matthew 7:24).

## Slide 17 – Q7: Dimensions of the City
- Question: What is the measurement of the city?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:16 – “And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth; and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Vastness)
- **Foursquare:**
  - Represents perfection, stability, and equality.
  - Faces North, South, East, and West—the gospel is for all corners of the earth.
- **Vastness:**
  - 12,000 furlongs (approx. 375 miles per side).
  - Covers an area larger than many modern countries.
- **God’s Generosity:**
  - Human cities are crowded; God's city is spacious.
  - There is no shortage of room in the Father's house (John 14:2).

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Height of the Wall
- Question: What was the height of the wall?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:17 – “And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Security)
- **Height:** Approximately 216 feet (144 cubits).
- **Security and Separation:**
  - Walls symbolize safety from enemies (though no enemies remain).
  - Symbolizes the separation between the holy and the profane.
- **The Number 144:**
  - Connects to the 144,000 (Revelation 14:1) who reflect Christ's perfect character.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:** Like the courtyard wall of the tabernacle, this wall defines the sacred space of God's immediate presence.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Material of the Wall
- Question: Of what material is the wall constructed?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:18 – “And the building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Reflecting Glory)
- **Jasper:**
  - In Revelation 4:3, the One on the throne looks like jasper.
  - The wall reflects the very glory of God.
- **Pure Gold like Glass:**
  - Unlike earthly gold (opaque), this gold is transparent.
  - **Character Lesson:** Represents a character pure through and through—no hypocrisy or hidden sin.

## Slide 23 – Q10: The Foundations
- Question: With what are the twelve foundations (or as some suppose, ornamental bases) of the wall adorned?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:19–20 – “And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (Priestly Stones)
- **The High Priest’s Breastplate:**
  - These stones mirror the breastplate of the High Priest (Exodus 28:17–20).
  - **Sanctuary Truth:** The New Jerusalem is the center of High Priestly work. God holds His people (the stones) over His heart.
- **Variety and Beauty:**
  - God loves diversity; each stone reflects light differently.
  - God's people have different personalities but all reflect the "Sun of Righteousness."
- **Value:** God calls His people "My jewels" (Malachi 3:17).

## Slide 25 – Q11: The Gates
- Question: Of what are the twelve gates composed?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:21 – “And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl; and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (Suffering & Glory)
- **The Pearl of Great Price:**
  - Represents Christ and His truth (Matthew 13:45–46).
  - We enter the city only through Him.
- **Illustration of Suffering:**
  - A pearl is formed when a living organism is injured and covers the injury with precious material.
  - Reminds us that heaven's beauty results from Christ's suffering.
  - Also, "we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22).
- **Transparent Streets:** Gold is trodden underfoot; material wealth is a paving stone, not an idol.

## Slide 27 – Q12: What is Excluded?
- Question: What will be excluded from that city?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:27 – “And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points (Purity & Atonement)
- **The Necessity of Purity:**
  - God is a consuming fire to sin.
  - Clinging to sin would make a person miserable in God's holy presence.
- **Defilement and Lies:**
  - Includes idolatry ("abomination") and falsehood.
  - The Great Controversy ends with the exclusion of all lies.
- **How to Enter?**
  - **Atonement:** Sins must be "blotted out" in the judgment before Christ returns (Acts 3:19).

## Slide 29 – Q13: Who is Welcomed?
- Question: Who will be welcomed there?
- Key Text: Revelation 22:14 – “Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points (Law & Grace)
- **Obedience as the Fruit of Faith:**
  - We do not keep commandments to *earn* heaven (legalism).
  - Because we are saved by grace, we walk as He walked.
  - Revelation 14:12 – “Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”
- **The Right to the Tree:**
  - Lost by Adam’s disobedience; restored by Christ’s obedience.
- **Harmony with the Law:**
  - Citizens keep the law because it is written on their hearts (Hebrews 8:10).

## Slide 31 – Q13: Illustration
- **Freedom in Law:**
  - A fish is only free when in the water; on land, it suffers.
  - A train is only free when it stays on the tracks.
- **Lesson:** A human being is only truly free and happy when living in harmony with God's design—His Law. Heaven is a place of perfect obedience and therefore perfect happiness.

## Slide 32 – Q14: The Condition of the Redeemed
- Question: In what condition will those be who are permitted to dwell in the holy city?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:4 – “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.”

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points (Throne & Service)
- **The Throne of the Lamb:**
  - Jesus shares the throne; His sacrifice is central to eternal worship.
- **Active Service:**
  - Heaven is not idleness. "His servants shall serve Him."
  - We will rule with Christ and fulfill our created purpose.
