### Q1. From what source comes the power to get wealth?

> "But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth." Deuteronomy 8:18.

**Answer:**

The foundation of all true stewardship is the recognition of God’s absolute sovereignty. While men may boast of their intellect, their strength, or their business acumen, the Scriptures declare that the very power to exercise these faculties comes from the Creator.

1.  **God as the Source of Life:** Every breath we draw and every pulse of the heart is a gift from God (Acts 17:25). Without His sustaining power, human effort would cease instantly. Therefore, any wealth generated by human effort is ultimately derived from Him.
2.  **The Danger of Forgetfulness:** The context of Deuteronomy 8 warns against the spiritual pride that says, "My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth" (v. 17). This is the spirit of self-righteousness—claiming credit for what God has graciously given.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** Just as we cannot generate physical wealth without God’s power, we cannot generate spiritual righteousness without Christ. We are dependent on Him for our daily bread (physical life) and the Bread of Life (spiritual life). Recognizing our total dependence on God is the first step in both stewardship and salvation.

*   **Stewardship:** The management of another person’s property or resources. In the Christian life, it means realizing we are managers of God’s gifts, not owners (1 Corinthians 4:2).

[ILL]
**The Factory Worker:** Consider a man working in a great factory. He pulls a lever, and the machine produces a product. Does the worker own the machine? Did he build the factory? Does he supply the electricity? No. He merely operates what the owner has provided. If the worker begins to claim the factory is his because he pulled the lever, he is deluded. So it is with man; God provides the mind, the health, and the opportunity; we simply labor with His capital.

***

### Q2. How may we honor God?

> "Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase." Proverbs 3:9.

**Answer:**

Honoring God with our substance is an act of worship that acknowledges His ownership of all things.

1.  **The Principle of First-Fruits:** In the ancient sanctuary service, the first-fruits were the earliest gathered produce, offered to God before the rest of the harvest was consumed (Leviticus 23:10). This taught the people that God must be first in their thoughts and affections.
2.  **An Outward Sign of an Inward Grace:** Tithes (one-tenth of income) and offerings are not payment to God, for He needs nothing from us (Psalm 50:10–12). Rather, they are an expression of faith. By returning to God the first part of our increase, we demonstrate that we trust Him to sanctify the remainder and sustain us.
3.  **Overcoming Selfishness:** The carnal heart is naturally selfish, seeking to keep everything for itself. The plan of systematic benevolence was designed by God to tear away the roots of selfishness and cultivate a character of benevolence, like that of Christ, who "for your sakes became poor" (2 Corinthians 8:9).

*   **Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit makes us holy, setting us apart for God's use. Using our means for God’s glory is a practical part of sanctification.

[ILL]
**The Farmer's Grain:** A wise farmer knows that the best grain must not be eaten, but saved for sowing the next crop. If he eats his "seed corn," he destroys his future. Giving to God is like planting seeds; it seems like a loss to the selfish eye, but in the economy of heaven, it is the only way to secure a harvest of spiritual blessing (Malachi 3:10).

***

### Q3. What caution is given concerning riches?

> "If riches increase, set not your heart upon them." Psalm 62:10.

**Answer:**

The danger lies not in the riches themselves, but in the position they occupy in the heart.

1.  **The Throne of the Heart:** The human heart is designed to be the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. When we set our hearts on wealth, we displace Christ. This is a violation of the first commandment: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3).
2.  **The Deceitfulness of Wealth:** Prosperity often dulls the spiritual senses. When life is easy, men feel less need of prayer and less dependence on the High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary. They begin to trust in their bank accounts rather than in the blood of Christ.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** True righteousness is a matter of the heart's allegiance. If the heart is attached to the world, the law of God cannot be written there (Jeremiah 31:33). We must ask God to "circumcise" our hearts, cutting away the love of the world so we may love Him supremely (Deuteronomy 30:6).

[ILL]
**The Anchor:** A ship needs an anchor to stay steady. But if the captain casts his anchor into a pile of shifting sand or drifting seaweed (representing worldly riches), the ship will drift into the rocks when the storm comes. The anchor must be cast into the solid rock. Our hope must be anchored "within the veil," in the sanctuary where Christ is, not in the shifting sands of earthly gain (Hebrews 6:19).

***

### Q4. Can riches be retained to our own hurt?

> "There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt." Ecclesiastes 5:13.

**Answer:**

Hoarding wealth is contrary to the laws of the universe and brings spiritual stagnation to the soul.

1.  **The Law of Circulation:** In God's creation, everything gives to sustain something else. The sun gives light, the ocean gives rain, the earth gives fruit. Only the selfish heart desires to absorb without giving. To keep riches solely for oneself is to break the law of love.
2.  **Spiritual Atrophy:** When a man hoards, his sympathies harden. He becomes less like Christ and more like the adversary. The riches he thought would bring safety instead become a spiritual weight that drags him down to perdition.
3.  **The Judgment:** In the investigative judgment, God looks at how we employed our talents. Wealth "kept" and not "used" for God's cause will stand as a witness against the owner (James 5:3).

*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (beginning in 1844) where He reviews the lives of professed believers to see if they are truly His.

[ILL]
**The Dead Sea:** The Sea of Galilee receives water from the Jordan and flows it out again; it is teeming with life. The Dead Sea receives the same water but lets nothing out; consequently, its waters are stagnant, bitter, and support no life. A Christian who receives God's blessings but does not pass them on becomes a spiritual "Dead Sea."

### Q5. Give an example of this.

> "Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me. But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions." Matthew 19:21, 22.

**Answer:**

The story of the Rich Young Ruler is one of the most poignant illustrations of Righteousness by Faith versus righteousness by works.

1.  **The Defect in Legalism:** This young man claimed to have kept the commandments (v. 20). Outwardly, his life was moral. But Jesus, looking upon the heart, saw one idol that prevented full surrender: his love of money. He was using the law as a ladder to heaven but had not let the law's spirit (supreme love for God and neighbor) enter his soul.
2.  **The Call to Perfection:** "If thou wilt be perfect" means to be complete or mature in Christ. Jesus was offering him a trade: earthly trash for heavenly treasure, and the companionship of the Son of God.
3.  **The Tragedy of Rejection:** He went away sorrowful because he could not part with his idol. He wanted salvation, but he wanted his wealth more. He could not be justified (declared righteous) because he refused to be sanctified (separated from his sin).
4.  **Grace to Overcome:** Had the young man cried out, "Lord, I am attached to this money, break these chains for me!" Christ would have given him the power to obey. But he thought he had to do it in his own strength, or not at all.

[ILL]
**The Trapped Monkey:** Hunters in some lands catch monkeys by placing a nut inside a jar with a narrow neck. The monkey reaches in and grabs the nut, making a fist. The fist is too big to pull back out. To be free, the monkey simply has to let go of the nut. But because he refuses to let go, he remains trapped and is captured. The young ruler would not "open his hand" to let go of the world, and thus remained a captive of sin.

***

### Q6. Is it easy for the rich to enter the kingdom of God?

> "And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto His disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!" Mark 10:23.

**Answer:**

Jesus uses the illustration of a camel passing through the eye of a needle to show the impossibility of a rich man entering heaven *while remaining attached to his riches*.

1.  **The Danger of Self-Sufficiency:** The wealthy often feel no need of help. They can buy food, medicine, and comfort. This creates a false sense of security. Salvation, however, is for the "poor in spirit" (Matthew 5:3)—those who know they are spiritually bankrupt without Christ.
2.  **The Laodicean Condition:** The last church, Laodicea, is described as saying, "I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing" (Revelation 3:17). This is the most dangerous spiritual condition because such a person does not realize they are "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."
3.  **Salvation by Miracle:** Jesus adds, "With men it is impossible, but not with God" (Mark 10:27). Only the miracle of regeneration—the new birth—can make a rich man humble enough to enter the kingdom.

[ILL]
**The Narrow Door:** Imagine a door that is very low and very narrow. A man carrying large suitcases and wearing a tall, proud hat cannot enter. To go through, he must drop his baggage (his earthly trust) and get on his knees (humility). The gate to heaven is wide enough for the sinner, but too narrow for the sinner and his pride.

***

### Q7. What charge is given to the rich?

> "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy." 1 Timothy 6:17.

**Answer:**

The Apostle Paul instructs Timothy on how to counsel the wealthy within the church. They are not commanded to become poor, but to change where they place their trust.

1.  **Against High-mindedness:** Wealth tends to breed arrogance (Proverbs 18:23). The rich must constantly be reminded that before the Cross, all men are equal. The ground is level at the foot of the cross.
2.  **Uncertain Riches:** Economic systems collapse; thieves steal; inflation destroys value. To trust in money is to build on a fault line.
3.  **Trust in the Living God:** Our trust must be in the Giver, not the gift. God gives us things to "enjoy"—He is not a harsh taskmaster—but He gives them so that we might use them to bless others, not to hoard in selfishness.

*   **High-minded:** Arrogant, proud, feeling superior to others due to social status or possessions.

[ILL]
**The Water vs. The Source:** A man traveling in the desert may find a canteen of water. If he trusts only in that canteen, he will panic as it runs dry. But if he knows the location of the ever-flowing spring, he is safe. Money is a canteen; God is the Spring.

***

### Q8. What are they further instructed to do?

> "That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life." 1 Timothy 6:18, 19.

**Answer:**

The antidote to the poison of selfishness is active benevolence.

1.  **Rich in Good Works:** True wealth in the sight of heaven is measured by character and service. A man may be a pauper in the bank but a millionaire in good works.
2.  **Willing to Communicate:** In older English, "communicate" means to share or to hold things in common. It implies a readiness to help the needy and support the gospel commission.
3.  **Laying a Foundation:** This is not salvation by works. We are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8). However, our works are the evidence of our faith. By using our means for God, we are "laying hold" on the reality of eternal life. We are proving that we are citizens of a better country.
4.  **Fitness for Heaven:** A person who hates giving would be miserable in heaven, for heaven is a place of ceaseless giving. Sanctification is the work of becoming fitted for that society.

[ILL]
**Currency Exchange:** If you were moving to a foreign country, you would convert your money into that nation's currency before you left, because your old money would be worthless there. We are moving to heaven. The currency of heaven is love and souls won for Christ. We "transfer" our wealth by giving it to God's work now.

***

### Q9. What dangers attend the getting of riches?

> "But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition." 1 Timothy 6:9.

**Answer:**

The text specifically speaks of those who "will be rich"—that is, those who are determined to be wealthy, whose will is set upon it.

1.  **The Snare (Trap):** The pursuit of money often leads men to compromise their integrity. A little lie here, a little oppression of a worker there, a Sabbath broken for business profit. Satan uses gold as bait to snap the trap of sin upon the soul.
2.  **Hurtful Lusts:** The desire for wealth often opens the door to other sins—intemperance, luxury, pride, and vanity.
3.  **Drowned in Destruction:** The imagery is of a man weighed down, sinking into deep water. The love of money drowns out the voice of the Holy Spirit.
4.  **Covetousness is Idolatry:** Colossians 3:5 tells us that covetousness is idolatry. It breaks the relationship with God, leaving the soul defenseless against the enemy.

*   **Perdition:** Final and irrevocable ruin; the loss of the soul.

[ILL]
**The Bait:** A fish does not see the hook; it sees only the worm. It bites to get something good, but ends up losing its life. The desire for riches is Satan’s worm; the hook is sin and death.

***

### Q10. What makes rich without adding sorrow?

> "The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it." Proverbs 10:22.

**Answer:**

There is a difference between the riches that come from grabbing and the riches that come from God's blessing.

1.  **Peace of Conscience:** Wealth obtained by fraud or overwork brings anxiety and guilt. Wealth that comes through honest labor and God's providence brings peace.
2.  **Spiritual Wealth:** The greatest riches are spiritual—justification, the indwelling Spirit, the knowledge of God. These bring no sorrow, only "joy unspeakable" (1 Peter 1:8).
3.  **Contentment:** When we accept what God provides with thanksgiving, we are truly rich. The blessing of the Lord satisfies the soul, whereas worldly wealth is like drinking saltwater—it only increases the thirst.

[ILL]
**Manna:** In the wilderness, God provided manna. It was a blessing. But if the people tried to hoard it selfishly overnight contrary to God's command, it bred worms and stank (Exodus 16:20). God's blessing brings life; man's selfish hoarding brings corruption.

***

### Q11. How are true riches obtained?

> "By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honor, and life." Proverbs 22:4.

**Answer:**

The economy of heaven is the opposite of the economy of earth. To go up, one must go down.

1.  **Humility:** This is the prerequisite for all grace. "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble" (James 4:6). We must admit our spiritual poverty before we can receive Christ's riches.
2.  **The Fear of the Lord:** This is not terror, but a reverential awe and a hatred of sin (Proverbs 8:13). It is the beginning of wisdom.
3.  **The Reward:** The verse promises riches, honor, and life. While this can include material provision, its ultimate fulfillment is in the New Earth. To be a child of the King is the highest honor; to possess eternal life is the greatest wealth.

*   **Grace:** The unmerited favor and enabling power of God given to the undeserving.

[ILL]
**The Valley:** Water flows down from the mountains and settles in the lowest valleys. If we want the "water of life," we must be in the valley of humility, not on the mountain peaks of pride.

### Q12. Does happiness depend on earthly possessions?

> "And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." Luke 12:15.

**Answer:**

Jesus strikes at the root of the human delusion that "more stuff equals more happiness."

1.  **The Nature of Life:** True life is found in union with God, who is the source of life. Objects are dead; they cannot impart life or love to the human heart.
2.  **The Vacuum of the Soul:** The human soul was made for God. Filling it with money, cars, or houses is like trying to fill a canyon with marbles; it may look full, but the gaps remain. Only the infinite God can fill the infinite longing of the human heart.
3.  **Victory over Covetousness:** This is a Righteousness by Faith issue. We cannot simply "decide" not to covet. We need the "expulsive power of a new affection." When we love Christ supremely, the things of earth grow strangely dim and lose their power to charm us.

*   **Covetousness:** An excessive desire for wealth or for something that belongs to another. It is a violation of the 10th Commandment.

[ILL]
**The Child and the Toy:** A child may cry bitterly because he drops a cheap plastic toy. But if his father picks him up and hugs him, the toy is forgotten. The world offers us toys; God offers us the Father's embrace.

### Q13. Will silver or gold be able to deliver in the day of wrath?

> "Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath." Zephaniah 1:18.

**Answer:**

This verse points to the great Day of the Lord and the final judgment.

1.  **The Failure of Bribes:** In earthly courts, rich men may sometimes escape justice through high-priced lawyers or bribes. In the court of heaven, there is only one currency accepted: the blood of Jesus Christ.
2.  **The Close of Probation:** When Jesus finishes His work as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, the "day of wrath" (the seven last plagues) begins. At that time, money will be worthless. It cannot buy food (which will be scarce) nor protection from the judgments of God.
3.  **The Only Covering:** The only safety in that day will be the covering of Christ’s righteousness. We must buy of Him "gold tried in the fire" (faith and love) and "white raiment" (righteous character) now, while the door of mercy is open (Revelation 3:18).

*   **Day of the Lord:** The time associated with the Second Coming of Christ and the execution of judgment upon the wicked.

[ILL]
**The Sinking Ship:** When the Titanic was sinking, millionaires reportedly left their money and jewels in their cabins but rushed to get into the lifeboats. In the face of death, gold had no value; only a seat in the lifeboat mattered. Christ is the lifeboat.

### Q14. How did Moses esteem the reproach of Christ?

> "Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward." Hebrews 11:26.

**Answer:**

Moses stands as a towering example of faith making the right valuation.

1.  **The Choice:** Moses could have been the Pharaoh of Egypt, the wealthiest empire on earth. He chose instead to identify with a chaotic group of slaves, simply because they were God's people.
2.  **The Reproach of Christ:** To follow God often involves suffering, ridicule, and loss of social standing. Moses saw that suffering *with* God was better than reigning *without* Him.
3.  **The Eye of Faith:** Moses "endured, as seeing Him who is invisible" (Hebrews 11:27). Faith is the ability to see the reality of the future reward (heaven) more clearly than the reality of present pleasure (Egypt).
4.  **Practical Application:** We are often faced with the same choice—compromise truth for job security or social status, or stand for truth and face loss. Like Moses, we must look to the eternal reward.

[ILL]
**The Telescope:** To the naked eye, a star looks like a tiny speck, while a candle looks large and bright. But look through a telescope, and the star is a blazing sun, while the candle is nothing. Faith is the telescope that shows us the true size of heavenly things compared to earthly trifles.

### Q15. Mention two classes of rich men.

> "There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing; there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches." Proverbs 13:7.

**Answer:**

The Bible presents a paradox regarding wealth.

1.  **Class 1: The Worldly Rich / Spiritually Poor.** This is the man who accumulates vast sums but has no treasure in heaven. In the sight of angels, he is a pauper. He has "nothing" that will survive the grave.
2.  **Class 2: The Worldly Poor / Spiritually Rich.** This is the self-sacrificing Christian who may have given all for the cause of God, or the humble believer who possesses little. Yet, they are "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:17). They possess peace, joy, and eternal life.
3.  **Christ's Example:** Jesus "made himself poor" (Philippians 2:7) that we might become rich. We follow in His steps when we value people over possessions.

[ILL]
**The Empty Box:** A beautifully wrapped box with a golden bow looks impressive. But if you open it and it is empty, the wrapping is a deception. A plain, rough box filled with diamonds is far more valuable. The world looks at the wrapping (clothes, cars); God looks at the contents (the heart).

***

### Q16. Give an example of the first class.

> "And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?" Luke 12:16–20.

**Answer:**

The Parable of the Rich Fool illustrates the ultimate futility of living for self.

1.  **The Problem of "I" and "My":** Notice the man's language: "My fruits," "my barns," "my goods," "my soul." He acted as if God did not exist. He forgot Deuteronomy 8:18—that God gave him the power to get wealth.
2.  **No Room for Giving:** His problem was "no room." He had room for hoarding, but no room for the poor or for God's cause. His barns were big enough for his greed, but his heart was too small for grace.
3.  **The Uncertainty of Life:** He planned for "many years," but he did not have even one night.
4.  **"Thou Fool":** The world called him successful; God called him a fool. Why? Because he prepared for a life he couldn't keep and neglected the life he could have had forever.

[ILL]
**The Sandcastle:** A child works all day building a magnificent sandcastle near the water's edge. He defends it and admires it. But when the tide comes in, it is washed away in seconds. The rich fool built his life on the sand, and the tide of death washed it all away.

***

### Q17. What lesson may we learn from this parable?

> "So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God." Luke 12:21.

**Answer:**

The lesson is one of investment strategy.

1.  **Rich Toward God:** What does this mean? It means possessing faith, love, and a character molded by the Holy Spirit. It means having a record of acts of mercy and support for the gospel recorded in the books of heaven.
2.  **Misplaced Treasure:** To lay up treasure for self is a failed investment because "you can't take it with you." But treasure sent ahead to heaven (by giving to God's work and helping the poor) awaits our arrival.
3.  **RBF Application:** We become rich toward God not by buying His favor, but by receiving Christ. When Christ dwells in the heart, His generosity flows through us. We give because we *are* His, not to *become* His.

[ILL]
**The Bank Transfer:** If a bank is about to burn down, a wise man transfers his funds to a safe bank in another city. This world is reserved for fire (2 Peter 3:10). To be "rich toward God" is to transfer our affections and resources to the Heavenly Bank before the fire comes.

### Q18. What fearful words are addressed to the rich oppressor?

> "Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days." James 5:2, 3.

**Answer:**

This passage is a specific prophecy regarding the economic conditions of the "last days."

1.  **Corrupted Riches:** James foresees a time of vast accumulation of wealth alongside great poverty. The "rust" witnessing against them implies that the wealth was unused—it sat idle while others suffered.
2.  **Oppression:** Contextually (James 5:4), this wealth was gained by fraud—by withholding wages from laborers. This speaks to the capital/labor struggles of the end times. God hears the cry of the oppressed.
3.  **Judgment Fire:** The "rust" eating the flesh like fire suggests the intense remorse and judgment that awaits those who prioritized profit over people.
4.  **Prophetic Warning:** We are living in these days. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few while the world suffers is a sign of the times. Adventists must avoid the spirit of monopolizing and hoarding.

*   **Cankered:** Rusted or tarnished. Gold does not literally rust, so this is a metaphor for the moral decay and the evidence of their hoarding.

[ILL]
**The Witness Stand:** Imagine your bank account and your possessions being called to the witness stand in a court. What would they say? Would they testify, "He used us to feed the hungry and spread the gospel"? Or would they say, "He locked us away for his own pride while his neighbor starved"?

### Q19. How may the poor of this world be counted rich?

> "Hearken, my beloved brethren; hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him?" James 2:5.

**Answer:**

God’s election often flips human hierarchy upside down.

1.  **Rich in Faith:** Faith is the currency of the Kingdom. With faith, we access the power of God, the forgiveness of sins, and the promise of the resurrection. A poor man with strong faith has resources that a billionaire atheist cannot comprehend.
2.  **Heirs of the Kingdom:** Through justification by faith, we are adopted into the family of God (Romans 8:15). This makes us heirs to the entire universe.
3.  **God's Choice:** God often chooses the poor because they are less likely to trust in themselves. Their daily need drives them to daily dependence on God, which is the essence of the life of faith.

[ILL]
**The Prince in Exile:** A prince may be traveling in a foreign land, dressed in rags, with no money in his pocket. He looks poor to the locals. But he has the blood of the king in his veins and a kingdom waiting for his return. The Christian is that prince.

### Q20. Can we estimate the worth of the eternal inheritance?

> "For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside Thee, what He hath prepared for him that waiteth for Him." Isaiah 64:4.

**Answer:**

The rewards of the faithful are beyond human comprehension.

1.  **Beyond Sense and Logic:** Our eyes and ears are limited to this fallen world. We cannot imagine the colors, the sounds, and the joys of the unfallen universe. Paul quotes this in 1 Corinthians 2:9 to describe what the Spirit reveals to us.
2.  **Prepared for Waiters:** The inheritance is for those who "wait for Him." This implies patience, endurance, and the "patience of the saints" (Revelation 14:12). It is for those who hold on to their faith in the Great High Priest during the delay.
3.  **The Greatest Reward:** The greatest thing God has prepared is not the golden streets or the mansions, but face-to-face fellowship with Himself. To be with Christ, free from the presence and power of sin, is the ultimate richness.
4.  **The Appeal:** Why trade this infinite, eternal weight of glory for the temporary, "uncertain riches" of this dying world? Let us choose Christ, the Pearl of Great Price, and in Him, possess all things.

[ILL]
**The Acorn and the Oak:** If you had never seen a tree, you could never guess that a mighty oak sleeps inside a tiny acorn. Similarly, looking at our current struggles, we cannot guess the glory that God will reveal in us. We must trust the Gardener.
