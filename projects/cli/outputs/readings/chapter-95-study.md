### Q1. Speaking of those who substitute a man made commandment for one of God's commandments, what kind of worship does Christ say they render?

**“But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of
men." Matt. 15:9.**

**Answer:** Here, the Lord Jesus strikes at the very root of false religion: the
substitution of human authority for divine authority.

1.  **The Definition of Vain Worship:** The word "vain" means empty, fruitless,
    or without effect. Jesus teaches that worship is not merely an outward act
    of praise or ritual; it is an act of obedience and submission to God's will.
    If we offer God praise while simultaneously rejecting His explicit law in
    favor of tradition, that worship reaches no higher than the ceiling. It is
    not accepted by Heaven.
2.  **The Conflict of Authority:** The Great Controversy between Christ and
    Satan is essentially a battle over authority. God’s law is the transcript of
    His character. When men set aside God's law to establish their own
    traditions, they are—perhaps unwittingly—placing human wisdom above divine
    wisdom.
3.  **Doctrines vs. Commandments:** A "doctrine" is a teaching. Jesus warns
    against elevating the "commandments of men" (traditions, church decrees,
    cultural customs) to the status of binding doctrine. True doctrine must be
    based solely on "Thus saith the Lord."

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a soldier who claims to love his general. He
sings songs about the general and polishes his uniform daily. However, when the
general issues a specific order for the battle, the soldier ignores it and
follows a different order given by a fellow private. Is the soldier’s salute
genuine? No. His disobedience proves his "worship" of the general is empty. So
it is with God; we cannot honor Him while willfully ignoring His commands.

### Q2. Concerning what commandment did Christ reprove the Pharisees on that occasion?

**“For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother; ...but ye say,
Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever
thou mightest be profited by me; and honor not his father or his mother, he
shall be free." Matt. 15:4-6.**

**Answer:** Christ cited the Fifth Commandment to demonstrate how tradition can
be used to sidestep moral duty.

1.  **The Corban Tradition:** The Pharisees had invented a tradition called
    "Corban" (Mark 7:11). A man could declare his property "dedicated to God" (a
    gift). Once declared, he could claim he was unable to use those resources to
    help his aging parents because the money was "holy." Yet, often, he kept the
    money for his own use, effectively using religion as a cloak for
    selfishness.
2.  **The Principle of Evasion:** The Pharisees were experts at keeping the
    _letter_ of their own laws while violating the _spirit_ and _letter_ of
    God’s law. They made religion a method of avoiding duty rather than
    fulfilling it.
3.  **Modern Application:** Today, many use similar logic regarding the Sabbath.
    They may say, "I dedicate every day to the Lord," or "My work is my
    worship," using these pious-sounding phrases to excuse themselves from the
    specific obligation of resting on the seventh day as God commanded.

---

### Q3. What was the result of their course?

**“Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition."
Matt. 15:6.**

**Answer:** The tragic result of elevating tradition is the nullification of
God's law in the life of the believer.

1.  **"None Effect":** To make the law of "none effect" means to strip it of its
    binding power and authority. When a church teaches that human custom
    supersedes the Bible, they effectively tell the people that God does not
    mean what He says.
2.  **The Danger of Tradition:** Tradition is not inherently evil, but it
    becomes destructive when it stands in opposition to a "Thus saith the Lord."
    In the matter of the Sabbath, the tradition of Sunday keeping (a day
    dedicated to the sun in paganism and adopted by the church in the early
    centuries) has completely displaced the biblical Sabbath in the minds of the
    majority of Christians.
3.  **The Law and the Gospel:** If the law is made of none effect, the Gospel is
    also weakened. The law points out sin (Romans 3:20), and the Gospel provides
    the remedy for sin. If we change the law to suit ourselves, we no longer see
    our need for the transforming grace of Christ to help us obey.

---

### Q4. What question did the disciples soon afterward ask Christ concerning what He had said?

**"Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?"
Matt. 15:12.**

**Answer:** The disciples were concerned about the popularity and reception of
their Master's message.

1.  **The Offense of Truth:** The Pharisees were the religious leaders, the
    "authorities" of the day. For Jesus to publicly bypass their authority and
    appeal directly to the Ten Commandments offended their pride.
2.  **Human Fear:** The disciples, like many of us, were afraid of rocking the
    boat. They worried that offending the church leaders would hinder the work.
    But Jesus teaches that truth cannot be compromised for the sake of "peace"
    or to avoid offending those in error (Luke 12:51).

---

### Q5. What answer did the Saviour make?

**“But He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not
planted, shall be rooted up." Matt. 15:13.**

**Answer:** This is a solemn decree regarding all false doctrines and
institutions.

1.  **God's Planting:** God has "planted" specific institutions for the benefit
    of man: The Sabbath (at Creation), Marriage (at Creation), and the
    Supper/Communion (in the New Testament). These are divine in origin.
2.  **Man's Planting:** Any religious institution or doctrine that originates in
    the mind of man—no matter how old, how popular, or how widely accepted—is a
    plant the Father did not plant.
3.  **The Certainty of Judgment:** The phrase "shall be rooted up" points to the
    final judgment. In the last days, during the "harvest," everything not
    founded on the Word of God will be destroyed. Only that which is built upon
    the Rock of Scripture will stand (Matthew 7:24-27). This gives us confidence
    to stand with the Bible, even if we stand alone.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A farmer walks through his field. He sees wheat that he
planted, but he also sees large, impressive weeds that have grown tall. They
look strong, but the farmer knows he did not plant them. At the harvest, he does
not spare the weed because it is big or old; he pulls it up because it is not
wheat. Sunday sacredness is a "weed" in the garden of Scripture—it is nowhere to
be found in the planting of the Lord.

---

### Q6. Where and by whom was the Sabbath of the fourth commandment planted?

**“For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and
hallowed it." Ex. 20:11.**

**Answer:** The Sabbath was planted by God Himself at the very foundation of the
world.

1.  **The Author:** "The Lord" (Jehovah) is the planter. In the New Testament,
    we learn that God created all things through Jesus Christ (John 1:1-3;
    Colossians 1:16). Therefore, the Sabbath was made by Christ Himself. It is
    truly the "Lord's Day" (Revelation 1:10).
2.  **The Time:** It was established in Eden, before sin entered, and before the
    existence of the Jewish nation. It is a gift to humanity (Mark 2:27).
3.  **Three Divine Acts:** God did three things to the seventh day that He did
    to no other:
    - **Rested:** He set the example.
    - **Blessed:** He filled it with spiritual life and benefit.
    - **Hallowed:** He set it apart for holy use. No human authority can
      "un-hallow" what God has hallowed.

---

### Q7. Who claims to have planted the Sunday institution?

**"Question - Has the church power to make any alterations in the commandments
of God? Answer - Instead of the seventh day, and other festivals appointed by
the old law, the church has prescribed the Sundays and holy days to be set apart
for God's worship; and these we are now obliged to keep in consequence of God's
commandment, instead of the ancient Sabbath." Catholic Christian Instructed,
page 204, ed. Kelly, Piet and Co., Baltimore.**

**Answer:** This historical admission clarifies that Sunday observance is an act
of ecclesiastical (church) authority, not Scriptural authority.

1.  **The Claim of Power:** The Papacy (the Roman Catholic Church) openly claims
    the authority to change biblical laws. This fulfills the prophecy of Daniel
    7:25 regarding the "little horn" power that would "think to change times and
    laws."
2.  **The Protestant Dilemma:** Protestants, by definition, claim to follow the
    Bible only (_Sola Scriptura_). Yet, by keeping Sunday, they are obeying a
    commandment of the Catholic Church, not the Bible.
3.  **The Issue:** This is not about condemning individuals, but about
    recognizing the source of our authority. Do we follow the "plant" of the
    Father (the Sabbath) or the "plant" of the Church (Sunday)?

---

### Q8. When is salvation to be brought to the people of God?

**“Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be
revealed in the last time." 1 Peter 1:5 (Isa. 25:9) (Isa. 35:4).**

**Answer:** While we are justified (forgiven) the moment we believe, the final
deliverance from the presence of sin and the restoration of the earth occurs in
the "last time" at the second coming of Christ.

- **Definition of Salvation (in this context):** This refers to the ultimate
  glorification of the saints and the final rescue from a doomed world.
- **The Power of God:** We are "kept" (guarded) by God's power. This is the
  essence of **Righteousness by Faith**. We cannot keep ourselves from falling;
  we are kept by faith in His power. The same power that sustains the universe
  sustains the believer in obedience.

---

### Q9. When God's salvation is near to come, and the advent doctrine is being preached, for what will God pronounce a blessing on the people?

**“My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is
the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth
the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil." Isa.
56:1, 2.**

**Answer:** This prophecy specifically links the "last days" (when salvation is
near) with a call to Sabbath reform.

1.  **Context:** The text says "My salvation is near to come." This applies with
    special force to the generation waiting for the Second Coming.
2.  **The Connection:** Why is the Sabbath linked to God's righteousness?
    Because the Sabbath is the sign of God’s sanctifying power (Ezekiel 20:12).
3.  **Polluting the Sabbath:** To "pollute" the Sabbath is to treat it as
    common—to mix the holy with the profane. God calls for a restoration of the
    Sabbath to its rightful place as a holy day of delight.
4.  **Faith and Works:** Notice the balance. We lay hold of the covenant by
    faith, but the _fruit_ of that faith is keeping the Sabbath and keeping the
    hand from evil. Real faith always produces obedience (James 2:17).

---

### Q10. Is this promise to be confined to the Jews at that time?

**“Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve
Him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be His servants, everyone that keepeth
the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even them will I
bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer." Isa.
56:6, 7.**

**Answer:** No, the Sabbath is universal.

1.  **The "Stranger":** This refers to Gentiles—those not of Jewish lineage.
    Under the New Covenant, the wall of partition is broken down (Ephesians
    2:14). All who join themselves to Christ are spiritual Israel (Galatians
    3:29).
2.  **"Join Themselves":** This implies a personal, covenant relationship. The
    Sabbath is not a legalistic requirement for salvation, but a sign of loyalty
    for those who have "joined" themselves to the Lord in love.
3.  **Taking Hold of the Covenant:** The New Covenant is God's promise to write
    His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). The Sabbath, as the heart of that law,
    is written in the heart of the believer by the Holy Spirit.

---

### Q11. What other promise has He given to the Gentiles who will then keep the Sabbath?

**“Even unto them will I give in Mine house and within My walls a place and a
name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name,
that shall not be cut off." Isa. 56:5.**

**Answer:** God promises an eternal legacy and intimate family status to the
faithful.

- **Better than Sons and Daughters:** In earthly families, names can be
  forgotten or lineages cut off. In God’s family, the name given to the
  overcomer is "everlasting."
- **Assurance:** This is a message of hope for those who may face rejection by
  their earthly families for accepting the Sabbath truth. God promises a better
  family and a permanent home.

---

### Q12. What does God call upon His ministers to say to His professed people at this time?

**“Cry aloud, and spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My
people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins." Isa. 58:1.**

**Answer:** God calls for a fearless ministry that will awaken the sleeping
church.

1.  **"Cry Aloud":** The message is not to be whispered. It is a warning
    message, similar to the Third Angel's Message of Revelation 14.
2.  **"My People":** Note that this message is directed at religious people
    ("house of Jacob"), not atheists. It is the church that needs to see where
    it has drifted from God's law.
3.  **The Purpose of Reproof:** God points out sin not to condemn, but to heal.
    Like a doctor diagnosing a disease, the minister must identify the sin
    (law-breaking) so the patient can seek the Cure (Christ).

---

### Q13. After speaking of their lack of devotion in certain directions, and offering a corrective, what other wrong does He point out and offer a remedy for?

**“If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My
holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and
shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor
speaking thine own words." Isa. 58:13.**

**Answer:** The prophet Isaiah highlights Sabbath-breaking as a primary sin of
God's people and prescribes the remedy: true Sabbath-keeping.

1.  **"Turn away thy foot":** This imagery suggests that people are trampling
    the Sabbath underfoot. To turn the foot away is to stop treating the day
    with contempt or indifference.
2.  **"Doing thy pleasure":** The Sabbath is not a day for our own amusements,
    business, or secular entertainment. It is a day to find pleasure in God.
3.  **"Speaking thine own words":** True Sabbath observance involves even our
    conversation. It is a time to lay aside worldly cares, politics, and
    business talk, and to speak of heavenly things.
4.  **A Delight, Not a Burden:** This is the key to **Righteousness by Faith**.
    The legalist keeps the Sabbath as a burden to earn heaven. The believer who
    loves Christ calls the Sabbath a "delight" because it is a day of communion
    with the Beloved.

---

### Q14. To those who will have courage to heed the appeal here given, what does the Lord promise?

**“Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride
upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy
father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." Isa. 58:14.**

**Answer:** Great spiritual and temporal blessings attend those who honor God’s
day.

1.  **Delight in the Lord:** When we stop seeking our own pleasure, we find a
    higher pleasure in God.
2.  **Ride on High Places:** A symbol of victory and overcoming. Those who can
    conquer their own selfishness to keep the Sabbath holy will be given power
    to overcome in other areas of life.
3.  **The Heritage of Jacob:** This is the inheritance of the New Earth.

---

### Q15. And what will those be called who turn from their transgressions?

**“And thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths
to dwell in." Isa. 58:12.**

**Answer:** God raises up a movement to restore what was lost.

1.  **The Breach:** A "breach" is a hole in a protective wall. The Law of God is
    the wall that protects humanity. The "Little Horn" (Daniel 7:25) made a
    breach in the law by changing the Sabbath.
2.  **The Repairers:** In the last days, God raises up a people—described in
    Revelation 14:12—who repair this gap by keeping _all_ the commandments of
    God.
3.  **Restorer of Paths:** Jeremiah 6:16 speaks of the "old paths." The Sabbath
    is the oldest path, established in Eden. We are called to lead people back
    to the original faith.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a city surrounded by a dike that holds back the
ocean. If a hole appears in the dike, the city is in danger. The people who rush
to fill that hole with sandbags are the "repairers of the breach." The world is
being flooded with lawlessness; Sabbath-keepers are those standing in the gap,
upholding God's standard.

---

### Q16. What does another prophet say that God's professed teachers will do?

**“Her priests have violated My law, and have profaned Mine holy things; they
have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed
difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from My
Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them." Eze. 22:26.**

**Answer:** Ezekiel prophesies a failure in leadership among God's people
regarding the Sabbath.

- **Hiding the Eyes:** This suggests a willful ignorance. The evidence for the
  Sabbath is in the Bible, but religious leaders choose to look away or ignore
  it to maintain tradition.
- **No Difference:** God distinguishes between the common (six working days) and
  the holy (the seventh day). When ministers teach that "every day is the same,"
  they are erasing the distinction God created.
- **I am Profaned:** To ignore God's law is to dishonor God Himself.

---

### Q17. What does He say they have done to maintain their theories?

**“And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and
divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord hath not
spoken." Eze. 22:28.**

**Answer:** They build up false theological structures to support their
traditions.

- **Untempered Mortar:** In ancient building, good mortar required the right
  mixture to harden and hold the stones. "Untempered mortar" (or whitewash) is a
  cheap plaster that looks good on the surface but has no strength.
- **The Application:** When ministers use weak arguments (like "it doesn't
  matter which day," or "redemption is greater than creation") to support Sunday
  keeping, they are daubing with untempered mortar. They say "Thus saith the
  Lord" (claiming it is God's day) when "the Lord hath not spoken" (there is no
  Bible verse for Sunday).

---

### Q18. What does the Lord say will become of this wall thus daubed with untempered mortar?

**“Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall; there
shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a
stormy wind shall rend." Eze. 13:11.**

**Answer:** False doctrines will collapse when tested by the final storm of
judgment.

- **The Wall Falls:** Any religion not based on Scripture will eventually
  crumble. The structure of Sunday sacredness, built on tradition and church
  authority, will not stand the test of the last days.

---

### Q19. When are these hailstones to fall?

**"Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the
treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
against the day of battle and war?" Job 38:22, 23.**

**Answer:** The "overflowing shower" and "hailstones" refer to the literal
judgments at the end of time.

- **Time of Trouble:** Scripture speaks of a "time of trouble such as never was"
  (Daniel 12:1).
- **Reserved:** God is holding back these final judgments until the work of the
  Gospel is finished.

---

### Q20. Under which of the seven last plagues will this battle take place?

**” And the seventh angel poured our his vial into the air; ...and the cities of
the nations fell; ...and every island fled away, and the mountains were not
found. And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the
weight of a talent." Rev. 16:17-21.**

**Answer:** The literal fulfillment of Ezekiel's prophecy occurs during the
Seventh Plague.

- **The Collapse:** "The cities of the nations fell." This includes the
  spiritual collapse of "Babylon" (false religion).
- **The Hail:** Revelation confirms the "great hail." This physical storm
  mirrors the spiritual reality: the "wall" of false doctrine is being destroyed
  by the reality of God's wrath against sin.

---

### Q21. In order to prepare His people for that terrible time, what does God expect His ministers to do?

**"Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of
Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord." Eze. 13:5.**

**Answer:** God expects ministers to build a spiritual defense ("hedge") around
His people so they can survive the Day of the Lord.

- **Making up the Hedge:** This means teaching the people the full counsel of
  God, including obedience to the Ten Commandments. The Law is the hedge that
  protects us from sin.
- **To Stand:** "Who shall be able to stand?" (Revelation 6:17). Only those who
  are covered by the robe of Christ's righteousness _and_ who have been
  sanctified by His Spirit to walk in obedience will stand. A gospel that
  teaches "you can't obey" or "the law is abolished" leaves the people
  defenseless (without a hedge) against Satan's attacks.

---

### Q22. Instead of their trying to close the breach made in God's law (the loss of the Sabbath), and to make up the hedge, what will they do?

**“They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying The Lord saith: and the
Lord hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would
confirm the word." Eze. 13:6.**

**Answer:** False shepherds give false assurance.

- **Lying Divination:** Preaching peace and safety when there is no peace.
- **False Hope:** They encourage people to hope that God will accept partial
  obedience or tradition in place of His specific commands. This is a dangerous
  deception.

---

### Q23. During these closing scenes, what message will God send forth to call attention to His commandments?

**” And the third angel followed them, saying with aloud voice, If any man
worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his
hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... Here is the
patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the
faith of Jesus." Rev. 14:9-12.**

**Answer:** The **Third Angel's Message** is God's final warning to the world.

1.  **The Warning:** It warns against worshiping the Beast (the Papacy) and its
    Image (apostate Protestantism uniting with the state), and receiving the
    Mark (the false sabbath/Sunday).
2.  **The Description of the Saved:** Verse 12 describes the "saints" (holy
    ones). They have two distinct characteristics:
    - **They keep the Commandments of God:** This includes the fourth
      commandment.
    - **They have the Faith of Jesus:** Not just faith _in_ Jesus, but the
      _quality_ of faith that Jesus had—a faith that trusts the Father
      completely and yields total obedience.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** These saints do not keep the commandments _to
    be_ saved; they keep them because they _are_ saved and possess the "faith of
    Jesus" which works by love.

---

### Q24. How are those of the remnant church treated?

**“And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the
remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony
of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.**

**Answer:** They are the objects of Satan’s (the dragon's) special wrath.

- **The Remnant:** The final piece of the church at the end of time.
- **The Reason for War:** Satan hates them because they stand as a rebuke to his
  lawlessness. By keeping the Commandments through the power of Christ, they
  prove that God's law can be kept, exposing Satan's lies.

---

### Q25. And when the earth is made new, and God's people are saved therein, how often will they all come to worship Him?

**” And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one
Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord."
Isa. 66:23.**

**Answer:** The Sabbath is not a temporary Jewish institution; it is eternal.

- **Eternal Rhythm:** In the New Earth, the Sabbath will continue to be the day
  of worship. It was kept in Eden before sin, it is kept by the remnant during
  the history of sin, and it will be kept in the New Earth after sin is
  destroyed.
- **Universal Worship:** "All flesh" will worship on this day.

---

### Q26. Will the tree of life also be restored to the saints?

**“Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the
tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." Rev. 22:14.**

**Answer:** Yes, access to the Tree of Life—lost in Eden through disobedience—is
restored in the New Jerusalem to those who have been restored to obedience.

1.  **"Blessed are they...":** This is the final beatitude of the Bible.
2.  **Commandment Keeping & Salvation:** We must understand this clearly. We are
    not saved _by_ doing the commandments (that is legalism). However, the
    _fruit_ of being saved is a life brought into harmony with God's law
    (Sanctification).
3.  **The Right to the Tree:** Christ's blood provides the title (the legal
    right) to heaven (Justification). The Holy Spirit's work of writing the law
    in our hearts provides the fitness (the character) to live there. Those who
    willfully reject God's commandments cannot enter the city, for they would
    start the rebellion all over again.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A passport gives you the legal right to enter a country.
A vaccine certificate shows you are healthy enough to enter without endangering
others. Christ’s blood is our passport (Justification). His Spirit producing
obedience is our certificate of health (Sanctification). We need both to enter
the City.
