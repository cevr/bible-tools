---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Nature of Salvation:**
  - The kingdom is a gift ("give you"), not earned by human merit.
  - This is the foundation of **Justification**; we receive it by faith.
- **The Father’s Attitude:**
  - It is God’s "good pleasure."
  - He is not reluctant to save; He delights in restoring His children.
- **Security:**
  - "Fear not" implies that despite being a "little flock" or marginalized, the outcome is secure in Christ.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

  - Imagine a wealthy king adopting a street orphan.

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Sanctuary & Grace)

- **The Throne of Grace:**
  - Represents the **Kingdom of Grace** reigning in the heart *now*.
  - Because Jesus is our High Priest, the judgment seat is a place of favor for the penitent.
- **Mercy vs. Grace:**
  - **Mercy:** Forgiveness for past sins (not receiving what we deserve).
  - **Grace:** Power to obey in the future (receiving power we do not deserve).
- **"Time of Need":**
  - This refers to our struggle with temptation.
  - The "grace to help" is the power of **Sanctification**—Christ's life imparted to us to overcome sin.

---

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

  - Source: Grace (God's unmerited love).
  - Instrument: Faith (The hand that grasps the gift).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**

  - **Justification:** Christ's perfect past life covers our past sins (Imputed).
  - **Sanctification:** Christ's present life is given for obedience (Imparted).
- **The Wages vs. The Gift:**
  - Death is earned (wages); Life is a gift.
