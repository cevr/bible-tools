## Slide 1 – Chapter 3: Power in the Word

- **Topic:** The instrument God uses in Creation and Salvation.
- **Core Theme:** God uses His Word to accomplish His will.
- **Comparison:**
  - Physical Creation: God did not use engines or tools; He used His Word.
  - Spiritual Re-creation: God uses the same instrument to save and transform.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** A reliance on the creative power of God’s Word to do what human effort cannot do.

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: Creative Power

- **Question:** What was the way in which God brought the heavens into existence?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 33:6-9 – “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth... For He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **Creative Power:** The universe was not formed from pre-existing matter but called into existence by the command (*fiat*) of the Almighty.
- **Word and Deed:**
  - For humans, a word is just a sound; we must act to fulfill it.
  - For God, the word *is* the deed. The power to fulfill the command is within the command itself (Isaiah 55:11 – “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void...”).
- **Immediate Obedience:** “He spake, and it was done.” There was no delay and no gradual evolution; matter obeyed instantly.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Artist vs. The Creator**
  - A master artist painting a sunrise must mix paints and work for hours to create an *image* of light.
  - When God created light, He simply said, “Let there be light.”
  - God did not need brushes or canvas.
  - **Lesson:** His word contained the reality of the light itself.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Sustaining the Universe

- **Question:** What is it that Christ uses to uphold all things?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 1:3 – “Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power...”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **Continuous Creation:**
  - Creation is not a clock wound up and left alone.
  - The same power that created the worlds is required to keep them existing moment by moment.
- **Laws of Nature:** Gravity and physics are simply the habits of God, maintained by His powerful Word.
- **Security for the Believer:**
  - If Christ’s Word can hold the stars in place, it can hold the believer in temptation.
  - Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: Willing Ignorance

- **Question:** Of what great truth are some willingly ignorant?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:5, 6 – “For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Skepticism:** Peter warns of those who deny God’s intervention in history (Creation and the Flood).
- **The Flood:**
  - Antediluvians mocked Noah because they saw no physical evidence of rain.
  - They trusted their senses rather than the Word of God.
  - The water held in check by God’s word was released by that same word.
- **The Lesson:** We must judge reality by what God has said, not by what we see.

---

## Slide 9 – Q4: Judgment by Fire

- **Question:** By what are the present heavens and earth reserved for a similar fate?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:7 – “But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **Kept in Store:** The only thing preventing the final fire from breaking out now is the "word" that keeps it in store.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, fire on the altar consumed the sacrifice.
  - In the final judgment, the fire of God’s glory consumes sin.
- **The Atonement:**
  - Romans 5:11 – “...by whom we have now received the atonement.”
  - Those covered by the Atonement are safe from the consuming fire because Christ has borne the judgment for them.

---

## Slide 11 – Q5: Sovereignty of God

- **Question:** What other passage of Scripture also reveals that creative power is exercised through the word of God?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 148:5 – “Let them praise the name of the Lord: for He commanded, and they were created.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points

- **Universal Praise:** The sun, moon, stars, and angels praise God because they owe their existence to His command.
- **Absolute Sovereignty:**
  - Inanimate creation obeys His voice instantly.
  - **Application:** How much more should man, created in God’s image, listen to and obey that Word?

---

## Slide 13 – Q6: The New Creation

- **Question:** What change is wrought out in the life of one who is in Christ?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points (Justification & Creation)

- **Spiritual Creation:** We move from physical creation to spiritual re-creation.
- **Justification:**
  - It is a legal declaration that a sinner is righteous (Romans 3:24).
  - It is also a *creative act*. God makes the believer a "new creature."
- **Newness of Life:**
  - Not a patch on the old life, but a new heart and mind (Ezekiel 36:26).
  - "Old things" (love of sin, pride) pass away as Christ takes possession.

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Wolf and the Sheep**
  - You cannot turn a wolf into a sheep by shearing it or feeding it grass; its nature remains predatory.
  - To change its nature would require a miracle of creation.
  - **Lesson:** Education and culture cannot turn a sinner into a saint. Only the Creator can install a new nature.

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: The New Birth

- **Question:** Jesus described this same experience in what other passage?
- **Key Text:** John 3:3 – “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points

- **Radical Change:** Jesus uses the metaphor of birth to explain conversion.
- **The Necessity:**
  - A man without the new birth *cannot* see the kingdom.
  - Heaven is a place of holiness; an unregenerate heart would find it a place of torture, being out of harmony with God.
- **The Method:** We cannot generate our own spiritual birth; it is the work of the Spirit received by faith.

---

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Agency of the Word

- **Question:** By what agency is this new creation or new birth accomplished?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:23 – “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Seed:**
  - A seed contains the life of the plant.
  - The Word of God is the "incorruptible seed" containing the life of Christ.
- **Receiving vs. Producing:**
  - We do not produce righteousness; we receive the Seed (the Word).
  - As the seed grows, it naturally produces the fruit of obedience (Galatians 5:22-23).
  - Our part is to receive and cherish the Word.

---

## Slide 20 – Q9: Light out of Darkness

- **Question:** What is the first creative commandment that is mentioned in the Bible?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:3 – “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points

- **Dealing with Darkness:**
  - God addressed the chaos and darkness of the deep.
  - He did not struggle with the darkness.
  - He introduced light, and the darkness vanished.
- **Application:** This is the pattern for how God deals with the darkness of sin in the human soul.

---

## Slide 22 – Q10: Spiritual Light

- **Question:** Did God also command another light to shine out of darkness?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 4:6 – “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points

- **The Dark Heart:** The human heart by nature is "darkness" (Ephesians 5:8); we cannot create light within ourselves.
- **The Divine Command:** God speaks forgiveness and grace into the heart.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the Holy Place, the **Candlestick** represented Christ, the Light of the World.
  - The Spirit illuminates the church through the Word.

---

## Slide 24 – Q11: Authority of Doctrine

- **Question:** What was it about Christ's teaching that astonished people?
- **Key Text:** Luke 4:32 – “And they were astonished at His doctrine: for His word was with power.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points

- **Source of Power:**
  - Scribes quoted human traditions and opinions.
  - Christ spoke from the Source; His word possessed inherent power to convict.
- **True Preaching:** It is not sharing human opinions, but delivering God’s Word which retains that same power today.

---

## Slide 26 – Q12: Power Over Spirits

- **Question:** What important fact testified to the power of Christ's word?
- **Key Text:** Luke 4:36 – “And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power He commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points (Spiritual Warfare)

- **The Great Controversy:** We are in a battle between Christ and Satan.
- **The Weapon:**
  - Logic and willpower cannot defeat the enemy.
  - Jesus defeated Satan by saying, "It is written" (Matthew 4:4).
  - We overcome by the "word of our testimony" (Revelation 12:11).

---

## Slide 28 – Q13: Healing Power

- **Question:** In ancient times, how did God bring healing to His people?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 107:20 – “He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.”

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Messenger:** The verse implies the Word is sent as a messenger to accomplish a task.
- **The Remedy:**
  - Healing (physical or spiritual) comes through the Word.
  - When we are sick with sin, the remedy is found in the promises of God.

---

## Slide 30 – Q14: The Centurion's Faith

- **Question:** In what way did the Roman centurion reveal his strong faith in Christ?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 8:8 – “The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.”

---

## Slide 31 – Q14: Key Points (Faith Defined)

- **Dependence on the Word:**
  - The Centurion did not ask for a sign or a touch.
  - He knew if Jesus simply *spoke*, the result was guaranteed.
- **True Faith:**
  - Faith is accepting God’s Word as fact *before* the result is seen.
  - We must believe the Word *only*, not wait for "feelings."

---

## Slide 32 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Reliable Check**
  - If a wealthy, reliable friend gives you a check, you consider the debt paid before you go to the bank.
  - You trust the "word" written on the paper.
  - **Lesson:** God’s promises are checks signed in the blood of Jesus. We may treat them as current reality.

---

## Slide 33 – Q15: The Seed of the Kingdom

- **Question:** What did Christ say is the seed of the kingdom of God?
- **Key Text:** Luke 8:11 – “Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q15: Key Points

- **Potential Life:**
  - A seed may look small, but it holds the germ of life.
  - The Bible contains the life of God within its pages.
- **Growth:**
  - Just as seed needs soil, the Word needs a receptive heart.
  - It produces "after its kind"—producing the character of Christ in the believer.

---

## Slide 35 – Q16: Indwelling Word

- **Question:** Where does God want Christ's word to dwell?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:16 – “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom...”

---

## Slide 36 – Q16: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **A Resident, Not a Visitor:** The Word is to "dwell" (live) in us.
- **Indwelling Christ:** To have the Word dwell in us is to have Christ dwell in us (John 1:14).
- **Sanctification:** The process of the Word taking over the mind, replacing worldly thoughts with God’s thoughts.

---

## Slide 37 – Q17: Unbelief

- **Question:** Could those who believed not on Jesus Christ receive this important seed?
- **Key Text:** John 5:38 – “And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.”

---

## Slide 38 – Q17: Key Points

- **The Obstacle:** Unbelief shuts the door to the Word.
- **Religious but Empty:**
  - The leaders memorized Scripture, but the Word did not *abide* in them because they rejected Christ.
  - We cannot separate the written Word from the Living Word.

---

## Slide 39 – Q18: Effectual Working

- **Question:** How does the Word of God work in the life of the believer?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 2:13 – “...when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.”

---

## Slide 40 – Q18: Key Points

- **Not Human Opinion:** If the Bible is merely good advice, it cannot save. We must receive it as God's voice.
- **Active Energy:**
  - "Effectually worketh" (Greek: *energeia*) means it is active.
  - The Word energizes the will to obey.
- **God Works in Us:**
  - Philippians 2:13 – “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q19: Partaking of Divine Nature

- **Question:** What new nature is imparted to us through the promises of God?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:4 – “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”

---

## Slide 42 – Q19: Key Points (Victory over Sin)

- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - We partake of the divine nature through God's *promises*.
  - Every promise contains the power to fulfill itself.
- **Escaping Corruption:**
  - We do not escape by physical isolation but by holding to the promises.
  - The divine nature expels the carnal nature as light expels darkness.

---

## Slide 43 – Q19: Illustration

- **The Diving Bell**
  - A diver remains dry underwater if he is inside a diving bell.
  - He is *in* the water, but not *of* the water.
  - **Lesson:** Through the "diving bell" of God's promises, the believer is surrounded by the atmosphere of heaven and kept from the corruption of the world.

---

## Slide 44 – Q20: Cleansing

- **Question:** What is it that can cleanse the lives of believers in Christ?
- **Key Text:** John 15:3 – “Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.”

---

## Slide 45 – Q20: Key Points & Sanctuary

- **Cleansing Power:** Just as water cleanses the body, the Word cleanses the mind and conscience.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The **Laver** in the courtyard was where priests washed before entering the Holy Place.
  - Ephesians 5:26 – “That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.”
- **Justification:** Christ pronounces us clean, and His word provides the reality of that purity.

---

## Slide 46 – Q21: Cleansing the Way

- **Question:** How can a young man cleanse his ways?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 119:9 – “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.”

---

## Slide 47 – Q21: Key Points

- **Practical Application:** How can one remain pure while facing strong temptations?
- **The Standard:** The Word is the standard of right and wrong.
- **Taking Heed:** This means aligning one's life with the Word, using Scripture as the guide for every decision.

---

## Slide 48 – Q22: Result of Accepting the Word

- **Question:** What is the result of accepting the Word of God into the heart and life?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 119:11 – “Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.”

---

## Slide 49 – Q22: Key Points

- **The Antidote to Sin:** The Word is the defense against temptation.
- **Hiding the Word:**
  - Memorizing, meditating, and storing the Word in the affections.
  - When temptation comes, the Spirit brings the "hidden" Word to remembrance.
- **Christ’s Example:**
  - Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”
  - As we behold Him in the Word, we are changed into His image.
