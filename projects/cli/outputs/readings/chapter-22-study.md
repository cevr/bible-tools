Chapter 22

### God's Willingness to Forgive

The study of God’s forgiveness is the study of the very heart of the gospel. It
reveals not only how God removes the guilt of the past but also how He restores
the sinner to favor and purity. In the light of the sanctuary message, we see
that forgiveness is not merely an administrative act, but a transformative
process where the blood of the Sacrifice (justification) and the power of the
High Priest (sanctification) work together to save the human soul.

### Q1. In what way has God dealt with penitent sinners?

"He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our
iniquities." Ps. 103:10.

**Answer:** The Psalmist here highlights the distinction between strict justice
and covenant mercy. If God were to deal with us "after our sins" (according to
what we deserve), the result would be immediate and eternal death, for "the
wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23).

1.  **Mercy Over Judgment:** God holds back the immediate execution of judgment
    to provide a time of probation—a period where the sinner may repent and turn
    to Him.
2.  **The Substitute:** The reason God can spare the sinner without ignoring the
    law is found in the plan of salvation. The penalty of our iniquities was
    laid upon Jesus Christ. Because He bore the "reward" of our iniquities on
    the cross, God can offer us mercy.
3.  **The Penitent Heart:** This verse specifically comforts the _penitent_
    (sorrowful and repentant) sinner. To the proud and unrepentant, the law
    remains a condemning force; but to the broken heart, God reveals His grace.

**Definition:**

- **Penitent:** Feeling deep sorrow and regret for having sinned, leading to a
  desire to change.

**[ILL]** Imagine a man who has amassed a debt he can never repay. Strict
justice demands he be sold into servitude to pay it. But a wealthy benefactor
steps in and pays the debt in full. The creditor no longer deals with the debtor
according to his debt, but according to the benefactor’s payment. So God deals
with us according to Christ’s merit, not our own lack.

---

### Q2. Why has He dealt thus with men?

"For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them
that fear Him." Ps. 103: 11.

**Answer:** The motivation for God’s forgiveness is His own character of
infinite love.

- **Infinite Measure:** The distance between heaven and earth is immeasurable to
  the human eye; likewise, God's mercy is beyond human calculation. It is not
  shallow or temporary; it is vast enough to cover every sin that is repented
  of.
- **Reverence Required:** The text notes this mercy is toward "them that fear
  Him." This is not a terror-based fear, but a holy reverence that acknowledges
  God’s authority and hates sin.
- **The Sanctuary Type:** In the earthly sanctuary, the "mercy seat" was placed
  _above_ the Ark of the Covenant containing the Ten Commandments. This
  illustrates that while the law is the standard of righteousness, God’s mercy
  (sprinkled with blood) covers the transgressor who comes to Him in faith.

### Q3. What is God ready to do for all who call upon Him?

"For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all
them that call upon thee." Ps. 86:5.

**Answer:** Many struggle with the idea that God is reluctant to forgive—that He
must be begged or persuaded to love us. This verse corrects that error.

- **Ready to Forgive:** God is essentially "standing at the door," waiting for
  the sinner to knock. He requires no persuasion; the urge to forgive comes from
  His own nature. The barrier is never God's unwillingness; it is man's
  impenitence.
- **Plenteous Mercy:** His supply of grace is not limited. As the Apostle Paul
  writes, "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound" (Romans 5:20).
- **The Condition:** The only requirement is to "call upon thee." This implies a
  recognition of need and a dependence on God’s power to save.

**[ILL]** A reservoir full of water stands ready to supply a city. It does not
need to be created; it only needs the tap to be opened. God’s mercy is the
reservoir; our prayer of faith is the opening of the tap.

### Q4. When Abraham asked God to spare Sodom if He should find ten righteous persons therein, what did the Lord say?

"And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once:
Peradventure ten shall be found there. And He said, I will not destroy it for
ten's sake." Gen. 18:32.

**Answer:** This dialogue reveals God’s immense desire to save rather than
destroy.

- **The Value of the Righteous:** God is willing to spare a multitude of wicked
  people for the sake of a tiny remnant of righteous ones. This shows that
  righteousness (right doing by faith) has a preserving power in the world.
- **God's Patience:** Abraham stopped asking at ten, but God’s willingness did
  not end there. God eventually saved the only righteous ones found (Lot and his
  family) before destruction came. He separates the righteous from the wicked
  before judgment falls.
- **Intercession:** Abraham acted as a mediator. Today, we have a better
  Mediator, Jesus Christ, who "ever liveth to make intercession" for us in the
  heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 7:25).

### Q5. What prayer did Moses offer in behalf of Israel?

"Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the
greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even
until now." Num. 14:19.

**Answer:** Moses, functioning as a type of Christ, intercedes for a rebellious
people.

- **Appeal to Character:** Moses does not argue that Israel deserves
  forgiveness. He argues based on the "greatness of Thy mercy." True prayer
  relies on God’s reputation, not our own goodness.
- **Consistent Forgiveness:** Moses reminds God (and the people) that His
  history with them has been one of repeated pardon. The Christian life is often
  a series of stumbling and being lifted up again by grace until the character
  is fully transformed.

**Definition:**

- **Intercession:** The act of pleading on behalf of another. Christ does this
  for us by presenting the merits of His blood before the Father.

---

### Q6. What reply did the Lord immediately make?

"And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to Thy word." Num. 14:20.

**Answer:**

- **Immediate Response:** There was no hesitation. God answered the prayer of
  the mediator instantly.
- **Power of Mediation:** This demonstrates the efficacy of our High Priest’s
  work. When Christ pleads His blood for a repentant sinner, the Father accepts
  the plea immediately. There is no friction between the Father and the Son;
  they are one in the work of redemption.

### Q7. When David confessed his great sin, what did God do for him?

"I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I
will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the iniquity of
my sin." Ps. 32:5.

**Answer:** David’s experience teaches the necessity of transparency with God.

1.  **Stopping the Silence:** Before this confession, David kept silence and his
    "bones waxed old" (Psalm 32:3)—the guilt was destroying him physically and
    spiritually.
2.  **Uncovering Sin:** Humans try to hide sin; faith uncovers it. "He that
    covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them
    shall have mercy" (Proverbs 28:13).
3.  **Immediate Release:** As with Moses, the moment the confession was genuine
    ("I said, I will confess..."), the forgiveness was granted ("Thou
    forgavest").

**[ILL]** A festering wound cannot heal if it is covered up and ignored. It must
be opened, cleaned, and exposed to the physician’s care. Confession is opening
the wound of sin to the Great Physician so He can apply the healing balm of His
blood.

### Q8. Does the lord forgive sins when they are confessed to Him?

"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9.

**Answer:** This is one of the most powerful verses on Righteousness by Faith in
the entire Bible. It presents a dual work of grace:

1.  **Forgiveness (Justification):** God removes the legal condemnation of sin.
    He is "faithful" to His promise and "just" because Christ has paid the
    penalty.
2.  **Cleansing (Sanctification):** God does not merely forgive the record of
    the past; He cleanses the heart from the defilement of sin. The goal is to
    remove "all unrighteousness."
3.  **The Process:** We must confess specific sins. A vague "I’m a sinner" is
    often not enough to break the power of sin. We must agree with God about the
    specific things that separate us from Him.

**Key Definitions:**

- **Justification:** God declaring the sinner righteous because of Christ's
  merits (imputed righteousness).
- **Sanctification:** God making the sinner holy in character through the
  indwelling Spirit (imparted righteousness).

**[ILL]** If a child falls in the mud, a loving parent does two things: First,
they forgive the child for being careless (restore the relationship). Second,
they wash the mud off the child (restore cleanliness). God forgives the guilt
_and_ washes away the stain of sin from our character.

### Q9. How full is the Lord's forgiveness, when one fulfills the conditions?

"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let
him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for
He will abundantly pardon." Isa. 55:7.

**Answer:** Here we see the conditions of genuine repentance which lead to
abundant pardon.

- **Forsaking the Way (Action):** Repentance is more than a feeling; it is a
  change of direction. The "way" or lifestyle of sin must be abandoned by God's
  enabling grace.
- **Forsaking the Thoughts (Mind):** Sin begins in the mind. True Righteousness
  by Faith involves bringing "into captivity every thought to the obedience of
  Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:5). We must ask God to change our very way of
  thinking.
- **Abundant Pardon:** God does not forgive grudgingly or partially. He pardons
  "abundantly"—enough to cover the sin and enough to restore the soul.

**Definition:**

- **Repentance:** A sorrow for sin and a turning away from it. It is a gift from
  God (Acts 5:31).

---

### Q10. In what special manner has God shown His willingness to forgive the sinner?

"But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
Christ died for us." Rom. 5:8.

**Answer:** The Cross is the ultimate proof of God’s willingness to forgive.

- **Preemptive Love:** God did not wait for the world to become righteous before
  sending Jesus. He acted while we were "yet sinners"—enemies of God.
- **The Cost of Forgiveness:** Forgiveness is free to us, but it cost Heaven
  everything. In the earthly sanctuary, an animal had to die to provide blood
  for atonement. In the reality, the Son of God had to die to provide the
  cleansing stream. This proves that God’s love is self-sacrificing and
  unconditional.

---

### Q11. What does this wonderful manifestation on the part of God, vouchsafe to us?

"He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He
not with Him also freely give us all things?" Rom. 8:32.

**Answer:** This is the logic of heaven: If God has already given the greatest
gift (His Son), He will certainly not withhold the lesser gifts needed for our
salvation.

- **"All Things":** What does this include? It includes the power to overcome
  sin, the Holy Spirit, wisdom, daily bread, and the grace to endure trials.
- **Assurance:** The believer need not fear that God will abandon them in their
  struggle for holiness. If He gave Jesus to die for you, He will give the
  Spirit to live in you.

---

### Q12. Why has such full provision been made?

"The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but
is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance." 2 Peter 3:9.

**Answer:**

- **God’s Will:** It is not God’s will that a single human being be lost. Hell
  was prepared for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41), not for man.
- **The Purpose of Time:** The delay in Christ’s Second Coming is an act of
  mercy. It provides time for the message of the gospel to reach every heart,
  giving everyone an opportunity to choose life.
- **Universal Call:** While not all will be saved, the _provision_ has been made
  for all. The tragedy of the lost is that they reject a pardon that has already
  been purchased for them.

### Q13. When the prodigal son, in the parable, repented and turned toward home, what did his father do?

"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his
father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed
him." Luke 15:20.

**Answer:** This parable is Jesus' description of the Father’s attitude toward
the repentant sinner.

- **God is Watching:** The father saw the son "a great way off." This implies he
  was watching daily for his return.
- **God Runs:** In that culture, it was undignified for an older man to run.
  Yet, the father runs to the son. God is in a hurry to bridge the gap between
  sin and righteousness when He sees a heart turning toward Him.
- **No Probationary Period:** The father did not make the son wait outside until
  he proved he was good enough. He embraced him in his rags. Acceptance comes
  first; the changing of the clothes (character transformation) follows.

---

### Q14. Upon the son's asking to be made only a hired servant, what order was issued in behalf of the penitent one?

"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on
him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the
fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: For this my son was
dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be
merry." Luke 15:22-24.

**Answer:** The son hoped to be a servant (legalism/working for favor), but the
father restored him as a son (grace/relationship).

1.  **The Best Robe:** This represents the **Righteousness of Christ**. In
    Zechariah 3, Joshua the High Priest stands in filthy garments (our sins) and
    is given "change of raiment." We are covered in Christ's perfection
    (Justification).
2.  **The Ring:** A sign of authority and belonging to the family.
3.  **The Shoes:** Servants often went barefoot; sons wore shoes. This
    represents the preparation to walk in newness of life (Ephesians 6:15).
4.  **Alive Again:** Sin is spiritual death. Forgiveness is spiritual
    resurrection.

**[ILL]** We come to God offering to do the work of a servant to "pay Him back."
God refuses our payment, adopts us as sons and daughters, clothes us in His own
character, and then empowers us to serve Him out of love, not debt.

---

### Q15. Is God willing to do for His children as earthly parents are for theirs?

"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how
much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"
Luke 11:13.

**Answer:**

- **The Argument from Lesser to Greater:** If flawed, sinful human parents
  naturally want to feed and help their crying children, how much more does the
  perfect God of love want to help us?
- **The Specific Gift:** Notice the promise is specifically for the **Holy
  Spirit**. Why? Because the Spirit brings the presence of Christ into the soul.
  It is the Spirit that writes the law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10) and empowers
  us to overcome sin. God is more willing to give us the power to be holy than
  parents are to give bread to a hungry child.

---

### Q16. How many receive forgiveness from God?

"Everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that
knocketh it shall be opened." Matt. 7:8.

**Answer:**

- **Universal Availability:** "Everyone" leaves no one out. The worst sinner,
  the backslider, and the pharisee are all invited.
- **The Persistence of Faith:** Asking, seeking, and knocking implies active
  faith. We do not earn forgiveness, but we must actively pursue God. We must
  hunger and thirst after righteousness (Matthew 5:6).
- **Certainty:** The text does not say "might receive." It says "receiveth." We
  can claim this promise with absolute confidence.

---

### Q17. Does the Lord forget the cries of those who call upon Him?

"Can a woman forget her sucking child?...Yea, they may forget, yet will I not
forget thee." Isa. 49:15.

**Answer:**

- **Stronger than Nature:** The strongest human bond known is that of a nursing
  mother to her infant. It is almost biologically impossible for her to forget
  her child. Yet, in a fallen world, even this love can fail.
- **The Unfailing Covenant:** God’s love transcends even maternal instinct. He
  cannot forget His children.
- **Graven on His Hands:** The following verse (Isa 49:16) says, "I have graven
  thee upon the palms of my hands." This is a prophetic reference to the scars
  of the crucifixion. Christ bears the marks of His love for us eternally. When
  He looks at His hands in the heavenly sanctuary, He sees the price paid for
  your soul, and He remembers you.

**[ILL]** A mother may, in madness or sin, abandon her child. But Christ, having
paid the infinite price of His life for us, has bound Himself to us with cords
that cannot be broken by anything but our own persistent rejection of Him. We
are safe in His remembrance.
