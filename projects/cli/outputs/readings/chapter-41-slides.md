## Slide 1 – Q1: The Faithful Captives

- **Question:** Among the captives taken at Jerusalem and carried to Babylon,
  who were the most prominent?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 1:6 – “Now among these were of the children of Judah,
  Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Character and Preparation

- **The Remnant Principle:**
  - Even in captivity, God preserves a faithful remnant.
  - These men represent believers living in the world ("Babylon") while
    maintaining citizenship in heaven.
  - Philippians 3:20 – “For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we
    look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:”
- **Preparation for Crisis:**
  - Their prominence began with small decisions of temperance (Daniel 1:8).
  - **Sanctification:** This is the practical work of daily choosing God's will
    over fleshly appetites.
  - Physical health provided the mental clarity needed to understand spiritual
    laws.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Righteousness by Faith

- **Source of Strength:**
  - Their ability to stand was not of themselves; it was the result of total
    surrender to God.
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** When we surrender the will to Christ, He imparts
    His power to us to overcome the world.
  - Philippians 4:13 – “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
    me.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Diamond on Velvet:**
  - Imagine a diamond placed on black velvet.
  - The darker the background, the more brilliant the light reflected by the
    diamond.
- **The Lesson:**
  - In the dark spiritual atmosphere of Babylon, the character of these Hebrews
    shone brightly because they reflected God’s light.
  - A Christian’s character is most visible when the surrounding culture is
    darkest.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon

- **Question:** Who was Nebuchadnezzar?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 1:1 – “In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king
  of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged
  it.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Sovereignty and Typology

- **God’s Sovereignty:**
  - Nebuchadnezzar thought he conquered by his own strength, but Scripture says
    the Lord gave the city into his hand (Daniel 1:2).
  - God sometimes uses secular powers to discipline His people.
- **Babylon as a Type:**
  - In prophecy, Babylon represents confusion and religion mixed with worldly
    power.
  - **Spiritual Babylon:** Just as literal Babylon besieged Jerusalem, false
    systems of worship attack the true church (Revelation 17:5).
  - Revelation 17:5 – “And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY,
    BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Troubled King

- **Question:** What caused sleep to depart from Nebuchadnezzar?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:1 – “And in the second year of the reign of
  Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was
  troubled, and his sleep brake from him.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Search for Peace

- **The Unrest of the World:**
  - Wealth and power cannot purchase peace of mind.
  - Isaiah 57:21 – “There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.”
- **The Holy Spirit’s Conviction:**
  - God disturbed the king's sleep as an act of mercy to get his attention.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Like a sinner bringing a sacrifice to the outer court, the king is brought
    to a place of helplessness where he must seek an answer outside of himself.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Pebble in the Shoe:**
  - A man may own a soft bed of silk, yet if his conscience is uneasy, the bed
    feels like stone.
  - God sometimes places a "pebble" in the shoe of our comfortable lives.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Discomfort is often God's way of making us stop and ask for directions.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Failure of Human Wisdom

- **Question:** When he applied to his magicians for an interpretation of his
  dream, what did they say?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:10, 11 – “The Chaldeans answered before the king, and
  said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter... And
  it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can
  shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: True vs. False Theology

- **The Failure of Earthly Wisdom:**
  - Worldly philosophy is helpless to reveal the secrets of God.
  - 1 Corinthians 3:19 – “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.
    For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.”
- **The Incarnation:**
  - The magicians claimed gods do _not_ dwell with flesh.
  - The Gospel truth is that Jesus became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14).
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** God does not remain distant; He dwells _in_ His
    people by the Holy Spirit (Colossians 1:27).
  - Colossians 1:27 – “To whom God would make known what is the riches of the
    glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope
    of glory:”

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Death Decree

- **Question:** In his anger, what decree did the king make?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:12 – “For this cause the king was angry and very
  furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Wrath of the Dragon

- **Persecution Foretold:**
  - When worldly powers cannot solve problems or silence truth, they resort to
    force.
  - Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
    make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God,
    and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”
- **No Neutral Ground:**
  - Daniel was not present with the magicians, yet he was subject to the decree.
  - In the final crisis, even those who quietly serve God will face the wrath of
    the state.

## Slide 14 – Q6: Daniel’s Response

- **Question:** To avoid suffering the consequences of the decree, what did
  Daniel do?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:16 – “Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that
  he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Faith and Intercession

- **Faith in Action:**
  - Daniel did not yet have the answer, but he acted with wisdom and requested
    time.
  - He believed God would not abandon him.
- **The Role of Intercession:**
  - Daniel stood between the king's wrath and the wise men.
  - He acted as a type of Christ, who intercedes to save the perishing.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Captain in the Storm:**
  - When a storm hits a ship, passengers panic, but the captain who knows his
    vessel remains calm.
  - Daniel knew his God.
- **The Lesson:**
  - While Babylon was in panic, Daniel was at peace because his anchor was cast
    within the veil.
  - Hebrews 6:19 – “Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
    steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;”

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Secret Revealed

- **Question:** After he and his three companions had prayed to God about the
  matter, how was the interpretation made known?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:19 – “Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a
  night vision.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Prayer and Revelation

- **United Prayer:**
  - There is power when God's people unite in intercession.
  - Matthew 18:19 – “Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on
    earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them
    of my Father which is in heaven.”
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - In the sanctuary, the priest stood at the Altar of Incense (prayer) before
    the veil.
  - God spoke from the Most Holy Place.
  - Daniel and his friends were at the altar of prayer, and God sent light from
    the throne.

## Slide 19 – Q8: The King’s Question

- **Question:** Afterward, when Daniel was brought in before the king, what
  question was asked him?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:26 – “Art thou able to make known unto me the dream
  which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Human vs. Divine Ability

- **The World’s Perspective:**
  - The world looks to the human agent: "Art _thou_ able?"
- **The Believer’s Reality:**
  - The Christian knows that in the flesh dwells no good thing.
  - Romans 7:18 – “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no
    good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is
    good I find not.”
  - We are not able, but He is able.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Daniel’s Humble Answer

- **Question:** What humble and impressive answer did Daniel return?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:28 – “There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets,
  and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Giving Glory to God

- **True Humility:**
  - Daniel deflected glory from himself to God.
  - Psalm 115:1 – “Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give
    glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.”
- **The Latter Days:**
  - The prophecy extends to the end of time ("eschatology").

## Slide 23 – Q9: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Clothed in His Wisdom:**
  - Just as Daniel claimed no wisdom of his own, the believer claims no
    righteousness of his own.
  - We stand before the King of the Universe only clothed in the wisdom and
    righteousness of Christ.
  - 1 Corinthians 1:30 – “But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made
    unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:”

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Great Image

- **Question:** What had the king seen in his dream?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:31 – “Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image.
  This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the
  form thereof was terrible.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Man’s View vs. God’s View

- **Human Glory:**
  - The image represents worldly kingdoms as man sees them: bright, glorious,
    and imposing.
  - It is a monument to human achievement.
- **God’s View:**
  - In Daniel 7, God reveals these same kingdoms as ravenous beasts.
  - Man looks on the outward appearance; God sees the heart.

## Slide 26 – Q11: The Metals

- **Question:** Of what were the different parts of the image composed?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:32, 33 – “This image's head was of fine gold, his
  breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of
  iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: The Flow of History

- **Devolution of History:**
  - Contrary to evolution, prophecy shows a decline in moral value (Gold ->
    Silver -> Brass -> Iron).
- **Increase in Strength:**
  - While value decreases, military strength/hardness increases (Gold is soft;
    Iron is hard).

## Slide 28 – Q11: Illustration

- **The River of Time:**
  - History is like a river flowing downstream.
  - It does not rise to higher purity on its own; it collects the mud and debris
    of the ages.
- **Lesson:**
  - Only the power of God can reverse the current of the human heart.

## Slide 29 – Q12: The Stone

- **Question:** What did the king see happen to the image?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:34 – “Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without
  hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and
  brake them to pieces.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Supernatural Intervention

- **Without Hands:**
  - This phrase denotes a divine work, not human effort.
- **Spiritual Application (Justification):**
  - Our salvation is also "cut out without hands"—it is not of works.
  - Ephesians 2:8-9 – “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
    yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”
- **Timing:**
  - The strike happens at the _feet_ (the end of time).

## Slide 31 – Q13: The Destruction of the Image

- **Question:** What then took place?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:35 – “Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the
  silver, and gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the
  summer threshing floors;... and the stone that smote the image became a great
  mountain, and filled the whole earth.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Judgment and Cleansing

- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - "Chaff of the summer threshing floors" calls to mind the judgment.
  - Matthew 3:12 – “Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
    floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff
    with unquenchable fire.”
- **Total Cleansing:**
  - Sin and rebellious governments must be blotted out for peace to reign.
  - The Kingdom of God replaces, rather than coexists with, earthly regimes.

## Slide 33 – Q14: The Head of Gold

- **Question:** Having told the dream, how did Daniel proceed to explain the
  head of gold?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:37, 38 – “Thou, O king, art a king of kings... Thou are
  this head of gold.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Babylon (605–539 B.C.)

- **Golden Splendor:**
  - Babylon was known for immense wealth; Isaiah 14:4 calls it "the golden
    city."
- **Stewardship of Power:**
  - Daniel reminds Nebuchadnezzar that his power was a gift from God.
  - All leaders are stewards who must give an account to the King of kings.

## Slide 35 – Q15: The Second Kingdom

- **Question:** What was to be the nature of the next kingdom after Babylon?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:39 (first part) – “After thee shall arise another
  kingdom inferior to thee.”

## Slide 36 – Q15: Inferiority and Historicism

- **Historical Fact:**
  - Medo-Persia was larger territorially but inferior in luxury and absolute
    power compared to Babylon.
- **Definition: Historicism:**
  - The method of interpreting prophecy as a continuous unfolding of history
    from the prophet's time until the Second Coming.

## Slide 37 – Q16: The Fall of Babylon

- **Question:** Who was the last Babylonian king?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 5:30, 31 – “In that night was Belshazzar the king of the
  Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about
  threescore and two years old.”

## Slide 38 – Q16: Belshazzar’s Judgment

- **The Handwriting on the Wall:**
  - Belshazzar defied God by using sanctuary vessels for a drunken party.
- **Investigative Judgment Type:**
  - Daniel 5:27 – “TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
    wanting.”
  - This illustrates that God investigates lives before executing judgment.
  - There is a point where probation closes.

## Slide 39 – Q17: Medo-Persia

- **Question:** To whom was Belshazzar's kingdom given?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 5:28 – “Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes
  and Persians.”

## Slide 40 – Q17: The Silver Kingdom (539–331 B.C.)

- **Fulfillment:**
  - Occurred in 539 B.C. when Cyrus the Great and Darius conquered Babylon.
- **Prophetic Accuracy:**
  - God named Cyrus by name through Isaiah roughly 150 years before his birth.
  - Isaiah 45:1 – “Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right
    hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him...”

## Slide 41 – Q18: The Ram Symbol

- **Question:** By what symbol is the Medo-Persian empire elsewhere represented?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:20 – “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are
  the kings of Media and Persia.”

## Slide 42 – Q18: Repeat and Enlarge

- **Prophetic Principle:**
  - God repeats prophecies using different symbols to add detail.
  - **Daniel 2 (Image):** Political history.
  - **Daniel 7 (Beasts):** Political history + Religious persecution.
  - **Daniel 8 (Ram/Goat):** Conflict between East/West + Sanctuary cleansing.

## Slide 43 – Q19: The He-Goat

- **Question:** What beast was seen to come against him?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:5-6 – “An he-goat came from the west on the face of the
  whole earth... And he came to the ram that had two horns... and ran unto him
  in the fury of his power.”

## Slide 44 – Q19: The Greek Conquest

- **Symbolism:**
  - **Direction:** Came from the "west" (Greece is west of Persia).
  - **Speed:** "Touched not the ground" (v. 5) indicates the incredible speed of
    conquest.

## Slide 45 – Q20: The Contest

- **Question:** What was the result of this contest?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:7-8 – “And I saw him come close unto the ram... and
  smote the ram, and brake his two horns... Therefore the he-goat waxed very
  great.”

## Slide 46 – Q20: Alexander the Great

- **Historical Fulfillment:**
  - Represents the Greek conquest of Persia (Battle of Gaugamela, 331 B.C.).
- **The Broken Horn:**
  - The "great horn" being broken refers to the sudden death of Alexander the
    Great at the height of his power.

## Slide 47 – Q21: Identification of the Goat

- **Question:** What did the goat represent?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:21 – “And the rough goat is the king of Grecia.”

## Slide 48 – Q21: The Bible Dictionary

- **Interpreting Scripture:**
  - We do not need to guess the meaning of the symbols.
  - The Bible provides its own interpretation: The Goat = Greece.

## Slide 49 – Q22: The Brass Kingdom

- **Question:** By what is Grecia represented in the image?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:39 – “And another third kingdom of brass, which shall
  bear rule over all the earth.”

## Slide 50 – Q22: Greece (331–168 B.C.)

- **The Brazen Kingdom:**
  - Greek soldiers were famous for bronze armor (helmets, breastplates,
    shields).
- **Cultural Rule:**
  - It would "bear rule over all the earth."
  - Even after Greece fell politically, its culture (Hellenism) and language
    ruled the world, influencing the writing of the New Testament.

## Slide 51 – Q23: The Fourth Kingdom

- **Question:** What is said of the fourth kingdom?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:40 – “And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron:
  forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that
  breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.”

## Slide 52 – Q23: Rome (168 B.C. – 476 A.D.)

- **The Iron Monarchy:**
  - Rome was known for iron discipline and ruthless ability to crush opposition.
  - Rome absorbed the territories of Babylon, Persia, and Greece, dismantling
    their independence.

## Slide 53 – Q24: Rome in the New Testament

- **Question:** Where is such a power brought to view?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:1 – “And it came to pass in those days, that there went
  out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.”

## Slide 54 – Q24: The Iron Legs and Christ

- **Historical Context:**
  - The New Testament confirms Rome as the ruling power during Christ's life.
  - **Caesar Augustus:** The first Roman Emperor.
  - **The Crucifixion:** A Roman governor (Pilate) sentenced Jesus; Roman
    soldiers executed Him.
  - The "Iron" legs attempted to crush the "Stone," but in dying, the Stone
    conquered death.

## Slide 55 – Q25: The Feet of Iron and Clay

- **Question:** What was indicated by the mixture of clay and iron in the feet
  and toes?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:41 – “And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part
  of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided.”

## Slide 56 – Q25: Divided Europe

- **No Fifth Universal Empire:**
  - Rome was not conquered by a stronger metal; it fragmented into the nations
    of Europe (the toes).
- **Iron and Clay Mixture:**
  - **Political:** Attempts to unite Europe have historically failed ("shall not
    cleave one to another," Dan 2:43).
  - **Religious:** Clay represents God's people (Jeremiah 18:6). "Miry clay"
    suggests an apostate church.
  - Represents the union of Church and State.

## Slide 57 – Q25: Illustration

- **Iron Filings and Clay Powder:**
  - You can mix iron filings and clay in a bucket, but they never fuse into a
    solid substance.
  - Stress causes them to fall apart.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Human attempts to unite the world without God will fail because there is no
    internal cohesion of love.

## Slide 58 – Q26: God’s Kingdom

- **Question:** What is to take place in the days of these kings?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:44 – “And in the days of these kings shall the God of
  heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed... but it shall break
  in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.”

## Slide 59 – Q26: The Second Coming

- **The Stone Strikes:**
  - This is not a gradual spiritual conversion of the world.
  - It is the literal, visible return of Jesus Christ to destroy earthly
    regimes.
  - Revelation 19:11 – “And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and
    he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he
    doth judge and make war.”

## Slide 60 – Q26: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Broken on the Rock:**
  - To be part of the Stone Kingdom, our stony hearts must be broken now.
  - Matthew 21:44 – “And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but
    on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.”
  - Psalm 51:17 – “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
    contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.”
  - **Justification:** We enter the kingdom now by faith and repentance.

## Slide 61 – Q27: Certainty of Prophecy

- **Question:** Can there be any doubt regarding the fulfillment of this
  prophecy?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 2:45 – “The great God hath made known to the king what
  shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation
  thereof sure.”

## Slide 62 – Q27: The Track Record

- **Prophecy Fulfilled:**
  1. Babylon (Passed)
  2. Medo-Persia (Passed)
  3. Greece (Passed)
  4. Rome (Passed)
  5. Divided Europe (Current Condition)
- **The Conclusion:**
  - Since the first five parts were fulfilled to the letter, we can have
    absolute confidence that the final event—the Kingdom of God—is sure.

## Slide 63 – Q27: Illustration

- **The Roadmap:**
  - If a map marks six cities on a journey, and you successfully pass the first
    five exactly as described, you do not doubt the existence of the sixth.
- **The Blessed Hope:**
  - We are living in the "toes" of the image.
  - We are approaching the gates of the Kingdom of God.
