### Q1. What does the ninth commandment forbid?
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." Ex. 20:16.

**Answer:**
The law of God is a transcript of His character, and because God is a God of truth (Deuteronomy 32:4), His law forbids all manner of deception. The ninth commandment extends far beyond perjury in a court of law; it encompasses any speech that conveys a false impression or unjustly damages the reputation of another.

1.  **The Nature of False Witness:**
    *   This commandment prohibits lying, exaggeration, and the spreading of unverified reports (Exodus 23:1).
    *   It forbids silence when truth should be spoken to defend the innocent, as well as speech that is malicious.
    *   It strikes at the very root of the "accuser of the brethren," Satan, who is the father of lies (John 8:44; Revelation 12:10).

2.  **The Sanctity of Reputation:**
    *   A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches (Proverbs 22:1). To rob a person of their good name through gossip or insinuation is a form of theft often more damaging than stealing property.
    *   **Love fulfills the law:** True commandment-keeping is rooted in love. Love "thinketh no evil" and "rejoiceth in the truth" (1 Corinthians 13:5–6).

3.  **The Spirit of the Law:**
    *   While the letter of the law forbids lying, the spirit of the law requires us to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15).
    *   It calls for strict veracity in every business transaction, social interaction, and religious declaration.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a man who takes a feather pillow to the top of a bell tower on a windy day, cuts it open, and shakes the feathers out. The wind carries them over the entire town. If he regrets his action later, can he go and gather every feather back? Impossible. So it is with words of gossip and false witness. Once spoken, they travel on the winds of rumor, and no amount of apology can fully undo the damage done to a neighbor’s reputation.

### Q2. How is such a man regarded?
"If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body." James 3:2.

**Answer:**
The Bible sets a high standard for the believer, showing that the control of the tongue is the truest test of a sanctified life.

1.  **The Test of Perfection:**
    *   **Christian Perfection:** This does not mean that a man has never sinned, but that he has reached a level of spiritual maturity where the Spirit of God has full control over his will (Matthew 5:48; Colossians 1:28).
    *   If the tongue—the most unruly member—is subdued by the grace of Christ, it proves that the entire citadel of the soul has been surrendered to God.

2.  **The Bridle of the Body:**
    *   Just as a bit in a horse's mouth controls the whole animal, the sanctification of speech indicates the sanctification of the whole person (James 3:3).
    *   A loose tongue suggests a loose Christian experience; a bridled tongue suggests a disciplined, Spirit-filled life.

3.  **Sanctification Defined:**
    *   *Sanctification:* The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the believer is cleansed from sin and restored to the image of Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23). It is not a moment of feeling, but a lifetime of yielding.
    *   The control of the tongue is a primary fruit of this work.

### Q3. To what double use is the tongue put?
"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be." James 3:10.

**Answer:**
James highlights the inconsistency of the carnal nature, which attempts to serve two masters. This double use of the tongue reveals a divided heart.

1.  **The Hypocrisy of Double Speech:**
    *   It is a grievous sin to praise God in the sanctuary on Sabbath and then criticize or "curse" (speak evil of) His children during the week.
    *   Man was made in the "similitude of God" (James 3:9). When we tear down a human being with our words, we are attacking the image of God.

2.  **The Fountain and the Tree:**
    *   James argues that a fountain cannot yield both salt water and fresh (James 3:11–12).
    *   If our speech is bitter, critical, or deceitful, it is evidence that the "fountain" (the heart) has not been fully cleansed by the blood of Christ.

3.  **Strange Fire:**
    *   In the earthly sanctuary, the priests were forbidden to offer "strange fire" (Leviticus 10:1).
    *   Similarly, our bodies are temples of the Holy Ghost (1 Corinthians 6:19). To use the tongue for gossip or cursing is to bring strange fire into the temple of God.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Consider a medicine dropper. If you use it to dispense deadly poison, and then, without washing it, attempt to use it to dispense healing medicine to a sick child, the medicine becomes tainted. We cannot expect our prayers and praises (the medicine) to be acceptable to God if the same tongue (the dropper) is coated with the poison of gossip and malice.

### Q4. Can man, un-renewed by grace, control his tongue?
"For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil; full of deadly poison." James 3:7, 8.

**Answer:**
This is a pivotal point in understanding **Righteousness by Faith**. The text explicitly states that "no man" can tame the tongue. Human effort, resolutions, and willpower are insufficient to cure the sin of gossip.

1.  **The Limit of Human Effort:**
    *   Man can tame lions and whales, but he cannot tame his own nature. The tongue is set on fire by hell (James 3:6), and only a power greater than hell can quench it.
    *   Legalism—trying to keep the law by our own strength—will always fail here. We may suppress the words for a time, but the poison remains within.

2.  **The Need for Divine Power:**
    *   Because "no man" can tame it, we require a Saviour. We must come to the end of our own resources and cry out for the indwelling life of Christ.
    *   It is strictly a work of grace.
    *   *Grace:* Not just forgiveness for the past, but the enabling power of God to do what human nature cannot do (2 Corinthians 12:9; Titus 2:11–12).

3.  **The Poison:**
    *   The "deadly poison" is the selfishness and pride of the natural heart. Until the heart is changed, the tongue remains dangerous.

### Q5. What is one's duty, under the circumstances?
"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves unto God." Rom. 6:13.

**Answer:**
Since we cannot tame the tongue ourselves, our duty is not to fight the battle alone, but to surrender the weapon to a new Commander.

1.  **The Act of Yielding:**
    *   The word "yield" implies surrender. We must hand over our members (our tongue, eyes, hands) to God.
    *   We stop lending our tongue to the enemy to be used as an "instrument" (or weapon) of unrighteousness.

2.  **Consecration:**
    *   Every morning, the believer should dedicate their speech to God, praying, "Lord, take my tongue; let it speak only Thy words today."
    *   This is the practical application of the Sanctuary service: presenting our bodies as a "living sacrifice" (Romans 12:1).

3.  **The Exchange of Masters:**
    *   We are either slaves to sin or servants of righteousness (Romans 6:16). By yielding to God, the Holy Spirit takes possession of the tongue and sanctifies its use.

### Q6. Through whom may we find deliverance from this law of sin in our members?
"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. O wretched man that I am I who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." Rom 7:23-25.

**Answer:**
Here is the glorious gospel solution to the problem of the unruly tongue.

1.  **The Conflict (Romans 7):**
    *   The "law of sin in the members" is the gravitational pull of our fallen nature toward evil. We try to be quiet, but we speak; we try to be kind, but we are harsh. This struggle proves our need of a Saviour.

2.  **The Deliverer (Jesus Christ):**
    *   Victory is not a method; Victory is a Person.
    *   *Righteousness by Faith:* We do not achieve victory to get to Christ; we receive Christ, and He wins the victory in us. "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27).
    *   When Christ dwells in the heart by faith, He brings His own self-control, His own love, and His own patience. The tongue is tamed by the presence of the Tamer.

3.  **No Condemnation:**
    *   For those who are "in Christ Jesus" and walk after the Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life sets them free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:1–2).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A captain of a sailing ship cannot control the wind, nor can he stop the waves from beating against the hull. If he tries to push the ship with his own hands, he fails. But if he hoists the sails to catch the wind, the ship moves with power. We cannot suppress the waves of our nature, but we can hoist the sails of our will to the Holy Spirit (the Wind). "Through Jesus Christ," the power is provided to move in the right direction.

### Q7. Of what are one's words the index?
"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Matt. 12:34.

**Answer:**
Words are the external index (indicator) of the internal state.

1.  **The Root Problem:**
    *   If the tongue is gossiping, lying, or impure, it is because the heart is nurturing those things.
    *   You cannot purify the water by painting the pump; you must cleanse the well.

2.  **The Need for a New Heart:**
    *   This reinforces the doctrine of the New Birth (John 3:3). We need the promise of the New Covenant: "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).
    *   When the law of love is written in the heart, the lips will speak love instinctively.

3.  **Diagnostic Tool:**
    *   We should monitor our words not merely to suppress them, but to diagnose our spiritual condition. Critical words indicate a prideful heart; angry words indicate an unsurrendered will.

### Q8. What will our words have to do with our standing in the judgment?
"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned." Matt. 12:37.

**Answer:**
This verse places our speech directly in the context of the **Investigative Judgment**.

1.  **Words as Evidence:**
    *   God does not judge us *based on* the merit of our words (we are saved by grace alone), but our words testify to whether our faith was genuine.
    *   If a man claims to have faith in Christ but his tongue is full of venom, his words prove his faith is dead (James 2:26).

2.  **The Books of Record:**
    *   In the judgment, the books are opened (Daniel 7:10; Revelation 20:12). These records contain not only our deeds but our words.
    *   "Idle words" (Matthew 12:36) are words spoken without purpose, careless gossip, or jesting that lowers spiritual vitality.

3.  **Justification and Condemnation:**
    *   *Justification (in this context):* The declaration that the believer's profession of faith is authentic, evidenced by the fruit of their lips.
    *   The only safety in the judgment is to have a character transformed by Christ, so that the record of our words shows the influence of His Spirit.

### Q9. What special sin is covered by the ninth commandment?
"Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am the Lord." Lev. 19:16.

**Answer:**
The Levitical law specifically identifies "talebearing" as a violation of the covenant.

1.  **The Talebearer Defined:**
    *   A talebearer is a peddler of secrets—someone who goes from house to house (or person to person) carrying bits of information, rumors, or private matters that stir up strife (1 Timothy 5:13).
    *   Even if the story is true, if it is not necessary to speak it, and if it causes harm, it is talebearing.

2.  **"Standing Against the Blood":**
    *   This phrase suggests that gossip endangers the life and safety of the neighbor. In ancient times, a false report could lead to execution (as with Naboth, 1 Kings 21).
    *   Spiritually, gossip murders a person's influence and character. To kill a reputation is akin to shedding blood in the eyes of God.

---

### Q10. What are the words of a talebearer like?
"The words of a talebearer are as wounds." Prov. 26:22.

**Answer:**
The King James Version marginal reading often renders "wounds" as "dainty morsels" that go down into the innermost parts of the belly. Both meanings offer profound insight.

1.  **As Wounds:**
    *   Gossip inflicts deep emotional and spiritual injuries. Unlike a physical cut that heals quickly, the wound of a betrayed confidence or a slanderous label can fester for a lifetime.

2.  **As Dainty Morsels:**
    *   The human heart has a morbid appetite for scandal. Gossip is often "tasty" to the carnal nature; people devour it greedily.
    *   However, once swallowed, it goes "into the innermost parts"—it poisons the soul of the listener. The one who listens to gossip is as guilty as the one who speaks it, for they provide the ear that allows the sin to exist.

### Q11. What is their effect?
“He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends." Prov. 17:9.

**Answer:**
The effect of gossip is essentially diabolical (the word *diabolos* means "slanderer" or "divider"). It destroys unity.

1.  **Separation of Friends:**
    *   Relationships built over years can be destroyed in a moment by "repeating a matter."
    *   Trust is fragile. Gossip erodes the trust necessary for fellowship in the church and peace in the home.

2.  **The Gospel Alternative: Covering:**
    *   "Love covereth a multitude of sins" (1 Peter 4:8).
    *   This does not mean hiding crime or enabling abuse, but rather refusing to broadcast the faults and failings of others.
    *   *Atonement imagery:* Just as the Mercy Seat covered the Law, Christ's blood covers our sins. If we have received mercy, we must extend mercy by not exposing the faults of others unnecessarily.

### Q12. What would follow if each attended to his own affairs only?
"Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth." Prov. 26:20.

**Answer:**
This is the practical remedy for church and social contention.

1.  **Starving the Fire:**
    *   Gossip requires fuel. The fuel is the willingness to listen and repeat.
    *   If we refuse to listen to the talebearer, the fire dies for lack of oxygen. We should ask the gossiper: "Have you spoken to the person concerned? Is this true? Is it necessary for me to know?"

2.  **Minding One’s Own Business:**
    *   Paul advises believers to "study to be quiet, and to do your own business" (1 Thessalonians 4:11).
    *   Busybodies are usually those who are neglecting their own soul's work. If we were busy examining our own hearts in the light of the Sanctuary, we would have no time to critique others.

---

### Q13. What is the word like which is fitly spoken?
"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver." Prov. 25:11.

**Answer:**
God does not demand silence, but sanctified speech.

1.  **Beauty and Value:**
    *   "Apples of gold in pictures [settings] of silver" represents high value and artistic beauty.
    *   Words of encouragement, truth, comfort, and peacemaking are precious in God's sight.

2.  **"Fitly Spoken":**
    *   Timing and tone matter. A reproof given in love, or a comfort given at the right moment, is a work of the Holy Spirit.
    *   The tongue should be used to "minister grace unto the hearers" (Ephesians 4:29).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A skilled artist knows exactly where to place a highlight on a painting to make it shine. A clumsy hand smears the canvas. A Christian walking in the Spirit knows, by God’s grace, how to place a word of hope into a dark situation, making the picture beautiful. The gossip smears the canvas with mud.

### Q14. To whom are our words all known?
"For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether." Ps. 139:4.

**Answer:**
We live our lives in the audience of One.

1.  **God’s Omniscience:**
    *   God hears the whisper in the closet as clearly as the shout from the rooftop. Nothing is hidden from Him (Hebrews 4:13).
    *   This should produce a holy fear—not of terror, but of reverence. We should speak as though Christ were visibly standing beside us.

2.  **The Comfort of Being Known:**
    *   While this warns against secret sin, it is also a comfort. God knows when we *try* to speak truth; He knows when we are falsely accused. He knows the intent of the heart.

3.  **Final Appeal:**
    *   Let our prayer be that of the Psalmist: "Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer" (Psalm 19:14).
    *   Victory over the tongue is possible through faith in the Redeemer who is our Strength.
