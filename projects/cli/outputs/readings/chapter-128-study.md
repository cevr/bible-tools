### Q1. What effect is the application of the blood of Christ expected to have upon the conscience?

> “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?” (Hebrews 9:14).

**Answer:**

The application of Christ’s blood is the foundation of the Christian experience, performing a specific work on the human conscience that no human effort can achieve.

*   **Defining the Terms:**
    *   **Conscience:** The internal voice or moral faculty that God has placed in man to distinguish right from wrong. However, without the Holy Spirit, the conscience can be defiled or misguided (Titus 1:15).
    *   **Purge:** To cleanse thoroughly or purify.
    *   **Dead Works:** These are works done to earn salvation by human merit (legalism), which cannot bring life; or they are simply sinful actions that lead to spiritual death (Romans 6:23).

*   **The Sanctuary Connection:**
    In the earthly sanctuary service, the blood of the sacrifice was shed in the outer court to make **atonement** (reconciliation) for the sinner. Similarly, Christ, our perfect Sacrifice, shed His blood to deal with the guilt of sin.
    *   **Justification:** When we accept Christ’s sacrifice, His blood cleanses us from the *guilt* of past sins (Romans 3:25). This is **imputed righteousness**—Christ’s record stands in place of our failure.
    *   The text says the conscience is purged *to serve the living God*. A guilty conscience causes us to hide from God (like Adam in Eden). A cleansed conscience frees us to serve Him out of love, not fear.

*   **Righteousness by Faith:**
    We cannot serve the living God while burdened by the belief that we must save ourselves ("dead works"). Faith lays hold of the blood of Christ, realizing that the penalty is paid. This liberates the believer to walk in newness of life, serving God because we *are* saved, not *to get* saved (Ephesians 2:8–10).

[ILL]
**The Debt and the Ledger.** Imagine a merchant who has fallen into hopeless debt. Every time he looks at his ledger, his conscience torments him; he cannot look his creditors in the eye, and he works frantically but fruitlessly to pay it back. This is "dead works." Then, a wealthy benefactor pays the debt in full and shows him the receipt. The ledger is clean. The merchant’s conscience is instantly purged of that heavy burden. He now works for the benefactor not to pay off the old debt—which is already gone—but out of gratitude and love.

### Q2. When once purged by the blood of Christ, in what condition is the conscience of an individual?

> “Because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.” (Hebrews 10:2).

**Answer:**

When the blood of Christ is applied by faith, the believer enters a state of peace that the Old Covenant sacrifices could only typify but never fully provide.

*   **No More Conscience of Sins:**
    This does not mean the believer forgets they were a sinner, nor does it mean they lose the ability to distinguish right from wrong. It means the **crushing weight of condemnation** is removed (Romans 8:1). The "conscience of sins" refers to the terrifying expectation of judgment that accompanies unpardoned guilt.

*   **The Assurance of Acceptance:**
    Under the Levitical system, sacrifices had to be repeated daily and yearly because they were only shadows. They reminded the people of sin but could not permanently remove it. Christ’s sacrifice was "once for all" (Hebrews 10:10).
    *   When we are **justified** (declared righteous), the law no longer condemns us. We stand before God as if we had never sinned.
    *   This creates a "good conscience"—not because we are naturally good, but because we are "accepted in the beloved" (Ephesians 1:6).

*   **Sanctuary Truth:**
    In the heavenly sanctuary, Jesus acts as our High Priest. Because He lives to make intercession for us, we can come boldly to the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16). We do not need to carry the burden of past sins; they have been transferred to the Lamb of God.

[ILL]
**The Pardoned Prisoner.** A man in prison for a crime feels the guilt of his action and the restriction of his cell. If the governor issues a full pardon, the cell door is opened. If the man sits in the cell, still weeping over his crime and refusing to leave, he is rejecting the reality of the pardon. A "purged" conscience walks out of the prison cell, leaving the guilt behind, believing that the pardon is real.

### Q3. In his defense before a certain council, how did Paul say he, had constantly lived?

> “Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.” (Acts 23:1).

**Answer:**

Paul’s testimony reveals that a "good conscience" is linked to acting according to the light one has.

*   **Integrity to Conviction:**
    Even before his conversion, when he was Saul the persecutor, he thought he was doing God service (John 16:2). He was technically wrong, but he was not a hypocrite; he followed his conscience based on his understanding at the time.
    *   However, conscience alone is not a safe guide if it is not educated by the Word of God. Saul’s conscience was "good" in terms of sincerity, but it was misguided until Jesus met him on the road to Damascus.

*   **The Necessity of Enlightenment:**
    Once Paul received the light of the Gospel, his conscience required him to change his course immediately. To have a "good conscience" *after* receiving light means we must obey that light.
    *   **Sanctification:** This is the process of walking in the light as He is in the light (1 John 1:7). As we learn more of God's will, our conscience becomes more sensitive and aligned with God's law.

[ILL]
**The Compass.** A compass is designed to point north. If a magnet is held near it, the needle may point east, yet the mechanism is working perfectly according to the influence upon it. The conscience is the needle. The Word of God is true North. We must ensure no "magnets" of tradition, pride, or sin are distorting our conscience, so that it aligns perfectly with God’s Law.

### Q4. When one lives as the apostle declared he had, in all good conscience, in what condition will his conscience be?

> “And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward men.” (Acts 24:16).

**Answer:**

Here we see the active side of the Christian life. A good conscience is not a passive state; it requires "exercise" or discipline.

*   **Void of Offense:**
    This phrase means "blameless" or "without stumbling." It implies a life where:
    1.  **Toward God:** There is no known, unconfessed sin separating the soul from the Creator (Isaiah 59:2). The believer keeps the first four commandments of the Decalogue from the heart.
    2.  **Toward Men:** There is restitution for wrongs done, and a life of love and integrity toward neighbors (the last six commandments).

*   **Righteousness by Faith – Imparted:**
    Paul does not say this happens automatically. He says, "I *exercise* myself."
    *   This is the cooperative work of **sanctification**. God provides the power (grace), but the believer must choose to yield, to watch, and to pray.
    *   We cannot keep our conscience clean by our own power, but we must choose to bring every thought into captivity to Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5).
    *   True faith works. It leads to a life where we strive to hurt no one and honor God in everything.

*   **The Standard:**
    The standard for a conscience "void of offense" is the Law of God. A person cannot claim a clear conscience while knowingly breaking one of God's commandments (James 2:10).

[ILL]
**The Daily Wash.** A surgeon washes their hands before surgery. They do not wash them once in a lifetime and say, "I am clean." They exercise care to keep them clean, and if they touch anything unsterile, they wash again immediately. "Exercising" a good conscience is the daily habit of bringing our lives to the water of the Word and the blood of Christ to remove any "offense" or spot of the world.

### Q5. What does the apostle say the act of baptism is to the candidate?

> “The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 3:21).

**Answer:**

Peter clarifies that the physical act of washing in water is not what saves; rather, baptism is the external pledge of an internal change.

*   **The Answer of a Good Conscience:**
    The word "answer" here can be translated as "appeal," "pledge," or "interrogation." It is a covenant transaction.
    *   The candidate is saying: "Lord, I accept Your death as my death to sin. I accept Your resurrection as my new life. I pledge my conscience to You."
    *   This assumes the person has already experienced **repentance** and **conversion**. Baptism is the public testimony that the conscience has been cleansed by Christ's blood.

*   **Connection to the Resurrection:**
    We are saved "by the resurrection of Jesus Christ." Our victory over sin comes from His living power.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** We are buried with Him in baptism and raised to walk in "newness of life" (Romans 6:4). The power to keep a good conscience comes from the resurrected life of Jesus dwelling in the believer (Galatians 2:20).

*   **Defining Terms:**
    *   **Baptism:** From the Greek *baptizo*, meaning to immerse or dip under. It symbolizes total burial of the "old man" of sin.

[ILL]
**The Uniform.** A soldier puts on a uniform to show he has joined the army. The uniform doesn't make him a soldier; his oath of enlistment and his training make him a soldier. But the uniform is the necessary public declaration of his allegiance. Baptism is the uniform; the "good conscience" is the oath of loyalty to the King of Kings.

***

### Q6. What else will a good conscience lead one to do?

> “For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.” (1 Peter 2:19).

**Answer:**

A good conscience empowers the believer to stand firm in the face of injustice, persecution, or misunderstanding.

*   **Suffering Wrongfully:**
    The carnal nature wants to retaliate when treated unfairly. However, a person whose conscience is captivated by God looks to Christ as their example.
    *   Christ "when he was reviled, reviled not again" (1 Peter 2:23).
    *   The believer endures grief not because they are weak, but because they are accountable to a higher Master. They fear displeasing God more than they fear the anger of man.

*   **The Great Controversy:**
    In the conflict between good and evil, God’s people are often misrepresented. Having a clear conscience allows a believer to sleep soundly even when the world attacks their reputation.
    *   **Sanctuary Principle:** We must leave vengeance to God. Just as judgment belongs to the Lord in the heavenly sanctuary, we trust Him to vindicate us in His time.

*   **Practical Application:**
    This is the test of **imparted righteousness**. Do we have the patience of the saints? (Revelation 14:12). Can we love our enemies? Only the Spirit of Christ within can produce this fruit.

[ILL]
**The Anchor.** A ship in a storm may be tossed by waves (circumstances/persecution) on the surface. But if its anchor is deep in the bedrock (conscience anchored in God), it will not drift onto the rocks. The storm rages outside, but the connection to the anchor holds firm.

### Q7. If one repels the Spirit of God from him, and refuses to have his conscience, or knowledge of himself, quickened, what is the result?

> “Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.” (1 Timothy 4:2).

**Answer:**

This is one of the most solemn warnings in Scripture regarding the danger of persistent disobedience.

*   **Seared with a Hot Iron:**
    The metaphor is of cauterization. When flesh is burned severely, the nerve endings are destroyed. The skin becomes scarred and unfeeling.
    *   A **seared conscience** is one that has been ignored so many times that it no longer feels the conviction of the Holy Spirit. It no longer warns the sinner of danger.

*   **The Process of Hardening:**
    No one reaches this state instantly. It happens by degrees:
    1.  The Holy Spirit convicts of a sin (John 16:8).
    2.  The individual resists or rationalizes the sin ("speaking lies in hypocrisy").
    3.  Repeated resistance dulls the voice of the Spirit.
    4.  Eventually, the "moral nerve" dies. This is the unpardonable sin—not because God refuses to forgive, but because the person has lost the capacity to want forgiveness.

*   **Righteousness by Faith vs. Presumption:**
    We must not presume on God's grace. While God is long-suffering, we cannot trifle with the conviction of truth. To know the right way and refuse to walk in it is to invite spiritual blindness (James 4:17).

[ILL]
**The Alarm Clock.** If you set an alarm clock but hit "snooze" or ignore it every morning, eventually your brain learns to tune it out. You sleep right through the ringing. The alarm (Conscience) is still sounding, but you have "seared" your ability to hear it.

***

### Q8. When one's conscience is well enlightened, what will it do for the individual?

> “For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world.” (2 Corinthians 1:12).

**Answer:**

A clear, enlightened conscience produces deep, abiding joy and confidence.

*   **The Testimony of Conscience:**
    When we examine ourselves and find that our motives are pure and our sins are covered by Christ, the result is "rejoicing."
    *   **Simplicity and Sincerity:** This means "singleness of heart." There are no double motives. The believer is not serving God for gain or applause, but out of pure love.
    *   **By the Grace of God:** Paul attributes this life not to his own willpower ("fleshly wisdom") but to God's grace.

*   **Conversation:**
    In KJV English, "conversation" means "lifestyle" or "conduct."
    *   This verse describes a life of **Sanctification**. The daily conduct is governed by the grace of God, resulting in a conscience that does not accuse the believer.
    *   "Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them" (Psalm 119:165).

[ILL]
**The Open Book.** A person who has nothing to hide lives like an open book. They don't have to worry about who sees their pages or what they find. They have "rejoicing" because they live in the sunlight of truth. A person with a guilty conscience is always guarding the book, afraid the wind might turn a page and reveal a secret sin.

***

### Q9. With what is a good conscience connected?

> “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.” (1 Timothy 1:5).

**Answer:**

Here we see the inseparable link between the Law (the commandment), Love (charity), and Faith.

*   **The End of the Commandment:**
    The goal or purpose of God's Law is **Charity** (Agapē love). The Law is a transcript of God's character, which is love (1 John 4:8).
    *   Legalism keeps the law to be saved (selfishness).
    *   True Christianity keeps the law because the heart has been filled with God's love (Romans 5:5).

*   **The Trio: Heart, Conscience, Faith:**
    Paul lists three things that produce this love:
    1.  **Pure Heart:** Cleansed from the love of sin.
    2.  **Good Conscience:** Cleansed from the guilt of sin.
    3.  **Faith Unfeigned:** Genuine, sincere trust in God.

*   **Doctrinal Conclusion:**
    You cannot have one without the others.
    *   Faith without a good conscience is a shipwreck (1 Timothy 1:19).
    *   A "good conscience" that ignores the commandment is a delusion.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith** is the harmonization of all three: Faith receives Christ's righteousness, which purifies the heart and conscience, leading to obedience to the commandment in love.

[ILL]
**The Three-Legged Stool.** Imagine a stool supported by a Pure Heart, a Good Conscience, and Unfeigned Faith. If you remove any one leg, the stool falls. You cannot sit and rest in God's love (Charity) if you are missing the leg of a good conscience or genuine faith.
