Here is the slide deck presentation based on the Bible study provided.

## Slide 1 – Q1: Legacy of the Righteous
- Question: Has anything been left as a legacy to the righteous?
- Key Text: Psalm 34:19 – “Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Great Controversy Context
- **The Reality of Conflict**
    - Living in enemy territory often brings perplexity to the believer.
    - God does not promise exemption from trouble.
    - 2 Timothy 3:12 – “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”
- **The Nature of Deliverance**
    - Deliverance is not always the immediate removal of the problem.
    - God often delivers us *in* the trouble before taking us *out* of it.
    - He sustains the spirit so the trial does not destroy the soul.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Refining the Character
- **Sanctuary Connection: The Fire**
    - Just as the sanctuary service required fire for the offering, the Christian life involves a "fiery trial."
    - 1 Peter 4:12 – “Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you.”
    - God permits afflictions to consume the dross of selfishness and sin.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Refiner’s Fire**
    - A goldsmith puts raw gold into the crucible and increases the heat to remove impurities (dross).
    - He does not intend to destroy the gold, but to purify it.
    - He knows the process is complete when he can see his own face reflected in the metal.
    - Malachi 3:3 – “And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver…”
    - God allows the heat of affliction until the image of Jesus is perfectly reflected in our characters.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Pity from Friends
- Question: What ought those in affliction to have from their friends?
- Key Text: Job 6:14 – “To him that is afflicted, pity should be showed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Ministry of Pity
- **Manifesting God’s Character**
    - True friendship reflects the love and mercy of God.
    - "Pity" implies deep compassion—suffering *with* another.
    - Galatians 6:2 – “Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.”
- **Reflecting Christ**
    - Jesus is the Friend that sticks closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24 – “A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.”).
    - Withholding pity is a failure of faith and a test of our connection with heaven.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Good Samaritan**
    - In the parable, the priest and Levite had "correct" theology but lacked the love of God.
    - The Samaritan showed pity: he stopped, bound up wounds, and paid the cost.
    - True religion is not just knowing truth; it is stopping to show pity to the afflicted.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Pure Religion
- Question: If one visits, and shows pity toward those in affliction, what does it indicate that he possesses?
- Key Text: James 1:27 – “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Righteousness by Faith & Sanctification
- **Active Benevolence (Faith Working)**
    - Faith without works is dead (James 2:17).
    - Caring for the vulnerable demonstrates that the law of love is written on the heart.
    - This is **Righteousness by Faith**: Christ’s life of love flowing through the believer.
- **Personal Purity (Sanctification)**
    - We are called to keep "unspotted from the world."
    - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”
    - This is the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit making the believer holy in character.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Sanctuary Connection
- **Washing and Preparation**
    - In the earthly sanctuary, the priest had to wash before entering the holy place.
    - Believers looking for the Lord’s coming must be washed in the blood of the Lamb.
    - Revelation 22:14 – “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Fruit Tree**
    - Labeling a dead stick "Apple Tree" does not make it one.
    - A living tree is identified by its fruit.
    - If the sap (Holy Spirit) flows, the tree naturally produces apples (good works).
    - We do not do works *to be* saved (legalism), but because we *are* saved and His life is in us.

## Slide 12 – Q4: David’s Affliction
- Question: What did David say with reference to his affliction?
- Key Text: Psalm 119:71 – “It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: The School of Suffering
- **Learning by Experience**
    - Prosperity can lead to spiritual slumber; affliction wakes us up.
    - David understood the theory of God's law, but suffering taught him the *experience* of it.
    - Suffering drives us to the Scriptures and submission to God’s sovereignty.
- **The Shepherd’s Care**
    - Psalm 23:4 – “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Shepherd’s Rod**
    - A shepherd uses a rod to defend but also to correct the sheep.
    - If a sheep wanders toward a cliff, the shepherd strikes it to turn it back.
    - The blow may hurt, but it saves the sheep’s life.
    - God’s rod is used for our ultimate good and safety.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Tendency Before Affliction
- Question: Before he had affliction, what was his tendency?
- Key Text: Psalm 119:67 – “Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points
- **The Danger of Ease**
    - Our natural tendency is to drift away from God when life is easy.
    - "Going astray" is often the result of a life without discipline.
- **Restoration to Obedience**
    - The Gospel aims to restore us to harmony with God's law: "But now have I kept thy word."
- **Righteousness by Faith**
    - Affliction reveals our weakness, forcing us to lean on Christ’s power.
    - 2 Corinthians 12:10 – “Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Purpose of Affliction (Forgiveness)
- Question: When affliction came upon him, what did he consider it was for?
- Key Text: Psalm 25:18 – “Look upon mine affliction and my pain, and forgive all my sins.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Sanctuary & Justification
- **The Sting of Sin**
    - Physical pain was less burdensome to David than separation from God.
    - **Justification:** David pleads for forgiveness—God’s legal declaration of pardon through Christ (Romans 4:7-8).
- **Sanctuary Connection: Day of Atonement**
    - Leviticus 23:27 – “Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls…”
    - Affliction prompts the deep heart-searching required for the blotting out of sins.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Hidden Infection**
    - A hidden infection may be ignored until a fever strikes and lays a man low.
    - The fever is uncomfortable, but it reveals the problem so a cure can be applied.
    - Affliction is the "fever" that drives us to the Great Physician to deal with the infection of sin.

## Slide 20 – Q7: God’s Regard for the Afflicted
- Question: How does God regard the cry of the afflicted?
- Key Text: Job 34:28 – “So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: The High Priest Who Hears
- **God is Listening**
    - The Creator hears the cry of the lowliest sufferer.
- **Our High Priest**
    - Hebrews 4:15 – “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.”
    - Jesus, in the heavenly sanctuary, presents the prayers of the afflicted to the Father.

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Father’s Pity
- Question: With what feelings does the Lord look upon His children?
- Key Text: Psalm 103:13 – “Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Divine Family
- **The Fatherhood of God**
    - God views us as family, not just subjects.
    - 1 John 3:1 – “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God…”
- **Sharing Our Sorrow**
    - Isaiah 63:9 – “In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them…”
    - This promise is for those who fear Him—a relationship of reverent trust.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Parent at the Bedside**
    - When a child has a fever, a loving parent sits by the bedside, wipes the brow, and holds their hand.
    - The parent may not instantly remove the sickness, but their presence provides comfort.
    - This illustrates how God sits with His suffering children.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Refuge for the Oppressed
- Question: What has the Lord promised to be to those who are oppressed?
- Key Text: Psalm 9:9 – “The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Sanctuary & Safety
- **A Stronghold**
    - "Refuge" implies a high tower or fortress where the enemy cannot reach.
- **Hid in Christ**
    - Colossians 3:3 – “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”
- **Sanctuary Imagery**
    - Christ is the true "City of Refuge" for the sinner.
    - The horns of the altar in the sanctuary represented a place of protection.

## Slide 27 – Q10: Sending the Comforter
- Question: When the Saviour was about to go away from the earth, what did He say He would send to His disciples?
- Key Text: John 16:7 – “Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Christ’s Work & Presence
- **The High Priest’s Work**
    - Jesus ascended to the heavenly sanctuary to begin His intercessory work.
    - He sent the *Paraclete* (Comforter)—one called alongside to help.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
    - Through the Spirit, Christ dwells in our hearts.
    - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me…”
    - RBF is the Spirit of Christ living out His life within the believer.

## Slide 29 – Q11: Name of the Comforter
- Question: What is the Comforter called?
- Key Text: John 15:26 – “But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.”

## Slide 30 – Q11: Spirit of Truth
- **Guiding into Truth**
    - The Spirit never leads contrary to the Word, for "Thy word is truth" (John 17:17).
- **Testifying of Christ**
    - The Spirit’s primary work is to spotlight Jesus and the sufficiency of His sacrifice.
- **Sanctification**
    - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 – “…God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.”
    - The Spirit fits us for heaven by writing the law on the heart.

## Slide 31 – Q12: Promise to the Mourner
- Question: What has the Lord promised to the mourner?
- Key Text: Matthew 5:4 – “Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Mourning for Sin
- **Godly Sorrow**
    - True blessedness is found in mourning for sin (repentance).
    - 2 Corinthians 7:10 – “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of…”
- **Sanctuary Connection**
    - On the Day of Atonement, mourning led to the blotting out of sins.
    - We are comforted by the assurance of pardon (1 John 1:9).

## Slide 33 – Q12: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Dark Background**
    - A jeweler displays a diamond against black velvet to make it shine brighter.
    - Grace shines brightest against the dark background of our recognized sinfulness.
    - When we mourn our sin, the diamond of Christ’s righteousness shines with true brilliance.

## Slide 34 – Q13: Hope for the Bereaved
- Question: What prophetic words were especially designed to comfort the mothers in Bethlehem who should mourn for having lost their innocent children through the envy of Herod?
- Key Text: Jeremiah 31:16 – “Thus saith the Lord; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.”

## Slide 35 – Q13: Death and Resurrection
- **The Land of the Enemy**
    - Death is not a friend; it is "the land of the enemy" and the wages of sin (Romans 6:23).
- **The Promise of Return**
    - "They shall come again" refers to the resurrection.
    - The dead are not currently in heaven but are in the grave awaiting the Life-giver.
    - The faithful work of parents will be rewarded with reunion in the resurrection morning.

## Slide 36 – Q14: The Apostle’s Comfort
- Question: What does the apostle present as a comfort to those who have lost dear friends by death?
- Key Text: 1 Thessalonians 4:14 – “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.”

## Slide 37 – Q14: The Second Coming
- **Sleep in Jesus**
    - 1 Thessalonians 4:15-16 – “…we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven…”
    - Death is a sleep: unconscious rest until the resurrection.
- **Reunion**
    - 1 Thessalonians 4:17 – “Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
    - We comfort one another with the promise of the resurrection, not with the idea that the dead are currently conscious.

## Slide 38 – Q14: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Long Night**
    - When a child sleeps, they know nothing of the passing hours until morning.
    - The next conscious moment after falling asleep is seeing their parents' faces in the morning.
    - So it is with death: the believer closes his eyes, and his next conscious moment is seeing Jesus coming in the clouds.

## Slide 39 – Q15: Using Comfort for Others
- Question: When one has received the Comforter in his heart, what use should he make of it?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 1:4 – “Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.”

## Slide 40 – Q15: Channels of Grace
- **Experience as Ministry**
    - God gives us comfort so it can flow through us to others.
    - Your trial becomes a testimony; your pain becomes a pulpit.
    - We share the reality of God's presence that sustained us.

## Slide 41 – Q15: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Bucket Brigade**
    - To put out a fire, men would pass buckets of water down a line.
    - If one man held the bucket and refused to pass it, the flow stopped.
    - We are in a line receiving the water of life; we must pass the comfort on to the next person in the fire of affliction.

## Slide 42 – Q16: Paul’s Comfort
- Question: How was Paul once comforted when in trouble?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 7:6 – “Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus.”

## Slide 43 – Q16: Human Instrumentality
- **God Uses People**
    - Paul admitted to being "cast down" (discouraged).
    - God comforted him not through an angel, but through the arrival of his friend Titus.
- **The Value of Fellowship**
    - We should not isolate ourselves in sorrow.
    - A visit, a kind word, or the presence of a faithful friend is God’s appointed means of grace.

## Slide 44 – Q17: Resting the Case
- Question: When in affliction, how should one rest his case?
- Key Text: Romans 8:28 – “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”

## Slide 45 – Q17: Providence
- **Working for Good**
    - Not all things *are* good (sin/sickness are bad), but God overrules them *for* good.
- **The Condition**
    - The promise is for "them that love God."
    - Trials harden the rebellious but refine the faithful.
- **The Definition of Good**
    - Romans 8:29 – “For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son…”
    - God’s goal is our eternal character—Christlikeness.

## Slide 46 – Q18: Paul’s Bonds
- Question: How did the bonds which were endured by Paul work for good?
- Key Text: Philippians 1:12 – “But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.”

## Slide 47 – Q18: Great Controversy Victory
- **Furtherance of the Gospel**
    - Though chained to guards, Paul’s imprisonment brought the gospel to Caesar’s household.
    - Philippians 4:22 – “All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.”
- **God’s Strategy**
    - Satan tried to silence Paul with prison; God turned the prison into a megaphone.
    - We should look for opportunities for the gospel within our own restrictions.

## Slide 48 – Q19: Christ’s Exhortation
- Question: How does Christ exhort those who have tribulation in the world?
- Key Text: John 16:33 – “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”

## Slide 49 – Q19: Righteousness by Faith (Vicarious Victory)
- **Two Realms**
    - In the world: Tribulation.
    - In Christ: Peace.
- **Be of Good Cheer**
    - Our courage is based on *His* victory, not our strength.
    - **Righteousness by Faith:** Jesus met every temptation and conquered.
    - When we are in Him, His victory is credited to us. We fight *from* His victory, not just *for* it.

## Slide 50 – Q19: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Conqueror’s Family**
    - When a king wins a war, his family shares in the peace and spoils, even though they did not fight on the front lines.
    - Jesus, our King, fought the battle at Calvary and won.
    - He invites us to share in His peace because the enemy is already defeated.

## Slide 51 – Q20: Paul’s Perspective
- Question: What comforted the apostle in these troubles?
- Key Text: Romans 8:18 – “For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.”

## Slide 52 – Q20: Weighing the Cost
- **Divine Accounting**
    - Paul "reckoned" (calculated) the difference between temporary suffering and eternal glory.
    - The glory so far outweighs the suffering that they cannot be compared.
- **Revealed IN Us**
    - This refers to the final restoration of God’s image—glorification.
    - To be made like Jesus, free from sin and death, is worth any price.

## Slide 53 – Q21: Description of Troubles
- Question: What did he call the troubles that beset him?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 4:17 – “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”

## Slide 54 – Q21: Key Points
- **Light Affliction**
    - Despite beatings and shipwrecks, Paul calls his trouble "light" compared to eternity.
- **Working for Us**
    - Affliction is not meaningless; it is producing spiritual muscle and character.
- **Eternal Perspective**
    - To the earth-bound view, trials are mountains.
    - To the heaven-bound view, they are "but for a moment."

## Slide 55 – Q21: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Scales**
    - Imagine a balance scale.
    - Left side: All sickness, tears, loss, and pain (looks heavy).
    - Right side: God places "Eternity" and "Glory."
    - The right side slams down, launching the left side into the air.
    - The "weight of glory" makes the weight of affliction seem like a feather.
