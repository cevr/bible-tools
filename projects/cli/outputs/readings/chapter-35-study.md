### Q1. How alone should the Christian walk?

**“He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.” 1 John 2:6.** (See Colossians 2:6.)

**Answer:**
The Christian life is not a solitary journey of self-improvement, nor is it a mere intellectual assent to truth; it is a daily union with a living Person. To "abide" in Christ means to maintain a constant, living connection with Him, just as a branch stays connected to the vine (John 15:4–5).

*   **The Standard of Righteousness:** The verse establishes that the life of Jesus is the standard for the believer. We are not called merely to admire Christ, but to reflect His character. This "walking as He walked" is the practical outworking of **Righteousness by Faith**.
    *   **Definition:** *Righteousness by Faith* is the experience where the believer, having surrendered self, trusts wholly in Christ’s merits for pardon (justification) and relies on His indwelling Spirit for power to obey (sanctification).
*   **Union, Not Imitation Alone:** We cannot walk as He walked by mere human effort. We can only reproduce His life if we possess His life. "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27) is the secret. When His Spirit dwells within, the natural fruit is obedience to God’s law, just as it was in Christ’s life (Psalm 40:8).
*   **The Walk of Faith:** As we received Christ Jesus the Lord—by faith, surrender, and dependence—so we must continue to walk in Him (Colossians 2:6). It is a moment-by-moment dependence on His power to overcome sin.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a glove. By itself, it is limp and powerless; it cannot pick up a pen or shake a hand. But if a living hand is inserted into the glove, the glove moves and acts exactly as the hand does. The glove does not struggle to imitate the hand; it simply yields to the hand filling it. So it is with the Christian: we are the glove, and Christ is the living hand. We walk as He walked only when we are filled with His life.

### Q2. What mind should be in us?

**“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 2:5.**

**Answer:**
The "mind of Christ" is the very foundation of the Christian character. It stands in direct contrast to the mind of the world, which seeks self-exaltation, pride, and power.

*   **Self-Renouncing Love:** The context of this verse describes Christ leaving the glories of heaven to become a servant and die on the cross (Philippians 2:6–8). The mind of Christ is the spirit of self-sacrifice for the good of others.
*   **Humility:** True greatness in the Kingdom of Heaven is found in humility. Christ did not grasp at equality with God but emptied Himself. This mind leads the believer to esteem others better than themselves (Philippians 2:3).
*   **Submission to the Father:** Christ’s mind was completely tuned to the Father’s will. "I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me" (John 5:30). To have His mind is to have the law of God written on the heart, delighting to do His will.
*   **Transformation:** We cannot manufacture this mind. It is a gift of the Holy Spirit. As we behold Christ through the study of His Word, we are changed into the same image (2 Corinthians 3:18). This is the work of **Sanctification**.
    *   **Definition:** *Sanctification* is the progressive work of the Holy Spirit in the believer’s life, removing the love of sin and imparting the character of Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]**
If you take a jar filled with stale air and try to empty it by hand, you will fail. But if you plunge that jar into a flowing river, the water rushes in and drives the air out entirely. We cannot empty ourselves of pride and selfishness by sheer willpower. We must immerse ourselves in the ocean of Christ’s love; His presence fills us and displaces the selfish mind.

### Q3. While yet but a child, what example of obedience to parents did He present to us?

**“And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.” Luke 2:51.**

**Answer:**
Even though He was the Creator of the universe, Jesus submitted Himself to earthly parents. This teaches us that true religion begins in the home and in the faithful performance of humble duties.

*   **Sanctifying the Home Life:** Jesus spent thirty years in obscurity, working as a carpenter and obeying His parents. He showed that manual labor is honorable and that obedience to the Fifth Commandment ("Honor thy father and thy mother") is a vital part of righteousness.
*   **Holiness in Little Things:** Many yearn for a great pulpit or a public ministry, yet neglect their duties at home. Christ’s example proves that sweeping a floor, sawing a plank, or obeying a parent, when done for the glory of God, is as holy as preaching a sermon.
*   **Preparation for Ministry:** Before He could minister to the world as High Priest, He learned obedience and faithfulness in the "little things" of Nazareth.

**[ILL]**
A builder knows that the foundation of a skyscraper, though hidden underground, carries the weight of the entire structure. If the foundation is weak, the building collapses. Jesus’ thirty years of hidden obedience in Nazareth were the foundation of His public ministry. If we cannot be Christians in our own kitchens and living rooms, we cannot be Christians in the pulpit.

***

### Q4. How are His childhood and youth described?

**“And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.” Verse 52 [Luke 2:52].**

**Answer:**
This verse presents a picture of balanced, holistic development. The plan of salvation restores the whole person—mental, physical, and spiritual.

*   **Physical Health ("Stature"):** Jesus cared for His body. He grew in physical strength. The laws of health are part of God’s law. To abuse the body is to weaken the instrument through which the Holy Spirit works.
*   **Mental Growth ("Wisdom"):** Jesus studied the Scriptures and the book of nature. His mind was clear and vigorous because He did not pollute it with sin or error.
*   **Spiritual and Social Grace ("Favor with God and man"):** He maintained a vertical connection with His Father and a horizontal connection of kindness toward His neighbors.
*   **The Model for Education:** True education is the harmonious development of the physical, mental, and spiritual powers. As we grow in grace (2 Peter 3:18), we should see development in all these areas.

***

### Q5. What example did He give us in regard to baptism?

**“Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad Him, saying, I have need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then He suffered him.” Matthew 3:13-15.**

**Answer:**
Jesus had no sin to wash away, yet He insisted on baptism. This is a profound lesson in His role as our Representative and Substitute.

*   **Fulfilling All Righteousness:** Jesus identified Himself with sinners. He took the steps that we are required to take, leaving us an example. If the sinless Son of God obeyed this ordinance, how much more should sinful mortals?
*   **The Pledge of Obedience:** Baptism is an outward sign of an inward renunciation of sin and a pledge to live a new life in Christ (Romans 6:3–4).
*   **The Approval of Heaven:** Upon His baptism, the Holy Spirit descended, and the Father spoke: "This is my beloved Son" (Matthew 3:17). When we follow Christ in baptism and obedience, we too are accepted in the Beloved.
*   **Connection to the Sanctuary:** Just as the priests were washed with water before entering the sanctuary service (Exodus 29:4), Christ was baptized to inaugurate His public ministry as the Messiah.

**[ILL]**
A general may not need to carry a heavy pack like a private soldier, but to build morale and show unity with his troops, he marches with them, carrying the same load. Jesus, the Captain of our salvation, stepped into the waters of Jordan not because He needed cleansing, but to march alongside us, showing us the path of obedience.

***

### Q6. How important was prayer in His life?

**“He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.” Luke 6:12. “He took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.” Luke 9:28.**

**Answer:**
If the Son of God, who was sinless, felt the need to spend entire nights in prayer, how much more do we, who are weak and sinful, need to pray?

*   **Source of Power:** Jesus did no miracle and spoke no word on His own authority; He lived in total dependence on the Father (John 5:19). Prayer was the channel through which He received strength to overcome Satan and fulfill His mission.
*   **Preceding Great Decisions:** In Luke 6:12, He prayed all night before choosing His twelve disciples. We should never make major life decisions without earnest prayer.
*   **Communion:** Prayer is not just asking for things; it is the breath of the soul. It is "opening the heart to God as to a friend." Jesus sought solitude to commune with His Father away from the noise of the world.
*   **Victory over Temptation:** In Gethsemane, it was prayer that prepared Him for the cross (Matthew 26:41). A prayerless Christian is a defenseless Christian.

***

### Q7. To what kind of work did Jesus dedicate His life?

**“Who went about doing good.” Acts 10:38.**

**Answer:**
The life of Jesus was a life of active benevolence. He did not live in a monastery or isolate Himself from human suffering.

*   **Ministry to the Body and Soul:** He healed the sick, fed the hungry, and comforted the mourning. His method was to mingle with people as one who desired their good, minister to their needs, win their confidence, and then bid them, "Follow Me."
*   **Unselfish Service:** He lived entirely for others. "The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister" (Matthew 20:28).
*   **Our Pattern:** The followers of Christ are called to continue this work. True religion is to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction (James 1:27). We are to be His hands and feet in a hurting world.

**[ILL]**
A river that has no outlet becomes a stagnant swamp (like the Dead Sea). It receives water but gives nothing, and so it cannot support life. A river that flows (like the Sea of Galilee) is full of life because it receives and then gives. The Christian who only receives truth but does not "go about doing good" will spiritually stagnate. We must be channels of blessing.

***

### Q8. What was it that caused Jesus to leave the riches of heaven and come down and live here on earth?

**“For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich.” 2 Corinthians 8:9.**

**Answer:**
This verse describes the "Great Exchange" of the Gospel. It was pure, unmerited love (grace) that motivated the Incarnation.

*   **His Riches:** Christ possessed the glory of the Godhead, the adoration of angels, and the command of the universe.
*   **His Poverty:** He took on human nature, was born in a stable, owned no home ("nowhere to lay His head"), and died a criminal’s death, stripped of everything.
*   **Our Riches:** Because He took our poverty (our sin, our guilt, our death), we receive His riches (His righteousness, His Spirit, eternal life).
*   **Imputed and Imparted Righteousness:**
    *   He took our record of sin so we could have His record of perfect obedience (Justification).
    *   He sends His Spirit to dwell in us, enriching our characters with His virtues (Sanctification).

***

### Q9. When misunderstood, reviled, and mistreated, what did He do?

**“Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously.” 1 Peter 2:23.**

**Answer:**
This is one of the most difficult yet necessary tests of the Christian life: the control of the temper and the tongue under provocation.

*   **Non-Retaliation:** The natural heart says, "Strike back!" or "Defend your rights!" The heart of Christ says, "Love your enemies." Jesus did not trade insult for insult.
*   **Trust in Judgment:** He did not need to vindicate Himself because He trusted the Father to handle the judgment. We can let go of resentment when we realize that God sees all and judges righteously (Romans 12:19).
*   **Silence is Golden:** Often, the most Christ-like response to unjust accusation is silence. "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth" (Isaiah 53:7).
*   **Victory over Pride:** Retaliation stems from wounded pride. When we are dead to self (Galatians 2:20), insults cannot hurt us because a dead man cannot be offended.

**[ILL]**
If you throw a burning coal at someone to hurt them, you must burn your own hand first. Holding onto anger and the desire for revenge damages the holder more than the target. Christ dropped the "coal" of judgment into the Father’s hands, leaving His own hands free to heal and bless.

***

### Q10. How did He pray for those who crucified Him?

**“Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” Luke 23:34.** (See Acts 3:17.)

**Answer:**
Even in the agony of the cross, while nails were being driven through His flesh, Christ’s concern was for the souls of His tormentors.

*   **The Spirit of Intercession:** He began His work of intercession even before He reached the heavenly sanctuary. He pleaded the blood He was shedding for the very men shedding it.
*   **Pity for the Sinner:** He saw them as deceived by Satan ("they know not what they do"). He hated the sin, but loved the sinner.
*   **The Standard for Us:** We cannot claim to be His followers if we harbor unforgiveness. "If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses" (Matthew 6:15).

***

### Q11. What did the Bible predict His life would be like?

**“Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” Hebrews 1:9.**

**Answer:**
This prophecy gives the secret of Christ's character and the secret of all true happiness ("oil of gladness").

*   **Loving Righteousness:** It is not enough to merely *do* what is right as a duty; we must come to *love* it. God wants to write His law in our hearts so that we delight to do His will (Psalm 40:8).
*   **Hating Iniquity:** Conversely, we must not only avoid sin but develop a hatred for it because of what it does to God and man. Sin murdered the Son of God.
*   **The Definition of Sanctification:** True sanctification is coming to be in such harmony with God that we love what He loves and hate what He hates.
*   **The Result:** Gladness. Sin promises happiness but brings misery. Righteousness brings the true "oil of gladness."

**[ILL]**
A magnet naturally attracts iron and repels non-magnetic materials. A heart sanctified by the Holy Spirit becomes like a spiritual magnet—it is naturally drawn to purity, truth, and kindness, and it is naturally repelled by impurity and dishonesty. It does not struggle to "like" the good; it is its new nature.

***

### Q12. How powerfully can Jesus bring us salvation?

**“I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.” Isaiah 63:1.**

**Answer:**
Our Savior is not weak or limited. He is "mighty to save."

*   **Power Over Sin:** The Gospel is "the power of God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16). There is no habit so deep-rooted, no hereditary tendency so strong, that Jesus cannot break its chains.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** He speaks in righteousness. When He declares a sinner righteous (Justification), He has the power to make that declaration a reality in the life (Sanctification). His word has creative power.
*   **Hope for the Worst Case:** No one should say, "I am too far gone." The arm of the Lord is not shortened that it cannot save (Isaiah 59:1).

***

### Q13. What was Christ's purpose in coming to this world?

**“For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” Luke 19:10.**

**Answer:**
This verse highlights the initiative of God. Man did not seek God; God sought man.

*   **The Lost:** Humanity was lost in sin, condemned by the law, and separated from the Father. "Lost" implies value—we do not worry about losing garbage, only things of value. God values the human soul.
*   **To Seek:** The Shepherd leaves the ninety-nine to find the one lost sheep. He comes to where we are—in our mess and brokenness.
*   **To Save:** He does not just find us; He rescues us. He saves us from the *penalty* of sin (death) and the *power* of sin (enslavement).
*   **Atonement:**
    *   **Definition:** *Atonement* literally means "at-one-ment." It is the work of reconciling estranged humanity with God through the sacrifice and mediation of Christ (Romans 5:11).

***

### Q14. Through what was Christ made a complete and perfect Saviour?

**“For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.” Hebrews 2:10.**

**Answer:**
This does not mean Christ was morally imperfect and needed to become good. It means He was functionally *qualified* (perfected) for His office as High Priest through suffering.

*   **Experiential Knowledge:** By suffering as a human, Christ learned by experience what it means to struggle, to be hungry, to be rejected, and to face death.
*   **The School of Suffering:** "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered" (Hebrews 5:8).
*   **Our Captain:** He is the "Captain" (or Trailblazer) of our salvation. He has walked the dark path before us. He does not ask us to endure any pain that He has not already endured.

**[ILL]**
A surgeon may have read every medical book in the library, but until he has held the scalpel and performed surgery, he is not fully "perfected" or qualified for his trade. Christ knew the theory of human suffering as God, but He "perfected" His qualification as our Sympathetic Priest by experiencing it in human flesh.

***

### Q15. As a result of His suffering and temptation, what is Christ able to do?

**“For in that He himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted.” Hebrews 2:18.**

**Answer:**
*   **Succour:** This old English word means "to run to the aid of" or "to help in time of distress."
*   **Sympathy:** Because He felt the full force of Satan’s temptations in the wilderness and Gethsemane, He knows exactly what we are going through. He is not a distant God.
*   **Victory is Available:** He was tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15). This proves that sin is not a necessity. By relying on the same power He used—the Word of God and the Spirit—we too may overcome.
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the earthly sanctuary, the priest had to be one of the brethren so he could have compassion. Jesus is our brother-Priest in the Heavenly Sanctuary.

***

### Q16. How complete a Saviour is He?

**“Wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.” Hebrews 7:25.**

**Answer:**
This is one of the most encouraging verses in Scripture regarding the **Priesthood of Christ**.

*   **To the Uttermost:** This means completely, entirely, and forever. There is no sin He cannot forgive, and no character flaw He cannot heal, if we come to Him.
*   **Present Truth:** He "ever liveth." He is not dead; He is alive in the Heavenly Sanctuary right now.
*   **Intercession:**
    *   **Definition:** *Intercession* is Christ's work in the Heavenly Sanctuary where He applies the merits of His sacrifice to the individual believer’s account. He stands between the sinner and the broken law, presenting His blood as the answer to the law’s claims.
*   **Coming by Him:** Salvation is inclusive (open to all) but exclusive (only through Him). "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).

***

### Q17. From what is He able to keep us?

**“Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy.” Jude 24.** (See verse 25.)

**Answer:**
Here is the pinnacle of the Gospel promise—not just forgiveness for past falls, but power to keep from falling.

*   **Kept from Falling:** A "fall" is yielding to sin. Christ is able to keep the surrendered believer from sinning. "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit [practice] sin" (1 John 3:9). This requires our constant consent and cooperation with His Spirit.
*   **Faultless:** The goal of the plan of salvation is to restore the image of God in man perfectly. In the final judgment (investigative judgment), God’s people will be found "without fault before the throne of God" (Revelation 14:5).
    *   This is not by their own works, but because they are washed in the blood and clothed in His righteousness, and His life has been lived out in them.
*   **Exceeding Joy:** A sinless life is a joyful life. Holiness is not gloom; it is the recovery of true joy.

**[ILL]**
A toddler learning to walk falls constantly. A loving parent holds the child's hand. As long as the child holds tight to the parent, they are "kept from falling." If the child lets go to run into danger, they fall. We are safe only as long as our hand is in the hand of Christ.

***

### Q18. What does Jesus, our Pattern, Helper, and Friend, call those who accept Him?

**“Henceforth I call you not servants;... I have called you friends.” John 15:15.**

**Answer:**
*   **Servants vs. Friends:** A servant (slave) obeys orders without understanding the master's plans or heart. A friend shares the master's counsel, understands his goals, and cooperates voluntarily out of love.
*   **Intimacy:** Jesus invites us into the inner circle. He reveals to us the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.
*   **Partnership:** We become "laborers together with God" (1 Corinthians 3:9).

***

### Q19. What kind of friend is He?

**“There is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother.” Proverbs 18:24.**

**Answer:**
*   **Faithfulness:** Human relationships may fail. Families may be divided. But Jesus is the Friend who never leaves nor forsakes (Hebrews 13:5).
*   **Availability:** A brother may be distant or unable to help, but Jesus is "a very present help in trouble" (Psalm 46:1).
*   **Unchanging:** "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever" (Hebrews 13:8).

***

### Q20. What is the evidence of a genuine friend?

**“A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.” Proverbs 17:17.**

**Answer:**
*   **Consistency:** Fair-weather friends disappear when trouble comes (as the prodigal son discovered). Jesus proves His friendship most powerfully in our "adversity."
*   **Our Response:** If He is such a friend to us, we ought to be such friends to Him. We show our friendship by keeping His commandments (John 15:14) and standing up for His truth even when it is unpopular.
*   **The Conclusion:** In Christ, we have the Pattern to follow, the Helper to enable us, and the Friend to comfort us. "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift" (2 Corinthians 9:15).
