## Slide 1 – Title
- **Topic:** Divine Justice and Recompense
- **Theme:** God’s Law, Our Choices, and Eternal Rewards
- **Scripture focus:** Understanding the principles of judgment and grace.

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: Benevolence
- **Question:** What principle of justice should govern us in our intercourse with one another?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 3:27 – “Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Active Benevolence)
- **Active Benevolence:**
  - It is not enough to merely refrain from harming others.
  - God’s law requires positive action to help those in need.
- **Stewardship of Power:**
  - God gives resources (time, influence, money) to be shared, not hoarded.
  - 1 Peter 4:10 – “As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.”
- **The Debt of Love:**
  - We owe a debt of love to others because of God’s love for us.
  - Romans 13:8 – “Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.”

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **The Source of Goodness:**
  - We do not do good to earn salvation, but because Jesus lives in us.
  - Romans 5:5 – “And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.”
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - When Christ dwells within, His character of self-sacrificing love is **imparted** to the believer.
  - His life naturally flows outward to others.

---

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Reservoir and the Channel:**
  - A **reservoir** that only takes in water and never releases it becomes stagnant (like the Dead Sea).
  - A **channel** receives water only to pass it on, staying fresh and bringing life to the fields.
  - **Lesson:** The Christian is called to be a channel, instantly passing the mercy received from Heaven to those around them.

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Law of Recompense
- **Question:** What general rule of recompense is given in the Scriptures?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:1, 2 – “Judge not, that ye be not judged, for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points (Spiritual Reciprocity)
- **The Golden Rule Reversed:**
  - The attitude we maintain toward the faults of others determines the standard by which we are measured.
- **The Danger of a Critical Spirit:**
  - To "judge" here means to condemn harshly or hold a censorious spirit.
  - This is opposite to the spirit of Jesus, who came to save (John 3:17 – “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”).
- **The Divine Mirror:**
  - We cannot claim the mercy of the Gospel while practicing the severity of the law against our neighbor.

---

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Echo:**
  - If a man shouts at a mountain, "I hate you!", the echo returns, "I hate you!"
  - If he shouts, "I love you!", the echo returns, "I love you!"
  - **Lesson:** Life is an echo. The measure of grace or judgment we send out to the world comes back to us—from men, and ultimately in God's judgment.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Rendering Evil for Evil
- **Question:** Should one, in any case, render evil for evil?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Romans 12:17 – “Recompense to no man evil for evil.”
  - 1 Peter 3:9 – “Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Overcoming by Grace)
- **No Retaliation:**
  - Christ abolished personal retaliation (Matthew 5:38–39).
  - Revenge has no place in the Christian life.
- **A Miracle of Grace:**
  - The natural heart wants to hit back.
  - Returning blessing for cursing is the strongest evidence of being born again.
  - 1 Corinthians 13:4 – “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.”

---

## Slide 11 – Q3: Sanctuary Application
- **Looking to our High Priest:**
  - When reviled, we look to Jesus, our example and Priest.
  - 1 Peter 2:23 – “Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.”
- **Trusting the Judgment:**
  - We leave all "recompense" in God's hands rather than taking it into our own.

---

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Sandalwood Tree:**
  - The sandalwood tree imparts its fragrance even to the axe that cuts it down.
  - **Lesson:** The Christian, filled with the Spirit of Christ, responds to the sharp blows of insult or persecution with the fragrance of prayer and forgiveness.

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Rendering Evil for Good
- **Question:** What is said of those who render evil for good?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 17:13 – “Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q4: Key Points
- **A Dangerous Spiritual Condition:**
  - To return evil for evil is human.
  - To return good for evil is divine.
  - To return evil for *good* is diabolical.
- **Ingratitude:**
  - Exemplified by Judas, who betrayed Christ after receiving years of love.
- **The Consequence:**
  - "Evil shall not depart from his house."
  - Rejecting the Holy Spirit (the ultimate Good) leaves us open to the control of the enemy.

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Rewards and Character
- **Question:** Will all men be rewarded irrespective of character?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 11:31 – “Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.”

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points
- **Defined by Character:**
  - God looks at what we *are* (character), not just what we profess.
- **Two Recompenses:**
  - **Righteous:** Receive eternal life.
    - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
  - **Wicked:** Receive the "wages" of sin (death).
- **Certainty of Judgment:**
  - If God disciplines the righteous to purify them, judgment will surely fall on those who willfully reject His law.

---

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Coin Press:**
  - A mint presses an image onto metal coins.
  - If the metal is too brittle or hard to receive the image, it is discarded.
  - **Lesson:** In judgment, God looks for the image of His Son impressed upon the soul. If the character of Christ is not there, the "coin" is counterfeit.

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: The Test of Works
- **Question:** Will each man's work be fully brought to light and tested?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 3:13 – “Every man's work shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire: and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points (Judgment & Sanctuary)
- **The Fire of Judgment:**
  - Fire burns away dross; only that which is built on Christ ("gold, silver") endures.
  - Hypocrisy and outward show will be consumed.
- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - Before Christ returns, there is an investigation in the heavenly sanctuary (Daniel 7:9–10).
  - The books are opened to demonstrate who has accepted the wedding garment of Christ’s righteousness.
- **Fitness for Heaven:**
  - We need both a title to heaven (justification) and a fitness for heaven (sanctification).

---

## Slide 20 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Building Inspector:**
  - A builder can hide faulty wiring or foundations behind beautiful drywall.
  - It looks perfect until the earthquake comes or the inspector opens the wall.
  - **Lesson:** God is the inspector who sees behind the "drywall" of our public reputation to the true structure of the character.

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Divine Impartiality
- **Question:** Will partiality be shown in decisions rendered?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 18:25 – “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?”
  - Romans 2:11 – “For there is no respect of persons with God.”

---

## Slide 22 – Q7: Key Points
- **No Respect of Persons:**
  - God cannot be bribed or impressed by wealth, status, or race.
  - He looks on the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).
- **According to Deeds:**
  - Romans 2:6 – “Who will render to every man according to his deeds.”
  - Works are the infallible evidence of faith (James 2:20).
- **Justice and Mercy:**
  - Psalm 89:14 – “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne; mercy and truth shall go before thy face.”
  - Through the Atonement, justice and mercy meet (Psalm 85:10). God is just, and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus.

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Our Power of Choice
- **Question:** May we not in reality decide for ourselves what our recompense shall be?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 30:15 – “See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.”

---

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points (Freedom & Faith)
- **The Two Ways:**
  - Jeremiah 21:8 – “Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.”
  - We decide today where we will be in eternity.
- **Freedom of Will:**
  - God draws us by His Spirit, but the final decision rests with the human will.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - Choosing "life" means choosing Christ.
  - We surrender the will so He can work in us.
  - Philippians 2:13 – “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Voter:**
  - Imagine an election where you cast a vote every single day.
  - A vote for self is a vote for death.
  - A vote for Christ is a vote for life.
  - **Lesson:** The final result is simply the tally of the life's daily direction.

---

## Slide 26 – Q9: The Universal Judgment
- **Question:** Will the cases of any be overlooked in the judgment?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:10 – “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points
- **No Exemptions:**
  - "All" includes kings, slaves, believers, and skeptics.
- **The Record:**
  - Ecclesiastes 12:14 – “For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”
- **The Standard:**
  - We are judged by the Law of God (James 2:12).
- **The Advocate:**
  - Our only hope is Jesus. He covers confessed sins with His blood (Justification) and points to His work in our hearts (Sanctification).

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: The Law of the Harvest
- **Question:** What shall determine the nature of the reward in each case?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:7 – “Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”

---

## Slide 29 – Q10: Key Points (Cause & Effect)
- **God is Not Mocked:**
  - Men may fool themselves, but God knows the seed (motive) behind every act.
- **Natural Consequence:**
  - Judgment is the harvest.
  - If you plant seeds of selfishness, the only possible harvest is death.
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the blood recorded the sin.
  - In the heavenly sanctuary, our sins are recorded. We are sowing records in heaven every day.

---

## Slide 30 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Garden:**
  - A gardener cannot plant weeds all spring and expect a harvest of vegetables in autumn.
  - **Lesson:** The harvest is simply the multiplication of the seed. One sin can produce a harvest of misery.

---

## Slide 31 – Q11: The Harvest of the Wicked
- **Question:** Define the harvest of the wrong doer.
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:8 – “For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q11: Key Points
- **Sowing to the Flesh:**
  - Living to satisfy selfish desires independent of God’s will.
- **Corruption:**
  - Implies decay, ruin, and destruction.
  - Sin destroys the conscience, health, and the connection with God.
- **Tribulation and Anguish:**
  - Romans 2:9 – “Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil...”
  - The ultimate harvest is the "Second Death" (separation from the Source of Life).

---

## Slide 33 – Q12: The Harvest of the Righteous
- **Question:** What shall be the recompense of the righteous?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:8 – “But he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q12: Key Points
- **Sowing to the Spirit:**
  - Yielding to the Holy Spirit, studying the Word, relying on Christ’s power.
  - Sowing acts of kindness, obedience, and faith.
- **The Reward:**
  - Romans 2:10 – “But glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good...”
  - **Peace:** The wicked have "no peace" (Isaiah 57:21), but the righteous have peace with God (Romans 5:1).
- **A Gift of the Spirit:**
  - We do not produce eternal life by works; we reap it as a gift *from* the Spirit, but we must sow to receive it.

---

## Slide 35 – Q13: The Close of Probation
- **Question:** What scripture brings to view the cases of all as decided forever, and the time when it is accomplished?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 22:11, 12 – “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly...”

---

## Slide 36 – Q13: Key Points
- **A Solemn Decree:**
  - This marks the **Close of Probation**, shortly before the Second Coming.
  - Intercession in the sanctuary ceases; Christ steps from Mediator to King.
- **Permanence of Character:**
  - "Let him be..." indicates the character is fixed forever.
  - No second chances or purgatory after this point.
  - Those who are holy are settled into the truth and remain holy.

---

## Slide 37 – Q13: Illustration
- **Setting Cement:**
  - Wet cement can be molded and shaped.
  - Once it sets, it becomes stone; you cannot change its shape without breaking it.
  - **Lesson:** Our characters are currently like wet cement. At the close of probation, the character "sets" for eternity.

---

## Slide 38 – Q14: The Impossibility of Escape
- **Question:** Then with what force is the subject under consideration brought home to each heart?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:2, 3 – “For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?”

---

## Slide 39 – Q14: Key Points & Appeal
- **The Logic of Judgment:**
  - If God punished violations of the Old Covenant, how serious is it to ignore the Son of God?
- **The Danger of Neglect:**
  - We do not have to fight God to be lost; we only need to *neglect* the relationship.
  - Drifting leads to the same "recompense" as rebellion.
- **The Great Salvation:**
  - The Gospel saves us *from* sin (pardon and power).
  - **Appeal:** Today is the day of salvation. Let us sow to the Spirit.
