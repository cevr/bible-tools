### Q1. How does God regard the Gentiles? “Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also." Rom. 3:29.

**Answer:**
The plan of salvation has never been limited by geography or genealogy. The Apostle Paul here strikes at the root of national pride and exclusivity. Since there is only one Creator, there is only one God for all humanity.

*   **Universal Need:** In the verses immediately preceding this (Romans 3:23), Paul establishes that "all have sinned." Since the disease of sin is universal, the remedy—the Gospel—must also be universal.
*   **Universal Access:** If God is the God of the Gentiles, then the Gentiles have access to His throne, His grace, and His law just as the Jews did.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
This truth is foundational to Righteousness by Faith. We are not saved by our heritage, our family line, or our church membership. We are saved because God, who is the Father of all spirits, provides the righteousness of Christ to any soul—Jew or Gentile—who claims it by faith.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a great famine strikes the entire world. A wealthy king opens a granary. If he were only the king of a certain village, only that village would eat. But because he is the King of the whole realm, the doors are open to everyone in the kingdom who is hungry. God is the King of the whole earth; therefore, the Bread of Life is for every hungry soul.

### Q2. Is God partial to either Jew or Gentile? “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him." Acts 10:34, 35.

**Answer:**
God’s impartiality is a central attribute of His character. He does not look at the outward appearance, but at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).

*   **He that feareth Him:** This refers to a reverential trust and awe of God—the beginning of wisdom (Psalm 111:10).
*   **Worketh Righteousness:** This is not a legalistic attempt to earn salvation. Rather, it is the outward evidence of an inward faith. True faith always works by love and purifies the soul (Galatians 5:6).

**Doctrinal Insight:**
God accepts the person who surrenders to Him, regardless of their background. In the investigative judgment, the question will not be "What was your nationality?" but "Did you have the faith of Jesus, and did that faith produce obedience to God's commandments?" (Revelation 14:12).

**Definition:**
*   **Accepted:** To be received with favor; to be justified. In Christ, we are "accepted in the beloved" (Ephesians 1:6).

---

### Q3. What rule must be applied to convict anyone of sin? “For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not Imputed when there is no law." Rom. 5:13.

**Answer:**
To understand our condition, we must have a standard of measurement. That standard is the moral law of God.

*   **The Detector of Sin:** Just as a crooked line cannot be known as crooked without a straight ruler, a sinner cannot know they are a sinner without the moral law (Romans 3:20; 7:7).
*   **Universal Application:** Since Gentiles are sinners (as seen in Q1), there must be a law that applies to them. If the Ten Commandments were only for the Jews, then Gentiles could not be charged with sin. But because sin *is* imputed to the world, the Law must be binding upon the world.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
We cannot appreciate the remedy (Christ's righteousness) until we understand the malady (sin). The law acts as a mirror to show us the dirt on our faces, but it cannot wash it off. It drives us to the Fountain—Christ—for cleansing.

**Definition:**
*   **Imputed:** To be reckoned, accounted, or charged to one's account. Sin is charged against us when we violate the known will of God.

**[ILL]**
A man is driving down a highway at 80 miles per hour. If there are no speed limit signs and no traffic laws exist, he cannot be given a ticket. But if the law says "55 MPH," he is guilty. The law does not make him speed, but it reveals that his speed is a transgression. So God's law reveals our deviations from His righteousness.

---

### Q4. For whom is the law made? “Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, ...for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine." 1 Tim. 1:9, 10.

**Answer:**
This text is often misunderstood. It does not mean that a righteous man is free to break the law. It means the law does not stand against him as an accuser or an enemy.

*   **For the Lawless:** The law stands as a barrier, a "schoolmaster," and a judge against those who live in rebellion. It condemns their sin.
*   **For the Righteous:** When a man is justified by faith and the Holy Spirit writes the law in his heart (Hebrews 8:10), he is in harmony with the law. He does not keep the law because he fears arrest; he keeps it because it is his nature to love God and man. The law is not "made for" him in the sense of being a weapon against him, because he and the law are friends.

**Sanctuary Connection:**
In the Ark of the Covenant, the Law was covered by the Mercy Seat. For the repentant sinner, the blood of Christ covers the condemnation of the law. But for the unrepentant, the law demands justice.

---

### Q5. Were the Gentiles addicted to such practices? “This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles,... who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness." Eph. 4:17, 19.

**Answer:**
Paul describes the natural condition of the human heart without God. The "Gentiles" here represent the unregenerate world.

*   **Past Feeling:** Sin has a hardening effect. The conscience becomes seared (1 Timothy 4:2) until the sinner no longer feels the conviction of the Holy Spirit.
*   **The Need for Change:** The Gospel demands a complete transformation. We cannot "walk as other Gentiles" and walk with Christ at the same time. This separation from the world is essential to the Christian walk (2 Corinthians 6:17).

**Righteousness by Faith:**
This describes the "old man" of sin. Salvation involves the crucifixion of this old nature and the resurrection of a "new man" created in righteousness and true holiness (Ephesians 4:24). It is not just forgiveness of past sins, but deliverance from the power of current sins.

---

### Q6. Speaking of how God would visit the Gentiles and take out a people for Himself, what did James say was fallen down, and would be built up again? “And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up." Acts 15, 16.

**Answer:**
James, presiding over the Jerusalem Council, quotes the prophet Amos (Amos 9:11–12) to settle the question of Gentile converts.

*   **The Tabernacle of David:** This represents the kingdom of God and the true worship of Jehovah. It had "fallen down" through the apostasy of Israel and the rejection of the Messiah.
*   **The Rebuilding:** God was rebuilding His spiritual house, not with bricks and mortar, but with "living stones"—believers from both Jewish and Gentile backgrounds (1 Peter 2:5).

**Sanctuary Connection:**
The earthly sanctuary was a type. The "building up" here refers to the establishment of the church as the dwelling place of the Spirit, where the law of God is kept in the heart, not just in a stone ark.

---

### Q7. What was to be the result of building again the tabernacle of David? “That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom My name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things." Acts 15:17.

**Answer:**
The purpose of restoring true worship is missional—it is so that "the residue of men" (the rest of humanity) might seek the Lord.

*   **Called by My Name:** God places His name—His character—upon His people. Whether Jew or Gentile, if they bear His name, they are His.
*   **Global Scale:** The Gospel commission (Matthew 28:19–20) is the fulfillment of this prophecy. The "tabernacle" is expanded to cover the whole earth.

---

### Q8. For whom was the Sabbath made? “The Sabbath was made for man." Mark 2:27.

**Answer:**
This is one of the most pivotal verses regarding the universality of the Sabbath.

*   **"Man" (Anthropos):** The Greek word used here is generic for "mankind" or "humanity," not "Jews."
*   **Timing:** The Sabbath was made at Creation (Genesis 2:1–3), more than 2,000 years before there was a single Jew (Abraham's descendants).
*   **Purpose:** It was made *for* man—for his benefit, his rest, and his spiritual connection with the Creator. It is not a burden to be borne, but a gift to be received.

**[ILL]**
If a father gives a beautiful estate to his first son, and that son eventually has many descendants, the estate belongs to the family line. The Sabbath was given to Adam, the father of the human race. Therefore, every descendant of Adam—whether African, Asian, European, or Jew—inherits the blessing of the Sabbath. It is the birthright of humanity.

---

### Q9. What particular day did God reserve for the Sabbath, and command man to keep? “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20:10.

**Answer:**
God is specific. He did not say "one day in seven" or "a seventh day," but "*The* seventh day."

*   **The Lord's Day:** The text says it is the Sabbath "of the Lord." It belongs to Him. He calls it "My holy day" (Isaiah 58:13).
*   **The Command:** It is the only commandment that begins with "Remember," implying that humanity (and specifically Israel in the wilderness) was prone to forget it.

**Theological Point:**
If the Sabbath is the Lord's day, and the Lord is the God of the Gentiles (as established in Q1), then the Sabbath is the day for the Gentiles to worship their God.

---

### Q10. What does the Lord, through Isaiah, pronounce upon those who keep the Sabbath? “Blessed is the man [any man] that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil." Isa. 56:2.

**Answer:**
The blessing of the Sabbath is conditional upon its observance, but universal in its scope.

*   **"The Son of Man":** This phrase applies to any human being.
*   **Holiness of Life:** Notice the connection between keeping the Sabbath and keeping one's hand from "doing any evil." The Sabbath is a sign of sanctification (Exodus 31:13). A person cannot truly keep the Sabbath holy while living a life of known sin. The weekly rest is a sign of the rest from the works of sin that we find in Christ (Hebrews 4:3–10).

---

### Q11. How does he say the stranger (Gentile) should feel when uniting with his people? “Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the Lord. speak. saying. The Lord hath utterly separated me from His people." Isa. 56:3.

**Answer:**
God anticipates the feelings of exclusion that Gentiles might feel and addresses them directly.

*   **No Caste System:** In God’s plan, there is no second-class citizenship. The stranger who joins the Lord is not "separated."
*   **Union with Christ:** Paul confirms this in Ephesians 2:14, stating that Christ has "broken down the middle wall of partition." In the observance of the Sabbath, the Gentile stands on equal holy ground with the Jew.

---

### Q12. What does He say He will do for the stranger who keeps His Sabbath? “Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve Him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be His servants, everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even them will I bring to My holy mountain. and make them joyful in My house of prayer... The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will gather others to Him, beside those that are gathered unto Him." Isa. 56:6-8.

**Answer:**
This is a powerful prophecy of the gathering of the Gentiles in the last days.

1.  **The Condition:** They join the Lord, serve Him, love His name, and *keep the Sabbath*.
2.  **The Covenant:** Keeping the Sabbath is equated here with "taking hold of My covenant." The Sabbath is the seal of the covenant, the sign of allegiance to the Creator.
3.  **The Promise:** God brings them to His "holy mountain" (Zion/The Church) and makes them joyful.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
"Serving" and "loving" precede the keeping of the Sabbath here. We keep the Sabbath because we love the Lord and have joined ourselves to Him. It is the outward sign of an inward love relationship.

**Definition:**
*   **Covenant:** A binding agreement or promise. The "New Covenant" is God's promise to write His law (including the Sabbath) upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10).

---

### Q13. What two classes did Paul once address at Antioch on the Sabbath? Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience." Acts 13:16.

**Answer:**
Paul addresses two distinct groups in the synagogue:
1.  **Men of Israel:** Born Jews.
2.  **Ye that fear God:** Gentiles who had turned from paganism to worship the true God.

**Significance:**
Both groups were present *on the Sabbath*. The "God-fearing" Gentiles did not have a separate Sunday service; they worshipped on the same day as the Jews, hearing the same Scriptures.

---

### Q14. Under what conditions was the church established in the Gentile city of Philippi? "And from hence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony; and we were in that city abiding certain days. And on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither." Acts 16:12, 13. Read also verses 14-40.

**Answer:**
This narrative provides evidence of apostolic Sabbath-keeping in a purely Gentile context.

*   **No Synagogue:** Philippi apparently did not have enough Jewish men to form a synagogue, so there was no formal Jewish service.
*   **Paul's Custom:** Despite being in a Gentile stronghold, Paul and his companions sought a place of prayer "on the Sabbath." They did not treat the day as common just because they were away from Jerusalem.
*   **The Result:** Lydia was converted, and the Philippian church was born—a church founded on a Sabbath prayer meeting by a river.

---

### Q15. At Corinth, what two classes assembled on the Sabbath to listen to the apostle's discourses? “And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks [Gentiles] ." Acts 18:4.

**Answer:**
In Corinth, a cosmopolitan Greek city, Paul's custom continued. He used the Sabbath day to persuade both "Jews and Greeks."

*   **Consistency:** If the Sabbath had been abolished at the cross, Paul lost a prime opportunity to tell these Greeks, "You don't need to come here on Saturday; we have a new day now." Instead, he utilized the Sabbath as the day for religious instruction for all.

---

### Q16. How long had Moses and the prophets been read in the synagogues? And how extensively were they taught? “For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day." Acts 15:21.

**Answer:**
The Scriptures (referred to as "Moses") were read weekly.

*   **The Bible of the Early Church:** The New Testament was not yet written. The early Christians, including Gentile converts, learned the Gospel by hearing the Old Testament types and prophecies explained on the Sabbath day.
*   **Universal Instruction:** This occurred "in every city." The Sabbath was the great educational institution of the ancient world for the knowledge of God.

---

### Q17. Of what two classes was the "congregation of Israel" made up? “And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle." Ex. 12:38.

**Answer:**
The Exodus was not a movement of a single ethnicity.
*   **Mixed Multitude:** These were Egyptians and other foreigners who chose to cast their lot with the God of Israel after seeing the plagues and the power of Jehovah.
*   **The Church in the Wilderness:** This "mixed multitude" (Acts 7:38) proves that the "church" has always been open to whosoever will come. They walked through the Red Sea and ate the manna just like the descendants of Jacob.

---

### Q18. How were these "strangers" regarded? “One law shall be to him that is home born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you." Ex. 12:49.

**Answer:**
God established a principle of equality before the law.

*   **No Double Standard:** There was not one moral code for the Israelite and a looser one for the Egyptian convert. Both were saved by the blood of the Passover lamb, and both were expected to walk in obedience to God's law.
*   **Application:** This principle remains. There is not one Sabbath for the Jew and a different day (or no day) for the Gentile Christian. "One law" governs the Kingdom of Heaven.

---

### Q19. Who murmured against Moses and Aaron after entering the wilderness? “And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness." Ex. 16:2.

**Answer:**
The "whole congregation" includes both the natural-born Israelites and the mixed multitude mentioned in Exodus 12:38. They were united in their dissatisfaction and lack of faith. It shows that human nature is the same in every race—prone to distrust God's providence.

---

### Q20. How did God prove the whole congregation? “Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you: and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in My law, or no." Ex. 16:4.

**Answer:**
God used the manna as a test of obedience *before* the law was spoken at Sinai (Exodus 20).

*   **The Test:** Would they trust God to provide double on Friday? Would they rest on the Sabbath as He commanded?
*   **"My Law":** This verse proves that the Sabbath law existed and was binding before the Ten Commandments were written on stone. It was already part of God's law.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
The test was about trust (faith). If they believed God's promise that the manna would last over the Sabbath, they would rest. If they doubted, they would work. Sabbath-keeping is a fruit of trusting God to sustain us.

---

### Q21. How did the people stand the test? “And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws?" Ex. 16:27, 28.

**Answer:**
Some failed the test. By going out to gather on the seventh day, they showed:
1.  **Unbelief:** They didn't believe God's word that there would be none.
2.  **Disobedience:** They violated the command to rest.

God's question, "How long refuse ye...?" implies this was not a new instruction. He held the mixed multitude and the Israelites equally responsible for keeping the Sabbath.

---

### Q22. How did all "the people" heed this stern rebuke? “So the people rested on the seventh day." Ex. 16:30.

**Answer:**
The rebuke brought about reform. "The people"—the entire mixed company—rested.

*   **Lesson:** God treats the Jew and Gentile alike. Both were obliged to observe the Sabbath because the Sabbath is the test of whether we will "walk in God's law or no."

---

### Q23. What instruction did Moses immediately begin giving to the people?” When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statute of God, and His laws." Ex. 18:16.

**Answer:**
This occurs in Exodus 18, still before the giving of the law on Sinai in Exodus 20. Moses was already teaching the people the "statutes of God."

*   **Oral Law:** The principles of God's government (including the Sabbath, as seen in Ex 16) were known to the patriarchs and were being taught to the mixed multitude before the mountain smoked and thundered.

---

### Q24. When God gave the Sabbath commandment from Sinai, did He mention these Gentiles by name? “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates." Ex. 20:10.

**Answer:**
Yes. The Fourth Commandment is unique in its detailed list of who must rest.

*   **"Thy Stranger":** This refers to the Gentile living among them. God explicitly commanded that the Gentile was to keep the Sabbath.
*   **Implication:** If the Sabbath were only a Jewish ceremonial sign, the stranger would not be required to keep it unless they became fully circumcised Jews. But the command applies even to the "stranger within the gates," showing the Sabbath's territorial and universal jurisdiction.

---

### Q25. What prayer did Solomon offer at the dedication of the temple, concerning the privileges and duties of the stranger? “Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of Thy people Israel, ...when he shall come and pray toward this house, hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all people of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee as do Thy people Israel." 1 Kings 8:41-43.

**Answer:**
Solomon understood that the Temple (the Sanctuary) was not an exclusive club for Israel.

*   **Missionary Purpose:** The goal of Israel's existence and the Temple service was "that all people of the earth may know Thy name."
*   **Sanctuary Truth:** The earthly sanctuary was a model of God's throne in heaven. Just as the "stranger" could pray toward the earthly temple and be heard, Gentiles today can look by faith into the Heavenly Sanctuary where Christ ministers and find grace.

---

### Q26. When all the redeemed people of the earth shall come up to worship before God in the new earth, what day will still be recognized by them?” And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord." Isa. 66:23.

**Answer:**
The history of the world ends where it began: with the Sabbath.

*   **Eden to Eden:** The Sabbath was established in Eden before sin (Genesis 2). It continues in the New Earth after sin is destroyed (Isaiah 66).
*   **"All Flesh":** This confirms the universal nature of the day. Not just Jews, but "all flesh"—the redeemed of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people—will gather to worship the Creator on His holy day.

**Conclusion:**
The Sabbath is the golden clasp that unites God with His people across all ages. It was given to Adam (humanity), kept by the mixed multitude in the wilderness, commanded for the stranger in the Decalogue, observed by the Apostles and Gentiles in the New Testament, and will be celebrated by all the saved in the Earth Made New. It is, and has always been, the Lord's Day for all mankind.

**[ILL]**
A flag represents a nation. It doesn't matter if a citizen was born in the country or naturalized later; they both salute the same flag. The Sabbath is the "flag" of God's government (Ezekiel 20:12, 20). Whether we are natural branches (Jews) or wild branches grafted in (Gentiles - Romans 11), we all salute the same King by honoring His flag, the holy Sabbath day.
