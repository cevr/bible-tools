Here is the presentation slide deck based on the study provided.

## Slide 1 – Q1: The Spirit in Creation
- **Question:** What is the first work the Bible ascribes to the Spirit of God?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:2 – “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Creation & New Creation)
- **From Chaos to Order:**
  - The earth was empty and confused.
  - The Spirit prepared the raw material to receive God's Word.
- **The Agent of Life:**
  - The word “moved” implies hovering or brooding (like a bird).
  - It suggests the imparting of life and energy.
- **Righteousness by Faith (The Spiritual Parallel):**
  - Just as the Spirit brought order to the earth, He brings order to the chaotic, sinful heart.
  - **Light:** 2 Corinthians 4:6 – “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”
  - **Life:** Ephesians 2:1 – “And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Sanctification)
- **Justification:** God speaks the word of forgiveness to the sinner.
- **Sanctification:** The Spirit organizes the life, bringing thoughts into obedience.
- **Scripture Support:**
  - 2 Corinthians 10:5 – “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Master Potter:**
  - Consider a shapeless, muddy lump of clay. It has no form or beauty.
  - The Potter’s hands (the Spirit) move over the clay to center and shape it.
  - Without the touch of the Spirit, we remain formless; with His touch, we become vessels of honor.
- **Scripture:**
  - Isaiah 64:8 – “But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Christ’s Power
- **Question:** By what power did Christ work miracles?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:28 – “But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Christ as Example)
- **Total Dependence:**
  - Jesus humbled Himself and did not use His own divine power for His benefit (Philippians 2:5–8).
  - John 5:30 – “I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Jesus overcame sin and worked righteousness through the Spirit.
  - If He used power unavailable to us, He could not be our example.
  - Because He relied on the Spirit, we too can have victory over besetting sins.
  - Romans 8:11 – “But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The King in Soldier's Armor:**
  - Imagine a king removing his royal robes to dress as a common soldier.
  - He goes into battle using only the standard-issue sword and shield.
  - He wins not by his royal rank, but by his skill and reliance on his commander.
- **Application:**
  - Jesus laid aside His robes of glory to fight sin as a man, armed with the Spirit.
  - He shows us that we can win the war against sin using the same weapon.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Resurrection
- **Question:** To what is His resurrection ascribed?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:18 – “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points
- **Quickened (Made Alive):**
  - The Spirit is the source of life (Romans 8:2).
  - He raised Jesus from the physical grave.
- **Spiritual Resurrection:**
  - We are naturally “dead in trespasses and sins” (Ephesians 2:1).
  - Just as the Spirit raised Jesus, He raises the repentant sinner to walk in “newness of life” (Romans 6:4).
- **The Guarantee:**
  - The resurrection is the Father's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice.
  - It proves the Spirit’s power is stronger than death and sin.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Battery:**
  - A battery may be perfectly structured, but without a charge, it is dead.
  - A human body may have all its parts, but without breath, it is a corpse.

  - The Holy Spirit is the "charge" of divine life.
  - He entered the tomb to raise Jesus.
  - He enters the dead heart of a sinner to produce a living Christian.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Conviction of Sin
- **Question:** How is conviction produced in the mind of the sinner?

- **Of Sin:**
  - Specifically unbelief and the violation of God’s law.
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **Of Righteousness:**
  - Points away from our "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6) to Christ's perfect righteousness.
- **Of Judgment:**
  - Warns of the final reckoning; Satan is judged, and sin will be destroyed.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the sanctuary, the sinner placed his hand on the victim and confessed (Leviticus 4:29).
  - The Spirit prompts this confession by revealing our guilt and the Lamb of God.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Dark Room:**
  - A man in a dark room may feel clean and safe.
  - When a bright light turns on, he sees dust, cobwebs, and stains.
  - The light did not *create* the dirt; it only *revealed* it.

## Slide 14 – Q5: The Comforter
- **Question:** What office does the Spirit perform for the Christian?
- **Key Text:** John 14:16 – “And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: The Sword

- **The Instrument:**
  - The Spirit works *through* the Word, not apart from it.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”
- **Victory over Temptation:**
  - Jesus used the Sword in the wilderness: "It is written" (Matthew 4:4).
  - Psalm 119:11 – “Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.”

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration
- **Surgeon and Scalpel:**
  - A scalpel is sharp, but it needs a surgeon’s hand to guide it.
  - The Bible is the scalpel ("sharper than any two-edged sword" - Hebrews 4:12).

## Slide 23 – Q8: Inspiration

- **Authority:**
  - 2 Timothy 3:16 – “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.”

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **Visual Revelation:**
  - The prophet's senses are suspended; the Spirit presents scenes to the mind.
  - Daniel 10:17 – “...for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.”
- **Consistency:**
  - From Genesis to Revelation, this is God’s method of giving special light.

- **The Last Days (Latter Rain):**
  - The "last days" extend to the end of time.
  - A final outpouring is needed to finish the work.
  - Revelation 18:1 – “And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.”
