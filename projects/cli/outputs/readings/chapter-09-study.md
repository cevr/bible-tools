### Q1. What attributes did Christ ascribe to His Father while addressing Him just before His trial in Gethsemane?

"And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are." "O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me." John 17:11, 25.

**Answer:**
In His great intercessory prayer, often called the "High Priestly Prayer," Christ focuses on two foundational attributes of God: His **holiness** and His **righteousness**.

1.  **The Holy Father:**
    *   **Holiness defined:** Absolute purity, moral perfection, and complete separation from sin (Isaiah 6:3; Habakkuk 1:13).
    *   Christ appeals to the Father's holiness because He is asking God to keep His disciples separate from the evil of the world. Just as the vessels in the earthly sanctuary were "holy" (set apart for God's use), the believer is to be set apart from sin.
    *   **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest bore the names of Israel into the Holy Place. Here, Christ, our great High Priest, bears His people before the "Holy Father," preparing to make the final atonement.

2.  **The Righteous Father:**
    *   **Righteousness defined:** The quality of being right, just, and acting in perfect accordance with God’s own law of love (Psalm 119:172).
    *   Christ appeals to God’s righteousness to distinguish between the world (which rejects God) and the disciples (who accepted Him). It is a righteous act for God to acknowledge those who have received His Son.

3.  **The Believer’s Need:**
    *   Because God is holy and righteous, and man is sinful, a mediator is required. We cannot stand before a Holy God in our own filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6). We need Christ to cover us with His merit and to wash us by His Spirit.

[ILL] **Illustration:** Imagine a surgeon preparing for a delicate operation. He must be perfectly clean and sterile (holy) to save the patient's life; any contamination causes death. God’s holiness is not merely a barrier to keep us away, but a purity that must be imparted to us so that we can live in His presence without being consumed.

### Q2. Does Christ possess these attributes?

"Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." Acts 2:27. "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities." Isaiah 53:11.

**Answer:**
Yes, the Scriptures explicitly attribute the same holiness and righteousness to Jesus Christ. He is not merely a good man; He is the divine Son of God.

1.  **The Holy One:**
    *   Christ passed through a world of sin without being tainted by it. He was "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners" (Hebrews 7:26). Because He was the "Holy One," the grave could not hold Him; sin is the cause of death, but in Him was no sin (1 John 3:5).

2.  **The Righteous Servant Who Justifies:**
    *   **Justification defined:** The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is righteous, based solely on the merits of Christ (Romans 3:24).
    *   Isaiah 53:11 reveals the heart of the gospel: Christ is the "righteous servant." He does not just *possess* righteousness; He *provides* it.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** We are justified not by our own works, but "by his knowledge" (knowing and trusting Him). Because He bore our iniquities (substitution), He can credit His perfect life to our account.
    *   Furthermore, He does not leave us in sin. He justifies us so that we may become righteous in character, partaking of His divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).

[ILL] **Illustration:** If a man is drowning in debt and facing prison, he cannot pay his way out. If a wealthy friend pays the debt in full, the man is free. But Christ does more than pay the debt; He adopts the debtor into the royal family and teaches him how to manage the King’s resources. Christ’s righteousness clears our past (justification) and transforms our future (sanctification).

### Q3. What is said about the goodness of God?

"And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth." Exodus 34:6.

**Answer:**
When Moses asked to see God’s glory, God revealed His character. This text is central to understanding the Great Controversy—Satan claims God is severe and exacting, but God reveals Himself as abundant in goodness.

*   **Merciful:** Treating us better than we deserve; withholding the immediate punishment sin merits.
*   **Gracious:** Giving us the favor and power we do not deserve.
*   **Longsuffering:** Patient with our weaknesses and slow to anger.
*   **Abundant in Goodness and Truth:** God’s resources of love are inexhaustible.

**Key Insight:** The glory of God is His character. To be changed into His image means we, too, must become merciful, gracious, and truthful through the indwelling of Christ.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A rebellion breaks out in a kingdom. The king has the power to crush the rebels instantly. Instead, he visits them unarmed, offering food, medicine, and pardon, patiently waiting for them to lay down their arms. This is the picture of God’s "longsuffering" and "goodness" toward a rebellious world.

### Q4. What was the nature of Christ's work while among men?

"How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him." Acts 10:38.

**Answer:**
Christ was the express image of the Father (Hebrews 1:3). Consequently, His life on earth was a practical demonstration of the attributes listed in Exodus 34:6.

1.  **Active Benevolence:**
    *   He "went about doing good." His religion was practical. He did not live in a cloister but mingled with the people, desiring their good.
2.  **Conflict with Satan:**
    *   He healed those "oppressed of the devil." Sickness and sin are the work of the enemy. Christ came to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8).
3.  **The Pattern for Believers:**
    *   **Sanctification defined:** The process of becoming like Christ in character.
    *   If we are abiding in Christ, we will do the works of Christ. We cannot claim to have His righteousness if we are indifferent to the suffering of others. Faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).

[ILL] **Illustration:** A stream that receives water from a spring but has no outlet becomes a stagnant swamp. A stream that receives and gives flows clear and sweet. The Christian who receives God’s goodness but does not "go about doing good" becomes spiritually stagnant.

### Q5. What is said of the mercy of God?

"The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy." Psalms 103:8.

**Answer:**
The Psalmist reiterates the revelation given to Moses. "Plenteous in mercy" implies that God’s mercy is not in short supply; it overflows.

*   **Slow to Anger:** God does not strike at the first offense. He gives time for repentance (2 Peter 3:9).
*   **The Purpose of Mercy:** God’s mercy is not permission to sin, but a bridge to restoration. "The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance" (Romans 2:4).
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the sanctuary, the cover of the Ark was called the "Mercy Seat." It was placed *above* the Ten Commandments. This teaches that while the Law requires obedience, Mercy makes a way for the transgressor to be cleansed and restored to obedience through the blood of sprinkling.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A child breaks a valuable vase. The father has the right to be angry and punish. Instead, he hugs the weeping child and says, "I forgive you; let us sweep this up together." That is mercy—it restores the relationship so the child desires to be careful in the future.

### Q6. Is He compassionate?

"But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth." Psalms 86:15.

**Answer:**
Yes, He is "full of compassion." The original language often implies a visceral reaction—a feeling of deep pity and sorrow for the suffering of another.

*   **Our High Priest:** We do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15). Christ feels every pang of sorrow and every struggle against temptation that we face.
*   **Basis for Confidence:** Because He is compassionate, we can "come boldly unto the throne of grace" (Hebrews 4:16). We need not fear that He is indifferent to our struggles with sin. He stands ready to help us overcome.

[ILL] **Illustration:** When a shepherd sees a sheep caught in thorns, bleeding and frightened, he does not feel anger; he feels pity. He gently disentangles the sheep and carries it home. This is the compassion of God toward the sinner caught in the thorns of bad habits and guilt.

### Q7. How did Moses represent God's faithfulness in keeping covenant with his people?

"Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations." Deuteronomy 7:9.

**Answer:**
God is defined here as the "faithful God" who keeps His covenant.

1.  **Covenant Defined:** A binding agreement or compact between God and man.
    *   In the **New Covenant**, God promises to write His law in our hearts and minds (Hebrews 8:10).
2.  **God’s Part:** He is faithful. If we surrender to Him, He *will* complete the work of sanctification in us (Philippians 1:6; 1 Thessalonians 5:24).
3.  **Man’s Part:** The text specifies "them that love him and keep his commandments."
    *   True love for God is demonstrated by obedience (John 14:15).
    *   We do not obey *to start* the covenant; we obey as the *fruit* of the covenant relationship.
    *   God is faithful to give us the power to obey if we choose to love and serve Him.

[ILL] **Illustration:** In a marriage, the husband and wife pledge faithfulness "until death." God is the perfect Husband to His people (Jeremiah 3:14). He never breaks His vow. Even when we stumble, if we return to Him, we find His faithfulness still standing like a mighty rock.

### Q8. Is Christ also the embodiment of truth?

"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." John 14:6.

**Answer:**
Christ does not merely *teach* the truth; He *is* the Truth.

*   **The Reality of God:** To know the truth is to know Jesus. All doctrines (the Sabbath, the State of the Dead, the Sanctuary) are only valid because they reveal something about Jesus and His character.
*   **Freedom from Error:** "The truth shall make you free" (John 8:32). Embracing Christ frees us from the deception of Satan and the slavery of sin.
*   **The Only Way:** There is no other path to the Father. We cannot bypass Christ’s sacrifice or His mediation. He is the ladder connecting earth to heaven (Genesis 28:12; John 1:51).

[ILL] **Illustration:** A map can show you the route to a destination, but a guide goes with you. Christ is not just the map (doctrine); He is the Guide (The Way) who walks the path with us, ensuring we reach the Father.

### Q9. How is the wisdom of God represented?

"Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom." Job 36:5.

**Answer:**
God combines infinite power ("mighty in strength") with infinite intelligence ("wisdom").

*   **Perfect Understanding:** God knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10). He understands the intricate web of cause and effect in our lives.
*   **Despiseth Not Any:** Remarkably, this text links God’s greatness with His humility. He does not overlook the lowly. His wisdom is used to save the humblest sinner.
*   **Trusting His Wisdom:** Because God is all-wise, His plan for our lives—even when it includes trials—is better than our own plans. "All things work together for good" to those who love God (Romans 8:28).

[ILL] **Illustration:** A master weaver sees the whole pattern of the tapestry, while the observer only sees the tangled threads on the backside. We must trust the Weaver’s wisdom even when the threads of our life seem confused and dark.

### Q10. What is said of the wisdom of Christ?

"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him." Luke 2:40.

**Answer:**
This verse highlights the humanity of Christ and His development.

*   **Growth in Wisdom:** Though divine, Christ took upon Himself human nature. He learned as we must learn—through study of the Scriptures, nature, and communion with His Father.
*   **Our Example:** This proves that wisdom is available to us. If Christ, in human flesh, could be "filled with wisdom" through the Spirit, so can we. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God..." (James 1:5).
*   **Christ Our Wisdom:** The Apostle Paul tells us that Christ "is made unto us wisdom" (1 Corinthians 1:30). We do not have to rely on our own faulty reasoning; we can have the mind of Christ (Philippians 2:5).

[ILL] **Illustration:** As a flower opens to the sun to receive light and color, so the human mind of Jesus opened to the Father to receive wisdom. We are to follow this same pattern of daily opening our hearts to heaven.

### Q11. In what strong language is the perfect justice of God proclaimed?

"He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he." Deuteronomy 32:4.

**Answer:**
Here God is described as the "Rock," a symbol of stability and immutability. His fundamental attribute is justice.

*   **All His Ways are Judgment:** God does nothing arbitrary. Every decision is based on perfect righteousness and fairness.
*   **Without Iniquity:** There is no shadow of turning in Him.
*   **Justice and the Gospel:** Many think justice contradicts mercy. In the Great Controversy, Satan accused God of being unjust. The Cross demonstrated that God is both "just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" (Romans 3:26). He did not set aside the law to save us; He paid the penalty of the law Himself. This establishes the law (Romans 3:31) while saving the sinner.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A building built on sand will shift and crack when the storm comes. A building anchored into bedrock stands firm. God’s government is built on the bedrock of justice; therefore, the universe is safe in His hands.

### Q12. How long will these attributes exist?

"Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end." Psalms 102:25-27.

**Answer:**
God is eternal and immutable (unchanging).

*   **"Thou Art the Same":** Creation may wear out (entropy), but the Creator remains.
*   **Comfort for the Believer:** Because God does not change, His promises do not expire (Malachi 3:6). The same mercy offered to David and Peter is offered to us. The same power that parted the Red Sea is available to help us overcome sin today.
*   **The Eternal Gospel:** The plan of salvation is called the "everlasting gospel" (Revelation 14:6). It is based on the unchangeable character of God.

[ILL] **Illustration:** Clouds constantly change shape and position, blocking the sun or letting it shine. But the sun itself remains constant. Our feelings and circumstances change like clouds, but God, the Sun of Righteousness, remains forever the same.

### Q13. Can man ever really find out God?

"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God: how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!" Romans 11:33.

**Answer:**
While God has revealed His character (love, justice, mercy), the infinite depths of His being are beyond human comprehension.

*   **The Finite cannot grasp the Infinite:** We can know God truly, but we can never know Him fully.
*   **Eternity of Study:** This is the joy of the redeemed. Throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity, we will be learning more of the wisdom and love of God, specifically revealed in the plan of salvation (Ephesians 2:7).
*   **Humility:** This truth should make us humble. When we cannot understand God’s providence in our lives, we must trust His heart even when we cannot trace His hand. We walk by faith, not by sight.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A small child may know and love their father, trusting him completely, yet understand very little of the father's professional work or the complex decisions he makes to protect the family. We are the children; God is the Father. We know He loves us, even when His ways are "past finding out."
