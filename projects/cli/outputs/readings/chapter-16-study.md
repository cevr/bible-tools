### Q1. To whom is repentance to be preached?
"And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations." Luke 24:47.

**Answer:**
The commission given by our risen Saviour is universal. It is not limited to any specific class, race, or degree of sinner.

1.  **A Universal Need:** Since "all have sinned" (Romans 3:23), the remedy must be offered to all. The gospel is not merely for the "irreligious" but for the moralist, the pagan, and the backslider alike.
2.  **In His Name:** There is no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12). Repentance is effective only because of who Jesus is and what He has done. It is His authority that grants the "remission" (forgiveness) of sins.
3.  **The Connection to Remission:** Repentance and remission are linked. God does not arbitrarily overlook sin; He forgives it when the sinner turns from it to Christ.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Remission:** The cancellation of a debt or penalty; the forgiveness of sins through the payment made by Christ (Hebrews 9:22).

[ILL] **The Universal Antidote:** If a deadly plague swept through every nation on earth, a physician possessing the only cure would be criminally negligent to offer it only to a few villages. Sin is that plague. The gospel of repentance is the cure. It must be "preached among all nations" because the disease is in all nations.

### Q2. Who are called to repentance?
"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Luke 5:32.

**Answer:**
Christ’s mission is a rescue mission for the lost.

1.  **The Diagnosis:** A doctor cannot heal a patient who insists they are well. Those who believe they are "righteous" by their own works or heritage shut themselves out from the grace of Christ.
2.  **The Invitation:** The call is to "sinners." If you acknowledge that you have broken God's law and possess a fallen nature, this call is for you.
3.  **The Gift of Repentance:** We must not wait until we feel "good enough" to come to Christ. We come to Him *as sinners* to be made righteous. Even the ability to repent is a gift from Him (Acts 5:31).

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Repentance:** A change of mind and heart led by the Holy Spirit, resulting in a turning away from sin and a turning toward God (Ezekiel 33:11).

[ILL] **The Hospital:** A hospital is not a museum for the display of perfect health, but a place for the healing of the sick. The church is a hospital for sinners. If a man stays away from the hospital because he is "too sick," he misunderstands the purpose of the institution. So it is with Christ; we come to Him *because* we are sinners, not because we are holy.

### Q3. How is one to know he is a sinner?
“By the law is the knowledge of sin." Rom 3:20.

**Answer:**
The moral law of God (the Ten Commandments) serves a specific, indispensable function in the plan of salvation.

1.  **The Detector of Sin:** Just as a straightedge shows the crookedness of a line, the perfect law of God reveals the crookedness of our characters. Without the law, we might measure ourselves by other people and feel secure (2 Corinthians 10:12).
2.  **The Definition of Sin:** The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). Therefore, to know if we are sinners, we must look into the mirror of the Ten Commandments (James 1:23–25).
3.  **Silencing Self-Righteousness:** When the law is understood in its spiritual breadth—reaching even the thoughts and intents of the heart (Matthew 5:21–28)—"every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God" (Romans 3:19).

[ILL] **The Mirror:** A mirror can show you a dirty spot on your face, but the mirror cannot wash it off. You do not wash with the mirror; you wash with water. The Law is the mirror that reveals our filth; Christ’s blood is the fountain that cleanses it. We must not despise the mirror for showing us the truth.

### Q4. Is this a universal rule?
"We have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin." Rom. 3:9.

**Answer:**
Yes, the condition of sinfulness is universal.

1.  **No Favorites:** The Jew (representing the religious person with the Bible) and the Gentile (representing the person without religious background) are in the same boat. Access to truth increases responsibility, but it does not grant immunity from the nature of sin.
2.  **All Under Sin:** The phrase "under sin" implies being under its power and condemnation. Humanity is held captive by a force it cannot break on its own.
3.  **Universal Need for Righteousness by Faith:** Because all are under sin, no human being can be justified (declared righteous) by their own law-keeping. All must seek righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 3:21–22).

---

### Q5. To what is the transgressor of the law subject?
"Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience." Eph. 5:6.

**Answer:**
Sin is not a trifle; it brings the transgressor under the "wrath of God."

1.  **The Reality of Wrath:** God’s wrath is not a temper tantrum or an emotional outburst. It is the settled, necessary opposition of His holy nature against evil. Sin destroys God's creation; therefore, God’s love for His creation demands that He oppose sin.
2.  **The Warning:** Paul warns against "vain words"—empty philosophies that suggest God doesn't care about how we live or that grace serves as a cover for continued disobedience.
3.  **The Result of Disobedience:** Those who persist in rebellion ("children of disobedience") separate themselves from the Source of Life. The "wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23).

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Transgression:** Literally "stepping across." It is the act of crossing the boundary line God has set in His holy law.

---

### Q6. What is it that awakens the soul to a knowledge of its condition before the law?
"When He [the Comforter] is come, He will reprove the world of sin." John 16:8.

**Answer:**
Human beings are naturally spiritually blind to their own guilt. It takes a supernatural agency to awaken the conscience.

1.  **The Work of the Spirit:** The Holy Spirit ("the Comforter") performs the office work of convicting the heart. He presses the claims of God's law upon the conscience.
2.  **Not Human Eloquence:** A preacher may speak the words, but only the Spirit can drive the truth home to the heart (Zechariah 4:6).
3.  **The First Step of Grace:** This conviction is the first touch of God's love. He disturbs our peace in sin so that we may find true peace in Christ.

[ILL] **The Dark Room:** If a room is pitch black, you cannot see the dust and cobwebs. When the sunlight (the Spirit) streams in, the dirt becomes visible. The light didn't create the dirt; it only revealed it so it could be cleaned.

---

### Q7. What will be the inquiry of those who are thus convicted?
"Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Acts 2:37.

**Answer:**
True conviction leads to a crisis of the will.

1.  **"Pricked in their Heart":** The text says the listeners were "pricked" (pierced) in their hearts. This is not merely intellectual agreement; it is deep emotional and spiritual realization of personal guilt.
2.  **The Demand for Action:** When a person realizes they are under the condemnation of the law and separated from God, they instinctively know something must be done. They cannot remain neutral.
3.  **The End of Self-Sufficiency:** The question "What shall we do?" is a cry of helplessness. They realized they had crucified the Messiah and had no way to fix it themselves.

---

### Q8. What reply should be returned to this inquiry?
"Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." Acts 2:38. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Acts 16:31.

**Answer:**
The apostolic answer combines two essential elements: Repentance and Faith.

1.  **Repent:** This is the turning away. We must recognize our rebellion, renounce it, and turn toward God.
2.  **Believe:** This is the turning toward. We must trust that Jesus Christ has paid the penalty for our sins and that He has the power to save us.
3.  **Baptism:** This is the public confession of this inward change—a symbol of dying to the old life of sin and rising to walk in newness of life (Romans 6:3–4).
4.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We do not repent *to earn* salvation; we repent and believe to *receive* the salvation already purchased by Christ.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Justification:** The legal act where God declares the repentant sinner righteous. He treats the sinner as if he had never sinned, imputing Christ’s perfect life to his account (Romans 4:5).

---

### Q9. How will the convicted sinner be constrained to act?
"I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin." Ps. 38:18.

**Answer:**
Conviction leads to confession and sorrow.

1.  **Open Confession:** The truly convicted soul stops making excuses. There is no blaming circumstances or other people (as Adam and Eve did). There is a frank declaration: "I have sinned."
2.  **Sorrow for Sin:** This is not just fear of punishment, but a sorrow for the act itself—for having broken God’s law and grieved His love.

---

### Q10. What will godly sorrow work?
"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation." 2 Cor. 7:10.

**Answer:**
There is a sorrow that saves.

1.  **The Function of Sorrow:** Sorrow is not the repentance itself; it is the *catalyst* for repentance. It leads to a change of mind and action.
2.  **Unto Salvation:** Godly sorrow leads the sinner to the foot of the Cross. It results in a life turned away from sin, which is the path of salvation.
3.  **Not to be Repented Of:** This means one never regrets turning to God. The result is a peace and joy that leaves no room for regret.

[ILL] **The Surgery:** The pain of a surgeon's scalpel is "godly sorrow"—it hurts, but it cuts out the cancer to save the life.

---

### Q11. What will any other kind of sorrow do?
"The sorrow of the world worketh death." 2 Cor. 7:10.

**Answer:**
Not all tears are genuine repentance.

1.  **Worldly Sorrow:** This is the sorrow of Judas, who was sorry he betrayed innocent blood but did not return to the Master for mercy. It is the sorrow of Esau, who wept for the lost blessing but not for his own profane character.
2.  **Focus on Self:** Worldly sorrow regrets the *consequences* (shame, loss, punishment) rather than the *sin* itself. It is self-pity, not contrition.
3.  **Outcome is Death:** Because this sorrow does not lead the sinner to Christ for cleansing, the sin remains, and the end is spiritual death.

---

### Q12. What does true repentance involve?
"Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die?" Eze. 18:31.

**Answer:**
True repentance involves a radical reformation of life through the power of God.

1.  **Casting Away Transgression:** Repentance is not genuine if we cling to our pet sins. We cannot hold Christ with one hand and the world with the other.
2.  **A New Heart:** God commands us to "make a new heart," yet elsewhere He promises, "A new heart also will I give you" (Ezekiel 36:26). This shows the cooperative nature of salvation:
    *   We must *will* to have a new heart.
    *   We must *choose* to separate from sin.
    *   God then performs the miracle of recreation that we cannot do for ourselves.
3.  **Why Will Ye Die?:** God’s plea shows that sin is not necessary. Provision has been made. To stay in sin and die is a tragic, unnecessary choice.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Sanctification:** The ongoing process of being made holy; the Holy Spirit writing the law of God upon the heart, transforming the character into the likeness of Christ (Hebrews 10:16).

### Q13. After repentance, how should one live?
"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?" Rom. 6:1, 2.

**Answer:**
The repentant life is a life that has died to sin.

1.  **Dead to Sin:** When we accept Christ, our "old man" is crucified with Him (Romans 6:6). A dead person does not respond to the stimuli of their old life.
2.  **Grace is not License:** It is a perversion of the gospel to think that because God is gracious, we are free to disobey His law. Grace is the power that breaks the dominion of sin, not a cloak to cover it.
3.  **Newness of Life:** We are called to walk in a new direction. Justification (pardon) always leads to Sanctification (holy living).

[ILL] **The Rescued Slave:** If a slave is purchased by a benevolent King and set free, he does not run back to his cruel old master and put the chains back on. He lives in gratitude and service to the King who bought him. "Sin shall not have dominion over you" (Romans 6:14).

---

### Q14. Whose servant is he that committeth sin?
"He that committeth sin is of the Devil." 1 John 3:8.

**Answer:**
Our actions reveal our allegiance.

1.  **The Source of Sin:** Sin originated with the devil. When we habitually practice sin, we are reflecting the character of Satan, not Christ.
2.  **Two Families:** There are only two spiritual families: the children of God and the children of the devil. There is no middle ground.
3.  **Victory in Christ:** The verse continues, "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil." Christ came to break the devil's hold on us so we do not have to be his servants.

---

### Q15. How does God regard the truly penitent?
"To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word." Isa. 66:2.

**Answer:**
God bypasses the proud and self-sufficient to dwell with the humble.

1.  **Poor in Spirit:** This refers to those who recognize their spiritual bankruptcy without Christ (Matthew 5:3).
2.  **Contrite:** Brokenhearted over sin. God does not despise a broken heart; He heals it (Psalm 51:17).
3.  **Trembling at the Word:** This indicates a high view of God’s authority. The penitent believer takes God’s commandments seriously and desires to obey every word that proceeds from His mouth.

---

### Q16. What promise is made to those who confess their sins?
"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9.

**Answer:**
This is one of the most comprehensive promises in Scripture, containing two distinct blessings.

1.  **Faithful and Just:** God's forgiveness is not merely an act of mercy; it is an act of justice because the price has already been paid by Jesus. God is faithful to His covenant.
2.  **Forgiveness (Justification):** He removes the *guilt* of sin.
3.  **Cleansing (Sanctification):** He removes the *stain* and *power* of sin ("all unrighteousness"). He does not just pardon the criminal; He reforms him.
4.  **The Condition:** "If we confess." We must specifically acknowledge our sins to Jesus, our High Priest.

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner brought the lamb, confessed his sin over its head, and the sin was transferred to the sanctuary. In the heavenly sanctuary, we confess our sins to Christ, who applies His blood to cover them and His Spirit to cleanse us from them.

---

### Q17. By what are we cleansed from sin?
"The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin." 1 John 1:7.

**Answer:**
The agent of our cleansing is the blood of Christ.

1.  **The Life is in the Blood:** The blood represents the life of Christ (Leviticus 17:11). It is a sinless life given in exchange for our sinful life.
2.  **Continuous Cleansing:** The verb "cleanseth" is in the present tense. As we walk in the light, the blood of Jesus continually keeps us clean.
3.  **Victory:** It is by the "blood of the Lamb" that the saints overcome the accuser (Revelation 12:11).

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man. It involves the sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross (the payment) and His ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary (the application) to blot out sin and restore the universe to harmony.

---

### Q18. Toward whom are we to repent?
"Repentance toward God." Acts 20:21.

**Answer:**
Repentance is directed toward the Father.

1.  **The Lawgiver:** We repent toward God because it is His law we have broken. Sin is a rebellion against the government of the universe.
2.  **The Injured Party:** While our sins hurt others and ourselves, they are ultimately a personal offense against our Creator. As David cried, "Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned" (Psalm 51:4).

---

### Q19. Toward whom must we exercise faith?
"And faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ." Acts 20:21.

**Answer:**
Faith is directed toward the Son.

1.  **The Mediator:** We cannot approach the Father in our own merits. We need a Mediator, the "man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5).
2.  **The Synergy of Repentance and Faith:** As the note in the outline explains, these two are inseparable.
    *   We cannot truly repent without the aid of Christ.
    *   It is the "goodness of God" revealed in Christ that "leadeth thee to repentance" (Romans 2:4).
    *   We look at the Cross—seeing the infinite cost of our sin—and that sight breaks our heart (Repentance).
    *   At the same time, that same Cross gives us the confidence that we are loved and can be saved (Faith).
3.  **Christ Our Righteousness:** We do not repent *in order* to make God love us. We see His love in Christ, and that empowers us to repent. Faith takes hold of Christ's merits (His perfect life and sacrificial death) and presents them to the Father in place of our own sinful record.

[ILL] **The Looking Glass:** You cannot see your own face (to know you need washing) without light. Jesus is the Light of the World. When we look at Him, we see our own darkness in contrast to His purity. This leads to repentance. Simultaneously, we see His arms open to receive us. This leads to faith.

### Q20. How will one show that he has truly repented?
"Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance [margin, answerable to amendment of life]." Matt. 3:8.

**Answer:**
True repentance is always visible in the life.

1.  **Fruits, not Roots:** Our works are not the *root* of our salvation (that is faith in Christ), but they are the necessary *fruit*. If there is no fruit, the tree is dead (James 2:26).
2.  **Amendment of Life:** If a man stole, he steals no more and restores what he took (Ezekiel 33:15). If he was angry, he learns gentleness.
3.  **The Power of the Indwelling Christ:** This fruit-bearing is not achieved by grit and human effort alone. It is the result of abiding in the Vine. "He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5).

[ILL] **The Apple Tree:** You do not walk up to a dry stick, tape apples to the branches, and call it an apple tree. That is hypocrisy. An apple tree produces apples because the life of the tree is inside it. So the Christian produces good works and obedience because the life of Jesus is inside him through the Holy Spirit.
