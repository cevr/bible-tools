## Slide 1 – Title

- **Bible Principles of Child Training**
- A Study on the Home, Discipline, and Godly Character

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Fifth Commandment

- Question: What duty does God require of children?
- Key Text: Exodus 20:12 – “Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may
  be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Honor & Authority)

- **The Bridge of the Law:** This command connects our duty to God (first four
  commandments) with our duty to man (last six).
- **Meaning of Honor:** The Hebrew word _kabad_ means to give weight to, value
  highly, and respect.
- **Divine Representation:** Parents are the first representation of God to a
  child. Learning to obey parents teaches a child to respect the Heavenly
  Father.
- **Commandment with Promise:**
  - Ephesians 6:2-3 – “Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first
    commandment with promise;) That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest
    live long on the earth.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Problem of the Carnal Mind:** A child cannot manufacture a submissive
  heart on their own.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **The Solution in Christ:** When the heart is touched by the love of Jesus,
  rebellion is broken.
- **Christ’s Example:** We honor parents because Jesus did.
  - Luke 2:51 – “And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
    subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.”

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Foundation Stones:**
  - Think of a great building. The foundation stones are often hidden from view,
    yet they support the entire structure.
  - Honoring parents is the hidden foundation of character.
  - If a child learns to honor authority at home, they become a stable citizen
    and a faithful Christian.
  - If this foundation is cracked, the whole life is often unstable.

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Method of Teaching

- Question: How are parents instructed to teach their children?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 6:6-7 – “And these words, which I command thee this day,
  shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy
  children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
  thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points (The Heart & The Home)

- **First, In the Parent’s Heart:** You cannot give what you do not possess.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
    Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
    and write them in their hearts...”
- **Diligent Teaching:** The Hebrew implies sharpening a tool. It requires
  effort and repetition.
- **A Lifestyle of Faith:** Religion is not a garment worn only on Sabbath; it
  must be the lifeblood of the home (sitting, walking, resting, rising).
- **The Home Sanctuary:** Parents act as priests in the home, presenting God's
  character through daily Bible study and prayer.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Pitcher and the Cup:**
  - If you wish to fill a cup with water, the pitcher must first contain water.
    A dry pitcher cannot fill a cup.
  - Likewise, a parent whose heart is empty of the grace of Christ cannot fill
    the heart of the child with the love of God.
  - The parent must first go to the Fountain of Life.
  - John 4:14 – “But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall
    never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of
    water springing up into everlasting life.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Divine Approval of Authority

- Question: How does God regard those parents who enforce obedience?
- Key Text: Genesis 18:19 – “For I know him, that he will command his children
  and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do
  justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath
  spoken of him.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Abraham’s Example)

- **Commanding vs. Suggesting:** Abraham did not merely advise; he "commanded"
  with firm, loving direction.
- **Purpose of Authority:** To guide the family into the Covenant so they "keep
  the way of the Lord."
- **Justice and Judgment:** The home is established on the same principles as
  God's throne.
  - Psalm 89:14 – “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy
    and truth shall go before thy face.”
- **Leadership Qualification:** Neglect of home duties disqualifies a man for
  church leadership.
  - 1 Timothy 3:5 – “(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall
    he take care of the church of God?)”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Shepherd:**
  - A shepherd does not merely suggest to the sheep which way to go.
  - He uses his rod and staff to guide and protect them.
  - If he sees a sheep heading toward a cliff, he intervenes decisively.
  - A loving parent will not let a child wander into sin without decisive,
    loving intervention.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Training the Child

- Question: How should parents train their children?
- Key Text: Proverbs 22:6 – “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when
  he is old, he will not depart from it.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points (Nurture & Admonition)

- **Training vs. Telling:** "Train" implies molding character and forming
  habits, not just giving orders.
- **"In the Way He Should Go":** Not the way he _would_ go by nature, but God's
  way.
- **Early Influence:** The twig is easily bent; the tree is rigid. Early years
  are critical.
- **Nurture and Admonition:**
  - Ephesians 6:4 – “And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but
    bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.”
- **The Promise:** Faithful training plants seeds the Holy Spirit uses as a
  tether to the conscience throughout life.

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Gardener and the Vine:**
  - Consider a gardener training a vine. He does not let it crawl on the ground
    in the mud.
  - He ties it to a trellis and prunes away wild shoots so it may bear fruit.
  - If neglected, the vine becomes a tangled mass.
  - Training a child requires patient, daily attention to lift their thoughts
    toward heaven.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Encouragement to Correct

- Question: What encouragement have parents to correct their children?
- Key Text: Proverbs 29:17 – “Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea,
  he shall give delight unto thy soul.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Fruit of Discipline)

- **Rest and Delight:** A disciplined child brings peace to the home and joy to
  the parent's soul.
- **Joy in Truth:**
  - 3 John 1:4 – “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
    truth.”
- **The Nature of Man:** We are born with a bent toward self ("foolishness bound
  in the heart" - Prov 22:15).
  - Psalm 51:5 – “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
    conceive me.”
- **The Cure:** Godly correction drives out foolishness and points the child to
  the wisdom of Christ.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Wild Horse:**
  - A wild horse is dangerous and useless for service.
  - Once "broken" or trained, its strength is harnessed, and it becomes a
    valuable companion.
  - A child’s will must be subdued—not broken in spirit, but conquered—so they
    can be of service to God and man.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Results of Neglect

- Question: What will result if correction is withheld?
- Key Text: Proverbs 29:15 – “The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left
  to himself bringeth his mother to shame.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points (Shame & Ruin)

- **"Left to Himself":** To leave a child to their own fallen nature is to leave
  them to the mercy of Satan.
- **Myth of Natural Goodness:** Children do not naturally gravitate toward
  holiness; they require guidance.
- **The Example of Eli:** Neglect brings tragedy.
  - 1 Samuel 3:13 – “For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever
    for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile,
    and he restrained them not.”
- **Rod and Reproof:** Consequences (rod) must be combined with instruction
  (reproof).

## Slide 20 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Neglected Field:**
  - If a farmer leaves a field "to itself," what grows? Corn? Wheat?
  - No—weeds and thorns grow naturally.
  - A harvest of righteousness requires intentional weeding (correction) and
    planting (instruction).

## Slide 21 – Q7: Profit to the Child

- Question: By proper correction what profit will come to the child?
- Key Text: Proverbs 23:13-14 – “Withhold not correction from the child: for if
  thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the
  rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.”

## Slide 22 – Q7: Key Points (Salvation)

- **Deliverance from Hell (Sheol):** Unchecked sin leads to premature death and
  eternal loss.
- **Correction as Rescue:** Discipline interferes with the "law of sin" working
  in the child.
- **Preparation for the Gospel:**
  - We are justified by faith alone.
  - However, discipline prepares the soil of the heart to understand that sin
    has consequences.
  - This points the child to the need for a Savior who took those consequences
    for us.

## Slide 23 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Venomous Snake:**
  - Imagine a child playing with a venomous snake.
  - A loving parent would strike the snake away and pull the child back, even if
    the child cries.
  - The parent sees the deadly poison; the child only sees a toy.
  - Discipline saves the child from the poison of sin.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Danger of Delay

- Question: Is there danger of delaying correction too long?
- Key Text: Proverbs 19:18 – “Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not
  thy soul spare for his crying.”

## Slide 25 – Q8: Key Points (Probationary Time)

- **"While There is Hope":** There is a window of opportunity. Habits eventually
  harden into character.
  - Jeremiah 13:23 – “Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his
    spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.”
- **Emotional Manipulation:** Parents must not let a child's crying prevent
  necessary discipline. Temporary pain prevents eternal ruin.
- **Divine Parallel:** God works with us "while it is called Today."
  - Hebrews 3:13 – “But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day;
    lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.”

## Slide 26 – Q8: Illustration

- **Wet Concrete:**
  - Wet concrete can be molded into any shape with ease.
  - Once it sets, it becomes rock-hard. Changing it then requires a jackhammer
    and destruction.
  - It is far better to mold the will while the child is young and tender.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Evidence of Love

- Question: Because a parent corrects his child, is it evidence that he does not
  love him?
- Key Text: Proverbs 13:24 – “He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he
  that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.”

## Slide 28 – Q9: Key Points (True Love)

- **Hate vs. Love:** Withholding correction is an act of "hate" because it
  permits the child's destruction.
- **Chasten Betimes:** True love acts early and diligently. It catches the
  "little foxes" before they spoil the vine.
- **Reflecting God's Character:**
  - Hebrews 12:6 – “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
    son whom he receiveth.”
  - God fights _for_ us, not _at_ us.

## Slide 29 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Surgeon:**
  - A surgeon cuts the patient with a sharp knife. Is this hate?
  - No, it is an act of love to remove a cancer that would otherwise kill.
  - Parental correction is the surgery that removes the cancer of rebellion.

## Slide 30 – Q10: Guarding the Heart

- Question: In correcting the child, what should the father guard against?
- Key Text: Colossians 3:21 – “Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest
  they be discouraged.”

## Slide 31 – Q10: Key Points (Avoiding Provocation)

- **How Parents Provoke:**
  - Inconsistency (changing rules).
  - Unreasonable demands.
  - Disciplining in anger/loss of temper.
  - Constant criticism.
- **The Result:** Discouragement. The child feels they can never please the
  parent and gives up.
- **The Christian Standard:**
  - Ephesians 6:9 – “...forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is
    in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.”
- **Self-Control:** A parent must experience victory over sin (Righteousness by
  Faith) before they can rightly discipline a child.

## Slide 32 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Blacksmith and the Iron:**
  - Iron can be shaped when it is heated and struck with precision.
  - If you strike cold iron with violence, it breaks.
  - A parent acting in anger is like striking cold iron—it damages the child
    rather than shaping them.

## Slide 33 – Q11: Respect for the Aged

- Question: What consideration should the young ever show to the aged?
- Key Text: Leviticus 19:32 – “Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and
  honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.”

## Slide 34 – Q11: Key Points (Reverence)

- **The Hoary Head:** Gray hair represents the crown of age and experience.
- **Linked to Godliness:** Respect for the elderly is tied directly to the
  command to "fear thy God."
- **Counter-Cultural:** God's people are to stand out by reverencing the wisdom
  and history of the aged, rather than dismissing them.

## Slide 35 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Forest:**
  - In a forest, saplings grow in the shadow of ancient oaks.
  - The old trees provide shelter and stability to the ecosystem.
  - To cut down or despise the old trees exposes the young ones to storms they
    are not ready to weather.

## Slide 36 – Q12: Pleasing the Lord

- Question: Is the Lord pleased with children who obey their parents?
- Key Text: Colossians 3:20 – “Children, obey your parents in all things: for
  this is well pleasing unto the Lord.”

## Slide 37 – Q12: Key Points (Obedience as Worship)

- **"In All Things":** Comprehensive obedience in the rightful sphere of
  authority.
  - Exception: We must obey God rather than men if commands conflict (Acts
    5:29).
- **Pleasing to Jesus:** Obedience to parents is accepted as service to Christ
  Himself.
- **The Example of Christ:**
  - Luke 2:51 – “And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
    subject unto them...”
  - If the King of Glory obeyed earthly parents, surely we can too.

## Slide 38 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Melody:**
  - Think of a beautiful melody.
  - When a child obeys, their life strikes a chord that is in harmony with
    heaven.
  - Disobedience is like a discordant, jarring noise that disrupts the melody of
    the home.

## Slide 39 – Q13: Duty to Aging Parents

- Question: How long does the command to honor parents bind sons and daughters?
- Key Text: Proverbs 23:22 – “Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and
  despise not thy mother when she is old.”

## Slide 40 – Q13: Key Points (Requiting Parents)

- **Care for the Aged:** Roles reverse in old age; children become the
  caregivers.
- **Repaying the Debt:**
  - 1 Timothy 5:4 – “But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn
    first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good
    and acceptable before God.”
- **A Test of Faith:**
  - James 1:27 – “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
    To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction...”
  - 1 Timothy 5:8 – “But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those
    of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.”

## Slide 41 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Bank Loan:**
  - Parents invest years of love, labor, sleepless nights, and resources into
    their children.
  - In their old age, the "bill" comes due.
  - It is a debt of love that a grateful child will spend their life repaying.

## Slide 42 – Q14: Sins of the Last Days

- Question: What is to be one of the prominent sins of the last days?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 3:2 – “For men shall be lovers of their own selves,
  covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
  unholy...”

## Slide 43 – Q14: Key Points (End Time Context)

- **The Root:** "Lovers of their own selves." Selfishness drives disobedience.
- **Attack on the Family:** Satan destroys the home to destroy respect for God's
  authority.
- **The Elijah Message:** Preparation for the end involves restoring family
  relationships.
  - Malachi 4:6 – “And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
    and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the
    earth with a curse.”
- **Sanctuary Application:** Christ is purifying a people in the Most Holy
  Place. This purification begins in the home.

## Slide 44 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Termites:**
  - If you see termites eating the foundation beams of a house, you know the
    house will soon collapse.
  - Disobedience to parents is the termite in the foundation of society.
  - Its prevalence today tells us the structure of this world is crumbling and
    Christ's return is near.
