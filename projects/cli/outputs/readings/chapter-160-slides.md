## Slide 1 – Title Slide

- **Topic:** The Leaven of the Pharisees (Hypocrisy vs. Sincerity)
- **Focus:** Uncovering the Roots of Hypocrisy and the Cure in Christ
- **Scripture:** "Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy." (Luke 12:1)

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Leaven of the Pharisees

- **Question:** What was the leaven of the Pharisees?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:1 – "In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Nature of Leaven:**
  - Yeast is small but permeates the entire batch.
  - Hypocrisy may start as a small pretense, but it corrupts the whole character.
- **Puffed Up (Pride):**
  - Just as yeast puffs up bread, the central sin of the Pharisee is pride.
  - Hypocrisy is the attempt to appear righteous outwardly while the heart remains unchanged.
- **The Contrast of Faith:**
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** Relies on Christ’s merits for salvation and His Spirit for obedience.
  - **Hypocrisy:** Relies on "works of the flesh"—outward performance and human praise.
- **Definition:** "Hypocrisy" comes from the Greek word for "actor" or "mask-wearer."

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Apple and the Worm:**
  - Imagine a shiny red apple, polished and perfect on the outside.
  - Inside, a worm has eaten away the core, leaving rot.
  - Hypocrisy maintains a polished exterior (church attendance, diet, dress).
  - However, the "core" (the heart) is eaten away by pride and self.
  - God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7 – "For the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.").

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Evidence of Hypocrisy

- **Question:** In what way did the Pharisees show themselves to be hypocrites?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:7-8 – "Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me."

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **Lip Service vs. Heart Service:**
  - God judges by the condition of the heart, not theological vocabulary.
- **The Danger of Formality:**
  - It is possible to keep the Sabbath and return tithe strictly as a form.
  - Without the love of Jesus in the soul, this is legalism and hypocrisy.
- **The New Covenant Promise:**
  - God promises to write His laws in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10 – "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...").
  - A hypocrite has the law memorized on their lips but not loved in their heart.
- **Distance from God:**
  - Holiness is agreement with God. If we love the world but sing hymns, we are effectively God's enemies (James 4:4).

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Unfaithful Husband:**
  - Consider a husband who praises his wife publicly with poetic words.
  - Yet, secretly, he is texting another woman and planning to leave.
  - His public words "draw nigh," but his actions prove his heart is "far away."
  - God desires a marriage covenant of faithfulness, not a theatrical performance.

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Heart Condition Revealed

- **Question:** How had the Saviour shown that their hearts were not with the Lord?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:4-6 – "For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother... But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition."

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Tradition vs. Law)

- **The Tradition (Corban):**
  - The Pharisees invented a rule allowing men to dedicate money to the Temple ("It is a gift").
  - They used this to excuse themselves from the moral duty of caring for their elderly parents.
- **Making the Law of "None Effect":**
  - They used a religious act to excuse a lack of love.
  - **Hypocrisy** seeks loopholes to keep traditions while avoiding the spirit of the law.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - True faith establishes the law (Romans 3:31).
  - It writes the law of love in the heart, leading to genuine obedience.

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Application (Sanctuary Truth)

- **The Standard of Judgment:**
  - The Law of God resides in the Ark of the Covenant, beneath the Mercy Seat.
  - This Law is the unchangeable standard of judgment.
- **Human Tradition:**
  - No human invention—whether the "Corban" rule or Sunday sacredness—can alter the Ten Commandments.
  - Psalm 89:34 – "My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips."

---

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The "Pious" Thief:**
  - Imagine a man who refuses to pay his debts to a neighbor.
  - His excuse: "I promised to give that money to the church building fund."
  - He thinks he is pious, but he is actually a thief and a hypocrite.
  - God says: "I hate robbery for burnt offering" (Isaiah 61:8).

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Signs of Insincerity

- **Question:** What other sign of insincerity did they manifest?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 6:5 – "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward."

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points & Sanctuary Connection

- **The Motive:**
  - The hypocrite prays "to be seen of men."
  - Their only reward is human applause; they receive no answer from heaven.
- **The Cure: Secret Prayer:**
  - Sincerity is tested in the "closet" where only God sees (Matthew 6:6).
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the Holy Place, incense represents Christ’s merits mingled with the prayers of saints (Revelation 8:3-4).
  - Prayers offered for self-glorification contain no "incense" and are "strange fire."
- **Justification:**
  - The publican ("God be merciful to me a sinner") went home justified; the self-righteous Pharisee did not (Luke 18:14).

---

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Mannequin:**
  - A store mannequin is dressed in fine clothes and placed in the window.
  - It looks like a person, but it has no breath, no life, and no heartbeat.
  - A hypocritical prayer is a decorated form with no living connection to the Father.

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Fault Finding

- **Question:** What did Christ call those who so readily saw the faults of others, but did not correct their own?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:5 – "Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye."

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Beam vs. The Mote:**
  - A "beam" is a log; a "mote" is a speck of dust.
  - It is absurd to try to perform eye surgery on a brother while blinded by a log.
- **Self-Deception:**
  - A critical spirit is often a greater sin than the faults being criticized.
- **The Order of Cleansing:**
  - **First:** Repentance and surrender (cleaning our own heart).
  - **Then:** With a sanctified heart, we may gently restore a brother (Galatians 6:1).
- **Antitypical Day of Atonement:**
  - We are living in the time of judgment.
  - We should be afflicting our *own* souls, not the souls of our brethren.

---

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Dirty Window:**
  - If you look through a dirty window, the neighbor's laundry looks dirty.
  - You might criticize the neighbor, but the dirt is on your own glass.
  - We must clean our own pane (our heart/mind) before we can rightly judge reality.

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: The Work of the Hypocrite

- **Question:** What is the real work of a hypocrite?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 11:9 – "An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered."

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points

- **Destruction by False Teaching:**
  - Hypocrites may teach error while claiming truth, leading others astray (2 Peter 2:1-2).
- **Destruction by Example:**
  - A double life destroys the faith of observers.
  - Children who see parents act religious at church but angry at home often reject God.
- **The Cure:**
  - "Through knowledge shall the just be delivered."
  - A true experimental knowledge of God protects us from deception.

---

## Slide 20 – Q6: Illustration

- **The False Lighthouse:**
  - A lighthouse guides ships to safety.
  - A "wrecker" puts up a false light on the rocks to trick captains.
  - A hypocrite is a false light signaling "safety," but leading followers to spiritual shipwreck.

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Peter’s Dissimulation

- **Question:** What eminent man was once nearly sacrificed by the dissimulations (really hypocrisy) of some Jews and one of the apostles?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 2:13 – "And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation."

---

## Slide 22 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Situation in Antioch:**
  - Peter had been eating with Gentiles, acknowledging unity in Christ.
  - When strict Jews arrived, he separated himself out of fear.
- **Dissimulation:**
  - Acting differently than one knows to be true (concealing true belief).
- **The Ripple Effect:**
  - Even Barnabas was led astray by Peter's influence.
- **Righteousness by Faith at Stake:**
  - Peter’s actions implied that Gentile converts needed to become like Jews to be saved.
  - This struck at the heart of the Gospel: salvation is by faith in Christ, not culture.

---

## Slide 23 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Lead Sheep:**
  - If the lead sheep jumps off a cliff, the flock often follows blindly.
  - Peter was a lead sheep.
  - By acting out of fear rather than principle, he led the flock away from Gospel truth.

---

## Slide 24 – Q8: Paul Opposes Peter

- **Question:** Why did Paul say he opposed Peter in the work he was doing at that time?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 2:11 – "But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."

---

## Slide 25 – Q8: Key Points

- **Open Rebuke:**
  - Paul did not gossip; he withstood Peter "to the face."
  - This is the biblical method for handling public error (Matthew 18:15 principle).
- **Faith vs. Works:**
  - Paul argued that if righteousness comes by the law (ceremonial separation), Christ is dead in vain (Galatians 2:21).
- **Courage for Truth:**
  - We must love the truth more than peace or the approval of leaders.
  - True unity is found only in the truth.

---

## Slide 26 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Doctor:**
  - Imagine a doctor sees a colleague about to administer a fatal dose of the wrong medicine.
  - Is it polite to stay silent? No. Love demands intervention.
  - Paul saw Peter administering the "poison" of legalism and intervened to save the church.

---

## Slide 27 – Q9: The Hypocrite's Hope

- **Question:** What will become of the hypocrite's hope?
- **Key Text:** Job 8:13 – "So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish."

---

## Slide 28 – Q9: Key Points

- **A Perishing Hope:**
  - The hypocrite hopes outward works or secrecy will save them.
  - Job 8:14 compares this hope to a spider's web—intricate but swept away instantly.
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - We are judged by works because works reveal faith.
  - "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing" (Ecclesiastes 12:14).
- **The Foundation:**
  - Only the house built on the Rock (hearing and doing) stands.
  - The house on the sand (hypocrisy) falls (Matthew 7:26-27).

---

## Slide 29 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Counterfeit Passport:**
  - A traveler may carry a fake passport that looks very real.
  - He hopes it will get him across the border.
  - When scanned, the fraud is detected, and he is rejected.
  - No counterfeit character will pass the gate of heaven; only Christ’s righteousness allows entry.

---

## Slide 30 – Q10: David's Resolution

- **Question:** What did David say he would not do?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 26:4 – "I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers."

---

## Slide 31 – Q10: Key Points

- **Separation from the World:**
  - "Dissemblers" are those who hide their true character (hypocrites).
  - We must not "sit" with them in vanity or join their pretenses.
- **Sanctification involves Separation:**
  - "Come out from among them, and be ye separate" (2 Corinthians 6:17).
  - We cannot maintain a double life and expect to grow in grace.
- **The Danger of Compromise:**
  - To "go in with" them means to join their activities.
  - Laughing at sin or nodding at skepticism makes us dissemblers too.

---

## Slide 32 – Q10: Illustration

- **White Gloves in Mud:**
  - If you wear white gloves and play in the mud, the gloves do not clean the mud.
  - The mud makes the gloves dirty.
  - We cannot "sit" in the mud of hypocrisy and keep our garments of righteousness unspotted.

---

## Slide 33 – Q11: Heavenly Wisdom

- **Question:** If one has true heavenly wisdom, what kind of fruits will he bear?
- **Key Text:** James 3:17 – "But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."

---

## Slide 34 – Q11: Key Points

- **Source:**
  - This wisdom comes "from above" (James 1:17), not from human effort.
- **Characteristics of the Sanctified Life:**
  - **Pure:** No secret corruption.
  - **Peaceable/Gentle:** Not critical like the Pharisees.
  - **Easy to be entreated:** Willing to listen and learn.
  - **Without Hypocrisy:** Transparent; the outside matches the inside.
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - God changes us into His image.
  - When Christ dwells in the heart, hypocrisy is driven out by love.

---

## Slide 35 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Mountain Stream:**
  - Think of a clear mountain stream where you can see to the bottom.
  - There is no mud, no hidden debris—just clear water.
  - A Christian without hypocrisy is transparent because the source (Christ) is pure.

---

## Slide 36 – Q12: The Evil Servant

- **Question:** Where does the Saviour class those who profess to believe in the lord's coming, and yet by their actions show that their hearts are not in the matter?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:51 – "And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

---

## Slide 37 – Q12: Key Points

- **The Context:**
  - A warning for the church in the last days (Matthew 24).
- **The Fatal Error:**
  - The servant said in his heart, "My lord delayeth his coming."
  - He did not deny the Lord's existence, but lived as if the Lord would not see.
- **The Punishment:**
  - He is appointed his portion with the hypocrites.
  - Reason: He claimed to be a servant of the King but lived like a rebel.

---

## Slide 38 – Q12: Application (Victory in Christ)

- **The Call to Readiness:**
  - To profess the Advent message while loving the world is to act the part of the Evil Servant.
- **The Assurance of Victory:**
  - **Justification:** "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us..." (1 John 1:9).
  - **Sanctification:** "...and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
  - We may have "boldness in the day of judgment" because "as He is, so are we in this world" (1 John 4:17).

---

## Slide 39 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Sleeping Sentry:**
  - A soldier on guard duty who falls asleep or gets drunk is dangerous.
  - He wears the uniform, but his actions betray his country.
  - God calls us to be "watchmen" on the walls of Zion—awake, alert, and sincere.
