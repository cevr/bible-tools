## Slide 1 – Q1: The Promise of the Second Advent
- **Question:** What wonderful promise did Jesus make concerning His Second Advent?
- **Key Text:** John 14:1-3
  - “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Assurance)
- **A Personal Promise**
  - Jesus pledges, “I will come again.” This is not a spiritual metaphor or death, but the literal return of the Person who left.
- **The Preparation (Sanctuary Connection)**
  - Christ went to the heavenly sanctuary to “prepare a place.”
  - This corresponds to His work as our High Priest.
  - While He prepares the heavenly mansions, His Spirit is preparing a people on earth to inhabit them.
- **The Ultimate Goal**
  - The climax of salvation is face-to-face communion: “that where I am, there ye may be also.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Claiming the Promise**
  - We have no title to those “mansions” based on our own merits.
  - Our title is the **imputed righteousness** of Christ (righteousness credited to our account).
- **Imputed Righteousness Definition**
  - The perfect life of Jesus is credited to the believer, giving them the legal right to enter heaven.
  - Romans 4:22–24 – “And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Bridegroom and the Home**
  - A bridegroom builds a home for his bride as proof of his love and intention to marry.
  - The bride does not build the house; she receives it as a gift.
  - While she waits, she prepares herself for the wedding.
  - **Lesson:** Christ prepares heaven for us, while we, by His grace, prepare to meet Him.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Manner of His Coming
- **Question:** What will follow the signs of Christ's coming?
- **Key Text:** Luke 21:27
  - “And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points
- **Visible to All**
  - The text says, “They shall see.” It will not be a secret rapture or hidden event.
  - Revelation 1:7 – “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.”
- **The Clouds**
  - Clouds often represent the presence of God and the angelic host.
  - Psalm 104:3 – “Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind.”
- **The Great Controversy Ended**
  - The “power” displayed breaks the hold of the grave and delivers God's people from the enemy’s dominion.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Ascension Promise
- **Question:** At His ascension, how was Christ's return promised?
- **Key Text:** Acts 1:10, 11
  - “And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points
- **“This Same Jesus”**
  - It is not a spirit or a new prophet, but the Jesus who bears the scars of crucifixion.
  - Zechariah 13:6 – “And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.”
- **“In Like Manner”**
  - **Personally:** He went in person; He returns in person.
  - **Visibly:** They saw Him go; we will see Him come.
  - **In the Clouds:** A cloud received Him; He returns with clouds.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Train Station**
  - If a loved one leaves on a train and says, “I will return on this same track,” you do not look for a letter or a phone call to replace their arrival.
  - You go to the station to meet the person.
  - **Lesson:** The Second Advent is the return of the Person, Jesus Christ.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Blessed Hope
- **Question:** With what words does Paul express the blessed hope of Christ's Second Advent for His people?
- **Key Text:** Titus 2:13
  - “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points
- **The Great God**
  - Paul affirms the deity of Christ; we are waiting for God Himself.
- **The Context of Grace**
  - Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness while we wait.
  - Titus 2:11–12 – “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.”
- **Sanctification**
  - The hope of His appearing is the strongest motivation for holy living.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Certainty of the Event
- **Question:** What does Peter say about this awaited event?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:16
  - “We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of His majesty.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points
- **Not a Myth**
  - The Christian hope is grounded in history and eyewitness testimony, not philosophy.
- **The Transfiguration Witness**
  - Peter refers to the Transfiguration (Matthew 17), where he saw a miniature representation of the Second Coming.
  - There, Christ was glorified, appearing with Moses (representing resurrected saints) and Elijah (representing translated saints).
- **Certainty**
  - Because the apostles saw His majesty then, we can have absolute confidence in His return now.

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Unprepared World
- **Question:** When He returns, will most of the inhabitants of earth be prepared to meet Him?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Matthew 24:30 – “Then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.”
  - Revelation 1:7 – “Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points
- **Universal Mourning**
  - The majority of the world realizes too late that they have rejected salvation.
- **Those Who Pierced Him**
  - Historically: Those who crucified Him.
  - Spiritually: All who rejected His grace and persisted in sin (Hebrews 6:6).
- **The Reality of Judgment**
  - The glory of God is a consuming fire to sin.
  - Hebrews 12:29 – “For our God is a consuming fire.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Application (Imparted Righteousness)
- **Fitted for Heaven**
  - Preparation is about being comfortable in the presence of a Holy God.
  - We need **imparted righteousness** (Christ’s nature lived out in us).
- **Definition**
  - Imparted righteousness is the character of Christ produced inside the believer by the Holy Spirit (Sanctification).
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Evil Servant
- **Question:** Why will many not be prepared for this important event?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:48-51
  - “But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth His coming; And shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; The Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points
- **The Cause**
  - The internal belief: “My Lord delays.” Loss of urgency leads to a return to the world.
- **The Result**
  - **Lack of Love:** “Smite his fellow servants” (becoming critical and harsh).
  - **Worldliness:** “Eat and drink with the drunken” (seeking satisfaction in worldly pleasures).
- **The Surprise**
  - The coming of Christ overtakes them like a thief because they were not watching.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Unprepared Student**
  - A student who believes the final exam is far away may party and neglect studies.
  - When exam day arrives suddenly, they fail.
  - **Lesson:** They fail not because the teacher is cruel, but because they were unprepared.

## Slide 20 – Q8: Worldly Preoccupation (Part 1)
- **Question:** What will the world be doing when Christ returns in the clouds of heaven for His own?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:37-39
  - “But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Worldly Preoccupation (Part 2)
- **Key Text:** Luke 17:28-30
  - “Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points & Sanctuary
- **Normalcy Bias**
  - Eating, drinking, building, and planting are not inherently sinful.
  - The sin was being *wholly absorbed* in these things to the exclusion of God.
- **The Close of Probation**
  - In Noah’s day, the door shut *before* the rain started (Genesis 7:16).
  - The world continued its routine, unaware their fate was sealed.
- **Sanctuary Application**
  - We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
  - We should prioritize spiritual preparation over worldly gain while the High Priest finishes His work.

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Deceiver
- **Question:** Who is it that blinds men to the message about salvation through Jesus Christ?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 4:4
  - “In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points
- **The Enemy**
  - Satan ("the god of this world") works to blind human minds.
- **The Method**
  - He uses the cares of life, false doctrines, and worldly allurements to block the gospel light.
- **The Goal**
  - To prevent men from seeing the “image of God” in Christ.
  - Salvation is the restoration of that image.
  - Colossians 3:10 – “And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Importance of Preparation
- **Question:** How important is it that we now prepare our lives to meet Christ when He returns?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:2
  - “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points
- **Identity vs. Likeness**
  - We are “now” sons of God by faith (Justification).
  - “We shall be like Him” implies a completed work of grace (Sanctification).
- **The Harvest Principle**
  - The Second Coming is a harvest, not a planting time.
  - When He appears, He reflects His image in His people.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Reward and Judgment
- **Question:** Will the return of Christ be a time of reward?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Matthew 16:27 – “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every man according, to his works.”
  - Revelation 22:12 – “And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points (Faith & Works)
- **Judgment by Works**
  - We are saved by *grace alone* (Ephesians 2:8), but judged by *works*.
  - Why? Because works are the inevitable fruit of saving faith.
  - James 2:26 – “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Sanctuary Connection
- **The Investigative Judgment**
  - Before Christ returns to give rewards, a judgment determines who receives them.
  - This work occurs now in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Daniel 7:9-10 – “The Ancient of days did sit... the judgment was set, and the books were opened.”
  - When Christ returns, the investigation is over, and rewards are ready.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Recipients of Salvation
- **Question:** Who will receive the promised salvation when Christ returns?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:28
  - “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

## Slide 31 – Q12: Key Points
- **“Looking for Him”**
  - Salvation is for those eagerly anticipating His return in a state of relationship.
- **“Without Sin”**
  - **Christ's Role:** First coming, He bore our sin. Second coming, He comes apart from sin as King.
  - **Believer's State:** Through the High Priest’s final work, their sins are blotted out.
  - Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Motivation for Purity
- **Question:** What strong motivation should His return have on our lives right now?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:2, 3
  - “We know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him... And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points
- **“Purifieth Himself”**
  - This implies active cooperation with God’s work.
  - We choose to separate from known sin and obey His word.
- **“Even as He is Pure”**
  - The standard is Christ Himself, not the culture or other Christians.
- **Practical Application**
  - We cannot clean our own hearts, but we can ask God to do it.
  - Psalm 51:10 – “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.”

## Slide 34 – Q13: Illustration
- **The Guest of Honor**
  - If a guest of great honor is coming to your home, you clean the house.
  - The scrubbing doesn't invite the guest (the invitation was already sent).
  - **Lesson:** The cleaning prepares the environment to receive them with honor.

## Slide 35 – Q14: The Crown of Life
- **Question:** To whom are these crowns of life promised?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 4:6-8
  - “For I am now ready to be offered... I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points
- **“All Them That Love His Appearing”**
  - The crown is for every humble believer who longs for Jesus.
- **The Good Fight**
  - The Christian life is a battle against spiritual powers and fleshly lusts.
  - Ephesians 6:11 – “Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”
- **Endurance**
  - We must finish the race.
  - Matthew 24:13 – “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.”

## Slide 37 – Q15: The Shout of Victory
- **Question:** What will the waiting ones say when Jesus comes the second time?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 25:9
  - “And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.”

## Slide 38 – Q15: Key Points
- **“Our God”**
  - They recognize Him because they have communed with Him daily in prayer.
- **“We Have Waited”**
  - Patience and endurance characterized their faith during delay and persecution.
- **Rejoicing**
  - While the wicked wail, the righteous rejoice because their redemption has come.

## Slide 39 – Q16: The Timing
- **Question:** Has the exact time of Christ's coming been revealed?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:36
  - “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only.”

## Slide 40 – Q16: Key Points
- **God's Secret**
  - The exact date is not revealed to men or angels.
- **Against Date-Setting**
  - Any teaching that sets a specific calendar date for Christ's return is contrary to Scripture.
- **Purpose**
  - God withholds the date so we remain in constant readiness, living by faith rather than a countdown.

## Slide 41 – Q17: Preparation
- **Question:** In view of this fact, how does Christ tell us to prepare for that glorious event?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:42
  - “Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.”

## Slide 42 – Q17: Key Points
- **Watchfulness**
  - To “watch” implies spiritual alertness.
  - A watchman on the wall scans the horizon; he does not sleep.
- **Active, Not Passive**
  - Watching involves prayer, studying the signs, and working to save souls.

## Slide 43 – Q17: Illustration
- **The Soldier on Guard**
  - A soldier on guard duty at night must stay awake. If he sleeps, the enemy enters.
  - 1 Peter 5:8 – “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”
  - **Lesson:** We must watch against the enemy of our souls.

## Slide 44 – Q18: Warning Against Distraction
- **Question:** What warning has Christ given that we might not be taken by surprise when He returns?
- **Key Text:** Luke 21:34-36
  - “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares... Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things...”

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points
- **Three Dangers**
  1.  **Surfeiting:** Overindulgence (intemperance).
  2.  **Drunkenness:** Physical alcohol or spiritual false doctrine.
  3.  **Cares of this life:** Anxiety over worldly status or survival.
- **Health and Holiness**
  - A mind clouded by intemperance cannot discern the Holy Spirit.
- **“Accounted Worthy”**
  - We stand before the Son of Man because we are clothed in His righteousness.

## Slide 46 – Q19: Developing Patience
- **Question:** What special attribute should the waiting ones develop?
- **Key Text:** James 5:7, 8
  - “Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.”

## Slide 47 – Q19: Key Points
- **Patience**
  - God is not slack concerning His promises.
  - 2 Peter 3:9 – “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward...”
- **The Harvest Principle**
  - God is the Husbandman waiting for the “precious fruit”—a people reflecting Christ’s character.

## Slide 48 – Q19: Application (The Rain)
- **Early and Latter Rain**
  - **Early Rain:** The Spirit at Pentecost/conversion to germinate the seed.
  - **Latter Rain:** The final outpouring of the Holy Spirit to ripen the grain for harvest.
- **Our Duty**
  - We must pray for this power to finish the work of overcoming sin.

## Slide 49 – Q20: Christian Attitudes
- **Question:** What has been the attitude of too many Christians toward the Second Advent of Christ?
- **Content:**
  - The belief in the Second Coming appears in Christian literature and creeds from the apostles down to recent times.

## Slide 50 – Q20: Key Points
- **Formalism vs. Reality**
  - While the *doctrine* is held officially (in Creeds), the *vitality* is often lost.
  - Many live as if this world is their permanent home.
- **Spiritualizing**
  - Some deny the literal return, viewing it only as a spiritual event at death.
- **Our Responsibility**
  - We are called to be “people of the Book.”
  - We must proclaim the Three Angels' Messages to prepare the world for this literal, glorious event.
