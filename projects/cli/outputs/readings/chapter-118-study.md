### Q1. By what means may the mother largely bind home hearts together?

**“She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness.” Proverbs 31:26.**

**Answer:**
The mother is the queen of the household, and her scepter is the “law of kindness.” The scriptures reveal that the atmosphere of the home is largely determined by her spirit and her words.

*   **The Law of Kindness:** This is not merely a pleasant personality, but a spiritual principle. It is the love of Christ (agape) flowing through human speech. When the law of God is written in the heart (Hebrews 8:10), the law of kindness is heard on the tongue.
*   **Binding Hearts:** Just as the High Priest bore the names of the tribes of Israel upon his breastplate (Exodus 28:29), keeping them near his heart, the Christian mother binds the family together through wisdom and gentle speech. Harsh words scatter; kind words gather.
*   **Wisdom in Speech:** True wisdom is "first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated" (James 3:17). A mother who abides in Christ receives this wisdom, enabling her to guide her children and support her husband without fretfulness or harsh command.

**[ILL]**
Consider a home like a garden. Harsh words are like hail that beats down the tender plants, stunting their growth. Kind words are like the dew and the gentle rain that nourish the roots. A mother’s kindness creates the climate in which the souls of her children can grow toward the Sun of Righteousness.

### Q2. Is it proper to speak words of encouragement to the pains taking keeper of home?

**“Her children arise up and call her blessed: her husband also, and he praiseth her. Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.” Proverbs 31:28, 31.**

**Answer:**
Yes, it is not only proper but a Christian duty to express gratitude. The work of the home—cooking, cleaning, mending, and training—is often unseen and repetitive, much like the daily ministry in the Holy Place of the sanctuary. It requires patience and self-sacrifice.

*   **The Duty of Husbands and Children:** Neglecting to thank the mother is a species of selfishness. If she ministers with the spirit of Christ, her family should respond with the appreciation of Christ.
*   **Encouragement as Fuel:** Praise is to the weary heart what oil is to the lamp; it brightens the flame and sustains the light.
*   **The Fruit of Her Hands:** While salvation is by grace alone, the Bible teaches that our works follow us (Revelation 14:13). The mother’s faithful discharge of duty is a "fruit" that testifies to the genuineness of her faith.

**[ILL]**
A traveler may drink from a clear, cool spring and be refreshed, yet never think of the hidden underground stream that feeds it. The mother’s love is often that hidden stream. It is right for the family to trace the blessing back to its source and say, "Thank you."

### Q3. Is mutual obligation enjoined in a well appointed home?

**“Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right. Honor thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” Ephesians 6:1-4.**

**Answer:**
The home is a school where we prepare for membership in the family of God. Paul outlines reciprocal duties that reflect the government of heaven:

1.  **Obedience in the Lord:** Children are to obey because parents stand in the place of God to them during their early years. This teaches the child the principle of respect for divine authority.
2.  **The First Commandment with Promise:** This refers to the Fifth Commandment (Exodus 20:12). It connects temporal blessing and longevity with the spiritual discipline of honor.
3.  **Parental Restraint:** Fathers are warned not to "provoke" children. Arbitrary, harsh, or inconsistent authority misrepresents God. God’s law is a law of love; therefore, parental authority must be exercised with patience and reason.
4.  **Nurture and Admonition:**
    *   *Nurture:* Providing for physical and emotional needs (tenderness).
    *   *Admonition:* Instruction, warning, and discipline (firmness).

**Definition:** *Admonition* implies putting a mind into someone—training the child to think and reason from cause to effect, rather than demanding blind submission.

**[ILL]**
A young tree must be staked to grow straight. If the gardener binds the rope too tightly, it cuts into the bark and kills the tree (provoking wrath). If he binds it too loosely, the wind blows the tree over (lack of discipline). The godly parent finds the balance of love and law to guide the child upward.

### Q4. In what scriptures are two families brought to view?

**“The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.” Matthew 13:38.**
**“In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil.” 1 John 3:10.**

**Answer:**
The Bible recognizes only two spiritual families in the world. Despite the many divisions of race, nation, or class, spiritually there are only:

*   **The Children of the Kingdom (Wheat):** Those who have received Christ and His righteousness.
*   **The Children of the Wicked One (Tares):** Those who remain in rebellion, regardless of their outward profession.

This distinction is central to the **Great Controversy**. There is no neutral ground. We are either gathering with Christ or scattering abroad (Matthew 12:30). The "tares" may look like wheat for a time—representing those in the church who have a form of religion but no converting power—but the harvest (the judgment) reveals their true nature.

**[ILL]**
In a magnet factory, a piece of metal either is magnetized or it is not. It may look exactly like a magnet, sit in the same box as the magnets, and be shaped like a magnet. But when the test comes, only the one with the magnetic charge (the life of Christ) will attract the steel.

### Q5. How are the children of God manifest?

**“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin.” 1 John 3:9.**
**“He that hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.” John 14:21.**

**Answer:**
The defining mark of God’s family is the character of the Father reproduced in the child. This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**:

1.  **The New Birth:** To be "born of God" means receiving a new nature (2 Peter 1:4). The old nature loves sin; the new nature loves righteousness. Therefore, "whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin"—meaning he does not practice it, cherish it, or live in it as a habit.
2.  **Obedience by Love:** Jesus connects love with commandment-keeping. We do not obey to *become* children of God; we obey because we *are* children of God.
3.  **Victory is Possible:** Through the indwelling of Christ, the believer is empowered to overcome every known sin. God does not command the impossible. His biddings are enablings.

**Definition:** *Sanctification* is the daily process of dying to self and living to Christ, resulting in a life that increasingly reflects God's law (Romans 8:3-4).

### Q6. How may the children of the wicked one be known?

**“He that committeth sin is of the Devil.” 1 John 3:8.**
**“Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.” John 8:44.**

**Answer:**
The children of the wicked one are identified not necessarily by gross crimes, but by the principle of rebellion in the heart.
*   **"Of the Devil":** This indicates spiritual parentage. Satan was a murderer and a liar from the beginning. When we cherish hatred (spiritual murder) or falsehood, we exhibit his DNA.
*   **"Committeth Sin":** This refers to a continuous action—living in violation of God’s law. Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4).
*   **The Lusts of the Father:** Selfishness, pride, and covetousness are the attributes of Satan. Even a refined, polite person who lives entirely for self is, in the eyes of Heaven, a child of the enemy.

**[ILL]**
A wolf may be dressed in sheep's clothing, but it cannot eat grass like a sheep. Eventually, its nature will demand meat, and it will kill. A sinner may dress in religious forms, but eventually, the unrenewed heart will reveal its true appetite for the things of the world.

### Q7. Are there counterfeit children of God?

**“Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” 2 Timothy 3:5.**
**“They profess that they know God, but in works, they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.” Titus 1:16.**

**Answer:**
Yes. This is one of the most solemn warnings in Scripture. It is possible to be a member of the visible church, to keep the Sabbath, to pay tithe, and yet be a "counterfeit."

*   **The Form vs. The Power:** The "form" includes rituals, doctrines, and outward habits. The "power" is the Holy Spirit cleansing the heart from the love of sin.
*   **Denying Him in Works:** A profession of faith that does not lead to a transformed life is a lie. This is the condition of the Laodicean church—feeling rich and increased with goods, yet spiritually naked (Revelation 3:17).
*   **Righteousness by Faith connection:** We are not saved by our works, but a faith that does not produce works of love and obedience is a dead faith (James 2:20).

---

### Q8. How may we judge between the true and the false?

**“Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” Matthew 7:20.**

**Answer:**
Since we cannot read the heart, God gives us the test of "fruit."
*   **What is the Fruit?** Galatians 5:22-23 describes the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
*   **Consistency:** A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit. If a man preaches truth but lives in adultery or dishonesty, the fruit is bad, and the tree is corrupt.
*   **The Life Test:** The test is not "Does he have emotional ecstasies?" or "Does he know all the doctrines?" The test is, "Is the character of Christ seen in his daily life?"

**[ILL]**
You can tie apples onto a dead branch, but they will eventually rot and fall off. Only a living branch produces apples from the inside out. A counterfeit Christian puts on good deeds like ornaments; a true Christian grows them naturally because he is connected to the Vine (Jesus).

### Q9. To what family do they belong who are not the children of God?

**“And you hath He quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins, ...and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.” Ephesians 2:1-3.**

**Answer:**
By default, every human being born into this world belongs to the family of Adam—a fallen, broken race.
*   **Children of Wrath:** This does not mean God hates us; it means our nature is opposed to His law and, if left unchanged, must be consumed by the glory of His holiness.
*   **Dead in Trespasses:** Without Christ, we possess biological life but not spiritual life. We are unresponsive to spiritual things.
*   **The Necessity of Rebirth:** Because we are "by nature" children of wrath, education and culture cannot save us. We need a new life from above. This highlights the need for **Justification** (forgiveness of past sins) and **Regeneration** (a new heart).

### Q10. If one desires to escape from the snare of the enemy, what must he do?

**“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.” James 4:7, 8.**

**Answer:**
Here is the secret of victory over sin. It is a cooperative work between the human will and divine power.

1.  **Submit:** The first step is surrender. We must yield our will to God. This is the death of self. "Not my will, but Thine, be done."
2.  **Resist:** God does not resist the devil *for* us while we sit idly by. We must actively say "No" to temptation, relying on the power of the Spirit.
3.  **Draw Nigh:** We do this through prayer, the study of the Word, and looking to Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary.
4.  **The Promise:** When we submit and resist in Christ's strength, Satan *must* flee. He cannot overcome a soul that is sheltered in Christ.

**[ILL]**
A small child is being bullied by a large tyrant. The child cannot fight the tyrant alone. But if the child runs and stands behind his mighty Father, the tyrant flees—not because of the child's strength, but because of the Father's presence. Submission is running to the Father.

### Q11. How may we know that we are accepted of God, and thus are members of the royal family?

**“But whoso keepeth His word, in Him verily is the love of God perfected; hereby know we that we are in Him.” 1 John 2:5.**
**“And he that keepeth His commandments dwelleth in Him and He in him, and hereby we know that He abideth in us by the Spirit which He hath given us.” 1 John 3:24.**

**Answer:**
Assurance of salvation is not based on flighty feelings, but on the evidence of a changed life and the indwelling Spirit.
*   **The Test of Assurance:** "Hereby know we." How? If we are keeping His word.
*   **The Connection:** Obedience is the pulse of the new life. If the heart is beating with the love of God, the life will walk in the commandments of God.
*   **Perfected Love:** Righteousness by Faith is not just a legal transaction; it is love "perfected" or reaching its goal in a life of loyalty. We know we are His because He has given us His Spirit, who empowers us to do His will.

**Definition:** *Imparted Righteousness* is the holiness Christ works *inside* us by the Holy Spirit, enabling us to keep the law.

### Q12. How has God manifested His great love to the children of men?

**“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.” 1 John 3:1.**

**Answer:**
The greatest manifestation of love is adoption.
*   **"What Manner of Love!":** The apostle John calls us to behold (look at with wonder) this love. It is foreign to human nature. Humans love those who are lovely; God loved us when we were "children of wrath."
*   **Adoption:** He does not merely forgive us like a judge acquitting a criminal; He takes us into His family. He gives us His name, His resources, and His inheritance.
*   **The Dignity of the Believer:** To be a son or daughter of God is a higher honor than to be a king or queen of an earthly empire.

### Q13. How strong is His desire, and how urgent the invitation that all men should share in this wonderful love?

**“And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” Revelation 22:17.**

**Answer:**
The Bible closes with a universal invitation.
*   **The Spirit and the Bride:** The Holy Spirit works on the heart, and the Church (the Bride) extends the call verbally.
*   **"Whosoever Will":** God honors the human will. He has provided salvation for all (Titus 2:11), but He forces it upon none. The gate is open, the price has been paid by the blood of the Lamb, and the water of life is free.
*   **Urgency:** As the Great Controversy draws to a close, the invitation becomes more urgent. To delay is to risk eternal loss.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a burning building. The firefighters have raised the ladder; the safety net is spread. They do not whisper; they shout, "Come! Jump!" God’s invitation is the urgent cry of a Savior to a perishing world.

### Q14. Will the time come when one class will forever pass out of sight?

**“For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” Psalm 37:10.**

**Answer:**
Yes. The "two families" will not coexist eternally.
*   **The End of the Wicked:** Scripture teaches that the wicked "shall not be." They will not live forever in a place of torment; they will be consumed and cease to exist (Malachi 4:1-3).
*   **Clean Universe:** Sin is an intruder. For God to be all in all, sin and sinners who cling to their rebellion must be removed.
*   **God's Justice and Mercy:** It would be cruel to force those who hate God to live in His presence forever, and equally cruel to torture them eternally. Their destruction is an act of justice that cleanses the universe.

### Q15. What is said of the universal family that remains?

**“And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb forever and ever.” Revelation 5:13.**

**Answer:**
The Great Controversy ends with a unified family.
*   **One Family:** The barrier of sin is removed. Angels and redeemed humanity are united in worship.
*   **Universal Praise:** There is no dissenting voice. Every creature acknowledges the justice and love of God.
*   **The Lamb:** The focus of eternity will be the "Lamb"—Jesus Christ, who by His sacrifice reconciled the family of earth to the family of heaven.

**Final Thought:** The home on earth is to be a type of this heavenly reality. By "binding home hearts together" now (Q1), we prepare to join that great multitude which no man can number, singing the song of Moses and the Lamb.
