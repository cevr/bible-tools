## Slide 1 – Q1: The Origin of the Sabbath

- **Question:** Who made the Sabbath and gave it to mankind?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:11 – “In six days the Lord made the heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Creator & Gospel)

- **The Authority of the Creator:**
  - The Sabbath is not a human invention or legislative decree.
  - It was established at the foundation of the world by Christ Himself (John 1:3 – “All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.”).
- **A Finished Work (The Gospel Connection):**
  - God rested because His work was perfect and complete.
  - This parallels the Gospel: Adam entered God’s finished work of creation; the believer enters Christ’s finished work of redemption.
  - Hebrews 4:10 – “For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.”
- **Universal Gift:**
  - Jesus confirmed the Sabbath was for all humanity, not just one nation (Mark 2:27 – “And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Architect’s Seal:**
  - When an architect designs a building, he places his seal on the cornerstone to identify the builder.
  - The Sabbath is God’s seal placed in the very heart of His law.
  - No government has the authority to remove the Architect’s seal and replace it, just as no painter has the right to sign his name to another artist’s masterpiece.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Ownership of the Sabbath

- **Question:** To whom does the Sabbath belong?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:10 – “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (God’s Property)

- **The Lord’s Day:**
  - God calls the Sabbath “my holy day” (Isaiah 58:13 – “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day...”).
  - It is the true “Lord’s Day” of Scripture (Revelation 1:10 – “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day...”).
- **Not Human Property:**
  - Humans are stewards of time, not owners. We have no right to alter, sell, or legislate God’s property.
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - The Sabbath commandment sat inside the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place.
  - This location, under the Shekinah glory, signifies that the Sabbath is central to God’s government and rule.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Tithe of Time:**
  - The tithe (one-tenth of income) belongs to the Lord (Leviticus 27:30 – “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD'S: it is holy unto the LORD.”).
  - Similarly, the Sabbath is the “tithe of our time”—one-seventh of our week.
  - Using Sabbath hours for common work is robbing God of what is His own, just as taking money from an employer's register is theft.

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: Rendering Observance

- **Question:** To whom, then, should its observance be rendered?
- **Key Text:** Mark 12:17 – “And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Two Kingdoms)

- **Two Distinct Kingdoms:**
  - **Caesar (The State):** Jurisdiction over civil matters, property, and public order.
  - **God:** Jurisdiction over the heart, conscience, worship, and faith.
- **The Limit of Civil Power:**
  - We owe the state taxes and civil obedience.
  - We owe God our worship and the Sabbath.
  - To render Sabbath observance to Caesar (keeping it only because of civil law) is to give Caesar what belongs to God.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **True Obedience Springs from Faith:**
  - A government can force a man to be idle, but it cannot force him to be holy.
  - Forced rest is not Sabbath-keeping.
  - Romans 14:23 – “...for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”
- **The Heart of the Matter:**
  - Obedience must come from a heart of love, not state coercion.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Coin and the Image:**
  - In Mark 12, the coin bore Caesar’s image, so it belonged to him.
  - Humanity bears *God’s* image (Genesis 1:27 – “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him...”).
  - Therefore, our entire being—conscience and worship—belongs to God alone, not the state.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Accountability

- **Question:** In religious matters, to whom alone are we accountable for our words and actions?
- **Key Text:** Romans 14:12 – “So then everyone of us shall give account of himself to God.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Judgment & Liberty)

- **Individual Judgment:**
  - The Investigative Judgment is a personal transaction between the soul and God.
  - Daniel 7:10 – “...the judgment was set, and the books were opened.”
  - No government official can answer for us at God's judgment bar; therefore, they cannot dictate our religious duty.
- **The Conscience:**
  - The conscience is holy ground for the Holy Spirit.
  - When the state interferes with conscience, it usurps the place of the Spirit.
- **Liberty in the Gospel:**
  - 2 Corinthians 3:17 – “Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Proxy:**
  - If you commit a crime, you cannot send a friend to serve your prison sentence; you must answer for yourself.
  - Since the government cannot take your punishment in the final judgment, the government has no right to dictate your worship now.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Holiness of the Day

- **Question:** How does God show the holiness of the Sabbath day?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Exodus 20:8 – “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”
  - Leviticus 23:3 – “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein...”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **A Spiritual Institution:**
  - The Sabbath is a “holy convocation,” involving worship and communion with the Creator.
- **Sanctification Required:**
  - To “keep” the day holy, the person must *be* holy.
  - A secular state cannot generate holiness.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”
- **The Believer’s Experience:**
  - Only through the indwelling of Christ (Justification and Sanctification) can a believer truly keep the Sabbath.
  - State laws only force unregenerate men to act hypocritically.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Nature of Legislation

- **Question:** So then, what is the true nature of all Sabbath legislation?
- **Answer:** It is religious legislation.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points (The Counterfeit)

- **Defining the Act:**
  - Since the Sabbath (or Sunday) is a religious institution, laws enforcing it are enforcing religious dogma.
- **Violating the Decalogue:**
  - Such laws violate the first table of the Law (duty to God).
  - Civil government exists to enforce the second table (duty to man).
- **True vs. False Motives:**
  - True Sabbath-keeping comes from love (John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”).
  - Legislated keeping substitutes the fear of the magistrate for the fear of God.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Baptism Law:**
  - If the government passed a law requiring every citizen to be baptized, it would be universally recognized as a union of church and state.
  - Baptism is a religious ordinance; the Sabbath is also a religious ordinance.
  - Legislating one is as illegitimate as legislating the other.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: Results of Union

- **Question:** Religious legislation unites church with state. What has generally been the result of enacting religious legislation?
- **Answer:** Religious intolerance and persecution.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Great Controversy)

- **The Lesson of History:**
  - Whenever the church uses state power (Pagan Rome, Papal Rome, etc.), persecution of dissenters follows.
- **Two Opposing Spirits:**
  - **Christ’s Kingdom:** Not of this world; does not use force (John 18:36 – “Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight...”).
  - **The Dragon’s Spirit:** Uses force and coercion (Revelation 12 & 13).
- **Force vs. Love:**
  - Satan claims God’s law is a burden requiring force.
  - God demonstrates His law is love, written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10 – “...I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”).

## Slide 21 – Q8: First Sunday Law

- **Question:** What was the first Sunday law in history?
- **Answer:** Constantine’s Sunday law of March 7, 321 A.D.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Historical Context

- **The Edict:**
  - “On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed...”
- **Compromise:**
  - Constantine sought to unite pagans and Christians.
  - The law used the pagan title “Day of the Sun,” not “Sabbath of the Lord.”
- **The Result:**
  - This heathen festival was “baptized” into the church, opening the door for the suppression of the biblical Sabbath.

---

## Slide 23 – Q9: Church Councils

- **Question:** What church council required Sunday observance and forbade Sabbath observance?
- **Answer:** The Council of Laodicea (circa A.D. 364).

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points (Prophecy & Authority)

- **The Decree:**
  - Christians were commanded to keep Sunday. If they rested on Sabbath (Saturday), they were to be “shut out from Christ” (anathema).
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:**
  - Fulfilled Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the most High... and think to change times and laws...”
- **The Gospel Issue:**
  - The church placed tradition above the Bible (Mark 7:7 – “Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”).
  - Claiming power to change God's law obscures the definition of sin and the need for Atonement.

---

## Slide 25 – Q10: Modern Legislation

- **Question:** Was there any additional governmental Sunday legislation in later years?
- **Answer:** Yes, a long series of imperial and civil decrees.

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points (Prophecy & Duty)

- **Prophetic Warning:**
  - Revelation 13 predicts a return to church-state union (the “image to the beast”).
  - Economic boycotts and laws will attempt to enforce false worship (Revelation 13:16-17).
- **The Believer’s Duty:**
  - Defend religious liberty.
  - Trust in Christ, our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Obey God rather than men (Acts 5:29 – “Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.”).

## Slide 27 – Q10: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Thermometer:**
  - Legislation is like a thermometer; it shows the spiritual temperature of society.
  - When a church loses the fire of the Holy Spirit, it often turns to the cold steel of the state to force people in.
  - A Spirit-filled church needs no civil law to support it.
