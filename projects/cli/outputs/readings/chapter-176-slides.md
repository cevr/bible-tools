## Slide 1 – Bible Study: Purity and the Temple of God

- **Topic:** Christian Purity, Health Reform, and Sanctification
- **Theme:** Glorifying God in Body and Spirit
- **Key Principle:** The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Command for Purity

- **Question:** What injunction regarding purity did Paul give Timothy?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 5:22 (last clause) – “Keep thyself pure.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Sanctuary & Purity)

- **More than Hygiene:**
  - This command is a spiritual imperative, not just a suggestion for physical
    cleanliness.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, priests washed at the laver before entering the
    Holy Place (Exodus 30:19–21 – “For they shall wash their hands and their
    feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them...”
    [Reference only, concept applied]).
  - Failure to cleanse meant death.
  - Believers today are “kings and priests unto God” (Revelation 1:6 – “And hath
    made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and
    dominion for ever and ever. Amen.”).
- **Definition of Purity:**
  - To be “pure” means to be unmixed and free from contaminating substances.
  - In the Christian life, this requires freedom from habits that cloud the mind
    or weaken the will.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Surgeon:**
  - A surgeon scrubs his hands thoroughly before a delicate operation.
  - He does not do this to be praised for cleanliness, but because a microscopic
    germ could kill the patient.
- **The Application:**
  - A Christian keeps himself pure not to earn salvation, but because he carries
    the life of Christ within him.
  - Sin and physical defilement are fatal to the spiritual life.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Extent of Cleansing

- **Question:** To what extent should all be kept pure?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 7:1 – “Having therefore these promises, dearly
  beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
  perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Scope & Method)

- **The Scope:**
  - “All filthiness of the flesh and spirit.”
  - This covers physical habits (flesh) and thoughts/motives (spirit).
  - We cannot harbor a secret sin in the body while claiming a pure heart.
- **The Method (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - We do not cleanse ourselves _in order_ to get God’s favor.
  - We cleanse ourselves _because_ we “have therefore these promises” of
    adoption (2 Corinthians 6:17–18).
  - **Justification:** God accepts us as children.
  - **Sanctification:** Because we are children, we partake of His nature and
    expel sin.
- **The Goal:**
  - “Perfecting holiness,” which is the restoration of the image of God in man.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Crystal Vase:**
  - Imagine a crystal vase designed to hold pure water.
  - If the vase is filled with mud, it cannot fulfill its purpose.
  - Pouring fresh water in while mud remains creates a dirty mixture.
- **The Lesson:**
  - To “perfect holiness” is to empty the vase of the mud (filthiness of the
    flesh) and wash it clean so it can hold the pure water of life (the Spirit).

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Separation from Pollution

- **Question:** Can one indulge in the use of anything filthy or polluting, and
  still be pure?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 6:17 – “Wherefore come out from among them, and be
  ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will
  receive you.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Separation & Victory)

- **The Condition:**
  - The command is definitive: “Touch not.”
  - Even contact with defiling substances compromises the separation God
    requires.
- **Sanctuary Holiness:**
  - A believer cannot walk with the world in destructive habits and walk with
    God in the sanctuary of holiness (Amos 3:3 – “Can two walk together, except
    they be agreed?”).
- **Application to Health:**
  - “The unclean thing” represents anything that acts as a poison to the body or
    a narcotic to the brain.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - Victory over habits is not achieved by mere human willpower.
  - It is achieved by faith working by love (Galatians 5:6).
  - Christ lives His life of purity _through_ the believer (Galatians 2:20 – “I
    am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth
    in me...”).

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Defiling the Temple

- **Question:** What will the Lord do to those who defile the temple of God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 3:17 – “If any man defile the temple of God, him
  shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.”

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (The Body Temple)

- **The Body as a Temple:**
  - In the Old Testament, God dwelt in the Most Holy Place.
  - In the New Covenant, the Holy Spirit dwells within the believer (1
    Corinthians 6:19 – “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the
    Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your
    own?”).
- **Sacrilege of Defilement:**
  - To defile the body with poisons is to destroy God’s workmanship.
- **Divine Justice:**
  - “Him shall God destroy” is a natural result, not arbitrary punishment.
  - If we destroy the machinery God gave us to sustain life, we eventually
    destroy ourselves.

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Bad Tenant:**
  - If a tenant rents a house and smashes the windows, tears down walls, and
    dumps toxic waste in the living room, the landlord will evict them to save
    the property.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Our bodies are the “house” owned by God.
  - If we tear them down with intemperance, we are destroying God’s property.

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Defiling Article

- **Question:** What article in common use is defiling to the user?
- **Source Text:** “Chemists, botanists, and physicians unite in pronouncing
  tobacco one of the most deadly poisons known. No other poison, with the
  exception of prussic acid, will cause death so quickly... The active principle
  of tobacco, that is, nicotine...”

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Tobacco & False Worship)

- **The Poison:**
  - Nicotine is scientifically classified as a potent toxin, often used to kill
    insects.
- **Spiritual Implication:**
  - Using a deadly poison for pleasure violates the Sixth Commandment (“Thou
    shalt not kill”), as it is a slow form of suicide.
- **Sanctuary Connection (Counterfeit Incense):**
  - The incense in the earthly sanctuary represented the prayers of saints
    (Revelation 8:3–4).
  - The “incense” of tobacco smoke is a counterfeit offering—a “strange fire”
    (Leviticus 10:1) that pollutes the human temple.

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Symptoms of Poisoning

- **Question:** What are some of the symptoms of tobacco poisoning?
- **Source Text:** Dr. B. W. Richardson says: “Smoking produces disturbances
  (a). In the blood... (b). In the stomach... (c). Of the heart... (d). Of the
  organs of sense... (e). In the brain... (f). Of the nervous filaments...”

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (The Brain & Nerves)

- **The Physical Impact:**
  - It affects the blood, heart, eyes, and ears.
- **The Spiritual Danger:**
  - The most critical damage is to the brain and nerves.
  - The brain is the only medium through which God communicates with man.
  - If nerves are paralyzed or clouded by narcotics, the Holy Spirit’s “still
    small voice” cannot be clearly heard.
- **Physical Theology:**
  - We must be “temperate in all things” (1 Corinthians 9:25) to run the
    Christian race effectively.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Radio Receiver:**
  - A radio must be tuned perfectly to pick up a distant signal.
  - If the internal wiring is corroded or static is introduced, the message is
    lost.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The brain is our receiver for Heaven’s signals.
  - Tobacco and stimulants introduce “static,” making it difficult to discern
    the will of God.

---

## Slide 18 – Q7: Exhortation to Change

- **Question:** What does the apostle exhort all to do concerning their former
  habits?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 4:2 – “That he no longer should live the rest of his
  time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points (Transformation)

- **Two Masters:**
  - One cannot serve both the “lusts of men” and the “will of God” (Matthew
    6:24).
- **The Transformation:**
  - Conversion implies a turning away from old habits.
  - The new life in the Spirit requires departing from the slavery of
    stimulants.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We overcome habits not to _become_ God’s children, but _because_ we are His
    children.
  - God works in us “to will and to do” of His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13).

---

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Reason for Change

- **Question:** What reason does he give for this advice?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 4:3 – “For the time past of our life may suffice us to
  have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
  lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points (Idolatry of Addiction)

- **Enough Time Wasted:**
  - We have spent enough time serving sin and sensory gratification.
- **The “Will of the Gentiles”:**
  - This refers to a lifestyle lacking self-control, common to those who do not
    know God.
- **Abominable Idolatries:**
  - An idol is anything that takes supreme place in our affections.
  - For the addict, the cigarette or stimulant becomes a god that dictates their
    schedule, mood, and spending.

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: Origins of the Habit

- **Question:** With whom was tobacco using first known?
- **Source Text:** “Originating with the Indians of America... the natives
  carried with them lighted fire brands... [Columbus's sailors] declared that
  they ‘saw the naked savages twist large leaves together, and smoke like
  devils.’”

---

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Heathen Customs)

- **Pagan Origins:**
  - History reveals tobacco use originated in heathenism, often used in rituals
    to commune with spirits.
- **Christian Distinctiveness:**
  - God’s people are a “peculiar people” (1 Peter 2:9).
  - Adopting habits that degrade the body is a step backward into spiritual
    darkness.
  - Jeremiah 10:2 – “Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the heathen...”

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: Glorifying God

- **Question:** How are all exhorted to glorify God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 6:20 – “For ye are bought with a price; therefore
  glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Redemption & Ownership)

- **Property Rights:**
  - We are not our own; we have been bought with the precious blood of Christ (1
    Peter 1:18–19).
- **The Definition of Sin:**
  - Damaging the body with poisons (tobacco, alcohol, caffeine) is damaging
    property that belongs to God.
- **Glorifying God:**
  - To glorify God is to reflect His character.
  - We glorify Him by keeping our bodies in the best condition to serve Him.

---

## Slide 26 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Borrowed Car:**
  - If you borrowed a friend's expensive car, you would treat it with great care
    out of respect for the owner.
  - You would not put sugar in the gas tank.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Our bodies are “on loan” from God, purchased at the infinite cost of the
    Cross.
  - Pouring poisons into them shows a lack of respect for the Owner and the
    Price paid.

---

## Slide 27 – Q11: Looking for the Saviour

- **Question:** What course will those take who are looking for the Saviour?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:2, 3 – “Beloved, now are we the sons of God... but we
  know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as
  He is. And every man that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself even as He
  is pure.”

---

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points (Preparation for Advent)

- **Preparation for Translation:**
  - Those living when Christ returns need a character that reflects Jesus.
- **Active Cooperation:**
  - “Purifieth himself” means actively cooperating with the Holy Spirit to
    remove habits that bind us.
- **The Standard:**
  - “Even as He is pure.”
  - Did Jesus use narcotics or enslave His will to stimulants? No.
  - To be like Him when He appears, we must strive to be like Him now.

---

## Slide 29 – Q11: Application (The Hope)

- **The Blessed Hope:**
  - The hope of the Advent inspires the work of reform.
  - We believe Jesus is coming to take us to a pure heaven; therefore, by His
    grace, we begin to live the life of heaven here on earth.

---

## Slide 30 – Additional Stimulants (Tea & Coffee)

- **Summary of Principles:**
  - The source text identifies tea and coffee (containing theine and caffeine)
    as similar in principle to other narcotics.
- **Effects on the Temple:**
  - **Digestion:** Retards digestion and hinders God-given functions.
  - **Nerves:** Produces artificial excitement followed by depression
    ("nervousness and peevishness").
  - **Spirit:** Can cause a "fretful" mood that hurts a Christian's witness.
- **The Rule:**
  - Total abstinence from all stimulants and narcotics is the safe path for the
    believer.

---

## Slide 31 – Q13: Entry into the City

- **Question:** When the saints are gathered at last into the city of God, who
  will be kept out?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 21:27 – “And there shall in no wise enter into it
  anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a
  lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points (Final Restoration)

- **"Anything that Defileth":**
  - Tobacco, alcohol, and narcotic stimulants defile the body temple and enslave
    the will.
- **"Maketh a Lie":**
  - Artificial stimulants create a false sense of well-being while actually
    destroying the nerves.
- **The Lamb's Book of Life:**
  - Only those washed in the blood of the Lamb enter (Revelation 7:14).
  - This washing includes the cleansing of our habits; we cannot cling to
    defilement and the Cross simultaneously.
- **The Gospel Promise:**
  - Jesus breaks the _power_ of sin (Sanctification) as well as the _guilt_
    (Justification). He offers a complete cure.

---

## Slide 33 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Royal Visit:**
  - When a king visits a city, the streets are swept, garbage is removed, and
    decorations are prepared.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The King of Kings is coming soon.
  - Shall He find the “city” of our soul filled with the refuse of
    self-indulgence?
  - Or shall He find a temple swept and garnished, ready for His habitation?
    (Matthew 24:42–44).
