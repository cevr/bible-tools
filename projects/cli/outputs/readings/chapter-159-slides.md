## Slide 1 – Q1: Definition of Presumption

- **Question:** What is the definition of presumption?
- **Definition:**
  - “The act of believing upon probable evidence, or taking for granted; belief upon incomplete proof; opinion. The act of venturing beyond due bounds; forward, venturesome, overconfident, or arrogant opinion or conduct; unreasonable confidence.” — *Webster’s Dictionary*

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Faith vs. Presumption)

- **Counterfeit Faith:**
  - Presumption is Satan’s counterfeit of faith.
  - Faith takes hold of God's power to obey Him.
  - Presumption expects God's power to sustain us while we disobey Him.
- **Venturing Without a Warrant:**
  - It is "venturing beyond due bounds."
  - The spiritual "bounds" are God’s commandments and Scripture.
  - **Isaiah 8:20** – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”
- **Self-Confidence vs. Christ:**
  - True faith relies wholly on Christ’s righteousness.
  - Presumption relies on human reasoning or feeling, assuming God is too "merciful" to punish willful sin.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Man on the Cliff:**
  - **Faith** is stepping onto a bridge that the architect has promised is safe.
  - **Presumption** is jumping off a cliff into thin air, hoping the architect will catch you before you hit the bottom—even though he warned you not to jump.
- **Lesson:** Faith trusts the Word; presumption tests the Word.

## Slide 4 – Q2: God’s View of Presumption

- **Question:** How does God look upon presumption, as indicated by His dealing with ancient Israel?
- **Key Text:** **Numbers 15:30** – “But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Willful Rebellion)

- **Reproaching the Lord:**
  - To act "presumptuously" (Hebrew: with a "high hand") is like shaking a fist in God’s face.
  - It is calculated rejection of God’s authority, not a sin of ignorance or weakness.
- **The Sanctuary Distinction:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, sacrifices were provided for sins of ignorance (Leviticus 4).
  - Initially, there was no sacrifice for defiant, high-handed rebellion because the sinner refused repentance.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (Sanctuary & Atonement)

- **The Need for Atonement:**
  - **Hebrews 10:26** – “For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.”
  - **Atonement** is the reconciliation of God and man.
  - In the sanctuary type, the sinner transferred sin to the lamb; in the antitype (reality), we transfer sin to Christ.
- **Justification:**
  - God cannot justify (declare righteous) a person who willfully clings to rebellion.
  - **Galatians 2:17** – “But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Broken Vase:**
  - A child who accidentally breaks a vase while trying to help clean needs instruction and comfort.
  - A child who looks the parent in the eye and smashes the vase on purpose needs a change of heart (conversion).
- **Lesson:** Rebellion blocks the relationship until the heart is surrendered.

## Slide 8 – Q3: False Prophecy

- **Question:** If a prophet of old presumed to speak in the name of God that which he had not commanded, what was the result?
- **Key Text:** **Deuteronomy 18:20** – “But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **Usurping Authority:**
  - Claiming heaven’s authority for human words is treason against the divine government.
  - It leads people away from the Bible and the Law of God.
- **Modern Application:**
  - We must not attribute our own impulses, emotions, or opinions to the Holy Spirit.
  - Saying "The Lord told me" when He has not spoken is a violation of the Third Commandment (taking God's name in vain).
- **Testing the Spirits:**
  - **1 John 4:1** – “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Presumption in Battle

- **Question:** What befell the Israelites when, having reached the promised land, they attempted to fight against the Canaanites without God's consent?
- **Key Text:** **Numbers 14:44, 45** – “But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses departed not out of the camp, Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Faith vs. Works)

- **Legalism and Presumption:**
  - God said "Go up," but they refused (unbelief).
  - Later, they tried to "make up" for their sin by going up in their own strength (works).
  - They thought the act of fighting would save them, even without God’s presence.
- **The Absence of the Ark:**
  - The Ark (containing the Law and Mercy Seat) remained in the camp.
  - Any effort to conquer the enemy without the Law and the Gospel is doomed to failure.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Application (Victory in Christ)

- **Victory by Faith:**
  - Victory is not achieved by human zeal or warfare, but by abiding in Christ.
  - When we move without His Spirit, we are defeated.
- **Illustration:**
  - A soldier who refuses to march when commanded, but charges alone after the army retreats, is not brave—he is insubordinate.
  - We must move only when the Cloud (the Spirit) moves.

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Antediluvians

- **Question:** What was withdrawn from the antediluvians because they had persisted in their evil course?
- **Key Text:** **Genesis 6:3** – “And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive with man.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Probation)

- **The Striving Spirit:**
  - The Holy Spirit convinces of sin, righteousness, and judgment (**John 16:8**).
  - This is the agency of **Sanctification**: the Spirit working to restore the image of God in man.
- **The Limit of Grace:**
  - God is long-suffering, but not "forever-suffering."
  - Eventually, the conscience becomes "seared with a hot iron" (**1 Timothy 4:2**).
- **Probation:**
  - Just as the door of Noah's ark was finally shut, there is a time when the destiny of souls is fixed.
  - **Revelation 22:11** – “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still...”

## Slide 15 – Q6: The Tower of Babel

- **Question:** Of what presumptuous act were men guilty soon after the flood?
- **Key Text:** **Genesis 11:4** – “And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Self-Salvation)

- **Distrust of God's Promise:**
  - God promised no more floods (**Genesis 9:11**). Building the tower declared they did not believe Him.
- **Self-Salvation:**
  - They sought to reach heaven by their own engineering.
  - This is the spirit of Babylon: saving oneself by human merit rather than God’s provided way.
- **Self-Exaltation:**
  - Motive: "Let us make us a name."
  - Christian Motive: "Do all to the glory of God" (**1 Corinthians 10:31**).

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Ladder to the Moon:**
  - The builders were like men trying to build a ladder to the moon.
  - Human works can never bridge the gap between sinful man and a holy God.
  - Only **Christ** (Jacob’s Ladder) can bridge that gap.
  - **John 1:51** – “...Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: God and Human Unity

- **Question:** What did the Lord say of them?
- **Key Text:** **Genesis 11:6** – “And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points

- **Unity in Rebellion:**
  - Satan seeks to unite the world in confederacies of evil.
  - When men unite against God’s law, their combined presumption strengthens them in sin.
- **Divine Intervention:**
  - If left unchecked, this centralized rebellion would have erased the knowledge of God.
  - God intervened to preserve a remnant through whom the Messiah could come.

## Slide 20 – Q8: Consequences of Babel

- **Question:** What befell them in consequence of their presumption?
- **Key Text:** **Genesis 11:9** – “The Lord did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points

- **Confusion:**
  - "Babel" means confusion.
  - Presumption leads to doctrinal and moral confusion.
  - Turning away from God’s law removes the standard of order.
- **God’s Sovereignty:**
  - Man proposed to stay together; God disposed that they scatter to fill the earth.
- **End-Time Parallel:**
  - **Revelation 18** speaks of "Babylon the Great"—a final religious presumption uniting the world against God’s law. It ends in total confusion.

## Slide 22 – Q9: Nadab and Abihu

- **Question:** What befell Nadab and Abihu for their presumption in offering strange fire that the Lord had not commanded?
- **Key Text:** **Leviticus 10:1, 2** – “And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire there in, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Strange Fire)

- **Sanctuary Lesson:**
  - The fire on the altar was originally kindled by God (**Leviticus 9:24**) and was holy.
  - Nadab and Abihu used common fire of their own making ("strange fire").
- **Spiritual Meaning:**
  - **Holy Fire:** Christ’s righteousness and the Holy Spirit, making prayers acceptable.
  - **Strange Fire:** Human works, emotional excitement, or man-made doctrines.
- **Exact Obedience:**
  - God requires exact obedience. We cannot worship Him according to our own devices.

## Slide 24 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Pharmacist:**
  - If a doctor prescribes a specific life-saving medicine, but the pharmacist substitutes a mixture of his own invention because it "looks the same," the patient dies.
  - The "strange fire" is fatal presumption.
  - We must accept the Gospel cure exactly as the Great Physician prescribed it.

## Slide 25 – Q10: The Little Horn

- **Question:** How was the little horn, the papacy, to show its presumption?
- **Key Text:** **Daniel 7:25** – “And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points

- **Speaking Against the Most High:**
  - Claiming titles and prerogatives that belong only to God (e.g., forgiveness of sins, head of the church).
- **Changing Times and Laws:**
  - The ultimate presumption: attempting to edit the Ten Commandments.
  - Changing the Sabbath (Saturday) to Sunday without scriptural authority places church tradition above the Bible.
- **Impact on Salvation:**
  - Obscuring the law obscures the definition of sin.
  - If sin is obscured, the need for Christ’s justification is obscured.

## Slide 27 – Q11: The Man of Sin

- **Question:** What is this power, therefore, called by the apostle?
- **Key Text:** **2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4** – “And that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth, and exalteth himself above all that is called God.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Man of Sin:**
  - Sin is "the transgression of the law" (**1 John 3:4**).
  - This power represents lawlessness.
- **Self-Exaltation:**
  - Like Lucifer, who said, "I will be like the Most High" (**Isaiah 14:14**).
- **In the Temple:**
  - He sits in the "temple of God" (the church).
  - This is presumption *inside* Christianity, claiming God’s authority while usurping His place.

## Slide 29 – Q12: David’s Prayer

- **Question:** What does the psalmist call the sin of presumption?
- **Key Text:** **Psalm 19:13** – “Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me; then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points (Victory)

- **Dominion of Sin:**
  - Cherished sin gains dominion over the will.
  - **Romans 6:14** – “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”
  - Grace breaks the power of presumptuous sin.
- **The Great Transgression:**
  - Continued presumption leads to a hardened heart (unpardonable sin).
  - The remedy is to pray, "Keep back thy servant." We need the indwelling Christ to guard us.

## Slide 31 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Boat and the Rapids:**
  - A boat drifting on a river can be steered with a rudder.
  - If it drifts into the rapids of a waterfall (presumption), the rudder is useless.
  - We must ask God to keep us from entering the rapids in the first place.

## Slide 32 – Q13: Grieving the Spirit

- **Question:** What admonition does the apostle give concerning our course toward the truth?
- **Key Text:** **Ephesians 4:30** – “And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points (The Seal)

- **Grieving the Spirit:**
  - We grieve the Spirit when we presume on grace—sinning because we know God is forgiving.
- **The Sealing Work:**
  - The "seal" is the settling into the truth so that one cannot be moved.
  - Those who persist in presumption grieve the Spirit away and cannot be sealed.
- **True Faith:**
  - Instead of presumption, the Christian is called to "fear God, and give glory to him" (**Revelation 14:7**).
  - True faith works by love, purifies the soul, and leads to obedience.
