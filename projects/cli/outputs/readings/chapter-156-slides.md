## Slide 1 – Q1: Justification by Faith
- **Question:** By what are men justified?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Justification)
- **Definition of Justification:**
  - It is the legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is righteous.
  - It is an act of free grace, not human merit (Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”).
  - It is not merely overlooking sin; the penalty was paid by Christ at the Altar of Sacrifice (the cross).
- **The Role of Faith:**
  - Faith is the hand that grasps the gift; it is not a meritorious work.
  - We are justified *by* faith, connecting our weakness to God’s strength (Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith”).
- **The Result:**
  - Peace with God. Justification removes the guilt and enmity that separates us from the Father.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Paid Debt:**
  - Imagine a man with a debt of millions he can never repay, facing imprisonment.
  - A wealthy friend pays the entire debt and presents the receipt to the judge.
  - The judge declares the debtor “free and clear.”
  - The man did not earn his freedom; he simply accepted the payment.
  - **Lesson:** Christ paid our debt; by faith, we accept His payment and go free.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Living by Faith
- **Question:** Then how are the just to live?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:38 – “Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Sanctification & Sanctuary)
- **From Justification to Sanctification:**
  - Faith is not just for the start; it sustains the whole life (Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me...” ).
  - This is **Sanctification**: drawing life from Christ to bear the fruit of obedience.
- **The Sanctuary Walk:**
  - To “draw back” is to return to unbelief (Egypt).
  - Having entered the courtyard (Justification at the cross), we must press into the Holy Place of daily communion.
  - We must possess the “faith of Jesus” that endures to the end (Revelation 14:12).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Deep-Sea Diver:**
  - A diver relies on an air hose connected to the surface for life.
  - As long as he stays connected, he lives and works in the depths.
  - If he disconnects to survive on his own, he perishes.
  - **Lesson:** Faith is the connecting hose. We must breathe through it every moment to live the life of Christ.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Stumbling Stone
- **Question:** Why did not Israel of old attain to the law of righteousness?
- **Key Text:** Romans 9:32 – “Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Law and Gospel)
- **Failure of Human Effort:**
  - Israel tried to achieve righteousness by their own strength (the Old Covenant experience).
  - A sinner cannot produce perfect obedience from a selfish heart (Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be”).
- **The Way of Faith:**
  - True obedience is the *fruit* of faith, not the *root* of salvation.
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** Christ lives His perfect obedience *in* us.
  - We do not abolish the law by faith; we establish it (Romans 3:31).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Elevator:**
  - Imagine a man trying to reach a roof by pulling on his own shoelaces. No matter how hard he strains, he stays on the ground.
  - Faith is like stepping into an elevator.
  - The power of the elevator lifts the man to the top.
  - **Lesson:** Human effort cannot reach the standard of the law; we must rely on the power of Christ to lift us.

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Sin of Faithlessness
- **Question:** When one told Christ of the disciples' failure to heal his afflicted son, what did He say of that generation?
- **Key Text:** Mark 9:19 – “He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points
- **Powerlessness and Unbelief:**
  - Spiritual powerlessness is directly linked to a lack of faith.
  - Unbelief insulates us from God's omnipotence.
- **The Grief of Christ:**
  - Jesus asks, "How long shall I suffer you?"
  - It burdens Christ when His people live as orphans, powerless against the enemy, when He has provided victory.
- **The Remedy:**
  - "Bring him unto Me." When human effort fails, we must go to the High Priest who feels our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15).

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: Believing Without Seeing
- **Question:** What did the Saviour say to Thomas when He met him, because he did not believe the testimony of his brethren that had seen Christ alive after His crucifixion?
- **Key Text:** John 20:27 – “Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points
- **Faith vs. Sight:**
  - Thomas demanded sensory proof, but Jesus calls us to a higher level: "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed" (John 20:29).
- **The Choice of Will:**
  - "Be not faithless" implies that faith is a choice. We can choose to trust God's Word or choose to doubt.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Application (The Sanctuary)
- **Relevance to the Last Days:**
  - We live in the time of the investigative judgment.
  - We cannot see Christ physically in the Most Holy Place, but we must believe He is there based on Scripture.
  - Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Surgeon:**
  - A patient trusts a surgeon for a life-saving operation based on reputation, without seeing the surgery happen.
  - If the patient refused anesthesia until he could "see" the work, he would die.
  - **Lesson:** We must trust the Great Physician based on His Word, even when we cannot see Him working.

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: Running the Race
- **Question:** In view of the great cloud of witnesses of faith presented by the apostle in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, what does Paul exhort all to do?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 12:1 – “Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points
- **The Besetting Sin:**
  - In context, the sin that "easily besets" is **unbelief**.
  - Unbelief cuts the nerve of spiritual power and leads to other sins.
- **Laying Aside Weights:**
  - Weights are hindrances—worldly cares or habits—that slow our progress.
  - In the antitypical Day of Atonement, we must "afflict our souls" and put away everything separating us from God.
- **Patience:**
  - The Christian life is a marathon requiring endurance, looking unto Jesus (Hebrews 12:2).

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Olympic Runner:**
  - A runner wears the lightest clothing possible; he never runs with a heavy coat (weights).
  - If a rope were tangled around his feet (the besetting sin), he would fall.
  - **Lesson:** To win the race, we must cast off the heavy coat of worldliness and untangle the rope of unbelief.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: Barred by Unbelief
- **Question:** Why were most of the children of Israel prohibited from entering the promised land?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 3:18, 19 – “And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points
- **Tragedy at Kadesh-Barnea:**
  - Israel looked at the giants and walled cities rather than God's promise.
  - They trusted their eyes more than God's Word.
- **Typological Application:**
  - As Adventists, we stand on the borders of the Heavenly Canaan.
  - If we doubt God's power to give us victory over sin, we may repeat their history.
  - Unbelief locks the door to heaven, which is a place of perfect trust.

---

## Slide 21 – Q8: Grieving God
- **Question:** How was their unbelief regarded, and how did it affect God?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 3:17 – “But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points
- **Grieving the Spirit:**
  - God is a personal Being; our unbelief grieves Him (Psalm 78:40 – “How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!”).
  - Unbelief accuses God of being a liar and insults His love.
- **Unbelief is the Mother of Sin:**
  - The text equates "them that believed not" with "them that had sinned."
  - When we stop trusting God to satisfy and protect us, we turn to sin to satisfy ourselves.

---

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Lesson for Us
- **Question:** What lesson does the apostle exhort us to draw from the course of the Israelites?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 4:1 – “Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points
- **A Holy Fear:**
  - Not a fear of God's anger, but a caution against our own deceitful hearts.
  - "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall" (1 Corinthians 10:12).
- **Entering His Rest:**
  - The promise remains open for us today.
  - We enter this rest by ceasing from our own works (legalism) and trusting fully in the finished work of Christ (Hebrews 4:10).

---

## Slide 25 – Q10: The Labor of Faith
- **Question:** What should we all labor to do?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 4:11 – “Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points
- **The Paradox:**
  - We must "labor" to enter "rest."
  - This is not working to earn salvation, but the effort required to maintain faith and surrender the will.
- **The Fight of Faith:**
  - 1 Timothy 6:12 – “Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.”
  - The labor is to deny self, resist the devil, and let Jesus reign.

## Slide 27 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Raging River:**
  - A man in a strong current must labor to hold onto a lifeline thrown to him.
  - His effort doesn't save him—the rope and rescuer do.
  - But he must use all his energy to hold on against the current.
  - **Lesson:** This holding on is the "labor" of faith.

---

## Slide 28 – Q11: Enduring Chastisement
- **Question:** Should one lose heart when trying to be a Christian, even though he feels that God is chastising him?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 12:5 – “And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Key Points
- **Understanding Chastisement:**
  - It is discipline and training to refine character, not punishment to inflict pain.
- **Two Wrong Reactions:**
  1. **Despising:** Resenting the trial or becoming hard-hearted.
  2. **Fainting:** Giving up in despair.
- **Encouragement:**
  - Correction is proof that God is still working on us; He has not rejected us.

---

## Slide 30 – Q12: The Badge of Love
- **Question:** Who are they that seem to have the greatest amount of affliction?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 12:6 – “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.”

## Slide 31 – Q12: Key Points
- **Evidence of Sonship:**
  - Affliction is a sign of love, not hatred.
  - "Scourging" implies deep trials necessary to break pride or separate us from sin.
- **Preparation for Heaven:**
  - God acts as a Refiner.
  - Malachi 3:3 – “And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi...”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Illustration
- **The Sculptor:**
  - A sculptor strikes a block of marble with hard blows.
  - If the marble could speak, it might ask, "Why are you hurting me?"
  - The sculptor replies, "I am releasing the statue hidden inside."
  - **Lesson:** God is the sculptor; we are the marble.

---

## Slide 33 – Q13: The Danger of Ease
- **Question:** If one has no chastisement to bear, how may he regard himself?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 12:8 – “But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.”

## Slide 34 – Q13: Key Points
- **Illegitimate Children:**
  - To live in sin without correction from God is a terrifying sign.
  - It suggests one is not truly born of God.
- **Embracing Discipline:**
  - Instead of complaining, we should rejoice that God considers us His children and is investing in our eternal future.

---

## Slide 35 – Q14: The Divine Possibility
- **Question:** When the disciples became almost discouraged at one of Christ's sayings, and asked, "Who then can be saved?" What answer did Christ make?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 19:26 – “But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points
- **Impossibility of Self-Change:**
  - We cannot change our own hearts or produce righteousness.
  - Jeremiah 13:23 – “Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - "With God all things are possible."
  - God can make a selfish heart loving and a defiled life holy.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the cleansing of the sanctuary, God proposes to blot out the very presence of sin from His people's hearts.

---

## Slide 37 – Q15: Abraham’s Faith
- **Question:** When God made a promise to Abraham that it seemed almost impossible to fulfill, how did the patriarch receive it?
- **Key Text:** Romans 4:20 – “He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.”

## Slide 38 – Q15: Key Points
- **Faith Against Circumstances:**
  - Biologically, it was impossible for Abraham (100) and Sarah (90) to have a son.
  - Abraham did not look at his dead body; he looked at the Creator's promise.
- **Giving Glory to God:**
  - Faith gives glory to God by acknowledging His power.
  - **The 144,000:** This mirrors the experience of the remnant (Revelation 14:12) who stand firm when all earthly support is cut off.

## Slide 39 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Steady Hand:**
  - If you hold a full cup with a trembling hand, it spills (staggering).
  - Abraham held the cup of God’s promise with a steady hand.
  - He did this even though everything around him said the cup should be empty.

---

## Slide 40 – Q16: Imputed Righteousness
- **Question:** For what was Abraham's faith under these circumstances counted?
- **Key Text:** Romans 4:3 – “For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.”

## Slide 41 – Q16: Key Points
- **Justification by Faith:**
  - Abraham had no merit of his own in this situation; he simply believed.
  - God "counted" (imputed) that faith as righteousness.
- **The Great Exchange:**
  - Faith is not a "work" that earns a reward; it is the reception of God's work.
  - Christ takes our sin; we take His righteousness. This happens solely through faith.

---

## Slide 42 – Q17: Help for Unbelief
- **Question:** What should be the burden of one's prayer, who is troubled with unbelief?
- **Key Text:** Mark 9:24 – “And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.”

## Slide 43 – Q17: Key Points
- **Honesty in Prayer:**
  - The father confessed both his faith ("I believe") and his doubt ("help mine unbelief").
  - He did not hide his struggle from Jesus.
- **Faith is a Gift:**
  - We cannot manufacture faith; we must ask for it.
  - Romans 10:17 – “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”

---

## Slide 44 – Q18: Believing You Receive
- **Question:** What do the Scriptures say of him who believes that he receives the things for which he asks?
- **Key Text:** Mark 11:24 – “Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points
- **The Prayer of Faith:**
  - We must believe we *receive* (present tense) the answer by faith before we see the answer in fact.
- **Conditions:**
  - We must pray according to God's will (1 John 5:14) and cherish no known sin (Psalm 66:18).
- **Application:**
  - Praying for victory? Believe Christ *is* giving it to you now.
  - Praying for forgiveness? Believe you *are* forgiven (1 John 1:9). This is how the just live by faith.
