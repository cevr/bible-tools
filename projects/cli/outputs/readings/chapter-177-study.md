### Q1. Does God want Christians to overcome evil in their lives?

"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good." Romans 12:21.

**Answer:**
Yes, God’s plan for the believer is not merely forgiveness of past sins, but a complete victory over the power of sin in the present life. This is the essence of the gospel: saving man *from* his sins, not *in* them (Matthew 1:21).

1.  **The Nature of the Conflict:** The Christian life is described as a warfare. Evil is not only an external force in the world but an internal tendency in the fallen nature. To "overcome" means to subdue, conquer, and prevail against these tendencies through the power of the Holy Spirit.
2.  **The Method of Victory:** Paul instructs us to overcome evil "with good." We cannot drive out darkness with more darkness; we must turn on the light. We do not overcome sin by merely fighting it with human willpower, but by filling the mind and life with the righteousness of Christ (Philippians 4:8).
3.  **Sanctification:** This process is called *sanctification*.
    *   *Definition:* **Sanctification** is the work of God’s grace by which the believer is progressively cleansed from sin and renewed in the image of God, resulting in obedience to His law (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23).
4.  **No Compromise:** God does not want us to be "overcome" or defeated. A defeated Christian misrepresents the power of the Cross. God provides power to resist every temptation (1 Corinthians 10:13).

[ILL] **The Empty Vessel:** You cannot empty a glass of air by trying to scoop the air out with a spoon. But if you pour water into the glass, the air is displaced automatically. Likewise, we cannot overcome evil merely by trying hard not to sin. We must be filled with the "water of life"—the Spirit of Christ—and the evil is displaced by His good.

### Q2. What only can overcome the world?

"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world." 1 John 5:4.

**Answer:**
Victory is not a result of human discipline alone; it is the result of a new nature.

1.  **The Source of Power:** The text says "whatsoever is born of God." The natural human heart is "enmity against God" (Romans 8:7) and cannot of itself overcome the world. To gain the victory, one must undergo the **New Birth** (John 3:3–5).
2.  **The World:** The verse defines the enemy as "the world." This refers to the principles of selfishness, pride, and rebellion that govern fallen society (1 John 2:16).
3.  **A Change of Nature:** When a person is born again, they receive a new principle of life from above. This new life is the life of Christ Himself imparted to the believer. Because Christ has already overcome the world (John 16:33), those who possess His life share in His victory.

[ILL] **The Submarine:** A submarine can remain submerged in the crushing depths of the ocean without collapsing because the pressure inside the sub is equal to or greater than the pressure outside. Similarly, a Christian lives in a crushing world of sin. We do not collapse under the pressure of the world only if the power of the Holy Spirit *inside* us is greater than the pressure *outside*.

### Q3. What special quality is needed in order to succeed in our efforts to overcome?

"And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." 1 John 5:4.

**Answer:**
The instrument that connects us to the power of God is **faith**.

1.  **Righteousness by Faith:** This is the heart of the message of Righteousness by Faith. We do not fight the battle alone; we trust in the victory Christ has already won.
    *   *Justification:* Faith lays hold of Christ’s merits to cover our past failures (Romans 3:24-26).
    *   *Sanctification:* Faith lays hold of Christ’s power to keep us from falling in the present (Jude 24).
2.  **Not Mere Mental Assent:** This faith is not just believing that God exists. It is a transaction—an entire surrender of the will to God, taking Him at His word, and claiming His promises as reality.
3.  **The Transfer of Battles:** By faith, we hand the battle over to the Lord. As it was with Jehoshaphat, "The battle is not yours, but God's" (2 Chronicles 20:15). When we attempt to overcome sin by our own strength, we fail. When we trust Christ to live His life in us, we succeed (Galatians 2:20).

[ILL] **The Drowning Man:** A drowning man cannot save himself by pulling on his own hair. He must stop struggling and trust the lifeguard to carry him. In the battle against sin, "faith" is the act of reaching out and holding tight to the Savior, allowing His strength to pull us through the waves of temptation.

***

### Q4. What promises are made by Christ to the overcomer?

1. "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God." Revelation 2:7.
2. "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death." Verse 11.
3. "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it." Verse 17.
4. "He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of My Father. And I will give him the morning star." Verses 26-28.
5. "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels." Rev. 3:5.
6. "Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from My God: and I will write upon him My new name." Verse 12.
7. "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne." Verse 21.

**Answer:**
Jesus gives seven magnificent promises to the seven churches, outlining the reward of the faithful. Notice the progression and the connection to the Sanctuary and the restored Kingdom:

1.  **Restoration of Life (Tree of Life):** Adam lost access to the tree through disobedience; the overcomer regains it through the obedience of faith.
2.  **Immunity from Destruction (Second Death):** The "second death" is the final, total annihilation of sin and sinners in the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14). The overcomer has no fear of this judgment.
3.  **Spiritual Sustenance (Hidden Manna):** This refers to the manna in the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place—symbolizing Christ as the secret source of our spiritual life. The **White Stone** was an ancient token of acquittal in a court of law; we are declared "Not Guilty."
4.  **Authority (Rod of Iron/Morning Star):** The saints will share in Christ's reign. They will judge the world (1 Corinthians 6:2).
5.  **Purity and Security (White Raiment/Book of Life):**
    *   *White Raiment:* The righteousness of Christ (imputed and imparted).
    *   *Book of Life:* This points to the **Investigative Judgment**. While some names are blotted out due to unrepentant sin, the overcomer’s name is retained and confessed by Jesus before the Father.
6.  **Permanence (Pillar in the Temple):** A pillar supports the structure and is rarely moved. This indicates an eternal, fixed state of holiness. They will "go no more out"—their wandering is over.
7.  **Exaltation (Sit on the Throne):** The highest promise is fellowship. We do not just serve *before* the throne; we sit *with* Him on it.

[ILL] **The Victor's Crown:** In ancient athletic games, the winner received a fading wreath of laurel leaves. Christ offers us the "crown of life." But unlike the athlete who wins by his own strength, the Christian wins by depending entirely on the Coach (Christ).

***

### Q5. In what one promise are all of these promises to the overcomers summarized?

"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My son." Rev. 21:7.

**Answer:**
This single verse encompasses the entire plan of redemption.

1.  **Inheritance:** "All things." We become joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17). The earth made new, the universe, and the presence of God belong to the redeemed.
2.  **Relationship:** "I will be his God, and he shall be My son." This is the Covenant formula (Hebrews 8:10). The ultimate goal of salvation is not just a location (heaven), but a relationship (Father and son/daughter).
3.  **Restoration of Character:** To be a "son" implies possessing the character of the Father. The overcomer reflects the family likeness—the character of God (love, justice, and holiness).

***

### Q6. What new name was given to Jacob?

"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." Gen. 32:28.

**Answer:**
1.  **Jacob:** The name meant "Supplanter" or "Deceiver," reflecting his character when he used deception to gain the birthright.
2.  **Israel:** This name means "Prince with God" or "One who wrestles with God."
3.  **The Context of Victory:** This name change occurred after Jacob wrestled with the Angel (Christ) all night. He admitted his sin, refused to let go without a blessing, and prevailed. This represents the experience of the "Time of Trouble" where God's people must struggle in prayer, claiming God's promises until they are settled in the faith.

***

### Q7. What group of people later were called by that name?

"Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt: ...Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher ...Joseph." Ex. 1:1-5. Abraham, were known as the twelve tribes of Israel.

**Answer:**
The literal descendants of Jacob—the twelve tribes—inherited this title. They were called to be a "kingdom of priests" (Exodus 19:6), a distinct nation chosen to preserve the knowledge of the true God amidst a world of idolatry.

***

### Q8. What special blessings were conferred upon the Israelites?

"Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all." Rom. 9:4, 5.

**Answer:**
Paul lists the immense spiritual advantages given to the Hebrew nation:
1.  **The Glory:** The Shekinah presence of God in the Sanctuary.
2.  **The Covenants:** The agreements God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
3.  **The Law:** The Ten Commandments, the transcript of God's character.
4.  **The Service:** The Sanctuary service (sacrifices and priesthood) which illustrated the plan of salvation and the work of the coming Messiah.
5.  **The Lineage of Christ:** Their greatest honor was that the Messiah was born through their bloodline.

***

### Q9. Who constitutes the true Israel of God, the seed of Abraham?

"They are not all Israel, which are of Israel: neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed." Verses 6-8.

**Answer:**
Here is a fundamental New Testament teaching: **Spiritual Israel takes precedence over physical lineage.**

1.  **Not by Blood:** Paul argues that simply having Abraham’s DNA does not make one a true "Israelite" in God's eyes.
2.  **Children of Promise:** Just as Ishmael (born of the flesh/human effort) was not the heir, but Isaac (born of the promise/miracle) was, so today, God’s people are those born of the Spirit, regardless of their ethnic background.
3.  **The Definition:** A true Israelite is an overcomer—one who has the spiritual experience of Jacob, not just his physical genes.

***

### Q10. Speaking to the Pharisees and Sadducees, what did John the Baptist have to say about this?

"And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham." Matt. 3:9.

**Answer:**
John the Baptist attacked the false security of the religious leaders.
1.  **False Security:** They believed their genealogy guaranteed them salvation.
2.  **God's Sovereignty:** John declared that God could create spiritual children from "stones"—likely pointing to the stony-hearted Gentiles who were considered lifeless by the Jews.
3.  **Lesson:** We must not rely on our church membership, our parents' faith, or our heritage for salvation. We must have a living, personal connection with God.

***

### Q11. What is it that decides whether or not a person is a child of Abraham?

"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham." Gal. 3:7.

**Answer:**
**Faith** is the deciding factor.
1.  **Abraham's Example:** Abraham "believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness" (Galatians 3:6).
2.  **The Spiritual DNA:** Those who trust God's word, who are justified by faith, and who obey God's call are the true spiritual descendants of the patriarch. This opens the door of "Israel" to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.

***

### Q12. To whom must one belong in order to be Abraham's seed?

"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Verse 29.

**Answer:**
This is the climax of the argument regarding Israel.
1.  **The One Seed:** Galatians 3:16 explains that the promises were made to Abraham's "Seed" (singular), which is **Christ**.
2.  **Union with Christ:** Since Jesus is the only true Heir, we can only become heirs by being *in Him*.
3.  **The Conclusion:** If a Gentile accepts Christ, they are spiritually grafted into Abraham. If a biological Jew rejects Christ, they cut themselves off from the covenant. Christ is the center; He defines the true Israel.

[ILL] **The Passport:** Imagine a special country that grants citizenship only to one Man—the King's Son. However, anyone who marries the Son automatically gains citizenship. We are the "Bride of Christ." By our union with Him, we gain His passport to the heavenly Canaan.

***

### Q13. In what passage of Scripture are the believers in Christ called "Israel"?

"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God." Galatians 6:16.

**Answer:**
Paul here bestows the title "Israel of God" upon the church—those who walk according to the rule of the "new creature" (v. 15). This confirms that in the New Testament era, the church (comprising believing Jews and Gentiles) acts as God's appointed agency, continuing the spiritual heritage of ancient Israel.

***

### Q14. To whom is the gospel the power of God unto salvation?

"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek." Rom. 1:16.

**Answer:**
1.  **Universal Scope:** The gospel is for "everyone that believeth."
2.  **Order of History:** "To the Jew first." This acknowledges the historical priority God gave to the Jewish nation as the custodians of His law and the birthplace of the Messiah.
3.  **Equality of Need:** Both Jew and Greek (Gentile) are saved in the exact same way: by the power of God through faith in Jesus Christ. There are not two plans of salvation.

***

### Q15. To what group did Jesus first send the disciples?

"These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." Matt. 10:5, 6.

**Answer:**
During Christ’s earthly ministry, the focus was exclusively on literal Israel.
1.  **Covenant Fulfillment:** God was giving the Jewish nation every final opportunity to accept their King and fulfill their destiny as the light of the world.
2.  **The Probationary Period:** This aligns with the "70 weeks" prophecy of Daniel 9, where the covenant was to be confirmed with many for one week (seven years) ending in A.D. 34 with the stoning of Stephen.

***

### Q16. While eating dinner with Zachaeus, what did Christ tell him?

"This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham." Luke 19:9.

**Answer:**
Zacchaeus was a tax collector, despised by his fellow Jews as a traitor. Yet, when he exercised faith and repented (demonstrated by making restitution), Jesus declared him a "son of Abraham." This proves that being a true son of Abraham is a matter of **character and faith**, not just social standing or birth.

***

### Q17. When the Jews rejected Paul's preaching of Christ, what did Paul and Barnabas reply?

"Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles." Acts 13:46.

**Answer:**
1.  **The Tragedy:** The religious leaders judged themselves "unworthy of everlasting life" by rejecting the Source of life.
2.  **The Pivot:** This marks a major turning point in Acts. Because the official leadership of the nation rejected the Gospel, the apostles turned to the Gentiles.
3.  **God's Purpose Continues:** The failure of the literal nation did not stop God's plan; it merely shifted the location of His "Israel" to the multi-ethnic body of believers who would accept the Messiah.

***

### Q18. What illustration is given to describe the coming of the Gentiles (non-Jews) into the true Israel of God?

"And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the branches." Rom. 11:17, 18.

**Answer:**
The **Olive Tree** represents the covenant people of God.
1.  **The Root:** The patriarchs and the covenant promises, ultimately Christ.
2.  **Natural Branches:** The Jewish people. Some were broken off due to unbelief.
3.  **Wild Olive Shoots:** The Gentiles.
4.  **Grafting:** A gardening process where a branch from one tree is inserted into another. The Gentile believers are grafted *into* the stock of Israel. They do not replace the tree; they join it. They drink from the same "root and fatness" (the spiritual promises given to Abraham).

[ILL] **The Graft:** A gardener takes a wild branch and splices it into a cultivated stock. The branch drops its old nature and produces the fruit of the cultivated tree. So we, by faith, drop our "wild" nature of sin and produce the "fruit of the Spirit" by drawing life from Christ, the Root.

***

### Q19. Lest the Gentile grafts should boast, saying that the Jews were broken off to let them come in, what warning is given to them?

"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high minded but fear: for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee." Verse 20-21.

**Answer:**
This is a solemn warning against **spiritual pride** (Presumption).
1.  **No Superiority:** Gentiles are not superior to Jews.
2.  **The Condition:** We stand only by "faith." If a Christian ceases to trust and obey (faith), they can be broken off just as surely as the unbelieving Jews were.
3.  **The Principle:** God has no favorites. He deals with all based on their relationship to His Son.

***

### Q20. Is it possible for members of the Jewish race to return to the vine?

"And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again." Verse 23.

**Answer:**
Yes. The rejection of the Jewish nation as a theocratic political entity does not mean individual Jews cannot be saved.
1.  **The Door is Open:** If they turn from unbelief and accept Jesus as Messiah, they are grafted back into their own olive tree.
2.  **God's Desire:** God longs for their salvation. In the last days, many from Jewish heritage will find their true Messiah and join the remnant church.

***

### Q21. Before the Gentiles became Israelites, what was their condition?

"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles ...at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world." Eph. 2:11, 12.

**Answer:**
This verse describes the hopeless state of humanity without the gospel.
*   **Without Christ:** The ultimate loss.
*   **Aliens:** Foreigners with no citizenship rights in God's kingdom.
*   **No Hope:** No assurance of resurrection or eternal life.
*   **Without God:** Spiritual orphans.
The gospel reverses all of this, making us "fellow citizens with the saints" (Ephesians 2:19).

***

### Q22. How are God's remnant, last-day people described?

"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Revelation 14:12.

**Answer:**
This is the description of the final "Israel of God" before Christ returns. They possess two distinct characteristics:
1.  **The Commandments of God:** They have been sanctified to the point of obedience. The law of God is written on their hearts (Hebrews 8:10). They do not keep the law *to be* saved, but because they *are* saved and love the Lawgiver.
2.  **The Faith of Jesus:** Not just faith *in* Jesus, but the *faith of* Jesus. They possess the same quality of trust and dependence on the Father that Jesus had during His earthly life. This faith carries them through the final crisis.

***

### Q23. Whose names are written in the foundations of the Holy City?

"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb." Revelation 21:14.

**Answer:**
The New Jerusalem rests on the foundation of the New Testament gospel, preached by the **Twelve Apostles**. This signifies that the church is built upon the "foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone" (Ephesians 2:20).

***

### Q24. Whose names are written on the twelve gates of that city?

"And [the wall] had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel." Verse 12.

**Answer:**
The gates bear the names of the **Twelve Tribes**.
1.  **Unity of the Saved:** The city brings together the Old and New Dispensations. The Apostles (foundations) and the Tribes (gates) are united in one structure.
2.  **Spiritual Entry:** To enter the city, one must pass through a gate named after one of the tribes. This implies that all the saved are reckoned as part of the spiritual "commonwealth of Israel." Whether Jew or Gentile by birth, we enter as part of the Israel of God.

***

### Q25. Who will walk in the light of the city?

"And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it." Verse 24.

**Answer:**
The "nations of them which are saved" refers to the redeemed from all ages—the true Overcomers.
1.  **The Fulfillment:** The promise to Abraham—that he would be the father of many nations—is finally realized here.
2.  **The Glory:** All earthly distinctions are gone. There is one fold and one Shepherd (John 10:16). The subjects of the Kingdom are those who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 7:14).

[ILL] **The Prism:** A prism takes white light and breaks it into many colors. Humanity is broken into many races and nations ("colors"). But in the New Jerusalem, all these distinct people are gathered back into the pure white light of God's presence, united in Christ.
