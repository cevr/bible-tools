## Slide 1 – Title
- **Bible Study: Change of the Sabbath**
- Examining History and Prophecy regarding God’s Law.
- The Distinction between Divine Command and Human Tradition.

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: Christ and the Law
- **Question:** According to the prophet, what was to be Christ's attitude toward His Father's law?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 42:21 – “The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the law, and make it honorable.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Magnifying the Law
- **The Mission of the Messiah:**
  - Christ did not come to abolish the law.
  - He came to "magnify" it—revealing its spiritual depth and binding nature.
- **God’s Character:**
  - The law is a transcript of God's character.
  - Since God is love (1 John 4:8) and righteous, His law is the standard of love and righteousness.
- **Magnifying vs. Changing:**
  - Magnifying a lens does not change the object; it reveals details.
  - In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus showed the law applies to thoughts and intents, not just actions (Matthew 5:21–22).

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **"For His Righteousness' Sake":**
  - We have broken the law and are under condemnation.
  - **Justification:** Christ lived a perfect life of obedience to provide *imputed righteousness* to the repentant sinner.
  - **Sanctification:** Through the New Covenant, Christ writes the magnified law in our hearts.
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”

---

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Map and the Master Guide:**
  - Imagine a detailed map leading to a safe haven, covered in dust and misunderstood over time.
  - A Master Guide arrives, not to tear up the map, but to clean it and shine a light on it.
  - **Lesson:** Christ did not destroy the moral map (the Law); He shone the light of the Gospel upon it so we could clearly see the path of righteousness.

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Law’s Permanence
- **Question:** How much of the law did He uphold?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:18 – “For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Doctrinal Points
- **Immutability:**
  - As long as "heaven and earth" exist, God's moral definition of right and wrong remains.
  - The Cross established the law rather than voiding it (Romans 3:31).
- **"Jot and Tittle":**
  - The "jot" was the smallest Hebrew letter; the "tittle" was a tiny stroke distinguishing letters.
  - Not even the smallest mark—including the Sabbath—was to be changed.
- **Standard of Judgment:**
  - We are measured by this law in the judgment, met only through faith in Christ.
  - **Key Text:** James 2:12 – “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q2: Distinctions
- **Moral Law:**
  - The Ten Commandments.
  - Defines duty to God and neighbor; eternal.
- **Ceremonial Law:**
  - Laws regarding sacrifices and feast days.
  - Pointed to Christ as types and shadows.
  - **Key Text:** Colossians 2:14 – “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Warning Against Lawlessness
- **Question:** How were those to be regarded who should break one of these commandments?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:19 – “Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be least in the kingdom of heaven.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Unity of the Law
- **A Cohesive Whole:**
  - To attack one commandment is to attack the Authority of the Lawgiver.
  - **Key Text:** James 2:10 – “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.”
- **Danger of False Teaching:**
  - It is dangerous to sin out of weakness.
  - It is far worse to establish a *doctrine* teaching others to ignore God's requirements (e.g., claiming the Sabbath is "done away").
- **True Greatness:**
  - Measured by humility and obedience born of love.

---

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Chain of Ten Links:**
  - If a man hangs by a chain over a cliff, how many links must break for him to fall?
  - Only one.
  - It does not matter if nine links are strong; if the "least" link breaks, the connection is severed.
  - **Lesson:** Breaking the Sabbath severs the connection of obedience just as surely as theft or idolatry.

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Foundation of Love
- **Question:** How much of the law did Christ say is suspended on the two great commandments of love?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 22:40 – “On these two commandments hang ALL the law and the prophets.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Explaining the "Hanging"
- **Structure of the Decalogue:**
  - **First Great Commandment:** Love to God (Summarizes the first 4 commandments).
  - **Second Great Commandment:** Love to neighbor (Summarizes the last 6 commandments).
- **Support, Not Replacement:**
  - A coat hangs on a hook; the hook supports the coat, it does not replace it.
  - We cannot claim to love God (the principle) while breaking His specific instructions on *how* to love Him (e.g., the Sabbath).
- **Fulfillment:**
  - **Key Text:** Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Prophecy of Change
- **Question:** What is said of the power represented by the "little horn?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Identifying the Power
- **The Little Horn:**
  - Arises from the fourth beast (Rome).
  - A religious-political power persecuting God's people during the Dark Ages.
  - Identified historically as the Papacy (the Roman Church system).
- **"Think to Change":**
  - No power can actually change God's eternal law.
  - This power presumes the authority to alter it in human practice.
- **Specific Changes:**
  - **Laws:** Removal of the second commandment (idolatry) in catechisms.
  - **Times:** The Sabbath (the only commandment dealing with time).

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Claim of Authority
- **Question:** What power claims authority to change God's law?
- **Answer:** The Roman Church.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: Tradition vs. Scripture
- **The Protestant Dilemma:**
  - Protestants claim *Sola Scriptura* (Bible Only).
  - The Roman Church argues that keeping Sunday is an acknowledgment of Church authority, as the Bible commands the seventh day.
- **The Mark of Authority:**
  - God’s sign is the Sabbath (Ezekiel 20:12, 20).
  - The Church’s admitted mark of authority is the institution of Sunday.

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration
- **The King and the Governor:**
  - If a King issues a decree, but a governor changes it and enforces his own version, whom do the subjects obey?
  - Those who obey the governor pay homage to the governor, not the King.
  - **Lesson:** Keeping a day established by tradition while neglecting God's command pays homage to the power that made the change.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Target of Change
- **Question:** What part of the law has this power thought to change?
- **Answer:** The fourth commandment.

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: The Seal of God
- **The Sabbath as a Seal:**
  - A seal must contain three elements:
    1.  **Name:** The Lord thy God.
    2.  **Title:** Creator/Maker.
    3.  **Territory:** Heaven and Earth.
  - Only the Fourth Commandment contains all three.
- **Consequences:**
  - Removing the Sabbath removes the "seal" of the living God from His law.
  - It obscures the memorial of Creation and opens the door to idolatry.

---

## Slide 21 – Q8: The First Sunday Law
- **Question:** Who first enjoined Sunday keeping by law?
- **Answer:** Constantine the Great.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: Historical Context (A.D. 321)
- **Political Compromise:**
  - Constantine sought to unite his empire, divided between pagans and Christians.
  - He chose the "day of the sun" as a vehicle for unity.
- **No Biblical Basis:**
  - This was a civil edict, not a divine command.
  - There is no record of Christ or the apostles seeking civil laws to enforce worship.

---

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Wording of the Edict
- **Question:** What did Constantine's law require?
- **Quote:** “Let all the judges and town people, and the occupation of all trades rest on the venerable day of the sun...”

---

## Slide 24 – Q9: Analyzing the Edict
- **Pagan Terminology:**
  - Called "the venerable day of the sun" (*Dies Solis*), not "the Sabbath" or "Lord's Day."
  - Constantine was a devotee of the Sun god (*Sol Invictus*).
- **Partial Rest:**
  - Agricultural work was allowed to continue.
  - Based on economic expediency, not the sacredness of the Decalogue.
- **Infiltration:**
  - This paved the way for the church to "baptize" a pagan festival.

---

## Slide 25 – Q10: Ecclesiastical Enforcement
- **Question:** When and by what authority was Sunday first enjoined upon Christians as the Lord's day?
- **Quote (Prynne):** “The Council of Laodicea [364 A.D.]... first settled the observation of the Lord's day.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q10: The Council of Laodicea
- **The Decree:**
  - Christians were commanded not to "Judaize" (keep the Sabbath) but to work on Saturday and honor Sunday.
- **The Curse:**
  - An "anathema" was pronounced on those who rested on the Bible Sabbath.
- **Fulfillment of Prophecy:**
  - A power "thinking to change times and laws."
  - Men presuming to override the finger of God written on stone.

---

## Slide 27 – Q11: Catholic Admission
- **Question:** But do Catholics themselves acknowledge their meddling with the Sabbath Commandment?
- **Answer:** They do.

---

## Slide 28 – Q11: The Open Admission
- **Catechisms:**
  - Catholic teaching openly states the Church transferred solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.
- **The Challenge:**
  - The Church asks: "If you follow the Bible only, why do you keep Sunday?"
  - The admission is "a change for which there is no scriptural authority."
  - This forces a choice: The Authority of God's Word vs. The Authority of the Church.

---

## Slide 29 – Q12: Obedience is Worship
- **Question:** To whom do people really pay homage?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:16 – “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”

---

## Slide 30 – Q12: The Test of Loyalty
- **Servants of Obedience:**
  - Obedience reveals who is truly Lord of our lives.
  - If we obey a power against the plain Word of God, we acknowledge that power as master.
- **Liberty in Christ:**
  - We obey His Sabbath not to be saved, but because we are His servants, bought with a price.

---

## Slide 31 – Q12: Illustration
- **Soldier on the Battlefield:**
  - A soldier cannot wear the uniform of one army while obeying the commands of the opposing general.
  - His obedience reveals his true allegiance.
  - **Lesson:** We cannot claim to be soldiers of the Bible while obeying the "general" of tradition.

---

## Slide 32 – Q13: Vain Worship
- **Question:** What kind of worship does the Saviour call that which is not according to God's commandments?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:9 – “But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”

---

## Slide 33 – Q13: Sanctuary Application
- **"Vain" (Empty) Worship:**
  - Sincerity is not enough (e.g., Cain, Pharisees).
  - Worship must be "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24).
- **Strange Fire:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, Nadab and Abihu offered "strange fire" (Leviticus 10:1) and were destroyed.
  - Sunday sacredness is "strange fire"—a human invention offered in place of the holy time God created.

---

## Slide 34 – Q14: The Minority
- **Question:** What was the difference between Elijah's faith, and that of the other prophets of his day?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 18:22 – “Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q14: Truth vs. Majority
- **Standing Alone:**
  - Elijah stood against 450 prophets of Baal and the state religion.
  - Truth is never determined by majority vote.
- **Remnant Theology:**
  - God often works through a small remnant who keep His commandments when the majority has apostatized.
  - We must be willing to stand alone with God's Word.

---

## Slide 36 – Q15: The Identity of Baal
- **Question:** Who was the Baal of the heathen Hebrews?
- **Source:** “Baal... is regarded as a personification of the sun...” (Johnson's Universal Cyclopedia).

---

## Slide 37 – Q15: The Ancient Conflict
- **Sun Worship:**
  - Baal worship was essentially sun worship—honoring the creation rather than the Creator.
- **The Parallel:**
  - Ancient Israel mixed Yahweh worship with Baal (sun) worship.
  - The 4th-century church mixed the Gospel with the "venerable day of the sun."
  - The issue remains: Worship the Creator on His day, or follow the customs of the world?

---

## Slide 38 – Q16: The Final Appeal
- **Question:** What appeal did Elijah make to the people?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 18:21 – “And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.”

---

## Slide 39 – Q16: No Neutral Ground
- **"Halting":**
  - Means to limp or hesitate.
  - One cannot walk with one foot on truth and the other on tradition.
- **The Choice:**
  - If Jehovah is God, keep His Sabbath.
  - If Baal (or the power adopting his day) is God, keep Sunday.
  - "No man can serve two masters" (Matthew 6:24).

---

## Slide 40 – Q16: Illustration & Conclusion
- **Illustration:**
  - A car in neutral goes nowhere. You must shift into drive to move forward.
  - In spiritual life, there is no neutral ground.
- **The Call:**
  - We are living in the antitypical day of Carmel.
  - God calls us to step out of confusion and stand on the solid rock of His Word.
  - Choose this day whom you will serve.
