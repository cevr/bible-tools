## Slide 1 – Title Slide
- **Topic:** Sufferings of Christ
- **Theme:** The Atonement, The Sanctuary, and Righteousness by Faith
- **Based on:** Chapter 36 (Historic Adventist Perspective)

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Mission of Christ
- **Question:** Why did Christ come into the world?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 1:15 – “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Salvation Defined)
- **A Rescue Mission:** Christ did not come merely to set a good example, but to intervene in a desperate situation.
- **To Save, Not Excuse:**
  - His name "Jesus" means "Jehovah saves" (Matthew 1:21).
  - He saves *from* sin, not *in* sin.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Salvation involves two inseparable works:
  - **Justification:** Being saved from the *penalty* of sin (death) by Christ’s past obedience credited to us.
  - **Sanctification:** Being saved from the *power* of sin in daily life by His indwelling Spirit.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Drowning Man:**
  - Imagine a man drowning in a stormy ocean.
  - He does not need a swimming instructor shouting lessons from the shore.
  - He needs a lifeguard to jump in, pull him out, and resuscitate him.
- **Application:** We were drowning in sin. Christ jumped into the "waters" of humanity to pull us out.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Motive of God
- **Question:** What prompted God to give His Son to die for man?
- **Key Text:** John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Love and Controversy)
- **The Father’s Love:**
  - The Atonement was the *result* of the Father’s love, not a way to convince an angry God to love us.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:19 – “God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself...”
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Satan charges that God is selfish.
  - The cross demonstrates that God is love—willing to sacrifice everything to save His enemies (Romans 5:10).

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Judge and the Fine:**
  - If a judge sentences his own son to a massive fine, justice demands payment.
  - If the judge then removes his robe and pays the fine from his own account, he satisfies both justice and love.
- **Application:** God’s law could not be changed, so He gave Himself in His Son to pay the debt.

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Prophecy of Suffering
- **Question:** What did the prophet say Christ would be called to endure?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 53:7 – “He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not his mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Sanctuary & Substitution)
- **The Lamb of God:**
  - Isaiah points to the Sanctuary service.
  - Christ is the Antitype (fulfillment) of the lambs sacrificed morning and evening (John 1:29).
- **Vicarious Atonement:**
  - "For the transgression of my people was He stricken" (Isaiah 53:8).
  - This means standing in the place of another.
  - He took the blow the law aimed at the sinner.

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration
- **Transfer of Guilt:**
  - In the ancient sanctuary, the sinner placed his hand on the head of the innocent animal and confessed his sin.
  - Symbolically, sin moved from the man to the lamb.
  - The man walked away free; the lamb died.
- **Application:** By faith, we lay our hands on Jesus, the Lamb of God, transferring our guilt to Him.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Foreknowledge
- **Question:** Must not Christ have known beforehand of these things?
- **Key Text:** Luke 18:31-33 – “Then He took unto Him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished...”

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Courage & Prophecy)
- **Omniscience:**
  - Jesus was not a victim of circumstance; He was a voluntary sacrifice.
  - He knew every detail of the humiliation awaiting Him yet set His face to go.
- **Love vs. Fear:**
  - His foreknowledge highlights the depth of His love.
  - Knowing the pain, He still chose to save us.

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Burning Building:**
  - A firefighter might rush into a burning building hoping to survive.
  - Jesus rushed into the "burning building" of this world knowing with 100% certainty He would die in the flames.
  - He went in anyway to save us.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Sorrow in Gethsemane
- **Question:** How did the Saviour feel when the sins of the world were upon Him?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 26:38 – “Then saith He unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with Me.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (The Weight of Sin)
- **Sorrow unto Death:**
  - This was not fear of physical death (martyrs have died singing).
  - This was the horror of separation from God caused by sin (Isaiah 59:2).
  - He tasted the "second death"—total abandonment—for every sinner.
- **Humanity of Christ:**
  - He longed for human companionship ("watch with Me"), showing He truly shared our nature.

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Filthy Coat:**
  - Imagine wearing a coat that is heavy, filthy, and infected with a deadly disease, glued to your skin.
  - Sin is that coat.
  - Christ, the Purity of Heaven, was clothed in the filthy rags of our unrighteousness.
- **Lesson:** The revulsion He felt was agonizing.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Prayer of Surrender
- **Question:** In His distress, for what did He pray?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 26:39 – “And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Sanctification & Will)
- **The Cup:** Represents God's wrath or judgment against sin (Revelation 14:10).
- **The Battle of Will:**
  - Adam fell because he exalted his will above God’s.
  - Christ overcame because He surrendered His will entirely.
- **True Sanctification:**
  - The process of having our will merged with God's will.
  - We overcome by the same surrender: "Not my will, but Thine be done."

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Ship Captains:**
  - Two captains in a storm.
  - One insists on steering his own course and wrecks on the rocks.
  - The other (Christ) hands the wheel to the Admiral (the Father), even though the course leads through dark waves.
- **Lesson:** Only through submission is the ship saved.

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: The Agony
- **Question:** How great was the agony of His soul?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:44 – “And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points (The Cost of Sin)
- **Hematidrosis:** The mental anguish was so intense it ruptured capillaries, forcing blood into His sweat.
- **The Real Sacrifice:**
  - The physical pain of the cross was terrible, but Gethsemane shows the true cost was the spiritual rupture between Father and Son.
- **Victory:** By accepting the cup here, He secured the salvation of the human race.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: Betrayal
- **Question:** After this remarkable prayer, what happened to cause Him more grief?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:48 – “But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?”

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Hypocrisy)
- **A Symbol of Friendship:** Judas used a kiss (affection) to serve the enemy.
- **Warning:** This warns against having a "form of godliness" while denying its power.
- **Christ’s Patience:** Even then, Jesus called him "Friend" (Matthew 26:50), giving him one last chance.

---

## Slide 24 – Q9: The High Priest
- **Question:** To what place was He taken?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:54 – “Then took they Him, and led Him, and brought Him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points (Irony & Distance)
- **The Irony:**
  - The True High Priest of the universe (Hebrews 8:1) stood to be judged by a corrupt earthly high priest.
  - The Shadow was judging the Substance.
- **Spiritual Distance:** Peter followed "afar off." Physical distance reflected spiritual distance, leaving him vulnerable to temptation.

---

## Slide 26 – Q10: Peter’s Denial
- **Question:** While at the high priest's house, what act of Peter's caused the Saviour additional suffering?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:61 – “And the Lord turned; and looked upon Peter.” (See verses 59-61 for context).

---

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points (Dependence on Christ)
- **Failure of Self-Confidence:**
  - Peter claimed he would never fall (Matthew 26:33).
  - Human willpower is insufficient against Satan; we need Christ working *in* us.
- **The Look of Love:**
  - Jesus looked with pity, not anger.
  - This led to genuine repentance (godly sorrow).

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Reed and the Rock:**
  - A reed in a river boasts, "I will not bend." When the flood comes, it snaps.
  - Christ is the Rock.
  - Only by being anchored in the Rock can we withstand the pressure to deny our Lord.

---

## Slide 29 – Q11: Mockery and Abuse
- **Question:** What reproachful things were done to Christ while He was at the high priest's house?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:64 – “And when they had blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face, and asked Him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?”

---

## Slide 30 – Q11: Key Points (Humility)
- **Humiliation:** The Creator allowed His creatures to strike Him.
- **Testing His Deity:** They challenged Him to use divine power for self-defense.
- **Principle:** Jesus never used miracles to save Himself; His power was reserved for saving others.

---

## Slide 31 – Q12: The Council
- **Question:** Where was Christ next taken?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:66 – “And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led Him into their council.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q13: The Charge
- **Question:** What was their object in taking Him there, since it was not in their power judicially to sentence Him?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:70 – “Then said they all, Art Thou then the Son of God? And He said unto them, Ye say that I am.”

---

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points (The Great Confession)
- **The Object:** To secure a confession of "blasphemy" to justify death.
- **"I Am":** Jesus publicly affirmed His Divinity.
- **The Choice:** If He were not God, He would be a blasphemer. We must accept Him as Lord or reject Him; there is no middle ground.

---

## Slide 34 – Q14: Before Pilate
- **Question:** Having procured the pretext they sought, what did they next do?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:1 – “And the whole multitude of them arose, and led Him unto Pilate.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q14: Key Points (Church and State)
- **Prophetic Type:**
  - The religious power (Jewish leaders) sought the civil power (Rome) to enforce their decree.
  - This foreshadows end-time persecution (Revelation 13).

---

## Slide 36 – Q15: The Accusation
- **Question:** When Pilate desired to let Christ go, how did they remonstrate?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:5 – “And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.”
- **Note:** They accused Him of sedition—a lie. Jesus taught, "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's."

---

## Slide 37 – Q16: To Herod
- **Question:** When Pilate heard that Christ had been in Galilee, what did he do?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:7 – “And as soon as he knew that He belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.”
- **Key Point:** Pilate tried to evade responsibility. One cannot remain neutral about Jesus.

---

## Slide 38 – Q17: Relentless Accusers
- **Question:** Did the chief priests and scribes follow Christ before Herod?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:10 – “And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.”

- **Question:** What indignity did Herod put upon the Saviour?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:11 – “And Herod with his men of war set Him at nought, and mocked Him, and arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him again to Pilate.”

---

## Slide 40 – Q18: Key Points (The Seared Conscience)
- **Silence:** Jesus spoke to Pilate, but said *nothing* to Herod.
- **Why?** Herod had silenced his conscience by murdering John the Baptist.
- **Lesson:** When the conscience is seared, God’s voice is no longer heard.

---

## Slide 41 – Q19: Pilate’s Compromise
- **Question:** When Christ was again brought before Pilate, what did Pilate propose to do?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:22 – “I have found no cause of death in Him: I will therefore chastise Him, and let Him go.”

---

## Slide 42 – Q19: Key Points (Danger of Compromise)
- **The Proposal:** Punish an innocent man to appease the crowd, then release Him.
- **The Result:** Once Pilate agreed to punish the innocent, he lost his moral authority.
- **Lesson:** There is no middle ground between right and wrong.

---

## Slide 43 – Q20: The Mob’s Demand
- **Question:** At this proposition, how did Christ's accusers act?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:23 – “And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that He might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.”
- **Choice of Character:** By choosing Barabbas (a murderer) over Jesus, the people symbolically chose the character of Satan.

---

## Slide 44 – Q21: The Scourging
- **Question:** Besides yielding to the clamors of the Jews, what cruelty did Pilate inflict upon Christ?
- **Key Text:** John 19:1 – “Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged Him.”
- **Healing:** Isaiah 53:5 – “With his stripes we are healed.” The tearing of His body provided healing for ours.

---

- **Question:** What shameful treatment did He receive from the soldiers?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 27:29 – “And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon His head, and a reed in His right hand: and they bowed the knee before Him...”

---

## Slide 46 – Q22: Key Points (The Curse)
- **The Thorns:** Thorns were the result of the curse of sin (Genesis 3:18).
- **Bearing the Curse:** Jesus literally wore the curse on His head.
- **True Royalty:** Even in mockery, His ability to endure with love proved His divine nobility.

---

## Slide 47 – Q23: Refusing the Narcotic
- **Question:** After bringing Him to the place of crucifixion, what did they offer Him to stupefy Him?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 27:34 – “They gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall; and when He had tasted thereof, He would not drink.”

---

## Slide 48 – Q23: Key Points (Clear Mind)
- **Clarity:** Jesus refused to have His mind clouded.
- **The Battle:** He needed to hold fast to faith while darkness engulfed Him.
- **Temperance:** Even in death, Christ practiced strict temperance.

---

## Slide 49 – Q24: Father Forgive
- **Question:** What prayer did He utter as they were nailing Him to the cross?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:34 – “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.”

---

## Slide 50 – Q24: Key Points (Imputed Righteousness)
- **God's Heart:** This reveals God loves His enemies.
- **Intercession:** He pleaded His blood for them before they even asked.
- **Hope:** This assures us that He intercedes for us today.

---

## Slide 51 – Q24: Illustration
- **The Crushed Flower:**
  - If you step on a flower, it crushes and dies.
  - But in dying, it leaves its fragrance on your heel.
  - Men crushed the "Rose of Sharon" (Jesus), and His response was the fragrance of forgiveness.

---

## Slide 52 – Q25: The Taunt
- **Question:** With what words did they taunt Him while on the cross?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 27:42 – “He saved others; Himself He can not save. If He be the King of the Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.”

---

## Slide 53 – Q25: Key Points (Self-Sacrificing Love)
- **A Deep Truth:** They spoke a truth they did not understand: "Himself He cannot save."
- **Why?** Because love seeks not its own.
- **The Exchange:** If He had saved Himself, He could not have saved us. He stayed on the cross for you.

---

## Slide 54 – Q26: Thirst
- **Question:** As He cried out in agony on the cross, what was again offered Him?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 27:48 – “And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink.”
- **Prophecy:** Fulfilled Psalm 69:21 – “In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.”

---

## Slide 55 – Q27: It Is Finished
- **Question:** What closed this terrible scene?
- **Key Text:** John 19:30 – “When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished: and He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost.”

---

## Slide 56 – Q27: Key Points (Atonement Secured)
- **Tetelestai:** The Greek word means "Paid in Full."
- **Type Meets Antitype:** The real Lamb had died; the shadow services were no longer needed.
- **Foundation:** The foundation for our salvation was securely laid.

---

## Slide 57 – Q28: Nature and the Sanctuary
- **Question:** What wonderful demonstration attested nature's sympathy with the dying Son of God?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:45 – “And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.”

---

## Slide 58 – Q28: Key Points (The Rent Veil)
- **The Darkness:** God the Father was present, suffering with His Son (Psalm 18:11).
- **The Rent Veil:**
  - The barrier between the Holy Place and Most Holy Place was torn by an unseen hand.
  - Signified the end of the earthly sacrificial system.
  - A new way was opened to access God directly through Christ (Hebrews 10:19-20).

---

## Slide 59 – Q29: Necessity of Suffering
- **Question:** Was it necessary for Christ thus to suffer?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:10 – “For it became Him... in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.”

---

## Slide 60 – Q29: Key Points (Experiential Perfection)
- **Not Moral Improvement:** Jesus was already sinless.
- **Qualification:** "Perfect" here means fully qualified as High Priest.
- **Sympathy:** By suffering as a human, He learned how to succor (help) those who are tempted (Hebrews 2:18).

---

## Slide 61 – Q29: Illustration
- **The Doctor:**
  - A doctor may know all the medical facts about a broken leg.
  - But a doctor who has *had* a broken leg knows the pain personally.
  - Christ is the Great Physician who suffered our diseases to heal us with perfect sympathy.

---

## Slide 62 – Q30: Assurance and Power
- **Question:** What follows from the fact that God gave us His only Son?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:32 – “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”

---

## Slide 63 – Q30: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Power to Obey:**
  - If you struggle with a specific sin, remember this promise.
  - He gave Jesus to die for that sin; He will surely give the Holy Spirit's power to overcome it.
