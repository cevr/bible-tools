## Slide 1 – Title: Growing in Grace
- **Topic:** The Ladder of Christian Progress
- **Focus:** 2 Peter 1 and the Principles of Sanctification

***

## Slide 2 – Q1: Peter’s Closing Admonition
- **Question:** With what words does the Apostle Peter close his second epistle?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:18 – “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.”

***

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Grace and Growth)
- **Salvation is a Daily Experience**
    - The Christian life is not static; it is a life of constant progress.
    - We are either advancing toward holiness or retreating into the world.
- **Defining Grace**
    - Grace is more than just "unmerited favor"; it is God's enabling power.
    - Titus 2:11–12 – “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.”
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection**
    - **Justification:** God accepts us as we are.
    - **Sanctification:** God transforms our nature to reflect His law.
    - We do not grow *in order* to be loved; we grow *because* we are loved.

***

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Newborn Baby**
    - Parents love a newborn perfectly the moment it is born (Justification).
    - The child does not need to earn that love.
    - However, parents desire the child to grow, walk, and mature (Sanctification).
    - **Lesson:** God accepts us as "babes in Christ," but He loves us too much to let us remain spiritual infants.

***

## Slide 5 – Q2: Multiplying Grace
- **Question:** How may grace and peace be multiplied in believers?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:2 – “Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.”

***

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Knowledge & The Sanctuary)
- **Experiential Knowledge**
    - The "knowledge" (*epignosis*) mentioned is not just facts; it is deep, personal acquaintance.
    - John 17:3 – “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”
- **Sanctuary Application: The Holy Place**
    - We multiply grace through daily communion, symbolized by the Holy Place ministry:
        - **Shewbread:** Feeding on the Word.
        - **Altar of Incense:** Daily prayer.
        - **Candlestick:** Witnessing in the Spirit's light.
    - Hebrews 4:16 – “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”

***

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Ruler vs. The Father**
    - You may know *about* a foreign ruler through the news, but that gives you no access to his resources.
    - If that ruler is your Father and you live in his house, you have relational access to his help.
    - **Lesson:** Intimate, daily knowledge of Jesus opens the storehouse of heaven's grace.

***

## Slide 8 – Q3: Partaking of the Divine Nature
- **Question:** What has our heavenly Father given to us, to enable us to become partakers of the divine nature?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:4 – “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”

***

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (The Power of Promises)
- **The Power in the Promise**
    - Every command contains an underlying promise of power to obey it.
    - When we claim a promise, we lay hold of God's creative power.
- **Imparted Righteousness**
    - **Definition:** The life of Christ lived out in the believer by the Holy Spirit.
    - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”
- **Escaping Corruption**
    - We cannot empty ourselves of sin (lust).
    - We escape the power of sin only by being filled with the Divine Nature.

***

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Signed Check**
    - If a penniless man receives a check signed by a king, that paper is valuable because of the promise and the signer's integrity.
    - The Bible contains "checks" signed in Jesus' blood—promises of forgiveness and victory.
    - **Lesson:** When we present these promises in faith, God honors them with spiritual power.

***

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Ladder of Character
- **Question:** What graces, or qualities of character, are we to add in our character building?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:5–7 – “Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.”

***

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Steps 1–4)
- **1. Faith:** The foundation; the trusting grasp on Christ’s merits.
- **2. Virtue:** Moral courage; taking a stand for the right.
- **3. Knowledge:** Understanding God’s Word to avoid ignorant zeal.
- **4. Temperance:** Self-control of all faculties.
    - **Health Message Connection:** A clear mind is needed to discern spiritual things.
    - 1 Corinthians 9:25 – “And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.”

***

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points (Steps 5–8)
- **5. Patience:** Endurance and perseverance under trial.
- **6. Godliness:** A life centered on God's glory; reverence.
- **7. Brotherly Kindness:** Affection for the church family.
- **8. Charity (Love):** The crowning grace; the nature of God.
- **Cooperation with God**
    - God gives the power, but we must "give all diligence" to add these graces.

***

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration
- **Building a House**
    - **Foundation:** Faith.
    - **Framing:** Virtue and Knowledge.
    - **Roof:** Temperance and Patience (protection from storms).
    - **Furnishing:** Brotherly Kindness and Charity (warmth).
    - **Lesson:** A house without a foundation collapses; a foundation without a structure is useless.

***

## Slide 15 – Q5: The Nature of Charity
- **Question:** What does the Bible tell us about charity?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 13:4 – “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up...”
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 4:8 – “And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.”

***

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Love and Law)
- **Attributes of Love (Agape)**
    - **Longsuffering:** Bears with faults.
    - **Unselfish:** Seeketh not her own.
    - **Forgiving:** Thinketh no evil.
- **Covering Sins**
    - Love refuses to expose others to gossip or shame (Proverbs 10:12).
- **Righteousness by Faith**
    - The Law is a transcript of God’s character (Love).
    - True Righteousness by Faith is having this law of love written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).

***

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Prism**
    - Pure white light passing through a prism breaks into many colors (rainbow).
    - **Lesson:** "Charity" is the pure white light of Jesus’ character.
    - When passed through the prism of daily life, it reveals its components: patience, kindness, unselfishness, and humility.

***

## Slide 18 – Q6: The Bond of Perfectness
- **Question:** What is another name for charity?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:14 – “And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.”

***

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points (Unity and Perfection)
- **The Bond (Ligament)**
    - Just as ligaments hold the body together, love holds the church together.
    - Doctrine is vital, but love creates unity.
- **Christian Perfection**
    - Biblical perfection refers to spiritual maturity and wholehearted loyalty.
    - Matthew 5:48 – “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”
    - It is a character completely controlled by the love of Christ.

***

## Slide 20 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Mason’s Mortar**
    - Stones in a wall need mortar (cement) to bind them together.
    - Without mortar, the wall is just a loose pile that falls easily.
    - **Lesson:** Charity is the spiritual mortar that binds all virtues together and unites the church into a strong temple.

***

## Slide 21 – Q7: The Result of Growth
- **Question:** What is the result of cultivating these eight precious attributes?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:8 – “For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

***

## Slide 22 – Q7: Key Points (Fruitfulness)
- **Service and Fruit**
    - True knowledge of Christ leads to service.
    - Faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).
    - The Divine Nature always produces a spirit of soul-winning.
- **Abounding Life**
    - God desires us to have life "more abundantly" (John 10:10).
- **The Judgment Test**
    - The tree is known by its fruit (Matthew 7:20).
    - Our title to heaven is Jesus' righteousness; our fitness is the fruit of the Spirit.

***

## Slide 23 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Fruit Tree**
    - A fruit tree is not planted just for leaves (profession), but for fruit (character/service).
    - An apple tree with no apples fails in its purpose.
    - **Lesson:** A Christian without patience, kindness, or love is like the barren fig tree (Luke 13:6–9).

***

## Slide 24 – Q8: Spiritual Blindness
- **Question:** What is the condition of one who lacks these graces?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:9 – “But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.”

***

## Slide 25 – Q8: Key Points (Forgetting the Cross)
- **Spiritual Nearsightedness**
    - The non-growing Christian sees only temporal things and loses sight of eternity.
    - Reminiscent of the Laodicean "blindness" (Revelation 3:17).
- **Forgetting the Purging (Justification)**
    - When sanctification stops, appreciation for justification fades.
    - To stop growing is to forget the cost of the cross and the value of pardon.
    - We cannot rely solely on a past experience.

***

## Slide 26 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Shipwreck Rescue**
    - A man rescued from freezing water is warmed and fed.
    - If he jumps back into the freezing water, he shows he has "forgotten" or despises his rescue.
    - **Lesson:** Returning to the old life of sin is to forget the cleansing power of Christ’s blood.

***

## Slide 27 – Q9: The Assurance of Victory
- **Question:** What promise is given to those who will patiently add grace to grace?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:10 – “Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.”

***

## Slide 28 – Q9: Key Points (Security in Christ)
- **Making Election Sure**
    - God wants all to be saved, but we must cooperate by "giving diligence."
    - We make our election sure by holding to Christ and building character.
- **"Ye Shall Never Fall"**
    - A promise of ultimate victory and security.
    - Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.”
- **The Path of the Just**
    - Proverbs 4:18 – “But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.”

***

## Slide 29 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Mountain Climber**
    - A climber is safe as long as he stays attached to the safety rope and keeps moving up.
    - Danger comes if he cuts the rope or stops on a slippery slope.
    - **Lesson:** Our safety rope is faith in Christ. As long as we hold fast and keep climbing (adding grace to grace), we "shall never fall."
