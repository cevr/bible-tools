## Slide 1 – Q1: The Carnal Mind

- **Question:** What does Paul say of the carnal mind?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:7 – “The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is
  not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Definition and Condition

- **The Definition**
  - The "carnal mind" is the unrenewed, natural human nature inherited from
    Adam.
  - It is dominated by the "flesh"—selfish desires separated from the Spirit of
    God.
- **The Condition: Enmity**
  - The mind does not just _have_ enemies; it _is_ enmity.
  - This indicates deep-seated, active hostility toward God’s character and
    government.
- **The Implication**
  - Humanity is not merely sick, but in rebellion.
  - We need a complete change of government—a new heart.
  - Ezekiel 36:26 – “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I
    put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and
    I will give you an heart of flesh.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **Oil and Water**
  - Imagine oil and water in the same jar.
  - No matter how much you shake them, they remain separate; oil naturally
    resists water.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** The carnal mind (oil) naturally resists the Spirit of
    God (water).
  - Education cannot mix them; it requires a miracle of grace to unite the soul
    with God.

---

## Slide 4 – Q2: Why Enmity Exists

- **Question:** Why is the carnal mind enmity?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:7 – “For it is not subject to the law of God, neither
  indeed can be.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Conflict with the Law

- **The Conflict**
  - The Law is a transcript of God's character: holy, just, and good.
  - Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and
    just, and good.”
  - The carnal mind is selfish and resents the Law's demand for supreme love to
    God.
- **The Inability (Righteousness by Faith)**
  - The text says the carnal mind _cannot_ be subject to the Law.
  - Left to our own strength, we are utterly incapable of perfect obedience.
  - John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and
    I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
    nothing.”
- **The Remedy**
  - Attempting to keep the law without a changed heart is legalism and failure.
  - We do not need the law changed; we need the mind changed by Christ.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Train and the Tracks**
  - A train is designed to run on tracks (God's Law).
  - If the train decides the tracks are "restrictive" and drives into a field,
    it destroys itself.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** The carnal mind views God's law as a burden.
  - In reality, the law is the only path to safety, movement, and life.

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: Pleasing God

- **Question:** Can one please God while he is carnally minded?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:8 – “So then they that are in the flesh cannot please
  God.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Motives and Faith

- **Motives Matter**
  - God looks at the heart, not just outward actions.
  - 1 Samuel 16:7 – “...for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on
    the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.”
  - Religious duties performed for self-glory or pride are "dead works."
- **Necessity of the Spirit**
  - To please God, we must have the character of Jesus.
  - Without the indwelling Spirit, we cannot produce the fruit of righteousness.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - Our standing is not based on human performance (which is flawed).
  - It is based on accepting Christ’s life in place of ours.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Wolf in Sheepskin**
  - A wolf may wear a sheepskin and look like a sheep from a distance.
  - However, it cannot bleat like a sheep or eat grass like a sheep; its nature
    remains a wolf.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** Outward behavior cannot hide an unconverted nature.
  - We must be "born again" to receive the nature of the Lamb.

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Consequence

- **Question:** What will those receive who remain in that state?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:6 – “For to be carnally minded is death; but to be
  spiritually minded is life and peace.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Separation and Sanctuary

- **Cause and Effect**
  - Sin is the transgression of the law, and the result is death.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- **Separation from Life**
  - God is the fountain of life; the carnal mind cuts the connection, leading to
    inevitable death.
- **The Sanctuary Connection**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner saw that sin caused the death of the
    innocent lamb.
  - This teaches the gravity of the carnal mind: it costs life—ultimately, the
    life of the Son of God.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Diver's Air Hose**
  - A deep-sea diver cuts his air hose because he finds it "restrictive."
  - By severing the connection to the surface, he is doomed.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** The carnal mind cuts the "air hose" connecting the
    soul to heaven.
  - Independence from God is not freedom; it is suicide.

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Remedy

- **Question:** In what way may this condition be changed?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:20 – “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as
  though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
  reconciled to God.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Reconciliation

- **Definition**
  - Reconciliation means restoring friendship and harmony between two parties at
    war.
- **God's Initiative**
  - We do not reconcile God to us; He is already seeking us.
  - The enmity is on _our_ side. God loves the sinner while hating the sin.
- **The Exchange**
  - To be reconciled, we must drop our rebellion.
  - We surrender our "weapons" (self-will) and accept His terms of peace and
    mercy.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Rebellious Son**
  - A son runs away and slanders his father.
  - The father stands on the porch daily with open arms, calling for the son.
  - The father does not need to change; the son needs to turn around and come
    home.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** God is the waiting Father; we are the ones who must
    return.

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: Example of Reconciliation

- **Question:** How was this reconciliation brought about in the case of the
  wicked Ninevites, when Jonah prophesied their destruction?
- **Key Text:** Jonah 3:8 – “But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth,
  and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and
  from the violence that is in their hands.”
- **Key Text:** Jonah 3:10 – “And God saw their works, that they turned from
  their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
  do unto them; and he did it not.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Steps to Reconciliation

- **Conviction & Humiliation**
  - They believed the warning and covered themselves in sackcloth (removing
    pride).
- **Turning Away (Sanctification)**
  - They did not just feel sorry; they turned "from his evil way."
  - True reconciliation leads to a change in behavior.
- **God's Response**
  - God "repented" (changed His course of action) because the people changed
    their position.
  - Jeremiah 18:8 – “If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from
    their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Ship and the Rocks**
  - A captain steers a ship toward a rocky cliff (destruction).
  - Upon warning, he spins the wheel and turns the ship around (repentance).
  - The crash is avoided. Did the rocks move? No.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** The ship moved. When we change our direction, the
    outcome changes from judgment to mercy.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: Repentance and Confession

- **Question:** Are repentance and confession still essential to reconciliation?
- **Key Text:** Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your
  sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the
  presence of the Lord.”
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
  forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Essential Elements

- **Repentance**
  - Heartfelt sorrow for sin and turning away from it.
  - It is a gift from God (Acts 5:31).
- **Confession**
  - Agreeing with God about the specific nature of our guilt.
  - Bringing sin into the Light rather than hiding it.
- **Sanctuary Truth: Blotting Out**
  - Acts 3:19 points to the Investigative Judgment.
  - Sins are forgiven now, but ultimately "blotted out" (erased) as we overcome
    through Christ.
- **Faithful and Just**
  - God is "just" to forgive because Christ paid the penalty.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Splinter**
  - You cannot heal a deep splinter by just putting a bandage over it.
  - You must expose it and allow the physician to remove it.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** Confession exposes the sin; repentance allows God to
    remove it.
  - Keeping sin hidden leads to spiritual infection and death.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: God's Part and Our Part

- **Question:** Is this work effected independently of the sinner's action?
- **Key Text:** John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
  begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
  everlasting life.”
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:10 – “For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled
  to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved
  by his life.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Provision vs. Application

- **God's Sovereign Act**
  - The Atonement was provided while we were yet sinners (Romans 5:6).
  - We did not ask for it; God gave it out of infinite love.
- **Two Aspects of Salvation**
  1.  **Justification:** Reconciled by His death (legal clearing at the cross).
  2.  **Sanctification:** Saved by His life (indwelling life of the resurrected
      Jesus).
- **The Role of Faith**
  - The gift is universal, but only effective for "whosoever believeth."
  - Faith claims what God has provided.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Bank Deposit**
  - A benefactor deposits one billion dollars into a debtor's account.
  - The provision is made without the debtor's help.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** If the debtor refuses to believe or write a check, he
    remains poor.
  - We must exercise faith to access the "riches" of Christ's grace.

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: Destroying the Carnal Mind

- **Question:** How is the carnal mind destroyed?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:6 – “Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with
  him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not
  serve sin.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Crucifixion and Victory

- **Crucifixion of the Old Man**
  - The carnal, selfish nature is not improved; it must die.
  - We surrender our will completely to God.
- **The Purpose**
  - "That the body of sin might be destroyed."
  - The goal is freedom from the power of sin.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - "That henceforth we should not serve sin."
  - Through the indwelling Christ, we are no longer slaves to the carnal nature.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me...”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Caterpillar and Butterfly**
  - A caterpillar cannot learn to fly; it must enter a cocoon and "die" to its
    old form.
  - Only through this process does the butterfly emerge.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** The "old man" (caterpillar) must die so the "new man"
    (butterfly) can live in Christ.

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: A Complete Change

- **Question:** When the work on the part of the sinner has been thoroughly
  done, how complete will be the change in him?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a
  new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”

## Slide 29 – Q10: New Creation

- **New Creature**
  - God speaks a new nature into existence, just as He created the world.
- **Old Things Pass Away**
  - Old habits, prejudices, addictions, and love of the world lose their power.
- **All Things New**
  - New motives, new tastes, and a new love for God's law.
  - We begin to love what we once hated and hate what we once loved.
  - This is the essence of Biblical Sanctification.

## Slide 30 – Q10: Illustration

- **Grafting the Briar**
  - If you graft a rose branch into a thorny briar bush, the bush changes its
    production.
  - It stops producing thorns and starts producing roses.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** The root remains, but the life-force is new.
  - When grafted into Christ, our nature produces His fruit.

---

## Slide 31 – Q11: The Evidence of Change

- **Question:** How may we know whether or not one has experienced this change?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:20 – “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.”

## Slide 32 – Q11: The Fruit Test

- **Testing the Life**
  - We cannot read hearts, but we can inspect the fruit of the life.
  - Profession means nothing without practice.
  - 1 John 2:4 – “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
    is a liar, and the truth is not in him.”
- **Harmony with Law**
  - The carnal mind hates the law; the spiritual mind delights in it.
  - Obedience is the visible fruit of invisible faith.

## Slide 33 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Sign and the Tree**
  - Hanging a sign that says "Apple Tree" on a dead tree does not make it alive.
  - You only know it is genuine when you see apples growing on the branches.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** A Christian label is not enough; there must be
    Christian fruit.

---

## Slide 34 – Q12: The Fruit of the Spirit

- **Question:** If one has a spiritual mind, what fruit will he bear?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:22-23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
  peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance:
  against such there is no law.”

## Slide 35 – Q12: Character of Christ

- **Singular Fruit**
  - The text says "fruit" (singular), indicating a unified character.
  - These are the attributes of Jesus reproduced in the believer.
- **Temperance and Health**
  - Includes self-control over appetite and passion.
  - We care for the body as the temple of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19).
- **The Law Reflected**
  - This list is the Ten Commandments translated into character traits.
  - Romans 13:10 – “...therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.”

## Slide 36 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Prism**
  - White light passed through a prism breaks into a rainbow of colors.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** The pure life of Christ (the Light) passed through the
    believer breaks into the rainbow of the Spirit's fruit.
  - Love, joy, peace, and temperance are all aspects of the same Light.

---

## Slide 37 – Q13: Justification and Peace

- **Question:** What is the first result of justification?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace
  with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 38 – Q13: The Peace of God

- **Justification Defined**
  - God's legal declaration that the sinner is counted righteous because of
    Jesus.
- **End of Hostilities**
  - The "war" between the carnal mind and God is over.
  - A peace treaty has been signed by the blood of Christ.
- **Through Christ**
  - This is not a feeling we manufacture.
  - It is a standing we possess "through our Lord Jesus Christ." He is our
    Peace.

## Slide 39 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Soldier and the Treaty**
  - A soldier in the trenches lives in constant fear of enemy fire.
  - Suddenly, news arrives: "The war is over! A treaty is signed."
  - He can lay down his rifle and breathe.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** Justification tells us the war with God is over; we
    are safe.

---

## Slide 40 – Q14: Completeness of Cleansing

- **Question:** How complete is the justification of that person who becomes
  reconciled to God?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:7 – “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the
  light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
  Son cleanseth us from all sin.”

## Slide 41 – Q14: Walking in the Light

- **Continuous Walk**
  - Justification leads to a walk of sanctification.
  - "Walking in the light" means obeying the truth as God reveals it.
- **Continuous Cleansing**
  - The blood of Jesus "cleanseth" (continual action) us from all sin.
  - As we follow Jesus in His Sanctuary ministry, He applies His blood to our
    daily failings.
- **Full Restoration**
  - The goal is a character cleansed from every stain of selfishness.

## Slide 42 – Q14: Illustration

- **Walking Toward the Sun**
  - Walking toward the sun reveals dust on your coat that was hidden in the
    shadows.
  - Seeing the dust doesn't mean you are getting dirtier, but that the light is
    stronger.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** The light reveals sin so the blood of Jesus can brush
    it away.

---

## Slide 43 – Q15: Standing in Christ

- **Question:** When thus reconciled to God, how will the individual stand?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:1 – “There is therefore now no condemnation to them
  which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
  Spirit.”

## Slide 44 – Q15: No Condemnation

- **In Christ**
  - The key to safety is abiding in Christ (John 15:4).
  - The law condemns the sinner, but it cannot condemn Christ.
- **The Direction of Life**
  - True believers "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
  - This denotes a changed direction, not instant absolute perfection.
- **Assurance**
  - We face judgment with confidence, not because of our own merit, but because
    we are hidden in the Perfect One.

## Slide 45 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Storm Shelter**
  - Standing outside in a storm leads to being wet and cold (condemned).
  - Stepping inside a waterproof shelter keeps you dry, though the storm still
    rages.
  - **Spiritual Lesson:** Christ is the Shelter.
  - As long as we "abide" in Him, the storm of judgment cannot touch us.
