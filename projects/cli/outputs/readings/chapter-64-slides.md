## Slide 1 – Q1: The Days of the Son of Man

- **Question:** How did the Saviour say it would be in the days of the Son of
  man (or when the Son of man would be revealed)?
- **Key Text:** Luke 17:26 – "And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be
  also in the days of the Son of man."
- **Additional References:**
  - Matthew 24:38 – "For as in the days that were before the flood they were
    eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe
    entered into the ark."

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Normalcy & Warning)

- **Parallel Conditions:** Jesus draws a direct parallel between Noah’s day and
  the time just before the Second Coming.
- **Fatal Normalcy:**
  - The people were absorbed in "eating, drinking, marrying."
  - These acts are not sinful in themselves, but the people were wholly absorbed
    in temporal things, oblivious to coming judgment.
- **The Warning Message:**
  - Just as Noah preached for 120 years, the **Three Angels’ Messages**
    (Revelation 14:6–12) are now warning the world.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In Noah’s day, the door of the ark was shut _before_ the rain (Genesis
    7:16).
  - Similarly, Christ’s intercessory work in the heavenly sanctuary will cease
    shortly before He returns (Revelation 22:11 – "He that is filthy, let him be
    filthy still").

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Volcano Village:**
  - Imagine a village at the base of an active volcano.
  - Experts warn of eruption; smoke rises, the ground trembles.
  - Villagers ignore the signs, too busy planning festivals and building houses.
  - When the lava flows, they perish not because they weren't warned, but
    because they were too absorbed in the temporary to prepare for the eternal.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Days of Noah

- **Question:** How was it in the days of Noah?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:5 – "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great
  in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
  evil continually."

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Depravity & The Heart)

- **Total Depravity:** The problem was internal; the "thoughts of his heart"
  were evil continually.
- **The Nature of Sin:** Sin is a condition of the heart at enmity with God
  (Romans 8:7 – "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God...").
- **The Need for Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Man cannot reform himself because the fountain of life (the heart) is
    polluted.
  - **The New Covenant Promise:** "I will put my laws into their mind, and write
    them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).
  - Salvation requires God cleansing the inside of the cup.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Muddy Stream:**
  - You cannot make a muddy stream clear by painting the banks or planting
    flowers along the edge.
  - The source itself must be cleansed.
  - Similarly, culture and education cannot cure the "evil continually" in the
    human heart.
  - Only the blood of Jesus applied to the conscience can cleanse the stream.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Characterizing the Last Days

- **Question:** How did Paul characterize the last days?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:1 – "This know, also, that in the last days perilous
  times shall come."

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Perilous Times)

- **No Golden Age:**
  - Paul did not see a world gradually converted or entering a temporal
    millennium of peace.
  - He saw "perilous" (dangerous) times.
- **Contradicting Popular Theory:**
  - The closer we get to the end, the more dangerous the spiritual landscape
    becomes.
  - The popular idea of the world getting better and better is unbiblical.

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Cause of Peril

- **Question:** What will make those times perilous?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:2-5 – "For men shall be lovers of their own selves,
  covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
  unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers,
  incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high
  minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of
  godliness, but denying the power thereof."

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points (Form vs. Power)

- **The Root of Sin:** A society dominated by **Self** ("lovers of their own
  selves").
- **Corrupted Religion:**
  - **The Form:** Outward ceremonies, church attendance, and liturgy.
  - **The Power:** The Gospel, which is the power to deliver from sin (Romans
    1:16).
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - To deny the power is to claim to follow Jesus while believing it is
    impossible to overcome sin.
  - True faith teaches that Christ came to empower us to live holy lives
    (Sanctification).

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Wax Apple:**
  - A wax apple may have the perfect shape and color (the "form").
  - However, it has no life, no juice, and no seeds. It cannot nourish.
  - A religion that is all theory but lacks victory over selfishness is like a
    wax apple.
  - It denies the life-giving power of the Vine (John 15:5).

## Slide 12 – Q5: Will the World Improve?

- **Question:** But will not this state of things grow better before the Lord
  comes?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:13 – "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and
  worse, deceiving, and being deceived."

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Progression of Evil)

- **Worse and Worse:** Scripture predicts a progression of evil, not a kingdom
  of God on earth before the Second Coming.
- **Rejection of Light:** As Gospel light increases, the rejection of it leads
  to deeper darkness.
- **The Separation:**
  - As the **Investigative Judgment** proceeds in heaven, a separation occurs on
    earth.
  - The righteous are settled in truth; the wicked are ensnared by deception (2
    Thessalonians 2:10-12).

## Slide 14 – Q6: Difficulty of Serving the Lord

- **Question:** Will it be easy for those living at this time to serve the Lord?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:12 – "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ
  Jesus shall suffer persecution."

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (The Battle for Holiness)

- **Godly Living:**
  - "In Christ Jesus" implies His life lived out in us (Galatians 2:20).
  - A holy life naturally antagonizes the spirit of the world.
- **Persecution:**
  - Can be physical or social (ridicule, economic pressure).
  - See Revelation 13:17 (regarding the mark of the beast and buying/selling).

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **Swimming Upstream:**
  - A dead fish floats downstream with the current; it takes no effort.
  - A live fish swims upstream, against the current.
  - To live godly in the last days is to swim against the violent current of
    popular culture.
  - The friction you feel is proof of spiritual life.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Wheat and Tares

- **Question:** According to the parable of the wheat and the tares, how long
  are the good and the bad to remain together?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 13:30 – "Let both grow together until the harvest: and
  in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
  tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my
  barn."
- **Reference:** Matthew 13:38-39 (Field is the world; tares are children of the
  wicked one).

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Ripening Character)

- **The Mixture:** We cannot expect a pure world before Jesus comes; wheat and
  tares grow together.
- **Character Development:**
  - The righteous ripen in the character of Christ (Revelation 14:12).
  - The wicked ripen in the character of Satan.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - This separation is finalized during the antitypical **Day of Atonement**.
  - When the judgment concludes, the "harvest" is ready (Revelation 14:14-16).

## Slide 19 – Q8: Timing of the Harvest

- **Question:** When does the harvest come?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 13:39 – "The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the
  harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels."

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (The End of the Age)

- **Specific Event:** The harvest is not a long era of peace.
- **The End:** It occurs at "the end of the world" (or age).
- **Maturation:** God waits until the principles of righteousness and sin are
  fully matured and demonstrated before the universe.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Man of Sin

- **Question:** When shall the "man of sin" (2 Thess. 2:3), also called "that
  Wicked," cease his iniquity?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:8 – "And then shall that Wicked be revealed,
  whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy
  with the brightness of His coming."

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Antichrist Destroyed)

- **No Conversion:** The "Man of Sin" is not converted by the gospel; he is
  destroyed by Christ's return.
- **Continued Conflict:**
  - The greatest enemy of the church exists until Jesus returns.
  - Therefore, there is no millennium of peace _before_ the Second Coming.
- **Definition:** The Man of Sin is the system of apostasy seeking to change
  God's law (Daniel 7:25).

## Slide 23 – Q10: The Little Horn's War

- **Question:** How long is the "little horn" (Dan. 7:25) to make war with the
  saints?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:21-22 – "I beheld, and the same horn made war with the
  saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and
  judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the
  saints possessed the kingdom."

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (Judgment & Vindication)

- **War Until the End:** The war continues _until_ the Ancient of Days comes.
- **Possessing the Kingdom:**
  - The saints do not take the kingdom through political power.
  - They possess it only after "judgment was given to the saints."
- **Investigative Judgment:** God vindicates His people in the heavenly
  sanctuary, declaring them righteous through the blood of Jesus.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Two Classes of People

- **Question:** How many classes of people will there be on the earth when the
  Lord comes?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 5:2-4 – "For yourselves know perfectly that the
  day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say,
  Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them... But ye,
  brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (Light vs. Darkness)

- **Children of Darkness:** Cry "Peace and safety," unaware of judgment;
  overtaken as by a thief.
- **Children of Light:** Awake, watching, and sober; they know the time of their
  visitation.
- **Application:**
  - Believers must put on the "armor of light" (Romans 13:12).
  - This is the righteousness of Christ covering the believer and the law
    written in the heart.

## Slide 27 – Q12: The Scoffers' Message

- **Question:** What will those who are in darkness say when they hear about the
  Lord's coming?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:3-4 – "Knowing this first, that there shall come in
  the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is
  the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things
  continue as they were from the beginning of the creations."

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points (Willful Ignorance)

- **Uniformitarianism:** The belief that things continue exactly as they always
  have, denying divine intervention (Creation/Flood).
- **Moral Motivation:**
  - "Walking after their own lusts."
  - Their theology is dictated by their morality; they deny the Second Coming
    because they do not wish to face the Judge.

## Slide 29 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Bad Tenant:**
  - A tenant who has destroyed the landlord's property and refuses to pay rent
    will argue that the landlord is never coming back.
  - His desire for the landlord's absence shapes his belief.
  - So it is with scoffers who reject the return of Christ.

## Slide 30 – Q13: Popular Teaching in Last Days

- **Question:** What will be popularly taught in the last days?
- **Key Text:** Micah 4:1-3 – "But in the last days... many nations shall come,
  and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord... and they shall
  beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation
  shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any
  more."

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points (The Peace and Safety Cry)

- **What Nations "Say":** This passage describes the _words_ of the
  people/nations, not the decree of God.
- **The Delusion:**
  - A message of universal peace and a "golden age" achieved by human effort.
  - This corresponds to the "Peace and Safety" cry of 1 Thessalonians 5:3.

## Slide 32 – Q14: Actual Condition of the World

- **Question:** What does the Lord say will be the actual condition of the world
  just before the end?
- **Key Text:** Joel 3:9-10 – "Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles: Prepare war,
  wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:
  beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the
  weak say, I am strong."

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points (Preparation for War)

- **God's Declaration:** In contrast to what nations say (peace), God declares
  what will happen (war).
- **Plowshares into Swords:**
  - The spirit of war stirs the nations.
  - This culminates in the final conflict (Armageddon).
- **Reality Check:** International conflict, not universal peace, precedes the
  Day of the Lord.

## Slide 34 – Q15: Inheritance of the Heathen

- **Question:** But are not the heathen to be given to the Lord for an
  inheritance?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 2:8 – "Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for
  thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession."

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points (Reclaiming the Earth)

- **Inheritance:** The Father gives the nations to the Son.
- **Purpose:** Christ inherits the earth to reclaim it from the usurper (Satan)
  and to cleanse it of rebellion.
- **Context:** We must read the very next verse (Psalm 2:9) to understand _how_
  He receives them.

## Slide 36 – Q16: Ruling with a Rod of Iron

- **Question:** What will the Lord do with them?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 2:9 – "Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou
  shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points (Judgment)

- **The Rod of Iron:** Signifies absolute rule and judgment.
- **Breaking vs. Converting:**
  - Those who refused the scepter of grace must face the rod of justice.
  - The Kingdom is ushered in by the destruction of the wicked, not gradual
    conversion.

## Slide 38 – Q16: Illustration

- **The Potter's Vessels:**
  - A potter inspects his vessels.
  - Those that are marred and hardened in a crooked shape cannot be remolded
    once fired; they must be broken.
  - When Christ returns, the time for molding (probation) is past.

## Slide 39 – Q17: The Wrath of God

- **Question:** When does the Lord thus rule the wicked nations in wrath?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 19:15-16 – "And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword,
  that with it He should smite the nations; and He shall rule them with a rod of
  iron: and He treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty
  God. And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of Kings
  and lord of lords."

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points (The Second Coming)

- **Timing:** This occurs at the visible Second Coming of Christ.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - The "wine press" connects to the final judgment.
  - Nations drunk on Babylon's wine now drink the wine of God's wrath
    (Revelation 14:10).
- **King vs. Lamb:** We must accept Him as the Lamb of God (John 1:29) now to
  avoid facing Him as the judging King then.

## Slide 41 – Q18: The Hope of the Church

- **Question:** Then instead of looking for the conversion of the world, what
  should be the hope of the church?
- **Key Text:** Titus 2:13 – "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
  appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."
- **Additional References:**
  - 2 Timothy 4:8 – "...unto all them also that love his appearing."

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points (The Blessed Hope)

- **Our Focus:** Not politics or the gradual improvement of society.
- **Our Hope:** The literal, visible, glorious return of Jesus Christ.
- **The Purpose of Grace:**
  - Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness (Titus 2:11-12).
  - Why? So we can look for this Blessed Hope with confidence.

## Slide 43 – Q18: Application (Faith & Purity)

- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We look for Him with longing, not terror, because we are covered by His
    righteousness.
- **Sanctification:**
  - "And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is
    pure" (1 John 3:3).
- **Conclusion:** The world grows darker, but the church shines brighter,
  waiting for the Bridegroom.
