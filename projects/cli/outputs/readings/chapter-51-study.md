### Q1. What announcement is made by the second angel of Rev. 14?

**"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that
great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her
fornication." (Revelation 14:8)**

**Answer:**

The second angel follows the first. This sequence is vital. The First Angel
brought the "everlasting gospel" and the announcement of the judgment hour
(Revelation 14:6–7). The Second Angel now announces the moral and spiritual
collapse of those systems that rejected the First Angel's message.

1.  **The Identity of Babylon:**
    - **Definition:** The term "Babylon" is derived from "Babel," signifying
      confusion (Genesis 11:9). In the Old Testament, literal Babylon was the
      oppressor of God’s people and the center of false worship (Daniel 3;
      4:30).
    - **Spiritual Application:** In the New Testament, specifically in
      Revelation, it represents a religious system that has become confused by
      mixing truth with error and blending the worship of God with the ways of
      the world.

2.  **The Meaning of the "Fall":**
    - Since this Babylon "makes all nations drink," she is an influential,
      global religious power. Her fall is not initially a physical destruction
      (which comes later in Revelation 18), but a **moral and spiritual fall**.
    - **Cause and Effect:** The Second Angel’s message is a declaration of
      result. When individuals or churches knowingly reject the light of the
      "everlasting gospel"—the power of God to save and transform—they
      inevitably fall into spiritual darkness (John 12:35).

3.  **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
    - The "fall" occurs when a church moves away from the foundation of
      **Justification by Faith** (reliance solely on Christ's merits) and begins
      to rely on human works, traditions, or political power.
    - **Sanctification:** A church that has "fallen" can no longer lead members
      to true holiness. Instead of the "law written in the heart" by the Spirit
      (Hebrews 8:10), it offers external ceremonies and human dogmas.

**[ILL]** Imagine a lighthouse designed to guide ships safely to harbor. If the
lighthouse keeper turns off the main light and instead puts up confusing colored
lanterns that lead ships onto the rocks, the lighthouse has "fallen" from its
purpose. It is no longer a beacon of safety but a cause of destruction.
Similarly, a church established to light the way to Christ "falls" when it
obscures the light of the Gospel with the fog of human tradition.

### Q2. To whom is the term Babylon elsewhere applied?

**"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color... And upon her
forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots
and Abominations of the Earth." (Revelation 17:4, 5)**

**Answer:**

Scripture interprets Scripture. To understand the "Babylon" of Revelation 14, we
look to the expanded description in Revelation 17.

1.  **The Symbol of the Woman:**
    - **A Pure Woman:** In Bible prophecy, a chaste, pure woman represents God's
      true church (Jeremiah 6:2; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Revelation 12:1).
    - **A Corrupt Woman:** Conversely, a corrupt woman (a harlot) represents an
      apostate religious system that claims to be married to Christ but has been
      unfaithful to Him (Ezekiel 16).

2.  **Identifying the System:**
    - The woman in Revelation 17 is wealthy ("purple and scarlet," "gold and
      precious stones") and politically powerful ("reigneth over the kings of
      the earth," v. 18).
    - **Historicist Interpretation:** Protestant reformers and Adventist
      pioneers have historically identified this "Mother" as the Papacy—a system
      that rose out of Rome, combining pagan rituals with Christian terminology,
      and assuming the prerogatives of God.

3.  **"Mystery":**
    - Paul speaks of the "mystery of iniquity" that was already beginning to
      work in his day (2 Thessalonians 2:7). This is a counterfeit of the
      "mystery of godliness" (1 Timothy 3:16).
    - While the mystery of godliness is God becoming man to save us, the mystery
      of iniquity is man (the religious leader) exalting himself to the place of
      God (2 Thessalonians 2:4).

**[ILL]** If a wife wears her wedding ring but secretly loves and serves a rival
of her husband, she is an adulteress, regardless of how beautifully she dresses
or how loudly she claims to be married. A church may claim the name of Christ,
but if she adopts the customs of the world and seeks the power of the state
rather than the power of the Holy Spirit, she is spiritually unfaithful.

---

### Q3. What does the apostle call the church that has become corrupted by worldly alliances?

**"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world
is enmity with God?" (James 4:4)**

**Answer:**

Here the Bible defines the nature of the "fornication" mentioned in Revelation.

1.  **Spiritual Adultery:**
    - The Church is betrothed to Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2). She is to depend
      on Him for protection, support, and righteousness.
    - When the church turns to the "kings of the earth" (political powers) for
      support, legislation, and status, she commits spiritual fornication. She
      is trusting in the arm of flesh rather than the arm of the Lord.

2.  **Friendship with the World:**
    - **Enmity:** James uses strong language. You cannot be a friend of the
      world's systems and a friend of God simultaneously (Matthew 6:24).
    - **Sanctification connection:** The world operates on principles of force,
      pride, and selfishness. The Kingdom of God operates on love, service, and
      self-sacrifice. To ally with the world is to adopt its character, thereby
      rejecting the character of Christ.

3.  **The Great Controversy:**
    - Satan's principle is self-exaltation and force. Christ's principle is
      self-renunciation and love. When the church adopts the world's methods
      (force, popularity, political maneuvering), she changes sides in the Great
      Controversy.

**[ILL]** Consider a vine that refuses to cling to its trellis and instead
creeps along the ground, tangling itself in the mud and weeds. It cannot bear
good fruit because it has left its source of uplift. A church that unclasps its
hold on Christ to grasp the hand of worldly politics inevitably becomes "earthy"
and fruitless.

### Q4. And what is that called which was to reveal the "man of sin," or the papacy?

**"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except
there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
perdition." (2 Thessalonians 2:3)**

**Answer:**

Paul warns that the second coming of Christ would not happen until a specific
development took place within the church history.

1.  **The "Falling Away" (Apostasia):**
    - **Definition:** The Greek word _apostasia_ means a defection or revolt.
      This was not an attack from the _outside_ (like pagan persecution), but a
      corruption from the _inside_.
    - **Gradual Process:** The "fall" of Babylon is the culmination of a long
      process of compromise. It began when the early church started accepting
      pagan philosophies (like the immortality of the soul) and pagan images to
      make Christianity more palatable to the Roman world.

2.  **The Man of Sin:**
    - This figure is described as sitting in the "temple of God" (the church),
      showing himself that he is God (v. 4).
    - **Sanctuary Connection:** This power obscures the work of Christ in the
      heavenly sanctuary. Instead of teaching people to go directly to Jesus,
      the High Priest, for forgiveness and cleansing, it establishes an earthly
      priesthood, earthly confessionals, and an earthly sacrifice (the mass).
      This "casts the truth to the ground" (Daniel 8:12).

3.  **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
    - The "man of sin" represents the ultimate triumph of **human
      righteousness**. It is the belief that man can forgive sin, change God's
      law, and merit salvation through rituals.
    - True Righteousness by Faith is the exact opposite: it acknowledges that
      man is bankrupt and that only Christ's life (imputed and imparted) can
      save and restore.

### Q5. What work was this "mother of harlots" seen to engage in?

**"And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood
of the martyrs of Jesus." (Revelation 17:6)**

**Answer:**

This verse reveals the horrific result of uniting church and state.

1.  **Persecution:**
    - When a church loses the power of love, it resorts to the power of law.
      History testifies to the millions who suffered during the Dark Ages
      because they refused to bow to the dogmas of the dominant church.
    - **The Spirit of Cain:** Just as Cain slew Abel because his own works were
      evil and his brother's righteous (1 John 3:12), a fallen church persecutes
      those who uphold the simplicity of Bible truth.

2.  **"Drunken":**
    - The imagery suggests an intoxicating madness. Persecution is irrational.
      It suppresses the conscience and destroys the very people Christ came to
      save.

3.  **The Contrast:**
    - Christ says, "Love your enemies" (Matthew 5:44).
    - Babylon says, "Destroy those who disagree."
    - This proves that Babylon is devoid of the Spirit of Christ, for "if any
      man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his" (Romans 8:9).

### Q6. What was in the hand of this woman?

**"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold
and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of
abominations and filthiness of her fornication." (Revelation 17:4)**

**Answer:**

1.  **External Beauty vs. Internal Poison:**
    - The woman is attractive to the eyes—rich, ornamented, and colorful. This
      represents the pomp, ceremony, glorious architecture, and sensory appeal
      of false worship.
    - However, the cup in her hand contains "abominations."

2.  **The Golden Cup:**
    - In the sanctuary service, golden vessels were used for holy purposes.
      Here, Satan has produced a counterfeit.
    - **Contents of the Cup:** This represents false doctrines that look like
      truth (the gold cup) but are actually deadly poison. These include:
      - Tradition above Scripture.
      - Sunday sacredness in place of the Bible Sabbath.
      - The natural immortality of the soul (Spiritualism).
      - Salvation by works/penance.

3.  **Sanctuary Contrast:**
    - Jesus offers us the "cup of salvation" (Psalm 116:13) and the "water of
      life" (Revelation 22:17). Babylon offers the wine of confusion. One
      cleanses the conscience; the other stupifies it.

**[ILL]** A pharmacist may take a bottle labeled "Medicine" and fill it with
poison. The bottle looks legitimate and trustworthy, but the contents bring
death. The "Golden Cup" is the church's authority and prestige, which people
trust. But if the doctrine inside contradicts the Bible, it is a cup of poison.

### Q7. What effect had this wine (false doctrine) upon those to whom it was given?

**"And the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her
fornication." (Revelation 17:2)**

**Answer:**

1.  **Spiritual Drunkenness:**
    - Physical drunkenness causes a loss of reason, balance, and distinct
      vision.
    - Spiritual drunkenness causes men to lose the ability to distinguish
      between truth and error. They become "dizzy" with exciting theories,
      emotionalism, or complicated theologies that obscure the plain "Thus saith
      the Lord."

2.  **The Effect on the Nations:**
    - The verse says "inhabitants of the earth." This is a global deception.
    - When people drink this wine, they no longer regard the Law of God. They
      may zealously practice religion, but without the transformative power of
      the Holy Spirit.

3.  **The Remedy:**
    - To cure drunkenness, one must stop drinking the intoxicant. The call of
      the Second Angel is a call to sobriety—to stop imbibing the errors of
      tradition and return to the clear, cold water of Bible truth.

### Q8. This woman is said to be the "mother" of harlots. Are there any churches which have sprung from the mother church of Rome, directly or indirectly, and which resemble her in doctrine or otherwise?

**Answer:**

The user provided Note quotes sources (Catholic Christian Instructed; Hopkins)
indicating that Protestant churches have retained "Roman" elements.

1.  **The Family Relationship:**
    - **The Mother:** The Papacy (Rome).
    - **The Daughters:** Churches that came out of Rome during the Reformation
      but did not continue to advance in truth. They retained key doctrines of
      the Mother, such as the observance of the first day of the week (Sunday)
      instead of the seventh-day Sabbath, and the belief in the conscious state
      of the dead.

2.  **Incomplete Reformation:**
    - The Reformation was a glorious work of God, but it was not completed by
      the first reformers (Luther, Calvin, Knox, etc.). God intended light to
      shine brighter and brighter (Proverbs 4:18).
    - When Protestant churches stopped advancing and codified their creeds,
      refusing new light from the Bible, they began to resemble the Mother. They
      began to seek the aid of the state and to persecute dissenters, just as
      Rome had done.

3.  **Defining "Harlotry" in this Context:**
    - It is an unlawful union with the world. When Protestant churches become
      "fashionable," seek political influence to enforce their decrees, or
      dilute the Bible to please modern culture, they are walking in the
      footsteps of the Mother.

### Q9. What confessions have been made by leading men, which show that they consider the churches to be in a fallen condition?

**Answer:**

The provided quotes from G.F. Pentecost and Robert Atkins highlight a tragic
reality:

1.  **Loss of Discipline and Purity:**
    - The quotes describe churches filled with "wicked, unholy, corrupt men" who
      are protected by their wealth. This is the exact opposite of the New
      Testament church, which was pure and separate from the world.
    - **Covetousness:** "Lovers of the world... aspirers after respectability."
      When the church seeks to be rich and respected by society rather than holy
      before God, she has fallen.

2.  **The Laodicean Condition:**
    - The description mirrors Revelation 3:17: "Thou sayest, I am rich, and
      increased with goods, and have need of nothing."
    - This spiritual pride blinds the church to her true need: the "gold tried
      in the fire" (faith and love) and "white raiment" (the righteousness of
      Christ).

3.  **RBF Application:**
    - A church that tolerates known sin among its members while maintaining a
      "form" of religion denies the power of the Gospel. The Gospel is the power
      of God to _liberate_ from sin, not just to forgive it while leaving the
      sinner in bondage.

### Q10. What does Paul say of the condition of the church in the last days?

**"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men
shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,...
lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but
denying the power thereof: from such turn away." (2 Timothy 3:1–5)**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Location of the Evil:**
    - Paul is not describing the secular world here; he is describing those who
      have a "form of godliness"—professed Christians.
    - The list of sins (selfishness, pride, covetousness) marks the character of
      those who claim to serve God but serve self.

2.  **"Denying the Power":**
    - **Definition:** What is the power of godliness? It is the Gospel (Romans
      1:16). It is the Holy Spirit's ability to circumcise the heart and write
      God's law upon it (Colossians 2:11).
    - To deny the power is to claim that one can be a Christian while continuing
      to live in willful sin. It is the teaching that we cannot overcome sin, or
      that God's law need not be kept.

3.  **Sanctification:**
    - True religion is not just a "form" (outward ritual/attendance), but a
      transformation of nature. God's plan is to restore the image of God in
      man.
    - **The Command:** "From such turn away." We cannot remain in fellowship
      with a system that promotes a form of religion while denying the power of
      Christ to give victory over sin.

### Q11. How does the prophet elsewhere describe the condition of Babylon?

**"Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of
devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and
hateful bird." (Revelation 18:2)**

**Answer:**

1.  **Progressive Degradation:**
    - Revelation 14 announces the fall; Revelation 18 shows the final, utter
      corruption. Rejection of truth is not static—it leads to greater darkness.
    - When the Spirit of God is grieved away by the rejection of light, other
      spirits take possession (Matthew 12:43–45).

2.  **Spiritualism:**
    - "Habitation of devils." This predicts that in the last days, fallen
      Christianity will open the door to demonic deceptions—likely through the
      belief that the dead are alive (Spiritualism). This opens the church to
      "doctrines of devils" (1 Timothy 4:1).

3.  **Sanctuary Imagery:**
    - The "unclean and hateful bird" recalls the birds of prey that would
      attempt to devour the sacrifice. The church, meant to be a temple for the
      Holy Ghost, becomes a "cage" for unclean spirits.

### Q12. Where will many of God's people be found when this cry is at its height?

**"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people,
that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."
(Revelation 18:4)**

**Answer:**

This is one of the most hopeful and tender verses in the prophecy.

1.  **"My People":**
    - God acknowledges that He has many true, sincere children currently inside
      the confusion of Babylon. They love the Lord and are living up to all the
      light they have.
    - They are not Babylon; they are _in_ Babylon. God does not condemn them for
      being there, but He loves them too much to let them stay there as the
      plagues approach.

2.  **The Call to Separation:**
    - Why must they come out? "That ye be not partakers of her sins."
    - Association inevitably influences character. If we remain in a system that
      teaches error and lowers God's law, we will eventually partake of that
      sin.
    - **Corporate Responsibility:** To financially and physically support a
      system that fights against God's final truth is to share in its guilt.

3.  **The Meaning of "Coming Out":**
    - It means physically withdrawing membership and support from apostate
      bodies.
    - It also means spiritually separating from the principles of Babylon
      (pride, force, tradition) and embracing the principles of Jesus.

**[ILL]** If a building is condemned and the foundation is crumbling, a fireman
shouts, "Get out!" He does this to save the people, not to insult the building.
The message of the Second Angel is a rescue mission.

---

### Q13. In this call to "come out" of Babylon, what message does the Lord send to guide His people into the truth for these days?

**"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man
worship the beast and his image... the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath
of God... Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." (Revelation 14:9–12)**

**Answer:**

When God calls His people _out_ of something, He always calls them _into_
something better.

1.  **The Destination:**
    - Those who come out of Babylon do not wander aimlessly. They gather under
      the banner of the **Third Angel's Message**.
    - They join a people identified by two key characteristics:
      1.  **Keeping the Commandments of God:** Not just nine, but all ten,
          including the Sabbath which Babylon has attempted to change.
      2.  **The Faith of Jesus:** Not just faith _in_ Jesus, but the quality of
          faith _of_ Jesus—a faith that trusts the Father completely and yields
          total obedience.

2.  **The Remedy for Babylon's Wine:**
    - Babylon offers the "wine of fornication" (lawlessness). The Third Angel
      points to the "Commandments of God" (lawfulness).
    - Babylon offers a "form of godliness." The Third Angel offers the "faith of
      Jesus"—the power of the Gospel to make us commandment-keepers in heart and
      life.

3.  **Righteousness by Faith (The Core):**
    - Verse 12 is the perfect description of Righteousness by Faith.
    - We cannot keep the Commandments by our own power. It requires the "Faith
      of Jesus" dwelling in us.
    - When we have His faith, His life is lived out in us, and the righteousness
      of the law is fulfilled in us (Romans 8:4). This is the group prepared to
      meet the Lord.
