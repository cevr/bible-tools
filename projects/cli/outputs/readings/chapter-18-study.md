### Q1. What is necessary to salvation?
"And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 18:3.

**Answer:**
The words of our Saviour here are absolute and uncompromising. He does not suggest that conversion is merely helpful or an improvement to one's life; He declares it to be an indispensable condition for entrance into the kingdom of heaven.

*   **A Radical Change:** The term "converted" implies a complete turnaround. By nature, the human heart is "deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked" (Jeremiah 17:9) and is at "enmity against God" (Romans 8:7). Therefore, the natural man cannot simply be educated or improved into salvation; he must be transformed.
*   **The Condition of Humility:** Jesus specifies becoming "as little children." This strikes at the root of human pride. To be saved, one must realize their own helplessness and dependence on God, just as a child depends entirely on its parents.
*   **No Exceptions:** The word "except" (unless) closes the door to all other methods. Neither heritage, nor social standing, nor outward morality can substitute for the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a clock that is mechanically broken; the gears are stripped and the mainspring is snapped. You may polish the glass, paint the hands gold, and hang it on the finest wall, but it will never keep time until the internal mechanism is completely repaired or replaced. So it is with man: outward polish (manners, education, culture) cannot fix the broken mainspring of the heart. We must be converted—remade from the inside out.

### Q2. What is the general sense of the word "conversion?"
"A turning or change from one state to another." Webster.
NOTE.—Water is converted, or changed, into ice; forests and rough places are converted, or changed, into fruitful fields and pleasant habitations; and man, perverted by sin, must be converted, or changed from a state of sin to one of holiness, to be saved at last in the kingdom of God.

**Answer:**
In the spiritual sense, conversion is the process by which a sinner is turned from a life of transgression to a life of obedience, from serving self to serving God.

*   **A Change of Masters:** We are all servants to whomever we obey (Romans 6:16). Conversion is the pivotal moment where allegiance shifts from Satan and self to Jesus Christ.
*   **A Change of Nature:** It is not merely painting over the old life. As the note suggests, it is like a rough field being turned into a garden. The weeds (sins) are uprooted, the soil (the heart) is broken up by the plow of the Word, and new seeds (righteousness) are planted.
*   **Restoration:** Man was "perverted" (twisted away from the straight line of truth) by the fall in Eden. Conversion is the work of God to restore the moral image of the Creator in the human soul (Colossians 3:10).

**[ILL]**
Consider the caterpillar. It crawls on the earth, consuming leaves. But when it undergoes metamorphosis, it emerges as a butterfly. It does not just crawl faster; it flies. It has a new nature and a new environment. Conversion is the metamorphosis of the soul—from crawling in the dust of sin to soaring in the atmosphere of grace.

---

### Q3. What two steps are necessary to make this change?
"And have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ." Acts 20:20-21.

**Answer:**
The Apostle Paul summarizes the apostolic message as consisting of two essential elements. These are not separate, isolated acts, but companion steps in the experience of salvation.

1.  **Repentance toward God:**
    *   Why toward God? Because it is God's law that has been broken. Sin is an offense against the Lawgiver (Psalm 51:4). The sinner must acknowledge the authority of the Father and admit their rebellion against His government.
2.  **Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ:**
    *   Why toward Christ? Because while the Father is the Lawgiver who has been offended, Christ is the Mediator and Sacrifice who provides the remedy. Repentance sees the debt; faith grasps the payment.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot be saved by repentance alone (for sorrow does not undo the crime), nor by a faith that ignores our need for cleansing. We must turn *from* sin (repentance) and turn *to* the Saviour (faith).

**[ILL]**
A man falls into a deep pit. To be rescued, two things must happen. First, he must stop digging deeper and look up, realizing his helpless condition (Repentance). Second, he must grasp the rope thrown down to him by the rescuer (Faith). He cannot grasp the rope if his hands are still busy digging in the mud.

---

### Q4. Of what is it necessary to repent?
"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out." Acts 3:19.

**Answer:**
True repentance is specifically directed at **sin**. It is not just a general feeling of sadness, but a recognition of specific acts and attitudes that separate us from God.

*   **The Purpose:** The verse states the goal is "that your sins may be blotted out." This language points directly to the Sanctuary service. In the earthly type, sins were transferred to the sanctuary; on the Day of Atonement, they were cleansed or "blotted out."
*   **The Investigative Judgment:** Before Christ returns, there is a work of judgment where the record of sin is finaly removed from the books of heaven (Daniel 7:9-10). Only sins that have been repented of and forsaken can be blotted out by the blood of Christ.
*   **Atonement:** *Atonement* is the work of reconciling God and man. Repentance is the condition upon which the benefits of the Atonement are applied to the individual.

**Definition:**
*   **Blotting Out of Sins:** The final removal of the record of forgiven sins from the heavenly books, preparing the believer to stand in God's presence without fault (Revelation 14:5).

---

### Q5. What is sin?
"Whosoever committeth sin, transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law." 1 John 3:4.

**Answer:**
The Bible gives a clear, legal definition of sin. It is not merely a mistake, a weakness, or a social faux pas; it is "transgression of the law" (in Greek, *anomia*—lawlessness).

*   **The Standard:** If sin is the transgression of the law, then the law must be the standard of righteousness (Psalm 119:172). One cannot know what constitutes a "crooked" line without a "straight" ruler.
*   **The Nature of Rebellion:** To sin is to step across the boundary line God has set for human happiness. It is an act of rebellion against the government of Heaven.
*   **No Ambiguity:** This definition protects us from vague spirituality. We are not left to guess what pleases God; He has written it in His law.

---

### Q6. What law does one transgress when he sins?
"But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors." "For He that said [margin, that law which said], Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law." James 2:9-11.

**Answer:**
James clearly identifies the law in question by quoting from the **Ten Commandments** (Exodus 20).

*   **The Moral Law:** The text cites "Do not commit adultery" and "Do not kill." This proves that the Ten Commandments are the standard by which sin is defined in the New Testament era.
*   **The Unity of the Law:** James emphasizes that the law is a perfect unit. You cannot pick and choose. To break one precept is to break the whole chain, for the authority of the Lawgiver is behind every commandment.
*   **Respect of Persons:** Even "small" sins like favoritism (respect of persons) are identified as transgressions of this same law.

**[ILL]**
A boat moored to the dock by a chain of ten links is secure. If nine links are solid steel, but one link is broken, the boat drifts away. It does not matter which link breaks; the result—separation from the dock—is the same. So it is with the Ten Commandments. Breaking any one of them separates the soul from God.

---

### Q7. What part does the law act in repentance?
"Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin." Rom. 3:20.

**Answer:**
This verse is crucial for understanding the relationship between Law and Gospel.

*   **The Function of the Law:** The law gives the "knowledge of sin." It acts as a diagnostic tool. It reveals our condition but provides no cure.
*   **Not a Method of Salvation:** "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified." We cannot be saved by keeping the law, because we have already broken it. Future obedience cannot atone for past disobedience.
*   **Leading to Christ:** By showing us our hopelessness and guilt, the law acts as a "schoolmaster" to bring us to Christ (Galatians 3:24). It shuts our mouths and stops our boasting, forcing us to cry out for mercy.

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** A legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is accounted righteous. It is an act of grace, received by faith, not earned by works (Romans 3:24-28).

**[ILL]**
A mirror is useful to show a man that his face is dirty, but he cannot wash his face with the mirror. He must go to the water and soap. The Law is the mirror that reveals the dirt of sin; Christ's blood is the fountain that washes it away (Zechariah 13:1).

---

### Q8. When Paul was converted, what first brought conviction to him?
"I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." Rom. 7:7.

**Answer:**
Paul (then Saul) was a Pharisee who kept the outward letter of the law perfectly (Philippians 3:6). Yet, the Spirit used the tenth commandment, "Thou shalt not covet," to pierce his heart.

*   **Internal Spirituality of the Law:** Paul realized that the law judges not just actions, but motives and desires ("lust"). He could control his hands, but he could not control his covetous heart without divine aid.
*   **Conviction:** This realization slew his self-righteousness ("sin revived, and I died," Romans 7:9). He saw that despite his religious exterior, he was a sinner in need of a Saviour.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** This teaches us that true commandment-keeping is a matter of the heart (love), which is only possible when Christ dwells within (Romans 8:3-4).

---

### Q9. What more than conviction is necessary to true repentance?
"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world worketh death." 2 Cor. 7:10.

**Answer:**
Conviction is knowing you are wrong; repentance is being sorry for it and turning from it. Paul distinguishes between two types of sorrow:

1.  **Godly Sorrow:** This is sorrow for the sin itself—grief for having broken God's law and wounded the Saviour. It leads to a change of life ("repentance to salvation"). It is a response to the love of God.
2.  **Sorrow of the World:** This is sorrow for the *consequences* of sin. It is the regret of getting caught, losing reputation, or facing punishment. It does not lead to a change of heart (e.g., Judas Iscariot, Esau).

**[ILL]**
A thief in prison may be sorry he is behind bars (worldly sorrow), but if released, he would steal again. A converted man is sorry he stole, because he realizes stealing is wrong and hurts his neighbor and God (godly sorrow). Even if there were no prison, he would not steal again.

---

### Q10. What does repentance involve?
"Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit." Eze. 18:30, 31.

**Answer:**
Repentance is active, not passive. It involves a deliberate break from the past.

*   **Turning and Casting:** The sinner must "turn" and "cast away" transgression. We cannot hold onto a "pet sin" with one hand and hold onto Jesus with the other.
*   **The Cooperation of Faith:** God commands, "Make you a new heart." Yet elsewhere He promises, "A new heart also will I give you" (Ezekiel 36:26). How do we reconcile this? We make the new heart by *choosing* to yield our will to God, and He performs the miracle of recreation. We supply the consent; He supplies the power.
*   **Victory:** The goal is that "iniquity shall not be your ruin." God intends for His people to have victory over the sins that once enslaved them.

---

### Q11. What does repentance further require?
"Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him." Isa. 55:6, 7.

**Answer:**
Isaiah deepens the definition of repentance to include the mind and the will.

*   **Forsaking Thoughts:** It is not enough to stop the outward action ("his way"); the "thoughts" must also be forsaken. The imagination and the affections must be purified. This is the work of sanctification.
*   **Urgency:** "While He may be found." There is a time of probation. The door of mercy does not stand open forever (Genesis 6:3).
*   **The Promise:** "He will have mercy... and abundantly pardon." The focus is not on the difficulty of the change, but on the greatness of God's grace.

---

### Q12. How will genuine repentance be shown?
"Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance [margin, answerable to amendment of life] ." Matt. 3:8.

**Answer:**
John the Baptist taught that an internal change produces external evidence.

*   **Fruits:** Just as a healthy apple tree naturally produces apples, a converted heart naturally produces good works (Ephesians 2:10).
*   **Restitution:** If we have stolen, we return it. If we have injured, we apologize. If we have lied, we confess. This is "amendment of life." (See Ezekiel 33:15; Luke 19:8).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** These works do not save us; they are the *result* of being saved. They show that the faith is alive (James 2:26).

**[ILL]**
If a man claims to be a master gardener, but his garden is full of weeds and dead plants, you doubt his claim. If a man claims to be a Christian but his life is full of bitterness, dishonesty, and impurity, his profession is vain. The fruit proves the root.

---

### Q13. What besides repentance is required in conversion?
"Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ." Acts 20:21.

**Answer:**
As noted in Q3, faith is the necessary counterpart to repentance. Repentance empties the heart of self and sin; faith fills it with Christ. Without faith, repentance is merely despair (like Judas). Faith looks away from the self-condemnation of the law to the mercy of the Redeemer.

---

### Q14. Who is Christ, that one should believe in Him?
"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16.

**Answer:**
The object of our faith is not a doctrine, but a Person—the divine Son of God.

*   **The Gift of the Father:** Salvation originates in the love of the Father. He gave His most precious possession.
*   **His Divinity:** Only the "only begotten Son"—He who is equal with God—could pay the infinite debt of sin. A created being could not atone for the violation of God's eternal law.
*   **The Exchange:** He took our death ("perish") that we might have His life ("everlasting life").

---

### Q15. What has Christ done for us that we should be saved through Him?
"Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures." 1 Cor. 15:3.

**Answer:**
*   **Substitution:** "Christ died *for* our sins." He stood in our place. The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), and Christ paid those wages on the cross.
*   **According to Scripture:** His death was the fulfillment of the entire Old Testament sanctuary system. Every lamb sacrificed on Jewish altars pointed forward to this moment.
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** As the sacrifice in the Outer Court (Calvary), He provided the blood that makes atonement possible.

**Definition:**
*   **Atonement:** The work by which God and man are brought back into oneness ("at-one-ment") through Christ’s sacrifice and priestly ministry.

---

### Q16. In order for one to be cleansed from sin, what is required of Him?
"But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:7-9.

**Answer:**
This passage outlines the ongoing life of the converted believer.

1.  **Walk in the Light:** We must live according to the truth we know. To reject light (truth) is to choose darkness.
2.  **Confession:** "If we confess..." Genuine confession is specific and heartfelt.
3.  **Twofold Work of Grace:**
    *   **Forgiveness:** He removes the guilt (Justification).
    *   **Cleansing:** He removes the "unrighteousness" or the habit/power of sin (Sanctification).
4.  **Faithful and Just:** God is faithful to His promise, and He is *just* in forgiving us because the penalty has been paid by our Substitute.

**RBF Note:** Note that the blood *cleanses* (present tense). It is a present power to give victory over sin, not just a past record of forgiveness.

---

### Q17. What should be one's relation to sin after repentance?
"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?" Rom. 6:1, 2.

**Answer:**
Paul firmly rejects the idea that grace allows for continued sinning (antinomianism).

*   **God Forbid:** A strong negative. It is impossible for a truly converted man to cherish sin.
*   **Dead to Sin:** The relationship has changed. A dead man does not respond to stimuli. If we are dead to sin, the temptations of the world should lose their power over us because the "old man" is deceased.
*   **Victory:** The gospel is not an arrangement to save us *in* our sins, but *from* our sins (Matthew 1:21).

---

### Q18. How does one become dead to sin?
"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin." Rom. 6:6.

**Answer:**
*   **Crucifixion:** Death to self is painful and absolute. It happens "with Him." By faith, we identify with Christ on the cross.
*   **The Old Man:** This represents the carnal nature, the selfish ego that wants to rule. It must be "destroyed" (rendered powerless).
*   **Freedom from Slavery:** The result is that we "henceforth [from now on] should not serve sin." Sin is a master; conversion breaks the chains of slavery so we are free to obey God.

**[ILL]**
A slave who dies is no longer under the authority of his master. The master may shout orders, but the dead slave does not obey. When we are "crucified with Christ," Sin (the old master) may shout temptations, but we are dead to his voice and alive only to Christ.

---

### Q19. What is done with the "old man" after he dies?
"Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life." Rom. 6:4.

**Answer:**
*   **Burial:** Baptism is the funeral service for the old life. It publicly testifies that the old life of sin is dead and buried.
*   **Resurrection:** We come out of the water to "walk in newness of life." This is the impartation of the life of Christ to the believer.
*   **Newness:** We do not live the old life with a new name; we live a *new* life with a *new* power.

---

### Q20. When truly converted, what does everyone receive?
"Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." Acts 2:38.

**Answer:**
NOTE.—Therefore every real conversion is a miracle of divine grace.

*   **The Gift:** The Holy Spirit is the personal representative of Christ. He brings the presence of Jesus into the heart.
*   **The Power:** Without the Spirit, we cannot overcome one sin or understand one spiritual truth. The Spirit supplies the power to live the new life.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** In the Holy Place, the oil in the lamps represents the Holy Spirit, illuminating the life of the believer.

---

### Q21. Can anyone be a Christian without having the Spirit of Christ?
"Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His." Rom. 8:9.

**Answer:**
This is a searching test.

*   **Identity:** A Christian is not defined by church membership, family lineage, or intellectual belief. A Christian is one who is indwelt by the Spirit of Christ.
*   **Character:** The "Spirit of Christ" is a spirit of love, sacrifice, humility, and obedience. If these traits are entirely absent, the Spirit is absent, and the claim to Christianity is false.

---

### Q22. What precious relation is sustained when one has the Holy Spirit?
"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." Rom. 8:14.

**Answer:**
*   **Adoption:** We become members of the Royal Family of the universe. God becomes "Abba, Father."
*   **Guidance:** The mark of a son is that he is "led" by the Spirit. He does not follow the dictates of his own heart or the fashions of the world.
*   **Privilege:** As sons, we have direct access to the Father through Christ (Ephesians 2:18).

---

### Q23. Can it be known when this relation exists?
"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God." Rom. 8:16.

**Answer:**
*   **Assurance:** God does not leave us in doubt. There is an internal witness—a peace that passes understanding—confirming our acceptance.
*   **Harmony:** The Spirit bears witness *with* our spirit. This means our conscience is clean, our will is surrendered, and we find our hearts in harmony with God's Word (which the Spirit inspired). The Spirit never witnesses against the written Word.

---

### Q24. When one thus stands complete in Christ, what is he?
"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new." 2 Cor. 5:17.

**Answer:**
*   **Re-Creation:** The Greek term implies a "new creation." It is as miraculous as when God spoke the worlds into existence.
*   **Total Transformation:** "All things are become new." New motives, new tastes, new habits, new companions, new hopes. The things we once loved (sin), we now hate; the things we once hated (holiness), we now love.
*   **RBF:** This is righteousness *imparted*—Christ's life actually lived out in the believer.

---

### Q25. Of what character are the "old things" which are to be put off?
"But now ye also put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds." Col. 3:8, 9.

**Answer:**
Paul gets practical. The "old things" are not just vague concepts; they are specific sins of the temper and the tongue.

*   **Sins of the Temper:** Anger, wrath, malice. These are contrary to the character of Jesus.
*   **Sins of the Tongue:** Blasphemy, filthy language, lying.
*   **The Requirement:** These must be "put off" like dirty clothes. A converted man cannot continue to be a liar or have an uncontrollable temper. The grace of Christ is sufficient to overcome these traits.

---

### Q26. What will the new man acquire?
"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering: forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness." Col. 3:12-14.

**Answer:**
*   **The Wardrobe of Heaven:** We are to "put on" the character of Christ.
*   **The Virtues:** Mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, patience (long-suffering), forgiveness.
*   **Charity (Love):** The "bond of perfectness." Love is the glue that holds all other virtues together. It is the fulfilling of the law (Romans 13:10).
*   **Sanctification:** This process of putting on these virtues is the work of a lifetime, growing up into the full stature of Christ.

**[ILL]**
When a soldier joins the army, he takes off his civilian clothes (the old man) and puts on the uniform (the new man). The uniform identifies who he serves. The virtues of kindness and humility are the uniform of the Christian soldier.

---

### Q27. Where will the affections then be found?
"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth." Col. 3:1, 2.

**Answer:**
*   **Heavenly Mindedness:** Because the believer is a citizen of heaven (Philippians 3:20), their heart is there.
*   **Sanctuary Focus:** "Where Christ sitteth." Our attention is directed to the heavenly sanctuary, where Jesus is ministering as our High Priest. We follow Him by faith into the presence of God.
*   **Detachment:** We are in the world, but not of it. We hold earthly possessions loosely, while grasping eternal realities tightly.

---

### Q28. Having done all this, what will be the final result?
"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory." Col. 3:3, 4.

**Answer:**
*   **Security:** "Your life is hid with Christ." Satan cannot touch the life that is entrusted to the Saviour's keeping.
*   **The Blessed Hope:** The Christian looks forward to the Second Coming ("When Christ... shall appear").
*   **Glorification:** Conversion leads to sanctification, and sanctification ends in glorification. The humble, converted believer, who perhaps was unknown and despised on earth, will shine with the glory of Christ when He returns.

**Definition:**
*   **Glorification:** The final step of salvation where the mortal body is changed to immortality and the believer is physically removed from the presence of sin to dwell with God (1 Corinthians 15:51-54).
