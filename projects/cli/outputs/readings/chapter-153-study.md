### Q1. Does the Lord care whether or not we are prompt in paying the poor?
"Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates: at his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee." Deut. 24:14, 15.

**Answer:**
The Bible reveals that God takes a personal interest in the financial transactions of His people, particularly regarding the vulnerable. This passage establishes several vital principles of practical godliness:

*   **God defends the vulnerable:** The "stranger" (foreigner/immigrant) and the "poor" often lack legal or social power to enforce their rights. God steps in as their Defender (Psalm 68:5).
*   **Promptness is a moral duty:** Delaying payment is not merely a clerical error; Scripture calls it *oppression*. For a worker living hand-to-mouth, a delay in wages means a delay in food for their family. To withhold what is due is a violation of the eighth commandment ("Thou shalt not steal").
*   **The cry of the oppressed:** Just as the blood of Abel "cried" from the ground, the distress of the unpaid worker rises to heaven. This connects to the **Sanctuary**, where God hears the prayers and cries of the earth. He is not indifferent to injustice.

**Sanctification** (the work of the Holy Spirit making the believer holy in character) includes our business practices. A man cannot be a true Christian on Sabbath while being a tyrant or a cheat on Monday. The life of Christ in the soul produces mercy, justice, and promptness in meeting obligations.

**[ILL]** A wealthy farmer hires a neighbor to fix his fence, promising to pay him at sunset. At sunset, the farmer is tired and thinks, "I will pay him next week; the money is safe in my pocket." Meanwhile, the neighbor walks home empty-handed, unable to buy milk for his children that evening. The farmer has not just delayed a payment; he has crushed a spirit. The Christian’s ledger is kept not only on earth but in the books of heaven.

### Q2. What is said of the hire of the laborers which is kept back by the rich men of the last days?
"Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth." James 5:4.

**Answer:**
This passage is a specific prophecy regarding the economic conditions of the "last days" (James 5:3). It paints a stark picture of the contrast between the hoarding of wealth and the suffering of the working class.

*   **The Lord of Sabaoth:** This title means "Lord of Hosts" (armies). It implies that the God of the universe is ready to battle on behalf of the defrauded.
*   **The Recording Angel:** The text says the cries have "entered into the ears of the Lord." In the **Investigative Judgment**—the phase of judgment prior to Christ's return—every act of fraud and every withheld wage stands as a witness against the soul unless confessed and rectified.
*   **Righteousness by Faith vs. Fraud:** A person claiming to have faith in Christ while systematically defrauding others possesses a dead faith (James 2:17). **Righteousness by Faith** is not a cloak to cover sin; it is a transforming power that writes the law of love on the heart (Hebrews 8:10). A heart filled with Christ cannot exploit another human being.

**[ILL]** Imagine a man praying loudly in a prayer meeting, asking for God’s blessing. Yet, the sound of his prayer is drowned out in heaven by the noise of coins he withheld from his employees. God hears the cry of the injustice louder than the profession of piety.

### Q3. With whom are they classed who defraud the laborer of his hire?
"And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages." Mal. 3:5.

**Answer:**
God places financial dishonesty in the same category as the most abhorrent sins.

*   **The Company they Keep:** Those who oppress hirelings are listed alongside:
    1.  **Sorcerers:** Those involved in witchcraft and rebellion against God.
    2.  **Adulterers:** Those who destroy the sanctity of the family.
    3.  **False Swearers:** Perjurers who lie under oath.
*   **The Severity of the Sin:** We often categorize sins, thinking financial stinginess is a "minor" flaw compared to sorcery or adultery. God sees it differently. Selfishness is the root of all sin. To rob a laborer of his livelihood is to demonstrate a character completely devoid of the love of God.
*   **Swift Witness:** In the final judgment, God does not need a jury. He Himself is the witness to the secret dealings of the business life.

**Justification** (being declared righteous by God) is a legal standing we receive by faith, but it is always followed by a changed life. If a man is truly justified, he will turn from oppression just as he turns from sorcery.

### Q4. Will any of these enter the new Jerusalem?
"For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie." Rev. 22:15.

**Answer:**
No. The New Jerusalem is a place of perfect integrity and love.

*   **"Maketh a Lie":** Fraud, embezzlement, and withholding wages are practical lies. They are actions that say, "This money is mine," when in reality, it belongs to another.
*   **Fitness for Heaven:** Salvation is by grace alone, but grace transforms the character to fit the environment of heaven. If a person who loves to cheat were admitted to heaven, they would bring the seed of discord and selfishness into a perfect universe. God's work of **Atonement** (reconciling man to God) involves cleansing the sinner from the *desire* to sin.
*   **The Seal of God:** The 144,000 are described as having "no guile" (deceit) in their mouths (Revelation 14:5). Absolute honesty is a mark of God's remnant people.

**[ILL]** A counterfeit coin may pass unnoticed in a dark alley, but under the bright light of a bank teller’s lamp, it is rejected. In this world, shady business deals may pass in the darkness of human ignorance, but in the light of God's glory at the gate of the New Jerusalem, only the pure gold of a Christ-like character will pass.

### Q5. How does the Bible reprove those who stint their laborers?
"For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward." 1 Tim. 5:18. "Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning." Lev. 19:13.

**Answer:**
The Bible reproves stinginess by appealing to the principle of fair exchange and the dignity of work.

*   **The Lesson of the Ox:** Paul quotes the Old Testament law regarding animals (Deuteronomy 25:4). If God requires us to be generous even to a working animal, allowing it to eat while it works, how much more should we treat human beings—created in the image of God—with generosity?
*   **Robbery:** Leviticus 19:13 equates delaying wages with "robbery." We might think robbery requires a mask and a gun, but in God's sight, keeping money that belongs to someone else past the due time is theft.
*   **Sanctuary Application:** In the earthly sanctuary service, a trespass offering was required for sins against a neighbor's property (Leviticus 6:1–6). This offering required **restitution** (paying back what was taken plus 20%). This teaches us that true repentance involves making things right with our fellow man whenever possible.

### Q6. Are we responsible for the loss by theft of goods that were entrusted to our care?
"If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbor's goods." "And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn." Ex. 22:8, 12, 13.

**Answer:**
Yes, under specific circumstances, we are responsible for what is entrusted to us. This teaches the principle of **Stewardship**.

1.  **Accountability:** If we agree to keep a neighbor's goods, we become the guardian of that property. If it is stolen due to our lack of watchfulness, we bear the loss.
2.  **Evidence of Innocence:** If an unavoidable accident happens (like a wild beast tearing the animal), the guardian must bring evidence ("bring it for witness"). God is reasonable; He does not demand the impossible, but He demands honesty.
3.  **Spiritual Application:** We are stewards of God's goods—our time, talents, and bodies. If we are careless with the Lord's "property" and allow the enemy of souls to steal our affections, we are accountable to the Judge of all the earth.

**[ILL]** If you borrow a friend’s car and leave it unlocked with the keys in the ignition, and it is stolen, you are morally responsible to replace it. You cannot say, "It was a thief, not me." Your negligence paved the way for the thief. So it is with our duties to God and man; we must be vigilant.

### Q7. Do we become debtors through our own negligence?
"If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution." Ex. 22:6.

**Answer:**
Yes. In God's law, sin is not just malicious intent; it is also a lack of care that harms others.

*   **The Law of Negligence:** If a man lights a fire on his own land (a lawful act), but fails to contain it, and it spreads to his neighbor's crop, he is liable. He did not *intend* to burn the neighbor's corn, but his carelessness caused the loss.
*   **Restitution:** The text says he "shall surely make restitution." Sincere sorrow is not enough; the loss must be repaid.
*   **The Golden Rule:** "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12). If our property were destroyed by another's carelessness, we would desire compensation. Therefore, the law of love requires us to do the same.

**Sanctification** involves becoming a careful, thoughtful person. A sanctified mind is not reckless. It considers the consequences of actions upon others.

### Q8. If a man wantonly or with malice aforethought, commits injury or entails loss, what redress is required of him?
"If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution." Ex. 22:5.

**Answer:**
When damage is done intentionally or through direct action (like letting one's beast graze in another's field), the law requires the highest form of restitution.

*   **Best for Best:** Note the strict requirement: he must pay from the *best* of his own field. He cannot repay with damaged or inferior produce. He must give his highest quality to replace what he destroyed.
*   **The Spirit of the Law:** This ensures the offender truly feels the cost of his action and restores the victim fully.
*   **Gospel Parallel:** In a spiritual sense, Adam's sin robbed God of a perfect humanity. Christ, the Second Adam, made "restitution" not by offering a blemished sacrifice, but by offering Himself—the very **Best of Heaven**—to satisfy the claims of the broken law and redeem the lost possession.

**[ILL]** If a boy breaks a neighbor’s window while throwing rocks in anger, it is not enough for the father to glue the shards together. The father must pay for a brand new pane of glass, perhaps even better than the one before, to fully restore the home.

### Q9. Does God's code hold us responsible for what we borrow?
"And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good. But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for his hire." Ex. 22:14, 15.

**Answer:**
Yes. Borrowing creates a sacred trust.

*   **Full Responsibility:** If you borrow an item (an animal, a tool, money) for your own benefit, you act as its insurer. If it breaks while in your care (and the owner isn't there managing it), you must replace it.
*   **Distinction:** If the owner is present and managing the animal, the borrower is not liable for accidents, as the owner is still in control.
*   **The Debt of Honor:** This teaches us to be more careful with other people's property than we are with our own.
*   **Spiritual Lesson:** We have "borrowed" our life and breath from God. We are not our own; we are bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:19–20). We are responsible for how we use this borrowed life.

### Q10. What is said concerning those who lend upon usury?
"Thou shalt not lend upon usury [exorbitant interest] to thy brother, usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury." Deut. 23:19.

**Answer:**
The Bible strongly condemns charging interest ("usury") when lending to the poor or to a brother in need.

*   **Definition of Usury:** In the biblical context, this often referred to *any* interest charged to a poor person who borrowed for survival (food, basic needs). To profit from another man's distress is a sin against God.
*   **Financial Freedom:** God desires His people to be free from the bondage of debt. "The borrower is servant to the lender" (Proverbs 22:7).
*   **Generosity vs. Profit:** The Christian spirit is one that lends, "hoping for nothing again" (Luke 6:35) when relieving the suffering. While modern commercial investing is different from the survival-lending described here, the principle remains: do not exploit the vulnerable for financial gain.

**Righteousness by Faith** produces a heart that trusts God for provision rather than squeezing the poor to increase wealth.

### Q11. Do we owe one another even deeds of kindness?
"If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him." Ex. 23:4, 5.

**Answer:**
Yes. Our obligation to others extends beyond mere financial honesty; it includes active benevolence, even to those who dislike us.

*   **Love Your Enemy:** This Old Testament law anticipates Jesus' command in Matthew 5:44. If your enemy's property is in danger, you have a duty to protect it.
*   **Overcoming Evil with Good:** To ignore the struggling animal because it belongs to an enemy is to harbor the spirit of murder (hatred) in the heart. To help the animal is to break down the wall of hostility.
*   **The Law is Spiritual:** This verse proves that the Ten Commandments were never just a cold legal code; they were always about love.

**[ILL]** Two neighbors are feuding. One sees the other's cow break through a fence and head toward a dangerous ravine. The natural heart says, "Let it fall; he deserves it." The heart where Christ dwells says, "I must save the creature for my neighbor's sake." The latter is the fruit of the Spirit.

### Q12. How does the apostle Paul cover the whole subject?
"Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor. Owe no many anything, but to love one another." Rom. 13:7, 8.

**Answer:**
Paul summarizes the Christian's duty regarding debts and obligations with two encompassing commands:

1.  **Pay what you owe:** Whether it is taxes ("tribute") to the government, respect ("honor") to authorities, or money to creditors, the Christian must be marked by integrity. We should aim to live within our means so we can "owe no man anything."
2.  **The Infinite Debt:** There is one debt we can never fully pay off: the debt of **Love**. Because Christ loved us infinitely and gave His life for us, we are under an eternal obligation to love others.

**Conclusion:**
The gospel of **Righteousness by Faith** provides the power to keep these laws.
*   **Justification** clears our debt of sin before God.
*   **Sanctification** empowers us to live honest, debt-free, generous lives before men.
*   We cannot do this in our own strength. But when Christ dwells in the heart by faith, He makes us honest, diligent, and kind. The man who is truly looking for the return of Jesus will strive to have his accounts balanced and his heart right with his neighbor.

**[ILL]** A specific jar is required to be filled with water. If there are holes in the jar, the water runs out. God pours His love into our hearts, but if we harbor dishonesty, fraud, or hatred (holes), the blessing is lost. We must ask the Great Potter to mend the vessel so we can be full of His love—owing nothing but love to those around us.
