### Q1. To what extent did the wise man test the pleasures of the world?

**"Whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy." Eccl. 2:10.**
**"I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure." Eccl. 2:1.**

**Answer:**
Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, possessed the wealth, power, and wisdom to conduct a total experiment in human happiness. He did not merely sample worldly pleasure; he immersed himself in it completely.

*   **The Experiment of Hedonism:** Solomon removed all restraints. If he saw something beautiful, he acquired it. If he felt a desire for entertainment ("mirth"), he indulged it. This was a deliberate attempt to see if the human heart could find satisfaction in the things of this life alone.
*   **The Nature of the Human Heart:** The heart was created to be the dwelling place of God. When man separated from God in Eden, a void was created. Solomon attempted to fill this infinite void with finite things—riches, laughter, wine, and architecture.
*   **The Futility of Self-Seeking:** The text reveals that seeking pleasure for pleasure's sake is a "test" or a "proof" that ultimately fails. The carnal mind (the mind separated from God) believes that *more* of the world will finally bring peace, but the appetite of the eyes is never satisfied (Proverbs 27:20).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a bucket with a hole in the bottom. You can pour the most expensive wines or the sweetest waters into it, but it will never be full. Solomon poured the world into his heart, but because he had temporarily disconnected from the Source of living water (Jeremiah 2:13), his heart remained empty. Only Christ can fill the soul.

### Q2. How much true enjoyment did such a course afford?

**"Behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun." Eccl. 2:11.**
**"Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness." Prov. 14:13.**

**Answer:**
The result of Solomon’s experiment was total emptiness. He discovered that worldly pleasure is deceptive; it promises happiness but delivers sorrow.

*   **Vanity and Vexation:**
    *   **Vanity:** In Hebrew (*hebel*), this word means "breath" or "vapor." It signifies something fleeting and unsubstantial. The pleasures were temporary.
    *   **Vexation of Spirit:** This implies frustration or a "chasing after wind." Instead of peace, the pursuit of pleasure brought inner turmoil.
*   **The Mask of Laughter:** Proverbs 14:13 reveals a profound psychological truth: outward laughter often masks deep internal pain. Many who appear the happiest in the world are suffering from a guilty conscience or a lack of purpose. The "heaviness" that follows worldly mirth is the inevitable crash that comes when the distraction ends and the soul is left alone with its guilt.
*   **The Need for Peace:** True peace comes only from justification by faith—being made right with God (Romans 5:1). Without the assurance of forgiveness and the presence of Jesus, all "fun" is merely a temporary anesthetic against the reality of life and death.

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ's merits, not their own works (Romans 3:24). It brings peace to the conscience.

### Q3. To whom alone is such mirth enjoyable?

**"Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom." Prov. 15:21.**

**Answer:**
Only those who lack spiritual understanding find genuine satisfaction in "folly" (sinful or trivial amusements).

*   **Destitute of Wisdom:** To be destitute means to be completely without resources. The person who finds joy in sin is spiritually bankrupt. They lack the "mind of Christ" (1 Corinthians 2:16).
*   **The Carnal Nature:** The natural heart is at enmity with God (Romans 8:7). Therefore, it enjoys what God hates. If a Christian finds themselves loving the things of the world more than the things of God, it is a sign that the heart needs a new birth (John 3:3).
*   **A Change of Taste:** Sanctification involves a transformation of our tastes. As we behold Christ, the "pleasures of sin for a season" (Hebrews 11:25) lose their flavor. We begin to hunger and thirst after righteousness (Matthew 5:6) rather than folly.

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to make the believer holy in character, changing their desires to align with God's law (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

### Q4. What conclusion did the wise man reach?

**"Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness." Eccl. 2:13.**

**Answer:**
Solomon concluded that the difference between a sober, wise life and a frivolous, pleasure-seeking life is as stark as the difference between day and night.

*   **Light vs. Darkness:**
    *   **Darkness:** Folly blinds the eyes. The pleasure-seeker stumbles because they do not see the consequences of their actions or the reality of eternity.
    *   **Light:** Wisdom allows one to see reality. Christ is the "Light of the world" (John 8:12). To walk in wisdom is to walk with Christ, seeing life through the lens of the Great Controversy between good and evil.
*   **The Value of Sobriety:** While Solomon found that human wisdom alone could not solve death, he recognized that living with "eyes in his head" (Ecclesiastes 2:14) was infinitely superior to walking blindly in the darkness of sensual gratification.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A man walking through a forest at night without a lantern (folly) is likely to fall into a pit or walk off a cliff. A man walking the same path at noon (wisdom) sees the dangers and avoids them. Sobriety is the daylight of the soul; it allows us to navigate life safely.

### Q5. Why is sobriety preferable to levity?

**"Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better." Eccl. 7:3.**
**"It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart." Eccl. 7:2.**

**Answer:**
This seemingly paradoxical statement teaches that serious reflection—often brought about by sorrow or mourning—is more beneficial to the soul than constant entertainment.

*   **The Benefit of the House of Mourning:** When we face death or tragedy, we are forced to confront the reality of our own mortality. This leads to self-examination: "Am I right with God? What is the purpose of my life?"
*   **Feasting Breeds Forgetfulness:** Constant "feasting" (entertainment, partying, amusement) is often designed to make us forget God and forget that we must give an account of our lives. It keeps the mind in a stupor.
*   **Godly Sorrow:** The Bible speaks of a "godly sorrow" that works repentance to salvation (2 Corinthians 7:10). When we soberly realize the cost of sin—that it cost the life of the Son of God—our hearts are made "better" (purified). We turn to Christ for cleansing. Levity (lightness, triviality) rarely leads to the foot of the Cross; a sober realization of our need does.

**Definition:**
*   **Repentance:** A change of mind and heart, characterized by genuine sorrow for sin and a turning away from it towards God (Acts 3:19).

### Q6. Of what does the wise man bid the young to be mindful, even in the pursuit of pleasure?

**"Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment." Eccl. 11:9.**

**Answer:**
Solomon acknowledges the energy and desires of youth but couples them with a solemn warning: Accountability is inescapable.

*   **Freedom and Responsibility:** God gives us free will. We can choose to "walk in the ways of our heart," but we cannot choose the consequences. The reality of the Judgment creates a boundary for our behavior.
*   **The Investigative Judgment:** The Bible teaches that "we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:10). Every secret thing, whether good or evil, is recorded. For the believer, this is not a cause for terror, but for reverence. It reminds us that life matters.
*   **Living in Reality:** Sobriety is simply living with the Judgment in view. It means asking, "Will this action stand the test of God's law?"
*   **The Sanctuary Connection:** In the ancient Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), the people were to "afflict their souls" (be sober and repentant) while the High Priest cleansed the sanctuary (Leviticus 23:27). We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement. Jesus, our High Priest, is finishing His work in heaven. It is a time for young and old to be serious about their salvation.

**Definition:**
*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of judgment beginning in 1844 (Daniel 8:14) where the lives of professed believers are reviewed in the heavenly sanctuary before Christ returns (Daniel 7:9-10).

### Q7. What injunction to sobriety does the apostle give in his epistle to Titus?

**"That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; that they may teach the young women to be sober... Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded." Titus 2:2-6.**

**Answer:**
Paul instructs Titus that sobriety is a universal requirement for the Christian church, regardless of age or gender.

*   **Universal Call to Holiness:**
    *   **Aged Men:** Must be "grave" (dignified) and "temperate." Experience should lead to spiritual maturity, not cynicism.
    *   **Aged Women:** Behavior that "becometh holiness." They are to be mentors, not gossips ("false accusers") or drinkers of wine.
    *   **Young Women and Men:** Both are called to be "sober" or "sober-minded."
*   **What is Sober-mindedness?** It is self-control (temperance) governed by the Holy Spirit. It is the opposite of being impulsive, driven by passion, or mentally lazy.
*   **Grace Leads to Obedience:** In this same chapter, Paul explains *how* this is possible: "For the grace of God... hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world" (Titus 2:11-12).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot produce this sobriety by human effort alone. It is the "grace of God" that teaches and empowers us. We yield to Christ, and He lives His sober, righteous life through us (Galatians 2:20).

### Q8. What similar advice is given in the epistle to the Romans?

**"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying." Rom. 13:13.**

**Answer:**
Paul contrasts the behavior of the "night" (sin) with the behavior of the "day" (righteousness).

*   **Walking Honestly:** The Christian life should be transparent. We should have nothing to hide. "Rioting" (wild partying), "chambering" (sexual immorality), and "wantonness" (lack of restraint) belong to the darkness.
*   **Strife and Envying:** Notice that Paul lists "strife and envying" right next to drunkenness and sexual sin. Lack of emotional sobriety—uncontrolled anger and jealousy—is just as carnal as physical drunkenness.
*   **Putting on Christ:** The very next verse gives the secret to this victory: "But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh" (Romans 13:14).
*   **Victory over Sin:** We do not fight darkness by shoveling it out; we turn on the light. We overcome intemperance not just by willpower, but by being clothed with the character of Christ. When we are filled with His Spirit, the desire for "rioting" is replaced by the peace of God.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A beggar in dirty rags (our own righteousness/sinful habits) is invited to a royal wedding. He cannot just sew a patch on his rags. He must take them off and put on the King’s provided robe. When we "put on" Christ, our behavior changes because our covering has changed.

### Q9. What testimony does the apostle Peter bear on this point?

**"Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." 1 Peter 1:13.**

**Answer:**
Peter uses the imagery of physical preparation to describe mental and spiritual readiness.

*   **Gird Up the Loins of Your Mind:** In biblical times, men wore long robes. To run, work, or fight, they had to gather up the loose fabric and tuck it into a belt ("girding the loins"). Peter applies this to the mind.
    *   **Meaning:** Do not let your thoughts drag in the mud of the world. Do not let your imagination hang loose. Gather your thoughts, discipline your mind, and focus on Christ.
*   **Hope to the End:** Our sobriety is not a gloomy despair, but a focused hope. We are looking forward to the "revelation of Jesus Christ" (the Second Coming).
*   **Grace to be Brought:** We are saved by grace now, but there is a crowning grace to be given when Jesus returns—the glorification of our bodies and total deliverance from the presence of sin. Focusing on this prize keeps us sober.

**Definition:**
*   **Grace:** Often defined as "unmerited favor," but in the context of RBF, it is also "God's power at work in us" to do what we cannot do for ourselves (2 Corinthians 12:9).

### Q10. Why is vigilance especially necessary?

**"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." 1 Peter 5:8.**

**Answer:**
Sobriety is required because we are in a war zone. We face a real, intelligent, and malicious enemy.

*   **The Great Controversy:** This verse pulls back the curtain on the invisible battle. Satan is compared to a lion—powerful, predatory, and hungry. He seeks to "devour" souls by tempting them into sin, discouraging them, or deceiving them.
*   **Vigilance:** To be vigilant means to be wide awake and watching. A sleepy soldier is a dead soldier. Spiritual drowsiness (neglecting prayer, bible study, or obedience) gives the enemy an opening.
*   **Resistance through Faith:** The very next verse tells us how to fight: "Whom resist steadfast in the faith" (1 Peter 5:9). We do not fight the lion in our own strength. We resist by claiming the blood of the Lamb.
*   **The Sanctuary:** Just as the camp of Israel had to be guarded, we must guard the avenues of the soul (senses and thoughts) so that the enemy does not defile the temple of the heart.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you knew a lion had escaped the zoo and was roaming your neighborhood, you would not leave your doors unlocked or walk outside carelessly with headphones on. You would be alert ("sober") and watchful ("vigilant"). Spiritually, the danger is just as real.

### Q11. What other consideration should lead us to sobriety?

**"But the end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer." 1 Peter 4:7.**

**Answer:**
The nearness of the end of the world is the ultimate reason for sobriety.

*   **The End is at Hand:** The apostles lived with an expectation of Christ's return; how much more should we, who see the signs of the times fulfilled around us?
*   **Watch unto Prayer:** Sobriety leads to a specific activity: prayer. A sober mind is a praying mind.
    *   In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus told the disciples, "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation" (Matthew 26:41). They slept, and they failed the test.
    *   To "watch unto prayer" means to maintain a constant connection with heaven, sending up petitions for grace to overcome sin and for the salvation of others.
*   **Practical Preparation:** We are living in the time of the "Loud Cry" and the sealing work. God is preparing a people who will stand when "the end of all things" comes. This requires a clear mind, unclouded by the intoxication of worldly pleasure, fully surrendered to the control of the Spirit.

**Conclusion:**
Sobriety is not merely the absence of alcohol; it is the presence of the Holy Spirit. It is the state of a mind that knows the times, knows the enemy, and knows the Savior. Through faith in Christ, we can live soberly, righteously, and godly, prepared for His glorious appearing.
