### Q1. Against whose worship are the dwellers of earth warned by the third angel?
“And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.” Rev. 14:9.

**Answer:**
The third angel’s message contains the most solemn warning to be found in the entire Bible. It warns the inhabitants of the earth against worshipping **the beast and his image** and against receiving his **mark**. This message reveals that in the final days of earth's history, the central conflict will not be merely political, but deeply spiritual—a battle over worship.

1.  **The Object of Worship:** Worship is an act of allegiance. By worshipping the beast, humanity aligns itself with a system that opposes God’s government and His law.
2.  **The Wrath of God:** This is defined as God’s judgment against sin unmixed with mercy (Revelation 14:10). It is the final outpouring of justice upon those who stubbornly refuse the offer of salvation and choose rebellion.
3.  **The Necessity of Choice:** Every human being will eventually be brought to a decision point. There will be no neutral ground; one will either receive the seal of God (Revelation 7:2–3) or the mark of the beast.

**Key Definitions:**
*   **Worship:** In Scripture, true worship is the outward expression of an inward loyalty and obedience to the Creator (Exodus 20:8–11; Revelation 14:7).
*   **The Beast:** In prophecy, a beast represents a kingdom or political power (Daniel 7:17, 23).

> [ILL] **The Danger Sign:** Imagine a bridge has washed away on a dark, mountain road. A man stands before the drop-off, frantically waving a red lantern and shouting at approaching cars to stop. His "loud voice" and urgent manner are not born of anger at the drivers, but of a desperate desire to save them from destruction. Similarly, the Third Angel’s warning, though stern, is a message of love from God, striving to save humanity from the fatal consequences of false worship.

### Q2. What beast had been seen coming up out of the sea?
“And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.” Rev. 13:1.

**Answer:**
The prophet John sees a beast rising from the "sea." In Bible prophecy, water or "sea" represents multitudes of people, nations, and tongues (Revelation 17:15). This power, therefore, arises from a densely populated area.

1.  **Identity of the Beast:** Students of the historicist interpretation of prophecy identify this beast as the **Papacy** (the Roman Church-State power) which rose to dominance among the nations of Europe after the fall of the pagan Roman Empire. It shares the characteristics of the four beasts of Daniel 7—the lion, bear, leopard, and dragon—indicating it absorbed the philosophies and methods of the empires before it (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome).
2.  **Blasphemy:** The beast bears the name of blasphemy. Biblically, blasphemy is defined as a man claiming to be God (John 10:33) or claiming the power to forgive sins (Mark 2:7). This power claims prerogatives that belong only to Christ.

**Sanctuary Connection:**
The earthly sanctuary had a High Priest who interceded for the people. This beast power diverts the attention of men from the true High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (Jesus) to an earthly priesthood, obscuring the "daily" ministry of Christ (Daniel 8:11–12).

---

### Q3. What power was given to this beast?
“And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.” Rev. 13:7

**Answer:**
This power is described as a persecuting force. It does not merely teach error; it uses force to "make war" against those who dissent from its dogmas.

1.  **War with the Saints:** History records the "Dark Ages," a period of 1260 years (prophetically called "a time, and times, and half a time" in Daniel 7:25 and Revelation 12:14), wherein millions of Christians were persecuted for holding to the Bible alone.
2.  **Universal Authority:** The text indicates a global influence. During its supremacy, this power dictated the conscience of the "civilized" world.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
True Christianity never uses force to compel conscience. Jesus says, "If any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not" (John 12:47) in this present age. The Spirit of Christ wins the heart by love (Jeremiah 31:3). Any system that uses the sword to enforce worship is operating contrary to the Spirit of Jesus.

---

### Q4. What was the result of his overcoming the saints?
“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” Rev. 13:8.

**Answer:**
The result of this power's influence is nearly universal worship. The verse draws a sharp line of distinction: the only ones who do *not* worship the beast are those whose names are in the **Book of Life**.

1.  **The Book of Life:** This is the registry of the heavenly sanctuary, containing the names of those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord (Philippians 4:3; Revelation 3:5).
2.  **The Lamb Slain:** The plan of salvation was not an afterthought. Before the creation of the world, the Godhead covenanted to save man at the cost of the Son’s life (1 Peter 1:19–20). This assurance gives the believer the strength to stand against the majority.

**Key Definition:**
*   **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation. The "Lamb slain" refers to the sacrifice of Christ, which provides the blood (life) to cover the sinner and cleanse the record of sin.

> [ILL] **The Anchor:** A ship in a storm may be tossed by waves, but if its anchor is secure in the bedrock, it will not drift onto the rocks. The world is the storm; the Beast provides a false harbor. But those written in the Book of Life have their anchor cast "within the veil" (Hebrews 6:19)—they are held secure by Christ, the Slain Lamb.

### Q5. What did the "mother of harlots" do to the saints?
” And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.” Rev. 17:6.

**Answer:**
In Revelation 17, the same power described as a beast in chapter 13 is depicted as a woman. In prophecy, a pure woman represents God’s true church (Jeremiah 6:2; 2 Corinthians 11:2), while a harlot represents an apostate church that has left her true husband (Christ) to form alliances with the kings of the earth.

1.  **Drunken with Blood:** This vivid imagery describes the terrible extent of persecution. The apostate church became intoxicated with the power to destroy those who upheld the "testimony of Jesus."
2.  **Martyrs of Jesus:** These are they who loved not their lives unto the death (Revelation 12:11). Their blood witnesses to the truth that obedience to God is more precious than life itself.

---

### Q6. And what did she succeed in accomplishing by her course?
“The inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.” Rev. 17:2.

**Answer:**
Through her alliances and influence, this power has spiritually intoxicated the world.

1.  **The Wine of Babylon:** This represents false doctrines and illegal unions between church and state. Just as wine confuses the mind and impairs judgment, false doctrine confuses the spiritual understanding.
2.  **Spiritual Fornication:** This is the biblical term for when the church seeks the support of the state to enforce her decrees, rather than trusting in the power of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God.

> **Note from Source:** The beast of Rev. 13, and the woman of Rev. 17, are identical. They are symbols of the Roman Church. She put to death millions of saints, and finally so nearly overcame the whole world that even "the kings of the earth" were subdued, and made to pay her homage and worship.

---

### Q7. What other beast was seen to arise after the one last described?
” And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” Rev. 13:11.

**Answer:**
As the first beast (Papal Rome) received its "deadly wound" (Rev 13:3) at the end of the 1260-year prophecy (specifically around 1798 AD), John sees a new power rising.

1.  **Out of the Earth:** Unlike the first beast which rose from the "sea" (crowded nations), this one rises from the "earth"—representing a sparsely populated, new territory. Prophetic students identify this as the **United States of America**.
2.  **Lamb-like Horns:** The horns have no crowns (unlike the first beast), indicating a government without a king—a republic. The "lamb-like" quality suggests youthfulness, innocence, and Christian professions (freedom of conscience, separation of church and state).
3.  **Spake as a Dragon:** The prophecy predicts a change in character. While appearing mild and Christian-like in its constitution, it will eventually "speak" (legislate) with the intolerance of the dragon (Satan/Pagan Rome).

> **Note from Source:** This symbol represents the United States of America. For confirmation of this, see reading on "The Last Nation Noticed in Prophecy."

---

### Q8. What is the two-horned beast to do?
“Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword, and did live.” Rev. 13:14.

**Answer:**
The United States is prophesied to lead the world in creating an **"image to the beast."**

1.  **What is an Image?** An image is a likeness or a copy. The first beast was a church clothed with civil power to enforce its dogmas. An "image" to that beast would be a similar system—Protestantism in America seeking the aid of the state to enforce religious observances.
2.  **Restoring Authority:** By doing this, the second beast heals the influence of the first beast, bringing back the methods of the Dark Ages under a modern guise.

**Key Definition:**
*   **Image of the Beast:** A union of church and state in the United States, where religious apostasy leads to the use of civil law to enforce religious duty.

---

### Q9. What will the two horned beast require all under its jurisdiction to receive?
” And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.” Rev. 13:16.

**Answer:**
The ultimate aim of this image is to enforce the reception of a **mark**. This is not a literal tattoo, but a sign of allegiance.

1.  **The Forehead:** Represents the mind, the intellect, and the conscience. Those who receive the mark here are those who are intellectually convinced of the system's doctrines or who have been deceived.
2.  **The Hand:** Represents labor and action. Those who receive the mark here may not believe the doctrines, but they comply for the sake of convenience, business, or fear of persecution.
3.  **Universal Enforcement:** The verse emphasizes that no class of society is exempt—"small and great, rich and poor."

**Righteousness by Faith:**
God seals His people in the forehead (Revelation 7:3), but never in the hand. God wants a service of love and conviction, not forced compliance. The enemy, however, is satisfied with forced obedience (the hand) if he cannot capture the heart.

---

### Q10. What will be the result?
“And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” Rev. 13:17.

**Answer:**
The penalty for refusing the mark is an economic boycott. This is a severe test of faith.

1.  **Total Dependence:** When the ability to participate in the economy is removed, the believer is thrown entirely upon the providence of God.
2.  **The Promise:** Just as God fed Elijah by the brook and the Israelites with manna, He promises to sustain His people. "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure" (Isaiah 33:16).

> [ILL] **The Bird on the Branch:** A bird sleeping on a branch does not worry if the branch breaks, because its trust is not in the branch, but in its own wings. The Christian's trust is not in the "branch" of the world's economy, but in the "wings" of the Almighty (Psalm 91:4).

---

### Q11. How much power is to be given to the image of the beast?
” And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.” Rev. 13:15.

**Answer:**
The boycott escalates to a death decree. The "image" (the apostate Protestant civil power) will eventually mirror the Papal intolerance of the past by mandating death for dissenters.

1.  **"Speak" and "Cause":** A nation "speaks" through its legislative laws and "causes" (acts) through its executive/police power.
2.  **The Final Test:** This brings the world to the final conflict of the Great Controversy. It is the ultimate test of whether a man loves his life more than he loves Jesus (Matthew 16:25).

---

### Q12. After uttering His warning by the third angel against all this, what does God offer instead, as that which will manifest the patience of the saints?
“Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Rev. 14:12,

**Answer:**
In stark contrast to those who worship the beast, God points to a remnant group. They are identified by two specific characteristics:

1.  **They Keep the Commandments of God:** While the world follows the traditions of the beast, this group upholds God's immutable law.
2.  **They Have the Faith of Jesus:** They do not merely have faith *in* Jesus (as a distant Savior), but they possess the *faith of* Jesus. This is the same quality of trust and dependence on the Father that Jesus had during His earthly life—a faith that can endure the cross and despise the shame.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
This verse is the perfect definition of Righteousness by Faith.
*   **Justification:** We are saved by the faith of Jesus.
*   **Sanctification:** That faith works in us to produce obedience to the Commandments.
We do not keep the commandments *to get* saved; we keep them because we *are* saved and the life of Christ is living out His law within us (Galatians 2:20).

---

### Q13. What does the Bible set forth as the "commandments of God?
“And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire;... and He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone." Deut. 4:12, 13.

**Answer:**
The "Commandments of God" mentioned in Revelation 14:12 are the **Ten Commandments** given at Sinai.

1.  **The Covenant:** God calls the Ten Commandments "His covenant." It is the standard of agreement between God and His people. Under the New Covenant, these same laws are written not on stone, but on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
2.  **Moral Law:** These are not ceremonial suggestions but the eternal moral law of the universe, reflecting God’s character of love.

---

### Q14. Were these ten commandments the complete law of God?
“These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice; and He added no more. And He wrote them in two tables of stone." Deut. 5:22.

**Answer:**
The text emphasizes, "He added no more."

1.  **Completeness:** The Ten Commandments are a complete summary of human duty to God (first four) and duty to man (last six).
2.  **Distinction:** God spoke these ten audibly and wrote them with His own finger. This distinguishes them from the ceremonial laws (regarding sacrifices and festivals) which were written by Moses and were types pointing forward to Christ. The moral law remains the standard of righteousness.

---

### Q15. Why should the law of God be obeyed?
“Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law." 1 John 3:4.

**Answer:**
Obedience is necessary because the Law is the detector of sin.

1.  **Definition of Sin:** The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (anomian - lawlessness). Without the law, we have no knowledge of what sin is (Romans 3:20).
2.  **The Gospel Connection:** If there is no law, there is no sin. If there is no sin, there is no need for a Savior. Therefore, abolishing the law would abolish the Gospel. Jesus came to save His people *from* their sins (Matthew 1:21), meaning He came to bring them back into harmony with God’s law.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
We cannot obey the law in our own strength. The carnal mind is hostile to God's law (Romans 8:7). Only when Christ dwells in the heart by faith can the "righteousness of the law" be fulfilled in us (Romans 8:4).

---

### Q16. How much of the law should one keep to be called a commandment keeper?
“For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." James 2:10.

**Answer:**
God's law is not a list of separate rules, but a unified whole representing His character.

1.  **Unity of the Law:** To break one commandment is to break the principle of love and rebellion against the Lawgiver.
2.  **No "Small" Sins:** In the crisis of the last days, the test may come on just one specific point (such as the Sabbath, the 4th commandment). To yield on one point is to surrender the authority of God to the authority of the beast.

> [ILL] **The Broken Chain:** If you hang a heavy weight by a chain of ten links, how many links need to break for the weight to fall? Only one. It does not matter if the other nine are strong; if one breaks, the connection is severed. So it is with our connection to God’s will.

---

### Q17. How does the apostle illustrate his meaning in this statement?
“For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law." James 2:11.

**Answer:**
James illustrates that the authority behind the law is God Himself.

1.  **The Lawgiver:** We do not keep the commandments because they seem logical or convenient; we keep them because "He said."
2.  **The Issue of Worship:** This brings us back to the Third Angel's Message. If we accept the Beast's modification of God's law (specifically the change of the Sabbath to Sunday, which tradition admits is a mark of church authority), we are respecting the beast above the Lawgiver.

> **Note from Source:** If keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus will be proof against worshiping the beast and his image, and receiving his mark, then it is plain that those who do worship the beast do not keep the commandments. It is also established by this that the great religious controversy of the last generation is to be over the commandments of God.

---

### Q18. Why will the remnant church be persecuted?
“And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.

**Answer:**
The final persecution arises because of the Dragon's wrath against the specific characteristics of the Remnant.

1.  **Two Distinguishing Marks:** The Remnant are identified by:
    *   **Commandment Keeping:** They restore the downtrodden law of God, including the Sabbath.
    *   **Testimony of Jesus:** Revelation 19:10 defines this as "the spirit of prophecy."
2.  **The Cause of War:** The world and the apostate church cannot tolerate a group that refuses to bow to human tradition and insists on obeying God rather than men (Acts 5:29). The life of Christ in His saints is a constant rebuke to sin.

**Conclusion & Promise:**
Though the war is fierce, the outcome is assured. The saints are described in Revelation 15:2 as standing on the sea of glass, having gotten the victory over the beast, his image, his mark, and the number of his name. Through the "Faith of Jesus," we can be more than conquerors.
