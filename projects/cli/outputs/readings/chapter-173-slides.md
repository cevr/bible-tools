## Slide 1 – Q1: The Wish for Health

- **Question:** What important wish (prayer, margin) is expressed by the apostle concerning Gaius?
- **Key Text:** 3 John 1:2 – “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Connection of Body and Mind**
  - The brain is the capital of the body and the medium for the Holy Spirit to communicate.
  - A sick body weakens the brain, making it difficult to think of eternal realities or exercise faith (Romans 10:17 – “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”).
- **A Balanced Life**
  - God values both the soul and the body; true religion does not ignore physical laws.
  - Believers seek to bring the body into harmony with God's laws of health.
- **Sanctification Involves the Body**
  - We cannot separate physical habits from our spiritual walk.
  - Sanctification is the restoring of God's image in us (1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Musician and the Instrument**
  - A musician may have a masterpiece in his heart, but if the instrument has broken strings, the music is distorted.
  - The Holy Spirit desires to play the melody of heaven through our lives.
  - Our body is the instrument; if we neglect it, we hinder the Spirit's expression.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Presenting the Body

- **Question:** Why is it necessary to preserve the body in health?
- **Key Text:** Romans 12:1 – “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **A Living Sacrifice**
  - In the sanctuary service, animals for sacrifice had to be "without blemish" (Leviticus 22:21 – “And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings... it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.”).
  - We do not offer dead animals, but *ourselves*; we should present our bodies in the best possible condition.
- **Reasonable Service**
  - Since God created and redeemed the body (1 Corinthians 6:20 – “For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.”), caring for it is a logical act of worship.
- **Response to Grace (Not Legalism)**
  - We keep health laws "by the mercies of God"—because we are already saved, not to earn salvation.
  - This is the fruit of **Justification**: a desire to please the Savior.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Diamond in the Sack**
  - If a King gave you a priceless diamond to carry, you would not put it in a torn, dirty sack.
  - The "diamond" is the Gospel message and the Holy Spirit.
  - The "sack" is our body.
  - We must keep the vessel strong to carry the treasure (2 Corinthians 4:7 – “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.”).

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Scope of Sanctification

- **Question:** When one is truly sanctified, how much of him will be affected?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Wholly Sanctified**
  - True **Sanctification** is not partial; it strikes a blow to the idea that religion is only for the "spirit."
  - It includes the spirit (mind/conscience), soul (life/emotions), and body (physical flesh).
- **Preparation for Translation**
  - We are to be preserved "blameless unto the coming of our Lord."
  - This implies a special preparation for those living in the final days.
- **God's Work Within Us**
  - The God of peace writes His law upon our hearts (Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”).
  - We cooperate by surrendering our appetites and stopping the poisoning of the temple.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Clean House**
  - A house is not "clean" if the living room is tidy but the basement is full of rotting garbage.
  - A man cannot be "holy" if he loves Jesus with his spirit but pollutes his body—the "basement"—with defiling habits.
  - God desires the whole house to be clean.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Paul’s Self-Discipline

- **Question:** How did the apostle guard himself?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 9:27 – “But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Struggle for Mastery**
  - Paul recognized a battle between the higher nature (Spirit) and lower nature (flesh).
  - He made his body a servant to his mind, rather than the mind a slave to the body.
- **The Danger of Falling**
  - Even the apostle Paul knew he could become a "castaway" (disqualified) if appetite ruled him.
  - We must "hold fast" to the end (Hebrews 3:14 – “For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;”).
- **Victory through Christ**
  - Subjection is possible through the "fruit of the Spirit," which includes temperance (Galatians 5:22–23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is... temperance...”).

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Rider and the Horse**
  - A rider on a powerful horse must hold the reins tight.
  - If he drops the reins, the horse (appetite) runs wild and carries the rider (the mind) into a ditch.
  - Self-control, empowered by the Spirit, is the rein that keeps the beast of appetite in check.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Lawful vs. Expedient

- **Question:** Is it expedient to eat everything that it is lawful to eat?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 10:23 – “All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **Expedience (Benefit)**
  - Just because something isn't explicitly named as forbidden doesn't mean it is wise to eat.
  - Unhealthful foods (like junk food) are not "expedient" because they do not build health.
- **Edification**
  - To "edify" means to build up.
  - Our choices should strengthen our physical body and spiritual influence.
- **Influence on Others**
  - We must not cause others to stumble (Romans 14:21 – “It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.”).

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Hiker's Backpack**
  - A traveler carrying a heavy backpack *can* legally put rocks in his bag—there is no law against it.
  - However, it is not *expedient* if he wants to reach the mountaintop.
  - Unhealthful habits are "weights" that hinder us in the race (Hebrews 12:1 – “...let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us...”).

## Slide 16 – Q6: Eating for God's Glory

- **Question:** Is God's glory to be considered even in one's eating?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 10:31 – “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **Glorifying God**
  - To glorify God is to reveal His character.
  - Simple, nourishing food promotes a clear mind, reflecting God's order and wisdom.
- **The Test of Appetite**
  - Adam and Eve failed on appetite (Genesis 3).
  - Christ overcame on appetite in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1–4).
  - We must overcome on this point to glorify God.
- **Practical Holiness**
  - Gluttony and intemperance cloud the mind and dishonor our Maker.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **The King's Watch**
  - If a man repairs a king’s watch, he treats it with care to honor the king.
  - Our bodies are God’s "watches," designed to keep time with His will.
  - To fill the delicate machinery with "grit and sand" (harmful food) is to insult the Owner.

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Body as a Temple

- **Question:** What are our bodies said to be?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 6:19 – “What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Indwelling Spirit**
  - In the Old Testament, God dwelt in the sanctuary; now, *we* are the temple.
  - The Holy Spirit desires to dwell in our hearts (Ephesians 3:17 – “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith...”).
- **Not Our Own**
  - We are tenants; God is the Landlord.
  - We have no right to abuse property that does not belong to us.
- **Sanctuary Hygiene**
  - Priests had to be clean and sober to serve in the earthly sanctuary (Leviticus 10:9 – “Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die...”).
  - We must maintain physical purity for the Holy Spirit's habitation.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Guest of Honor**
  - If a guest of honor were coming to your home, you would clean the floors and remove the trash.
  - The Holy Spirit is the heavenly Guest.
  - We should not invite Him into a body filled with the debris of intemperate habits.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Duty to the Owner

- **Question:** What is the Christian's duty concerning his body in view of the fact that the Spirit of God has taken possession of it?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 6:20 – “For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **The Purchase Price (Atonement)**
  - We were bought with the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18–19 – “...redeemed... with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:”).
  - Jesus gave His broken body to make ours whole.
- **Double Ownership**
  - God owns us by Creation (Psalm 100:3 – “...it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves...”).
  - He owns us by Redemption (buying us back from sin).
- **Duty of Love**
  - Health reform is not a burden; it is protecting God's investment out of gratitude.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Freed Slave**
  - Imagine a slave market where a kind master pays everything to buy a slave and set him free.
  - That slave would serve his master forever out of love.
  - Christ paid His life for us; we care for our bodies because we love the One who bought us.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Consequence of Defilement

- **Question:** What does the apostle say God will do to those who defile or mar this temple of His, the human body?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 3:17 – “If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points

- **The Consequence of Defilement**
  - To "defile" means to corrupt or pollute.
  - Persisting in habits that destroy health (drugs, alcohol, gluttony) destroys God's property.
- **The Law of Sowing and Reaping**
  - God is the author of life; sin is the author of death.
  - Choosing physical self-destruction leads to separation from the Source of life (Galatians 6:7 – “...for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”).
- **Holiness is Essential**
  - The temple is *holy*; God cannot dwell in a defiled temple.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration

- **Vandalizing the Palace**
  - If a vandal smashes the windows and burns the walls of the King's palace, he is arrested and punished.
  - Our bodies are the King's palace.
  - We must not vandalize them with harmful indulgences.

## Slide 28 – Q10: Daniel’s Choice

- **Question:** Can the body be defiled with improper food or drink?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 1:8 – “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank.”

## Slide 29 – Q10: Key Points

- **The Example of Daniel**
  - Daniel refused the king's rich, likely unclean food and alcoholic wine.
  - He knew these would cloud his mind for communion with God.
- **"Purposed in his Heart"**
  - Victory begins with a decision of the will surrendered to God (**Righteousness by Faith** in action).
- **The Result**
  - God gave Daniel wisdom and skill ten times better than the Babylonians (Daniel 1:20).
  - A clean diet laid the foundation for understanding prophecy.

## Slide 30 – Q10: Illustration

- **The High-Performance Car**
  - A car designed for high-octane fuel will fail if filled with sludge.
  - Daniel knew his body was designed for God’s fuel, not Babylon’s sludge.
  - Because he kept the machine clean, God could use him for great service.

## Slide 31 – Q11: The Original Diet

- **Question:** What sort of food did Daniel desire?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:29 – “And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.”

## Slide 32 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Original Diet**
  - Daniel requested "pulse" (vegetables/plants) and water.
  - Before sin entered, man's diet was fruits, grains, nuts, and vegetables.
- **Restoration**
  - The gospel is a work of restoration (Acts 3:21 – “...times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets...”).
  - Moving toward the Edenic diet helps prepare the body for translation.
- **Health and Holiness**
  - The diet God chose for perfect man is the best diet to keep man in a holy state.

## Slide 33 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Manufacturer's Manual**
  - When a manufacturer builds a machine, he provides an instruction manual specifying the fuel.
  - Genesis 1:29 is the Manufacturer's instruction for the human engine.
  - Following it ensures the best performance.

## Slide 34 – Q12: Permitted Flesh Foods

- **Question:** What kind of flesh did the Lord afterward permit man to eat?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 11:3 – “Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.”

## Slide 35 – Q12: Key Points

- **Permission After the Flood**
  - When vegetation was destroyed, God permitted animal flesh but with restrictions.
- **The Definition of "Clean"**
  - Land animals must meet two conditions:
    1. Part the hoof (cloven-footed).
    2. Chew the cud (ruminants like cows, sheep).
- **Biology, Not Ritual**
  - These laws are based on health/biology, not ceremonial types.
  - Unclean animals are scavengers; their nature did not change at the cross.
  - God restricts our diet to minimize toxins and protect our health.

## Slide 36 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Good Father**
  - A good father forbids his child from eating berries from a poisonous bush.
  - He does this to protect the child’s life, not to deprive them of pleasure.
  - God’s dietary laws are boundaries set by a loving Father.

## Slide 37 – Q13: Distinction Before Moses

- **Question:** By what term was this class of creatures distinguished from the other?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 7:2 – “Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.”

## Slide 38 – Q13: Key Points

- **Pre-Sinai Distinction**
  - The distinction between "clean" and "unclean" existed in Noah's day—long before the Jews or the ceremonial law at Sinai.
- **Universal Application**
  - Noah is the father of the post-flood race; this distinction was for all mankind.
- **Preservation of Life**
  - Clean animals were taken by sevens (for food/sacrifice).
  - Unclean animals were taken by twos (only to prevent extinction, not for food).

## Slide 39 – Q13: Illustration

- **Gravity and Law**
  - Gravity existed before Newton wrote about it.
  - The distinction between clean (healthful) and unclean (unhealthful) animals existed before Moses wrote Leviticus.
  - It is a law of nature fixed by the Creator.

## Slide 40 – Q14: The Swine Prohibition

- **Question:** Which one of these now commonly eaten was mentioned as being unfit even to touch?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 14:8 – “And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.”

## Slide 41 – Q14: Key Points

- **The Swine (Pig)**
  - God specifically singles out the pig as unclean.
  - Though it has a split hoof, it is a scavenger and does not chew the cud.
- **Medical Warning**
  - The pig is an earthly scavenger, often carrying parasites (like trichina) and toxins.
- **Clear Prohibition**
  - The command is double: do not eat it, and do not touch the carcass.
  - God wants His people to have no relationship with this article of diet.

## Slide 42 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Garbage Truck**
  - A city employs garbage trucks to haul away waste; they perform a necessary service.
  - However, you would never eat a meal off the back of a garbage truck.
  - The swine is nature’s "garbage truck"—designed to clean the earth, not to feed the body.

## Slide 43 – Q15: A Holy People

- **Question:** Why did the Lord thus restrict the Hebrews?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 14:2, 3 – “For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth. Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.”

## Slide 44 – Q15: Key Points

- **Holiness and Separation**
  - "Holy" means set apart. God's people are distinct from the world.
  - The world eats for pleasure; the Christian eats to sustain a temple for God.
- **A "Peculiar" People**
  - This means "special treasure." Because we are God's treasure, He does not want us fueled by "abominable things."
- **The Call Today**
  - Spiritual Israel is also a "holy nation" (1 Peter 2:9 – “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people...”).
  - Our health is vital as we prepare for the return of Christ.

## Slide 45 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Olympic Athlete**
  - An athlete training for the Olympics eats differently than the spectator in the stands.
  - He is "peculiar" in his diet because he has a high goal in view.
  - Christians are running a race for eternal life (1 Corinthians 9:24–25); our diet must support our calling.

## Slide 46 – Q16: End-Time Judgment

- **Question:** What does the Lord say of those who are found eating swine's flesh and the like, when Christ comes?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 66:15, 17 – “For behold, the Lord will come with fire... They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 47 – Q16: Key Points

- **End-Time Application**
  - The context is the Second Coming ("come with fire").
  - The prohibition on unclean meats was not abolished at the cross, as God judges it at His return.
- **False Sanctification**
  - The text warns against those who "sanctify themselves" (hypocrisy) while secretly indulging in forbidden things.
  - True **Sanctification** involves obedience to God's physical and moral laws.
- **The Consequence**
  - Rebellious indulgence is incompatible with the purity of heaven.

## Slide 48 – Q16: Application (Victory in Christ)

- **Victory is Possible**
  - We need not fear judgment if we are in Christ.
  - He is able to "keep you from falling" (Jude 1:24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,”).
  - Through the Spirit, we can overcome appetite and stand blameless.

## Slide 49 – Q16: Illustration

- **The Sinking Ship**
  - If a ship is sinking, passengers must leave heavy baggage behind to get into the lifeboat.
  - Some refuse to let go of their "baggage" (sinful habits) and are pulled down.
  - We must let go of every weight to be lifted up by Christ.
