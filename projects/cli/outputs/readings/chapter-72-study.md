### Q1. How long has sin reigned?

**“He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the
beginning." 1 John 3:8.**

**Answer:** The reign of sin predates the creation of this world. The apostle
John reveals that the origin of evil lies with "the Devil," who sinned "from the
beginning." This implies several vital truths regarding the government of God:

1.  **The Antiquity of Law:** Since sin is defined as "the transgression of the
    law" (1 John 3:4), the moral government of God and His law must have existed
    in heaven before Satan fell. You cannot have a rebellion without a ruler,
    nor a transgression without a law.
2.  **The Nature of Satan’s Work:** Satan, originally Lucifer, was the first to
    break harmony with God’s character of love. His rebellion was a rejection of
    God’s authority.
3.  **The Universal Conflict:** The Great Controversy between Christ and Satan
    began in heaven and was transferred to this earth. The issue has always been
    about the justice of God’s law and His character.

**Term Definition:**

- **Sin:** The transgression (breaking) of God’s law (1 John 3:4). It is not
  merely a mistake, but a rebellion against the principles of God’s government.

[ILL] Imagine a mutiny on a ship at sea. The mutiny begins the moment the crew
decides to reject the captain's orders, even before they throw the captain
overboard. Similarly, sin began in the heart of Lucifer when he rejected God's
law of love, long before he tempted Adam and Eve.

### Q2. What others sinned with Satan?

**“God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and
delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment." 2 Peter
2:4.**

**Answer:** The rebellion was not limited to Lucifer alone; he drew a third of
the angels with him (Revelation 12:4). This text highlights the serious nature
of the moral law:

- **Angels are Subject to Law:** If angels can sin, they must be subject to a
  moral standard. Created beings, no matter how high or holy, are not
  independent of their Creator's will.
- **Judgment is Certain:** The phrase "reserved unto judgment" points us to the
  sanctuary message. God has an appointed time to examine the lives of His
  creatures. If God did not spare the angels who stood in His very presence, He
  will surely not overlook willful sin in humanity.
- **The Cost of Rebellion:** These angels were "cast down." Sin always results
  in separation from God, who is the source of light and life.

**Term Definition:**

- **Judgment:** The judicial process where God examines the records of
  intelligent beings to decide their eternal destiny, vindicating His justice
  and mercy.

### Q3. Can there be sin where there is no law?

**“Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no
transgression." Rom. 4:15.**

**Answer:** This is a foundational pillar of truth. The apostle Paul establishes
a logical impossibility: one cannot be guilty of a crime if there is no law
defining that crime.

1.  **The Existence of Law in the Patriarchal Age:** Since the Bible clearly
    states that Adam, Cain, the Antediluvians, and Sodom were guilty of _sin_,
    the moral law (the Ten Commandments in principle) must have been in force
    long before it was spoken on Mount Sinai.
2.  **The Function of the Law:** The law acts as a mirror (James 1:23–25). It
    reveals dirt (sin) but cannot wash it away. Paul says the law "worketh
    wrath" because it points out our violation and the penalty required.
3.  **The Need for a Savior:** Because the law existed and man broke it, man was
    under the penalty of death. This necessitated the plan of salvation
    immediately upon the fall of Adam. If there were no law, there would be no
    sin; if no sin, no need for a Savior.

[ILL] If a driver speeds down a road that has no posted speed limit and no
traffic laws, a police officer cannot issue a ticket. There is no transgression
because there is no law. However, if the officer issues a valid ticket, it
proves the law existed before the driver arrived. Since God charged men with sin
from Adam to Moses (Romans 5:13–14), the Law must have been active.

---

### Q4. How was the first death brought about?

**“And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in
the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him." Gen.
4:8.**

**Answer:** The first physical death in human history was a murder—a direct
violation of the principle later codified as the Sixth Commandment, "Thou shalt
not kill" (Exodus 20:13).

- **The Fruit of Unbelief:** Cain’s act was the final result of anger and
  jealousy, which Jesus equates with murder in the heart (Matthew 5:21–22).
- **Rejection of the Atonement:** Cain refused to bring the lamb (typifying the
  blood of Christ) and instead brought the fruit of his own labor
  (works-righteousness). When his man-made religion was rejected, hatred for the
  true religion sprang up. Persecution often comes from those who try to be
  saved by their own works against those who rest in Christ’s righteousness.

---

### Q5. What was the difference between the characters of the two men?

**“Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore
slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous." 1
John 3:12.**

**Answer:** The difference was not merely in their offering, but in the _state
of their hearts_, which dictated their actions.

1.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Hebrews 11:4 tells us that "By faith Abel
    offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice." Abel is called "righteous" not
    because he was naturally perfect, but because he looked by faith to the Lamb
    of God. His obedience flowed from a heart reconciled to God.
2.  **Evil Works:** Cain’s works were "evil" because they originated from a
    heart of rebellion. Even an act of worship, if done without faith and
    contrary to God's command, is an "evil work."
3.  **The Two Classes:** This establishes the two great classes of humanity
    found throughout the Great Controversy: those who rely on the blood of
    Christ and obey God (Abel), and those who rely on self and rebel against
    God's law (Cain).

**Term Definition:**

- **Righteousness:** Doing what is right in God's eyes. In the Christian life,
  it is twofold: Christ's perfect life credited to us (justification) and
  Christ's life lived out through us by the Holy Spirit (sanctification).

### Q6. Did the Lord impute sin to Cain for taking the life of his brother?

**“If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well,
sin lieth at the door... And he [God] said,"... the voice of thy brother's blood
crieth unto me from the ground... now art thou cursed from the earth." Gen.
4:7-11.**

**Answer:** Yes, God clearly imputed sin to Cain.

- **Moral Accountability:** God’s question, "If thou doest well, shalt thou not
  be accepted?" implies that Cain knew what "doing well" meant. He was morally
  obligated to obey God’s will.
- **Sin Lies at the Door:** This phrase depicts sin like a crouching beast
  waiting to devour. God warned Cain that he must master his sinful passions,
  but this is only possible through surrender to God.
- **The Curse:** God pronounced a sentence (judgment) upon Cain. This confirms
  that the principles of the law were in effect and that God acts as the Judge
  of the earth.

**Term Definition:**

- **Impute:** To reckon, count, or charge to one’s account. God imputed guilt to
  Cain because of his sin. Conversely, in the Gospel, God imputes Christ's
  righteousness to the repentant sinner (Romans 4:22–24).

---

### Q7. In what condition was mankind before the flood?

**“The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with
violence." Gen. 6:11.**

**Answer:** The antediluvian world (before the Flood) demonstrates the result of
setting aside God's law.

- **Corruption:** This refers to moral decay, likely including the perversion of
  marriage and worship.
- **Violence:** When the first four commandments (duty to God) are broken, the
  last six (duty to man) are soon trampled. Without God, humanity turned against
  itself. "Violence" is the violation of the rights of others.
- **Total Depravity:** Genesis 6:5 adds that "every imagination of the thoughts
  of his heart was only evil continually." This shows the desperate need for a
  new heart (Sanctification), which the Spirit of God was striving to give them
  (Gen 6:3), but they resisted.

---

### Q8. What did God purpose to do with the people of that day?

**” And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the
earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them
with the earth." Gen. 6:13.**

**Answer:** God purposed to execute judgment.

- **The limit of Divine Patience:** God is "longsuffering... not willing that
  any should perish" (2 Peter 3:9), but there is a limit to divine forbearance.
  When men become fully settled in rebellion, preventing any possibility of
  repentance, probation closes.
- **Cleansing the Earth:** The Flood was a type of the final destruction of sin.
  Just as the sanctuary must be cleansed of recorded sins, the earth had to be
  cleansed of the violent rebels who were destroying it.
- **Vindication of Law:** The destruction of the old world is a testimony that
  God’s law cannot be trampled upon with impunity forever.

---

### Q9. What was Noah called?

**“And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher
of righteousness." 2 Peter 2:5.**

**Answer:** Noah is called a "preacher of righteousness."

- **The Definition of Righteousness:** "All thy commandments are righteousness"
  (Psalm 119:172). Therefore, Noah was a preacher of obedience to God's law.
- **Preaching by Life and Word:** For 120 years, while building the ark, Noah
  preached that men should repent—which means to turn away from sin
  (transgression of the law) and turn toward God.
- **Salvation by Grace:** Noah "found grace in the eyes of the Lord" (Genesis
  6:8). His righteousness was the fruit of his faith (Hebrews 11:7). He did not
  earn salvation by boat-building; he built the boat because he believed God.

[ILL] Noah was like a lighthouse keeper in a storm. He didn't just shine the
light (preach); he stood on the solid rock (faith in God) while the waves of
popular opinion and mockery crashed around him. His life proved that it is
possible to walk with God even in a wicked generation.

### Q10. Why did the Lord destroy Sodom?

**“The men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly." Gen.
13:13. "We will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great
before the face of the Lord." Gen. 19:13.**

**Answer:** Sodom was destroyed because they were "sinners... exceedingly."

- **The Nature of their Sin:** They violated the laws of purity and love. Jude 7
  tells us they gave themselves over to "fornication" and "strange flesh."
  Ezekiel 16:49 adds that they were full of "pride, fullness of bread, and
  abundance of idleness" and did not strengthen the hand of the poor.
- **Sin against God:** Notice the text says they were sinners "before the Lord."
  Sin is personal; it is an offense against the Creator's character.

---

### Q11. By what standard were their deeds weighed?

**“And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked; for
that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his
righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds." 2 Peter 2:7, 8.**

**Answer:** Their deeds were weighed by the standard of God's law.

- **"Unlawful Deeds":** The Apostle Peter explicitly calls their actions
  "unlawful." This is proof positive that the Law existed in Lot's day. You
  cannot have "unlawful" deeds without a law.
- **"Filthy Conversation":** This refers to their conduct or lifestyle.
- **The Reaction of the Righteous:** Lot was "vexed" (tortured/distressed) by
  the sin around him. This is a mark of the true child of God (see Ezekiel 9:4).
  A believer cannot be comfortable in the presence of open rebellion against
  God's law.
- **Imputed Righteousness:** Lot was a flawed man, yet the Bible calls him
  "just" and "righteous." This shows he had been justified by faith, and his
  heart was aligned with God’s standards, even though he struggled in a
  difficult environment.

### Q12. What did Joseph say when he was tempted on a certain point?

**“How then, can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" Gen. 39:9.**

**Answer:** Joseph recognized the moral law regarding adultery centuries before
it was written on stone at Sinai.

- **The Seventh Commandment:** Joseph understood that taking another man's wife
  was "great wickedness."
- **Sin Against God:** While it would have been a sin against Potiphar, Joseph
  recognized the deeper truth: all sin is primarily treason against God.
- **Victory over Sin:** Joseph illustrates the power of Righteousness by Faith.
  He did not debate the temptation; he fled from it. His connection with God was
  so real that he would rather go to prison than break his relationship with the
  Lord by sinning. This is the experience God desires for His people in the last
  days (Revelation 14:12).

---

### Q13. What did God tell Abraham concerning the Amorites?

**“But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity
of the Amorites is not yet full." Gen. 15:16.**

**Answer:** God revealed to Abraham that nations are on probation.

- **Probationary Time:** God gave the Amorites over 400 years to turn from their
  wickedness. This shows God's mercy and longsuffering.
- **Measurement of Iniquity:** The cup of iniquity becomes "full" when a nation
  or individual completely rejects the light of conscience and truth.
- **National Judgment:** Just as God judged the world by the Flood and Sodom by
  fire, He judges nations when they violate moral law.

---

### Q14. Of what sin were they specially guilty?

**“And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did
the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel." 1 Kings
21:26.**

**Answer:** The Amorites were specifically guilty of gross idolatry ("following
idols").

- **Violation of the First Table:** This is a direct violation of the first and
  second commandments—putting other gods before the true God and bowing to
  images.
- **Abominations:** Their idolatry wasn't innocent; it involved horrific rites,
  including child sacrifice and ritual prostitution (Deuteronomy 12:31).
- **Universal Application:** The fact that God cast out the Amorites (Gentiles)
  for idolatry proves that the command to worship the true God alone was not
  just for Jews, but for all humanity.

---

### Q15. Why did the Lord abhor the nations that occupied Canaan before Israel?

**"Ye shall therefore keep all My statutes, and all My judgments and do them:
that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. And ye
shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you; for
they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them." Lev.
20:22, 23.**

**Answer:** God abhorred them because they "committed all these
things"—referring to a list of moral crimes including incest, adultery, and
child sacrifice.

- **The Land "Vomits" Sinners:** The metaphor of the land "spuing" (vomiting)
  them out vividly portrays that sin is unnatural. God created the world for
  righteousness; sin is a foreign, toxic substance that creation itself rejects
  (Romans 8:22).
- **No Double Standard:** God warned Israel that if they did the same things,
  the land would vomit them out too. God does not have one law for Gentiles and
  another for Jews; He has one moral standard for all mankind.

---

### Q16. Why did God make His promise to the seed of Abraham?

**“Because that Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My
statutes and My laws." Gen. 26:5.**

**Answer:** This is perhaps the most powerful verse regarding law in the
Patriarchal age. God confirms the covenant with Isaac based on Abraham's life of
faithful obedience.

- **Comprehensive Obedience:** Note the terms used: _Charge, Commandments,
  Statutes, Laws._ This vocabulary covers the entirety of God's revealed will,
  moral and ceremonial.
- **Before Sinai:** Abraham lived hundreds of years before Moses received the
  tablets of stone. Yet, Abraham knew God’s commandments. They were written on
  his heart by the Holy Spirit.
- **Faith Works:** Abraham is the "father of the faithful" (Romans 4:16). This
  text proves that true faith does not abolish the law; rather, true faith
  _establishes_ the law (Romans 3:31). Abraham believed God, and that faith
  produced obedience.

**Term Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The result of the covenant of grace where God writes His
  law in the heart (Hebrews 8:10), causing the believer to walk in His statutes
  (Ezekiel 36:27).

---

### Q17. What will the children of Abraham do?

**“Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works
of Abraham." John 8:39.**

**Answer:** Jesus teaches that spiritual lineage is demonstrated by character
and action, not just DNA.

- **The Works of Abraham:** What were the works of Abraham? As seen in the
  previous question, he "obeyed My voice" and kept God's commandments. He also
  commanded his household to keep the "way of the Lord" (Genesis 18:19).
- **Counterfeit Faith:** The Pharisees claimed to be Abraham's children but
  sought to kill Jesus (John 8:40). Jesus pointed out that their actions (works)
  proved they were actually children of the devil (John 8:44).
- **The Lesson:** We cannot claim to be saved by faith if our lives are
  characterized by willful disobedience. "Faith, if it hath not works, is dead,
  being alone" (James 2:17).

---

### Q18. Who are the children of Abraham?

**“And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
promise." Gal. 3:29.**

**Answer:** Here is the beautiful conclusion of the Gospel.

- **Union with Christ:** We do not become children of Abraham by birth or by our
  own efforts, but by belonging to Christ. When we accept Jesus, His history
  becomes our history. His righteousness becomes our robe.
- **Heirs of the Promise:** The promise to Abraham was a promise of land (the
  earth made new) and spiritual blessing. This belongs to the Christian who,
  like Abraham, walks by faith.
- **The Conclusion of the Matter:** If we are Abraham's seed through Christ, we
  will do the works of Abraham (Q17). We will cherish and obey God's
  commandments, not to _be_ saved, but because we _are_ saved and belong to the
  family of God.

[ILL] An adopted child takes on the legal name and the inheritance of the
father. But more than that, a loving adopted child grows to resemble the
character of the father the longer they live together. Being "Christ's" gives us
the title to heaven (Justification), and living with Him imparts to us His
character of obedience (Sanctification).
