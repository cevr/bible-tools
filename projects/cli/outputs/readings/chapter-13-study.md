### Q1. In what condition are all men naturally?

**"But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin." Gal. 3:22. "For all have
sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23.**

**Answer:** The Bible presents a diagnosis of the human race that is universal
and without exception. Naturally, apart from the grace of God, humanity is in a
state of spiritual bankruptcy.

- **The Scope of Sin:** The text says "all" have sinned. There are no distinct
  classes of men where some are naturally holy and others are sinners. Whether
  Jew or Gentile, rich or poor, all are born with a fallen nature inherited from
  Adam (Psalm 51:5).
- **The Definition of Sin:**
  - **Transgression:** Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4). It is
    stepping across the boundary of God’s government.
  - **Falling Short:** Romans 3:23 describes sin as coming short of the "glory
    of God." Since God’s glory is His character (Exodus 33:18–19; 34:6–7), sin
    is a failure to reflect God’s character of love.
- **The Prisoner:** The phrase "concluded all under sin" suggests a prison
  house. We are held captive by the power of sin, unable to free ourselves. This
  prepares the way for a Deliverer.

**[ILL] The Debtors:** Imagine a prison filled with debtors. One owes a million
dollars, another owes ten dollars. While the amounts differ, both are equally
prisoners and equally unable to pay their way out. So it is with humanity;
whether our sins seem great or small to human eyes, all are "under sin" and in
need of a Savior.

### Q2. What is the wages of sin?

**"The wages of sin is death." Rom. 6:23.**

**Answer:** In the government of God, sin is not merely a mistake; it is a
rebellion against the Source of Life.

- **Wages:** A wage is something earned—payment that is due. Sin acts as a
  master, and when we serve sin, it pays us in death.
- **The Nature of Death:** This is not merely the first death (sleep) that all
  experience, but the "second death" (Revelation 20:14)—eternal separation from
  God, who is the Life-giver.
- **The Justice of God:** The law of God is a law of life. To transgress it is
  to choose disconnection from Life. God does not arbitrarily kill; sin itself,
  when finished, brings forth death (James 1:15).

---

### Q3. What is the gift of God?

**"The gift of God is eternal life." Rom. 6:23.**

**Answer:** Here is the sharp contrast of the Gospel. While death is earned
(wages), life can never be earned by a sinner.

- **A Free Gift:** Eternal life is not a reward for good behavior, nor a payment
  for years of service. It is a gift (Ephesians 2:8).
- **Restoration:** This gift restores what Adam lost in Eden. It includes not
  only length of days (immortality) but quality of existence—a life in harmony
  with God’s law and character.

**Definition:**

- **Grace:** The unmerited favor of God toward those who deserve the opposite.
  It is God’s Riches At Christ’s Expense.

---

### Q4. In whom is now this gift?

**"This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is
in His Son." 1 John 5:11.**

**Answer:** God does not dispense eternal life as a separate commodity or a
package to be handed out. He gives us a Person.

- **Life is in the Son:** We cannot possess eternal life apart from possessing
  Christ. He is the "Life" (John 14:6).
- **The Fountain:** Just as water stays in the fountain, eternal life stays in
  Christ. To get the water, one must come to the fountain. To have life, one
  must be united with Jesus.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** This is the core of Righteousness by Faith. We do
  not have righteousness in ourselves; we have it only by being in Christ.

---

### Q5. How many may have this life?

**"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.
And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of
life freely." Rev. 22: 17. "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not
the Son of God hath not life." 1 John 5:12.**

**Answer:** The offer is universal, but the reception is conditional upon the
will.

- **Whosoever Will:** The invitation is open to every human being. No one is
  excluded by God’s decree; men exclude themselves by refusing to come (John
  5:40).
- **The Condition:** The verse in 1 John simplifies the entire judgment: "He
  that hath the Son hath life." It does not say "he that hath a good record" or
  "he that hath superior knowledge," but he that _hath the Son_.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:** Just as the water flowed from the rock in the
  wilderness (1 Corinthians 10:4), the water of life flows freely from Christ to
  all who are thirsty.

---

### Q6. How must one have Christ?

**"Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be
reprobates?" 2 Cor. 13:5.**

**Answer:** This question moves from the legal to the experiential. It is not
enough to know _about_ Christ historically; He must dwell within.

- **The Mystery of the Gospel:** Paul defines the "mystery" of the ages as
  "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27).
- **Indwelling Spirit:** Christ dwells in the believer through the Holy Spirit.
  This is not a metaphor; it is a spiritual reality where the mind of Christ
  becomes our mind (Philippians 2:5).
- **The Test:** The text asks us to examine ourselves. If Christ is not in
  us—ruling, guiding, and empowering—we are "reprobates" (disqualified or
  rejected), regardless of our outward profession.

---

### Q7. How do we really have Christ in us unto eternal life?

**"He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life." John 6:47.**

**Answer:** The mechanism of this union is faith.

- **Believing is Receiving:** To believe on Him is to accept Him as He is
  offered—as Savior from sin and Lord of life.
- **Present Possession:** The verb is present tense: "Hath" (has) everlasting
  life. It begins the moment the soul casts itself wholly upon Christ.
- **Heart Work:** This faith is "with the heart" (Romans 10:10). It opens the
  door of the soul for Jesus to enter (Revelation 3:20).

**Definition:**

- **Faith:** Not merely mental assent to facts, but a transaction of the will
  where I surrender my emptiness to receive Christ’s fullness. It is "taking God
  at His word" (Hebrews 11:1).

---

### Q8. What follows the reception of Christ?

**"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in
the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God." Gal. 2:20.**

**Answer:** When Christ is received, a new power takes the throne of the heart.
This is the essence of sanctification.

- **Death to Self:** "I am crucified with Christ." The old self-centered nature
  is legally reckoned dead and experientially subdued.
- **A New Occupant:** "Christ liveth in me." It is actually the life of Jesus
  being lived out through a human vessel.
- **Practical Obedience:** This answers the charge that faith leads to
  lawlessness. If Christ lives in me, He will do in me what He did in Galilee—He
  will keep the Father’s commandments (John 15:10). He does not enter the heart
  to sin, but to obey.

**[ILL] The Glove:** A glove lying on a table is powerless. It cannot lift a
penny. But if a living hand puts on the glove, the glove moves, lifts, and
works. The glove says, "I work, yet not I, but the hand works in me." So the
Christian is the vessel; Christ is the Worker.

---

### Q9. How are all regarded before they are quickened with Christ?

**"God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even
when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ." Eph.
2:4-5.**

**Answer:** Before the new birth, the Bible diagnoses us as "dead."

- **Spiritual Death:** A corpse cannot see, hear, or respond to physical
  stimuli. A sinner "dead in sins" is unresponsive to spiritual things until the
  Spirit draws him.
- **Quickened:** This old English word means "made alive."
- **Grace Initiative:** Notice that God loved us _while_ we were dead. He did
  not wait for us to revive ourselves. He breathed life into us through the
  Gospel.

---

### Q10. What is this spiritual transition from death to life called?

**"Being born again, not of corruptible seed; but of incorruptible, by the word
of God, which liveth and abideth forever." 1 Peter 1:23.**

**Answer:** This transition is the "New Birth" or being "Born Again" (John
3:3–5).

- **Necessity:** Just as we cannot enter the physical world without a physical
  birth, we cannot enter the spiritual kingdom without a spiritual birth.
- **The Agent:** The "seed" is the Word of God. When the Word is received into
  the heart by faith, it germinates and produces a new nature—the divine nature
  (2 Peter 1:4).
- **Victory:** This new birth is the secret to victory over sin. "Whosoever is
  born of God doth not commit sin [does not practice sinning]" (1 John 3:9).

---

### Q11. When our first parents transgressed, what was done to prevent them from living forever in sin?

**"And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and
eat, and live forever." "So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of
the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep
the way of the tree of life." Gen. 3:22, 24.**

**Answer:** God’s action here was an act of severe mercy.

- **Conditional Immortality:** Man is not naturally immortal. His life depended
  on access to the Tree of Life.
- **Preventing Immortal Sinners:** To allow a sinner to eat of the tree would be
  to immortalize sin. It would doom man to an eternity of misery, separation,
  and evil.
- **The Barred Way:** God barred the way to the physical tree so He could open a
  "new and living way" (Hebrews 10:20) through Christ. We now access life
  through faith, not through the physical fruit of Eden.

---

### Q12. By whom did the Lord say that Satan, the originator of sin, should be destroyed?

**"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Gen. 3:15.**

**Answer:** This is the _Protoevangelium_—the first proclamation of the Gospel.

- **The Enmity:** God promised to put a supernatural hatred for sin in the heart
  of man (the church/woman). Without this imparted enmity, we would be content
  slaves of Satan.
- **The Conflict:** There is a war between the seed of Satan (rebellion) and the
  Seed of the woman (Christ and His people).
- **The Victory:** The "Seed" (Christ) would suffer a bruised heel (the
  crucifixion—painful but not final), but He would crush the serpent's head (the
  total destruction of Satan and his kingdom).

---

### Q13. For what purpose did Christ die?

**"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also
Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him
that had the power of death, that is, the Devil." Heb. 2:14.**

**Answer:** Christ died to break the dominion of Satan and to liberate humanity.

- **Identification:** He did not take on the nature of angels; He took on "flesh
  and blood"—the same nature as the children He came to save. He met sin in the
  flesh to condemn sin in the flesh (Romans 8:3).
- **Destroying the Destroyer:** By dying, Jesus paid the wages of sin (death) on
  behalf of the race. In doing so, He broke Satan’s legal claim over humanity.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the sacrificial goat was slain in the
  outer court, Christ was slain on earth (the antitypical outer court) to make
  atonement.

---

### Q14. How early was it determined that Christ should die?

**"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not
written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."
Rev. 13:8.**

**Answer:** The plan of salvation was not an afterthought or an emergency backup
plan devised when Adam sinned.

- **Eternal Purpose:** The "Everlasting Covenant" (Hebrews 13:20) was
  established before creation. God foresaw the possibility of sin and provided
  the remedy—the Lamb—from the foundation of the world.
- **Security:** This gives the believer immense confidence. Our salvation rests
  on a foundation as old as eternity.

---

### Q15. Through whom was Abraham to receive the promise of God?

**"The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will give this land."
Gen. 12:7.**

**Answer:** The covenant of salvation was renewed with Abraham, centered on a
specific "Seed."

- **The Promise:** The inheritance (the land, and ultimately the earth made new)
  was promised not just to Abraham, but to his Seed.
- **Faith, not Flesh:** This promise was not based on Abraham's natural capacity
  (he was old and childless) but on God’s miraculous power.

---

### Q16. How far was the promise to Abraham to extend?

**"And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed." Acts 3:25.**

**Answer:** The promise was global and universal in scope.

- **Mission:** God called Abraham not to exclude the Gentiles, but to be the
  channel of blessing to _all_ families of the earth.
- **The Gospel:** Paul tells us that the gospel was preached to Abraham in this
  promise (Galatians 3:8).

---

### Q17. To whom does the "seed" of the Old Testament refer?

**"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to
seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." Gal.
3:16.**

**Answer:** Here is the key to the covenant.

- **Christ is the Seed:** The ultimate fulfillment of the covenant is Jesus
  Christ. He is the true Heir of the world.
- **Union with Christ:** Since the promise is made to Christ, the only way for
  us to share in the promise is to be _in_ Christ. "And if ye be Christ's, then
  are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (Galatians 3:29).

---

### Q18. How did the Lord regard Abraham's faith?

**"Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness." Rom.
4:3.**

**Answer:** This is the foundational text for Justification by Faith.

- **Counted/Imputed:** Abraham had no righteousness of his own to offer. He
  simply believed God’s promise. God took that faith and credited it to him as
  righteousness.
- **Exchange:** God treats the believing sinner as if he were righteous, because
  he trusts in the Righteous One.
- **Not Faith in Nothing:** It was not faith in "faith," but faith in _God's
  promise_ (the coming Seed) that saved him.

**Definition:**

- **Justification:** The legal declaration by God that a sinner is righteous. It
  is being "set right" with God, solely through the merits of Jesus.

---

### Q19. Since man had sinned, if righteousness could come by the law, then what must we conclude?

**"If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain." Gal. 2:21.**

**Answer:** This is the strongest argument against legalism (trying to be saved
by works).

- **The Dilemma:** If a man could save himself by obeying the Ten Commandments,
  then the sacrifice of Jesus was an unnecessary waste.
- **The Limit of Law:** The law points out sin (Romans 3:20), but it has no
  power to save, forgive, or change the heart. It acts as a mirror—revealing the
  smudge on the face, but unable to wash it off. Only the blood of Jesus can
  cleanse.

**[ILL] The Mirror:** If you look in a mirror and see dirt on your face, you do
not try to wash your face with the mirror. You go to the water. The law is the
mirror; Christ is the water.

---

### Q20. Why have all been reckoned under sin?

**"But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of
Christ Jesus might be given to them that believe." Gal. 3:22.**

**Answer:** God allows the law to reveal our hopeless condition for a specific
purpose.

- **Shut Up to Faith:** We are diagnosed as terminal so that we might accept the
  Cure. The law strips us of self-confidence so we must rely wholly on "the
  faith of Christ Jesus."
- **The Promise:** The promise of the Spirit and eternal life is given only to
  those who stop working for it and start trusting the Savior for it.

---

### Q21. What does Christ become to the true believer?

**"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh
unto the Father, but by Me." John 14:6.**

**Answer:** Christ is the exclusive and all-sufficient means of salvation.

- **The Way:** Not merely a signpost pointing the way, He _is_ the Way. In the
  sanctuary service, He is the Door, the Sacrifice, the Priest, and the Veil.
- **The Truth:** He is the reality of all God’s promises.
- **The Life:** He is the source of the new life that overcomes sin.
- **No Other Way:** There is no other ladder from earth to heaven. All human
  philosophy, ritual, or effort fails to bridge the gap caused by sin.

---

### Q22. How then do all become children of God?

**"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:26.**

**Answer:** Adoption into the heavenly family is by faith alone.

- **Relationship:** We are not natural-born children of God (in the spiritual
  sense); we are "children of wrath" by nature (Ephesians 2:3). We become
  children by adoption through faith.
- **Equality:** This privilege is open to "all"—Jew, Gentile, bond, or free.

---

### Q23. If children of God, what is our prospect?

**"If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ." Rom.
8:17.**

**Answer:** The study concludes with the glorious result of the Gospel.

- **Heirs:** An heir inherits what the father possesses. God gives us the
  Kingdom.
- **Joint-Heirs:** We share the inheritance with Jesus. Whatever He has won, He
  shares with His people—His throne, His glory, and His eternal life (Revelation
  3:21).
- **The Condition of Suffering:** The verse goes on to say, "if so be that we
  suffer with him." We share in His sufferings against sin now, that we may
  share in His glory hereafter.

**Concluding Thought:** As noted in the introduction to this topic, for Christ
to be a perfect Savior, He had to be made "like unto his brethren" (Hebrews
2:17). He took our nature, fought our battles, and defeated sin in the flesh.
Now, through the new birth, He imparts that victory to us. He does not merely
cover our past; He empowers our present. He is the Way of Life—not just a
theory, but a living Person dwelling in the heart of the believer.
