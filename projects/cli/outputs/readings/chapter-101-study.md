### Q1. Because Jesus had not followed their unbiblical traditions about the Sabbath, what did the Jews do?

“Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath day.” (John 5:16)

**Answer:**
The conflict between Christ and the religious leaders was not over the validity of the Law of God, but over the method of its observance and the source of righteousness.

1.  **Tradition vs. Commandment:** The Jewish leaders had encrusted the Sabbath of the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8–11) with hundreds of man-made restrictions. Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28), ignored these human additions to demonstrate the true purpose of the day: mercy, healing, and restoration.
2.  **The Spirit of Persecution:** Because Jesus’ life of perfect love rebuked their cold legalism, they sought to kill Him. This reveals a fundamental principle in the **Great Controversy**: false religion, which relies on outward forms and human authority, will always persecute true religion, which relies on the Spirit and the Word of God.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** The leaders sought righteousness by rigorous adherence to rules (works of the law). Jesus demonstrated righteousness as a living principle of love flowing from the Father. When the heart is not softened by the grace of Christ, the law becomes a yoke of bondage, and those who impose it become intolerant of those who walk in the liberty of the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:17).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a man who builds a fence around a beautiful garden to protect it. Over time, he builds another fence, and then another, until the garden can no longer be seen or enjoyed. When the Gardener arrives and opens the gate so people can enter and eat the fruit, the fence-builder becomes angry because his fences are ignored. The Jewish leaders loved their "fences" (traditions) more than the Garden (God’s presence) or the Gardener (Jesus).

### Q2. What kind of fast is most acceptable to God?

“Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?” (Isaiah 58:6)

**Answer:**
God contrasts empty ritualism with practical godliness. True religion is not merely abstaining from food, but abstaining from sin and selfishness.

*   **Loosing the Bands of Wickedness:** This is the work of the Gospel. Before we can help others, we must experience the **Justification** (being declared righteous) that sets us free from the guilt of sin.
*   **Letting the Oppressed Go Free:** This points to the work of **Sanctification** (being made holy). The gospel breaks the power of reigning sin in the life. A man enslaved by appetite, pride, or anger is not free.
*   **Practical Ministry:** The result of receiving Christ’s righteousness is a heart that loves what God loves. The true believer will work to relieve suffering, ignorance, and oppression in the world, ministering to the physical and spiritual needs of others (Matthew 25:35–40).

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The continuous process by which the Holy Spirit imparts Christ's character to the believer, enabling them to overcome sin and live a life of obedience and love (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23).

### Q3. Why did Cain kill Able?

“For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.” (1 John 3:11, 12)

**Answer:**
The first murder in history was a religious persecution. It illustrates the two opposing systems of salvation found throughout Scripture.

1.  **Two Offerings:**
    *   **Cain** brought the "fruit of the ground" (Genesis 4:3). This represents salvation by **works**—offering God the product of one's own labor and culture, without recognizing the need for a substitute. It is the religion of self-sufficiency.
    *   **Abel** brought a "firstling of his flock" (Genesis 4:4). This represents **righteousness by faith**. He recognized he was a sinner who needed a Substitute. By offering the blood, he looked forward to the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29).
2.  **The Enmity:** Cain’s offering was rejected because without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin (Hebrews 9:22). Abel’s righteous life—a life of faith and dependence on God—was a silent rebuke to Cain’s pride.
3.  **The Sanctuary Truth:** Abel met God at the altar with a sacrifice, acknowledging the penalty of the law. Cain bypassed the altar of sacrifice (the cross) and tried to approach God on his own merits. Those who rely on human merit often despise and persecute those who rely solely on the blood of Christ.

**[ILL]**
Two patients have the same deadly disease. One admits he is helpless and takes the doctor's bitter medicine, resulting in a cure. The other insists he is healthy enough to cure himself with vitamins and exercise, but he gets worse. The pride of the second man causes him to hate the first man, because the first man’s cure proves the second man’s method is foolish. Cain hated Abel because Abel’s faith exposed Cain’s failure.

### Q4. Commenting on Ishmael's treatment of Isaac, what principle does Paul give us?

“But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the flesh Spirit, even so it is now.” (Galatians 4:29)

**Answer:**
Paul uses the story of Ishmael and Isaac to illustrate the conflict between the **Old Covenant** (trying to keep the law by human effort) and the **New Covenant** (the law written in the heart by God's Spirit).

*   **Born after the Flesh:** Ishmael was the result of Abraham attempting to fulfill God's promise through human devising (works). This represents the legalist—one who tries to earn heaven by their own strength. The "flesh" (carnal nature) is enmity against God (Romans 8:7).
*   **Born after the Spirit:** Isaac was the child of promise, born miraculously when human strength was dead. This represents the true Christian, who is "born again" by the power of the Holy Spirit (John 3:3–6).
*   **The Conflict:** The legalist spirit is always harsh, critical, and persecuting. The Spirit-filled life is one of love and freedom. Just as Ishmael mocked Isaac, those who rely on outward forms often mock and harass those who walk in the Spirit.

**Definition:**
*   **The Flesh:** In Scripture, this often refers not just to the physical body, but to the unrenewed, selfish nature of man that opposes God (Galatians 5:17).

### Q5. Who does Paul tell us will suffer persecution?

“Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” (2 Timothy 3:12)

**Answer:**
Persecution is not an accident; it is a logical necessity in a sinful world.

1.  **The Condition:** The text does not say "all who profess religion" will suffer, but "all that will live **godly in Christ Jesus**."
    *   To live "godly" means to have the character of God reproduced in the life.
    *   To live "in Christ Jesus" means to have a vital, abiding connection with Him (John 15:4).
2.  **The Reaction:** The world hates Christ because His light exposes their darkness (John 3:19). If Christ dwells in us, His presence will provoke the same reaction in the world today as it did when He walked in Judea.
3.  **The Promise of Grace:** While persecution is promised, the grace to endure it is also promised. The believer does not face this in their own strength, but through the indwelling power of the Saviour.

**[ILL]**
If you row a boat downstream with the current, the water carries you effortlessly. But if you turn the boat around and row upstream against the current, you immediately feel the resistance and force of the water against you. A Christian is one who rows against the current of the world. The resistance they feel is persecution.

### Q6. What is essential to religious persecution?

**Answer:**
Ecclesiastical control of the civil power, or a union of church and state.

1.  **The Separation of Realms:** Jesus established the principle: "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matthew 22:21).
    *   **Civil Government:** Deals with the relationship between man and man (justice, order, protection). It uses the sword (force) to punish crime (Romans 13:4).
    *   **The Church:** Deals with the relationship between man and God (worship, faith, conscience). It uses the Word (sword of the Spirit) to convict the heart.
2.  **The Danger of Union:** When the church fails to convert men by the power of love and the Holy Spirit, she often tempts the state to use force to compel the conscience. This creates a beast-like power (Revelation 13) that enforces worship. True worship can never be forced; it must be a freewill offering of love.

---

### Q7. Since persecution is invariably wrong, what must be true of persecuting governments?

**Answer:**
They likewise must be in the wrong.

*   **God’s Character:** God grants every being freedom of choice (Joshua 24:15). He desires obedience motivated by love, not fear of punishment.
*   **The Limit of Authority:** When a government dictates religious belief or practice, it steps outside its God-ordained jurisdiction. "We ought to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).
*   **The Lesson:** Any system—whether political or religious—that uses force, coercion, or penalties to mandate worship is operating contrary to the principles of heaven.

### Q8. What terrible deception would it require for religious people to persecute Christians?

“They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh; that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.” (John 16:1, 2)

**Answer:**
This describes the height of spiritual blindness.

1.  **Conscience Deceived:** It is possible to have a zeal for God, but "not according to knowledge" (Romans 10:2). Saul of Tarsus (Paul) believed he was serving God when he imprisoned believers, until he met Jesus on the Damascus road (Acts 26:9–11).
2.  **Satan’s Strategy:** By distorting the character of God, Satan leads men to believe that God is a tyrant who demands forced homage. If men believe God burns heretics eternally in hell, they feel justified in burning them temporarily on earth.
3.  **The Need for Truth:** This highlights why we must know the Scriptures for ourselves. A sincere conscience, if misinformed by false doctrine, can lead to terrible sin. We need the Spirit of Truth to guide us (John 16:13).

**Definition:**
*   **Investigative Judgment:** The work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary to review the lives of believers, separating true faith from false profession, before His Second Coming. This judgment vindicates God's justice and the believer's standing in Christ (Daniel 7:9–10; 2 Corinthians 5:10).

### Q9. Who is the original murderer?

“Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning.” (John 8:44)

**Answer:**
The spirit of persecution is the spirit of Satan.

*   **The Root is Hate:** John tells us that "whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer" (1 John 3:15). Persecution begins in the heart with anger, resentment, and intolerance.
*   **Two Fathers:** Jesus makes it clear there are only two spiritual families. We are either children of God, manifesting His love, or children of the devil, manifesting his hatred.
*   **The Remedy:** We must be born again. We need a new heart—a "heart of flesh" (Ezekiel 36:26)—that is capable of loving our enemies. This is the miracle of **Righteousness by Faith**: God replacing our stony, selfish nature with the loving nature of Jesus.

### Q10. When James and John wished to call down fire from heaven to consume the unbelieving Samaritans, what did Christ say in reply?

“He turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of: For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives but to save them.” (Luke 9:55, 56)

**Answer:**
Even Christ's closest disciples were tempted by the spirit of intolerance.

1.  **Defending Jesus?** The disciples thought they were defending Jesus’ honor. But Jesus showed that His honor is defended by mercy, not vengeance.
2.  **A Different Spirit:** The "spirit" that seeks to destroy those who disagree with us is not the Holy Spirit. It is the spirit of the enemy.
3.  **The Mission:** Christ came to save. Therefore, any action by the church that destroys life, reputation, or liberty acts against the very mission of Christ. The Gospel utilizes the power of the cross (self-sacrifice), never the power of the sword (force).

**[ILL]**
The sun melts the ice, but a hammer shatters it. You can try to break a man's resistance with the hammer of force, but you will only leave him shattered and hard. Only the warm sunlight of Christ's love can melt the heart and change the nature.

### Q11. Has the Papacy claimed the authority to persecute?

**Answer:**
Yes. History and the internal documents of the Roman Catholic Church (as noted in the lesson source material) confirm this claim.

1.  **The Theological Basis:** The claim to authority to persecute stems from the doctrine of **Infallibility** and the belief that the Church possesses the keys to the kingdom exclusively. If one believes there is no salvation outside their specific organization, they may rationalize that suppressing "heresy" (dissent) is an act of mercy to society.
2.  **Prophetic Identity:** This aligns with the prophecy of the "Little Horn" in Daniel 7:21, which "made war with the saints, and prevailed against them," and the beast of Revelation 13:7.
3.  **The Protestant Principle:** In contrast, the Bible teaches that "every one of us shall give account of himself to God" (Romans 14:12). No church has the right to police the conscience. While we must identify the *system* (the Papacy) as the fulfillment of prophecy, we must also recognize that many individual believers within that system are following the light they have and are loved by God.

### Q12. What divine command, if obeyed, would do away with all oppression and persecution?

“Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” (Matthew 22:39). “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” (Matthew 7:12)

**Answer:**
The Law of God, which is the law of love, is the perfect remedy for intolerance.

*   **The Golden Rule:** This is the principle of the universe. It requires us to accord to others the same rights of conscience and freedom that we desire for ourselves.
*   **The Impossible Command?** To the natural, selfish human heart, loving one's neighbor as oneself is impossible. This command drives us to Christ. We must ask Him to dwell in us and love our neighbor *through* us. This is the essence of the New Covenant promise: "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).
*   **Victory over Selfishness:** When Christ controls the heart, selfishness dies. Where selfishness is dead, persecution is impossible.

### Q13. What does love not do?

“Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” (Romans 13:10)

**Answer:**
Love is active; it is the keeping of the commandments in spirit and truth.

1.  **Love vs. Harm:** Persecution works "ill" (harm) to a neighbor—physically, socially, or economically. Therefore, persecution is a violation of the law of God.
2.  **Fulfilling the Law:** Many claim to have "love" while ignoring God's commandments, but the Bible says love *is* the fulfilling of the law.
    *   If I love my neighbor, I will not kill him (6th Commandment).
    *   I will not steal from him (8th Commandment).
    *   I will not lie about him (9th Commandment).
3.  **The Fruit of the Spirit:** The only way to fulfill the law is to walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16, 22–23). Righteousness is not a legal fiction; it is the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, resulting in a harmless, blameless life (Philippians 2:15).

### Q14. What blessing does Christ impart to those who are persecuted?

“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” (Matthew 5:10-12). (See Revelation 2:10; 6:9-11.)

**Answer:**
Christ turns the world's values upside down. To be persecuted for His sake is a badge of honor, a sign of citizenship in His kingdom.

1.  **Fellowship of Suffering:** Persecution identifies the believer with Christ and the prophets. It confirms that we are no longer of the world (John 15:19).
2.  **Character Development:** Trials and opposition, when met with the Spirit of Christ, refine the character. They purge away dross and teach us to depend wholly upon God. "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church."
3.  **The Final Reward:** The suffering is temporary; the kingdom is eternal. The "reward" is not of debt, but of grace. Those who stand firm for truth, even unto death, will receive the "crown of life" (Revelation 2:10).

**[ILL]**
A diamond is merely a piece of coal that has endured intense pressure and heat over a long time. The pressure did not destroy it; it transformed it into something precious and reflective of the light. God uses the pressure of persecution to transform His people into jewels that reflect His glory (Malachi 3:17).

**Practical Conclusion:**
We cannot avoid persecution if we are faithful to Christ, but we can determine our response. By partaking of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4), we can respond to hatred with love, and to violence with prayer. This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.
