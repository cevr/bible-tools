### Q1. Who is emphatically the good shepherd?

"I [Jesus Christ] am the good Shepherd." John 10:11.

**Answer:**

The Lord Jesus Christ stands alone as the great Pattern for all ministry and
leadership. In declaring Himself the "Good Shepherd," He distinguishes Himself
from all earthly priests, kings, or philosophers.

1.  **The Owner of the Flock:** Unlike a hired hand, the sheep belong to Him by
    double right:
    - **Creation:** "It is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are
      his people, and the sheep of his pasture" (Psalm 100:3).
    - **Redemption:** He has "purchased" the church with His own blood (Acts
      20:28).
2.  **The Personal Connection:** In the East, a shepherd does not drive sheep;
    he leads them, and they know his voice. This illustrates the personal
    relationship of **Righteousness by Faith**. We do not obey a set of cold
    rules; we follow a Person who loves us.
    - **Justification:** We enter the fold through Him, the Door (John 10:9).
    - **Sanctification:** We walk in the path He treads before us. To be a
      Christian is simply to follow the Shepherd wherever He goes (Revelation
      14:4).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a stranger trying to call a flock of sheep. The
sheep will startle and run because the voice is unfamiliar. But when the true
shepherd whispers, even in the dark, the sheep settle down or follow
immediately. So it is with the believer; the "voice" of the Good Shepherd is
found in His Word. It speaks peace to the conscience and calls us away from the
dangerous cliffs of sin.

### Q2. To what extent did Christ sacrifice for the sheep?

"The good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep." John 10:11.

**Answer:**

Here is the foundation of the gospel. The extent of the Shepherd’s sacrifice is
total—He gave His life. This points us directly to the **Sanctuary service**:

1.  **The Lamb and the Shepherd:** Uniquely, Christ is both the High Priest
    (Shepherd) and the Victim (the Lamb). In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner
    brought a lamb to die for their sin. In the plan of salvation, God provided
    the Lamb—His own Son (John 1:29).
2.  **Substitutionary Atonement:**
    - **Definition:** _Atonement_ means reconciliation. Because the "wages of
      sin is death" (Romans 6:23), the broken law demanded the life of the
      transgressor.
    - Christ stepped in between the wolf (Satan/Death) and the sheep. He took
      the bite of death so that the sheep might live.
3.  **Infinite Cost:** "Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver
    and gold... but with the precious blood of Christ" (1 Peter 1:18–19). This
    proves the immense value God places on the human soul.

**[ILL] Illustration:** David, a type of Christ, risked his life fighting a lion
and a bear to save a single lamb (1 Samuel 17:34–35). But Christ did more than
risk His life; He voluntarily laid it down. He did not die merely as a martyr;
He died as a substitute, taking the crushing weight of the world's guilt upon
Himself in Gethsemane and Calvary.

### Q3. Will false shepherds do this?

"The hireling fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep."
John 10:13. "They are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their
own way, everyone for his gain, from his quarter." Isa. 56:11.

**Answer:**

A clear distinction is drawn between the true shepherd (motivated by love) and
the hireling (motivated by self-interest).

1.  **The Hireling Spirit:** A hireling works only for wages (money, prestige,
    or power). When ministry becomes difficult, unpopular, or dangerous ("when
    he seeth the wolf coming"), the hireling abandons the truth and the flock to
    protect himself.
2.  **Self-Seeking:** Isaiah describes them as looking "to their own way." This
    is the essence of sin—placing self above God and His law.
    - Instead of feeding the flock, they feed off the flock.
    - They dilute the truth to maintain popularity or income.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A captain who loves his passengers will stay with the
sinking ship to the very end to save them. A captain who only cares for his
paycheck will be the first in the lifeboat when the ship strikes an iceberg. The
"wolf" today may be ridicule, loss of job, or social pressure. The hireling
compromises truth to escape these pressures; the true shepherd stands firm for
God's law, come what may.

### Q4. Will the true shepherd see that the sheep are provided with food?

"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock over the which the
Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He hath
purchased with His own blood." Acts 20:28. See also 1 Peter 5:2.

**Answer:**

The primary duty of a spiritual leader (pastor, elder, or teacher) is to nourish
the flock.

1.  **Divine Commission:** The Holy Ghost makes men "overseers."
    - **Definition:** _Overseer_ implies one who watches over the safety and
      health of others.
2.  **Purchased Possession:** The shepherd must remember the sheep are not his
    own; they are "purchased with [God's] own blood." Mistreating or starving
    the flock is a sin against the Owner, Christ.
3.  **Feeding is Essential:** Just as physical life requires daily bread,
    spiritual life requires the "bread of life." Without it, the church becomes
    weak, sickly, and unable to resist temptation.

---

### Q5. With what kind of food will he feed the flock?

"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge
the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom; Preach the word." 2
Tim. 4:1, 2. (See also Rev. 10:9, 10 and Eze. 2:8, Eze. 3:1-3.)

**Answer:**

The only safe food for the soul is the unadulterated Word of God.

1.  **Preach the Word:** Not politics, not philosophy, not comedy, and not
    psychology. The faithful shepherd opens the Bible and explains the
    Scriptures (Luke 24:27).
2.  **The Scroll of Prophecy:** The references to Revelation 10 and Ezekiel 3
    involve eating a "book" or "scroll." This symbolizes internalizing the
    message.
    - A minister cannot share what he has not eaten himself. He must have a
      personal experience with **Sanctification** through the Word (John 17:17)
      before he can lead others.
3.  **Judgment Context:** Paul charges Timothy to preach the word in light of
    the "appearing" of Christ. We are living in the time of the **Investigative
    Judgment**; therefore, the preaching must prepare people to stand before
    God.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a mother feeds her child candy and sawdust instead of
milk and bread, the child will starve or become diseased. Pastors who preach
mere entertainment or human theories are feeding the flock "sawdust." The soul
needs the "sincere milk of the word" (1 Peter 2:2) to grow into the likeness of
Christ.

---

### Q6. Will the true shepherd set a good example to the flock?

"In all things showing thyself a pattern of good works." Titus 2:7.

**Answer:**

A true shepherd leads from the front. His life must match his message.

1.  **A Pattern of Good Works:** This touches on **Imparted Righteousness**. It
    is not enough to have "correct theology" (imputed
    righteousness/justification alone); the life must demonstrate the power of
    the Gospel to transform character (sanctification).
2.  **Visual Theology:** People read the pastor's life more than they listen to
    his sermons. If a leader preaches health reform but is intemperate, or
    preaches humility but is proud, he destroys his own work.
3.  **Victory over Sin:** The shepherd must demonstrate that Christ’s grace is
    sufficient to overcome pride, appetite, and selfishness (1 Corinthians
    9:27).

---

### Q7. Will he warn the sheep of coming danger?

"O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore
thou shalt hear the word at My mouth, and warn them from Me." Eze. 33:7.

**Answer:**

The shepherd is also a watchman. In ancient times, watchmen stood on the city
walls to spot approaching armies.

1.  **Hearing from God:** The watchman does not invent the warning; he hears "at
    My mouth." He transmits God's warnings found in Scripture.
2.  **The Three Angels' Messages:** In the last days, the specific warning
    entrusted to God's watchmen is found in Revelation 14:6–12. This involves:
    - The hour of God's judgment.
    - The fall of Babylon (false religious systems).
    - The warning against the Mark of the Beast.
3.  **Duty to Warn:** It is not unloving to warn of danger; it is the highest
    form of love. To see a sword coming and remain silent is an act of hatred
    toward the sheep.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a bridge is washed out on a dark night, a faithful
watchman will wave a light and shout to stop cars from driving over the edge. If
he sits quietly because he doesn't want to "disturb" the drivers or seem
"negative," he is responsible for the crash.

---

### Q8. What does the Lord say to the watchman or shepherd who does not warn the wicked?

"If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall
die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand." Eze. 33:8.

**Answer:**

This is a solemn statement regarding **bloodguiltiness**.

1.  **Personal Responsibility:** Every man dies for his own iniquity. The wicked
    man is not excused because the watchman was silent.
2.  **Ministerial Accountability:** However, God holds the silent shepherd
    accountable for the loss of that soul. This highlights the seriousness of
    the ministry. It is a matter of life and death, eternal gain or eternal
    loss.
3.  **The Watchman's Defense:** The apostle Paul understood this well. He said,
    "I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not shunned to declare unto
    you all the counsel of God" (Acts 20:26–27).

---

### Q9. What does our Saviour call false shepherds?

"Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the blind." Matt. 15:14.

**Answer:**

Jesus identifies a terrible condition: **Spiritual Blindness.**

1.  **Blindness to the Law:** In the context of Matthew 15, the Pharisees were
    elevating human tradition above the Commandments of God (Matt 15:3–6). A
    leader who sets aside God's Ten Commandments to follow popularity or
    tradition is spiritually blind.
2.  **The Ditch:** The result of following a blind guide is that "both shall
    fall into the ditch." This implies ruin and loss of salvation.
3.  **"Let Them Alone":** This is a command to separate. If a leader is
    persistently blind to the plain truths of God's Word, the true sheep must
    not follow him.

---

### Q10. Do such warn the flock of coming danger?

"His watchmen are blind, that are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they
cannot bark, sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber." Isa. 56:10. "They have
healed also the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, Peace,
peace; when there is no peace." Jer. 6:14.

**Answer:**

False shepherds are characterized by their silence regarding sin and judgment.

1.  **Dumb Dogs:** A watchdog that does not bark when a thief approaches is
    useless. Similarly, a preacher who never preaches against popular sins
    (Sabbath-breaking, intemperance, pride, worldliness) is a "dumb dog."
2.  **"Peace, Peace":** This is the false gospel of **Cheap Grace**.
    - They comfort the sinner in his sins, rather than leading him _out_ of his
      sins.
    - **Definition:** _Cheap Grace_ promises forgiveness without requiring
      repentance or a change of life.
    - True peace only comes when sin is confessed and forsaken (Proverbs 28:13).
3.  **Healing Slightly:** They put a bandage on a cancer. They treat the
    symptoms of unhappiness without addressing the root cause: rebellion against
    God's law.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a doctor who tells a patient with a deadly
infection, "You are fine, just take this painkiller and relax." The patient
feels better for a moment but eventually dies. A true doctor (and a true
shepherd) performs the painful surgery of exposing sin to save the life.

---

### Q11. Has the Lord given us another means by which to distinguish between true and false shepherds?

"To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it
is because there is no light in them." Isa. 8:20. "For the priest's lips should
keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth... But ye are departed
out of the way: ye have caused many to stumble at the law." Mal. 2:7, 8.

**Answer:**

God has given an objective standard to test all teachers: The Law of God and the
Testimony of His Word.

1.  **The Standard of Truth:** The Ten Commandments (the Law) are the transcript
    of God’s character. If a shepherd teaches that the Law is abolished, or that
    we can ignore one of the commandments (like the fourth), there is "no light
    in them."
    - **Note:** "No light" means they are speaking from darkness/error,
      regardless of how eloquent or educated they may be.
2.  **Causing to Stumble:** Malachi warns that false priests cause people to
    stumble _at the law_. They make obedience seem impossible or unnecessary.
3.  **Harmony of Law and Gospel:** A true shepherd shows that the Law reveals
    our need for Christ, and Christ empowers us to keep the Law (Romans 8:3–4).
    This is the essence of the New Covenant: "I will put my laws into their
    mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).

---

### Q12. Will the shepherds who are unfaithful give to the flock the sense of those prophecies relating to "the time of the end" (Dan. 12:14)?

"And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed,
which men deliver to one that is learned, saying Read this, I pray thee: and he
saith, I cannot, for it is sealed." Isa. 29:11. Read also verses 13-16.

**Answer:**

_Note: The user’s reference to Dan. 12:14 likely refers to the end of the book
of Daniel (ch 12:4, 9), where the book is sealed "even to the time of the end."_

False shepherds often neglect or ignore the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation.

1.  **"It is Sealed":** Many modern ministers refuse to preach on the beasts,
    the horns, the sanctuary, or the time prophecies of Daniel. They claim these
    things are too difficult, "sealed," or not practical for today.
2.  **Learned Ignorance:** Isaiah 29 depicts the learned men (the
    scholars/theologians) admitting they cannot understand the prophetic word.
3.  **The Result—Human Religion:** Verse 13 explains the result of ignoring
    prophecy: "Their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men." When the
    sure word of prophecy is neglected, the church drifts into human traditions
    and emotionalism.
4.  **The Advent Message:** The unsealing of Daniel occurred at the "time of the
    end" (post-1798). A faithful shepherd today _must_ understand and teach
    these prophecies to prepare a people for the Second Coming.

---

### Q13. Was there to come a time when people would not listen to Bible truth?

"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after
their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and
they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto
fables." 2 Tim. 4:3, 4.

**Answer:**

This prophecy describes the religious condition of the last days.

1.  **Itching Ears:** People desire novelty, entertainment, and affirmation.
    They do not want to hear about duty, self-denial, or judgment.
2.  **Heaping Teachers:** The problem is not just with the leaders, but with the
    congregations. The people _hire_ pastors who tell them what they want to
    hear. It is a supply-and-demand problem; a worldly church demands a worldly
    pastor.
3.  **Turning to Fables:** When truth is rejected, the vacuum is filled with
    myths (fables).
    - Examples of fables: The natural immortality of the soul, Sunday
      sacredness, or the idea that one can be saved while deliberately sinning.

---

### Q14. Will such like to have plain words spoken to them?

"Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy unto
us deceits." Isa. 30:10.

**Answer:**

The carnal heart is at enmity with God (Romans 8:7). It desires "smooth
things"—a religion that allows for a comfortable life in this world while
promising heaven in the next.

1.  **The Rejection of "Right Things":** "Right things" refers to straight,
    upright truth. The unregenerate heart finds the straight testimony
    offensive.
2.  **Preference for Deceit:** It is a fearful thing when people prefer a
    comforting lie over an uncomfortable truth. This prepares the way for the
    final deceptions of Satan.
3.  **The True Shepherd's Duty:** He must speak the "right things" in love, even
    if it causes the "itching ears" to burn. He must love the soul more than he
    loves the soul's approval.

---

### Q15. What does the Lord say further concerning false shepherds?

"My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go
astray... Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not
the shepherds feed the flocks?... neither shall the shepherds feed themselves
any more, for I will deliver My flock from their mouth..." Jer. 50:6; Eze. 34:2,
3, 8-12.

**Answer:**

God eventually intervenes to judge the false shepherds and rescue His people.

1.  **Shepherds Causing Error:** Jeremiah points out that the people are lost
    _because_ of their leaders. This places a heavy burden on the ministry.
2.  **God Against the Shepherds:** In Ezekiel 34, God declares, "I am against
    the shepherds." He will fire them, as it were, and take over the job
    Himself.
3.  **The Gathering:** "I... will both search My sheep, and seek them out" (Eze
    34:11). This points to the **Remnant** gathering in the last days. God is
    calling His sheep out of false folds (Babylon) where they are being starved
    and fleeced, and bringing them into the one true fold of Bible truth.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a babysitter neglects the children and eats all the
food while the parents are away, the parents' return will be a day of reckoning.
The babysitter will be dismissed, and the parents will care for the children
themselves. Christ is returning to relieve the hirelings and gather His
scattered flock.

---

### Q16. What is to be the future of those who "add unto" or "take away from " the words of prophecy?

"If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that
are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the
book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life..."
Rev. 22:18, 19. (See also Jer. 25:34-37).

**Answer:**

Tampering with God's Word brings the most severe penalties in Scripture.

1.  **The Integrity of Scripture:** God protects His revelation. "Adding"
    (bringing in tradition/human philosophy) or "Taking Away" (denying portions
    of Scripture/modernism) alters the map to heaven, causing souls to be lost.
2.  **The Plagues:** Those who distort the message will receive the **Seven Last
    Plagues** (Revelation 16). This confirms that false shepherding is a major
    issue in the final judgment.
3.  **Loss of Eternal Life:** To have one’s part taken out of the **Book of
    Life** is the second death. It is the final blotting out of the name from
    existence.
4.  **Jeremiah's Warning:** The "shepherds shall have no way to flee." In the
    day of the Lord's anger, titles, degrees, and positions will offer no
    protection.

---

### Q17. What promise has Peter left on record for faithful shepherds?

"And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory
that fadeth not away." 1 Peter 5:4.

**Answer:**

While the work of a faithful shepherd is hard, thankless, and often opposed by
wolves and hirelings, the reward is sure.

1.  **The Appearing:** The reward is given at the Second Coming, not at death.
    The focus is on the "Chief Shepherd's" return.
2.  **The Crown of Glory:** This is the victor's crown (stephanos).
    - It "fadeth not away," unlike the laurels of earthly fame or the money of
      the hireling which "cankers" (James 5:3).
    - Daniel 12:3 says, "They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
      firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever
      and ever."

**Conclusion:** The lesson for every believer is twofold:

1.  **Pray for your shepherds**, that they may be faithful watchmen who feed the
    flock with the pure Word.
2.  **Test all things** by the Law and the Testimony. Do not rely on a human
    leader for your salvation. Look to the Chief Shepherd, Jesus Christ, and
    follow Him.
