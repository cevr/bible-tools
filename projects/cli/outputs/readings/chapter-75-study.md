### Q1. What positive statement does the apostle make concerning the law?

**Scripture:**
> "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight." (Romans 3:20)

**Answer:**
While this statement appears negative at first glance, it establishes a positive and absolute theological truth: human effort to keep the law cannot produce the righteousness necessary for salvation.

1.  **The Limit of Human Effort:** The "deeds of the law" refer to man’s attempt to obey God’s commandments in his own strength to earn acceptance. The Apostle Paul clarifies that fallen human nature is incapable of producing perfect righteousness (Romans 8:3, 7).
2.  **Definition of Justification:**
    *   **Justification:** This is a legal term meaning God declares a sinner "not guilty" and treats them as if they were righteous. It is the forgiveness of sins and the imputation (crediting) of Christ’s perfect life to the believer’s account (Romans 4:5–8).
3.  **The Purpose of the Law:** The law was never designed to be a savior. In the earthly sanctuary service, the Ten Commandments were inside the Ark of the Covenant, covered by the Mercy Seat. The law demanded perfection; the sinner outside could not offer it. Only the blood sprinkled upon the Mercy Seat (representing Christ's sacrifice) could intervene between the law's demand and the sinner's guilt.
4.  **Righteousness by Faith:** This verse destroys the foundation of legalism (trying to be saved by works). We must look away from our own imperfect deeds to the perfect merit of Jesus Christ.

Imagine a man whose face is covered in dirt. He walks over to a mirror. The mirror faithfully reveals the dirt, but the mirror cannot wash his face. If the man rubs his face against the mirror, he will not get clean; he will only smudge the glass. The law is the mirror—it reveals our defect. It points us to the soap and water, which is Jesus Christ. We are not washed by the mirror; we are washed by the Savior.

### Q2. What does the law do?

**Scripture:**
> "I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." (Romans 7:7)
> "...for by the law is the knowledge of sin." (Romans 3:20, last clause)

**Answer:**
The primary function of the moral law in the work of salvation is diagnostic. It acts as the standard of righteousness that reveals our deviation from God's character.

1.  **The Definition of Sin:** The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). Without the law, humanity would have no objective standard to understand what is wrong.
2.  **Conviction of Sin:** The Holy Spirit uses the law to bring conviction to the conscience. When a person reads "Thou shalt not covet," they realize that God's requirement goes deeper than outward actions—it reaches the thoughts and intents of the heart (Hebrews 4:12).
3.  **The Schoolmaster:** By revealing our hopeless condition and our inability to meet God's standard of holiness, the law acts as a "schoolmaster" to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith (Galatians 3:24). It shows us our danger so that we will flee to the Refuge.
4.  **Sanctuary Connection:** In the sanctuary, the sinner had to realize he was guilty before he brought a lamb to the altar. The knowledge of his guilt (via the law) was the prerequisite for seeking the atonement (the gospel).

A plumb line is a tool used by builders to determine if a wall is perfectly straight. If a wall is crooked, the plumb line does not fix it; it simply hangs there, silently testifying to the crookedness. The builder cannot be angry at the plumb line for revealing the fault. The law is God's plumb line (Amos 7:7–8). It hangs beside our character and shows us where we are "crooked" so we may seek the Master Builder to restore us.

### Q3. Will the law do this work for others besides the Jews?

**Scripture:**
> "Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God." (Romans 3:19)

**Answer:**
Yes. The jurisdiction of God's moral law is universal, extending to every human being, regardless of nationality or heritage.

1.  **Universal Guilt:** The text says "all the world" becomes guilty. Since all have sinned and come short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23), all are subject to the law's condemnation until they find Christ.
2.  **Stopping the Mouth:** This phrase implies a courtroom scene. When the evidence of the law is presented, the sinner has no defense, no excuse, and no argument. The law silences human pride. We cannot say, "I am a good person," because the law reveals our true condition.
3.  **The Standard of Judgment:** In the Great Controversy, God's government is based on His law. In the final judgment, represented by the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary, this law is the standard by which all lives are measured (Ecclesiastes 12:13–14; James 2:10–12).
4.  **The Need for a Universal Savior:** Because the condemnation is worldwide, the remedy must also be available to the whole world. "God so loved the world..." (John 3:16).

**[ILL]**
Gravity is a law of nature. It does not matter if you are American, European, or Asian; if you step off a cliff, gravity operates the same way. You cannot argue with it. Likewise, the Ten Commandments are the moral gravity of the universe. They apply to every soul created by God, silencing every excuse and proving that the whole world needs a Savior.

### Q4. What is the nature of God's law?

**Scripture:**
> "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." (Romans 7:12)

**Answer:**
Far from being a burden or an enemy to the believer, the law is a transcript of God's own character.

1.  **Holy, Just, and Good:**
    *   **Holy:** It sets apart right from wrong and demands purity.
    *   **Just:** It is fair and equitable in its requirements.
    *   **Good:** It is designed for the happiness and well-being of God’s creatures (Deuteronomy 10:13).
2.  **The Harmony of Law and Gospel:** Because the law is the character of God, God cannot abolish it to save man, for that would imply God's character was flawed. Instead, the Gospel brings man back into harmony with this holy law.
3.  **The Problem is Us, Not the Law:** Paul emphasizes in Romans 7:14 that "the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin." The conflict exists not because the law is severe, but because our nature is fallen.
4.  **Sanctification:**
    *   **Sanctification:** This is the work of God’s grace to make the believer holy in character and life (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
    *   True sanctification brings the believer into sympathy with the law. The "carnal mind" acts as an enemy to the law, but the "spiritual mind" (renewed by Christ) delights in it (Romans 8:7; Psalm 119:97).

Consider a perfect, intricate mold used for casting metal statutes. If you pour rocky, hard, cold metal into it, the metal will not take the shape. The problem is not the mold; the mold is perfect. The problem is the state of the metal. The law is the perfect mold of righteousness. We are the hard, cold hearts. We need the fire of the Holy Spirit to melt us so we can be poured into the mold and reflect the image of Jesus.

### Q5. How, then, can man be justified?

**Scripture:**
> "Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." (Romans 3:24)

**Answer:**
Since the law cannot justify the transgressor, justification comes only as a gift from God, received by faith.

1.  **Freely by His Grace:**
    *   **Grace:** Often defined as "unmerited favor," it is also the power of God given to the undeserving. We do not pay for justification; it is free to us because it was costly to Christ.
2.  **Redemption:** This word means "to buy back" or "to release by payment of a ransom." We were slaves to sin and condemned to death. Christ paid the ransom with His own blood (1 Peter 1:18–19).
3.  **The Exchange:** This is the heart of the Righteousness by Faith message. On the cross, Christ took our sins (which He did not commit) and died our death. In exchange, He offers us His righteousness (which we did not earn) so we can have His life (2 Corinthians 5:21).
4.  **The Sanctuary Type:** In the earthly service, when the sinner placed his hand on the head of the innocent victim and confessed his sin, the sin was symbolically transferred to the lamb. The man went away free because the lamb died in his place. This foreshadowed Christ, the Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a man standing before a judge, owing a debt of ten million dollars—a sum he could never pay in a thousand lifetimes. The judge is about to pass sentence when a wealthy benefactor steps in, pays the debt in full, and hands the receipt to the judge. The judge then declares the debtor "free." The man is not free because he had the money; he is free because another paid his price. This is justification by grace.

### Q6. But does the fact that we are subjects of God's grace, give us license to sin?

**Scripture:**
> "What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?" (Romans 6:15, 16)

**Answer:**
Absolutely not. Being "under grace" is not a license to disobey; it is the power to obey from a new heart.

1.  **Under Law vs. Under Grace:**
    *   **Under the Law:** To be under the condemnation of the law because we have violated it and are trying to be saved by it.
    *   **Under Grace:** To be under the pardon of God and the power of the Holy Spirit.
    *   Paul argues that if we are truly under grace, sin (rebellion) no longer has "dominion" over us (Romans 6:14).
2.  **Servants of Obedience:** Faith is not merely an intellectual assent; it is a yielding of the will. When we accept Christ, we change masters. We step out of the ranks of rebellion and into the service of King Jesus. To claim to be His servant while willfully sinning is a contradiction.
3.  **Imputed and Imparted Righteousness:** Justification (imputed righteousness) gives us the title to heaven. Sanctification (imparted righteousness) gives us the fitness for heaven. Grace provides both. It forgives the past *and* transforms the present.
4.  **The New Covenant:** Under the New Covenant, God does not abolish the law; He writes it in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). Thus, the believer obeys not to *be* saved, but because he *is* saved and loves the Savior (John 14:15).

**[ILL]**
If a prisoner is pardoned by the governor and released from death row, does that pardon give him the right to go out and commit murder again? No! The pardon is given with the expectation that he will now live as a law-abiding citizen. In fact, gratitude to the governor for saving his life should make him the most law-abiding citizen of all. Grace produces obedience, not rebellion.

### Q7. How must those walk who would be free from condemnation?

**Scripture:**
> "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Romans 8:1)

**Answer:**
Freedom from condemnation is experienced by those who maintain a living, vital connection with Christ, characterized by walking in the Spirit.

1.  **In Christ Jesus:** This is the condition of safety. Just as Noah was safe only while inside the Ark, we are safe from judgment only while "abiding" in Christ (John 15:4).
2.  **The Walk:** The Christian life is described as a "walk"—steady, progressive movement. It is not a one-time event but a daily experience.
    *   **Walking after the flesh:** Living to satisfy selfish desires, appetites, and worldly ambition.
    *   **Walking after the Spirit:** Living in dependence on God's Word, prayer, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, yielding the will to God moment by moment.
3.  **Victory Over Sin:** The text implies that those who are "in Christ" have a new direction of life. While they may struggle, the trend of their life is toward holiness. The "law of the Spirit of life" sets them free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:2).
4.  **Sanctuary Application:** We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement. While our High Priest (Jesus) is cleansing the sanctuary above, we are to be afflicting our souls and walking in the Spirit here below, putting away every known sin so that we may stand blameless before Him (Revelation 14:4–5).

**[ILL]**
Two travelers are on a road. One is walking toward a cliff (the flesh/death), the other toward a city of light (the Spirit/life). If the traveler toward the city stumbles, he gets back up and continues toward the city. His direction is set. But the one walking toward the cliff is in danger even if he is walking smoothly. "No condemnation" belongs to the one whose face is set toward Christ and who is moving, by the Spirit's power, away from the life of sin.
