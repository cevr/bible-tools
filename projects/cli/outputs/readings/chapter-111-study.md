### Q1. When writing to the Philippians, what desire did the apostle Paul express?

**Scripture**
> “For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.” (Philippians 1:23)

**Answer**
The apostle Paul expresses a deep, personal longing that arises from a heart fully surrendered to Jesus. He describes himself as being in a “strait,” meaning he is pressed or hemmed in by two powerful, opposing motivations. His personal desire was to “depart”—to leave the trials, persecutions, and weariness of this present life behind—and to reach the ultimate goal of the Christian existence: “to be with Christ.”

This expression reveals the intimacy of Paul’s connection with the Savior. To the believer who has experienced **Righteousness by Faith**, Christ is not merely a distant theological figure but a personal friend and the source of all life. Paul’s desire was not simply for death itself, for death is an enemy (1 Corinthians 15:26); rather, his desire was for the *outcome* that follows the Christian’s race—eternal union with his Lord.

*   **Depart:** In the original Greek, this word was often used for unmooring a ship or striking down a tent. Paul viewed his body as a temporary tabernacle (2 Corinthians 5:1) and longed for the permanent home.
*   **Far Better:** Paul understood that the trials of this life are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed (Romans 8:18).

**[ILL] The Sailor’s Longing**
Imagine a sailor who has been at sea for months, battling fierce storms, limited rations, and constant danger. When the ship nears the harbor, he sees the lights of his home on the shore. He has a duty to the ship (to stay on board and finish his work), but his heart has a desperate desire to "depart" the ship and be with his family. His desire isn't to drown in the water between the ship and the shore, but to reach the destination where his loved ones wait.

### Q2. What were the two conditions between which the apostle was thus in difficulty?

**Scripture**
> “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.” (Philippians 1:21)

**Answer**
The two conditions pressing upon the apostle were **life** (continued ministry) and **death** (rest from labor). Both held a specific value for him, creating the "difficulty" or dilemma he faced.

1.  **"To live is Christ":** This is the concise summary of **Sanctification**. It means that Paul’s life was no longer his own; he had been crucified with Christ, and now Jesus lived His life through Paul (Galatians 2:20).
    *   **Definition:** *Sanctification* is the ongoing work of God’s grace by which the Holy Spirit imparts the character of Christ to the believer, empowering them to overcome sin and obey God’s law from the heart.
    *   If Paul continued to live, it meant more fruit for the Kingdom, more souls won, and more glory to God through his suffering and service.

2.  **"To die is gain":** This does not mean death provides an immediate entry into heaven (as answered in later questions), but that death brings a cessation of burden. For a man who had been stoned, beaten, shipwrecked, and imprisoned, death meant the "gain" of absolute rest and the sealing of his life’s testimony.

**[ILL] The Worker and the Whistle**
Consider a laborer working in a scorching field under a hot sun. He is dedicated to his master and wants to finish the harvest ("to live is Christ"). However, his body is aching, his hands are blistered, and he is exhausted. When he thinks of the evening whistle blowing ("to die"), it represents "gain" to him—not because he hates the work, but because he longs for the rest and the wages that are secured at the end of the day.

### Q3. What does he mean by the words "to depart?

**Scripture**
> “For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.” (2 Timothy 4:6)

**Answer**
By "depart," Paul is referring to his physical death. In 2 Timothy, written just before his execution under Nero, he uses the same language to indicate that his life’s journey was concluding.

From a biblical perspective, death is often likened to sleep or a departure, but it is never the final end for the believer. It is a temporary cessation of consciousness until the call of the Life-giver. Just as a traveler departs from one city to travel to another, Paul viewed death as the exit from this world of sin. However, the "arrival" at the destination (heaven) depends on the timing of the resurrection, which Scripture clarifies elsewhere.

*   **The Sacrificial Context:** In 2 Timothy 4:6, Paul speaks of being "offered" (poured out as a drink offering). In the **Sanctuary** service, the drink offering was poured out around the altar, symbolizing a life fully consumed in service to God. Paul viewed his impending death not as a tragedy, but as a final act of worship.

**[ILL] The Unmooring**
The Greek word for "departure" (*analusis*) was used to describe the unmooring of a ship to set sail. When a ship leaves the dock, it disappears from the sight of those on the shore, but it has not ceased to exist; it is simply voyaging toward the next port. For the believer, death is the unmooring from the shores of this sinful earth.

### Q4. What was sure to the cause of Christ, whether Paul lived or died?

**Scripture**
> “According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.” (Philippians 1:20)

**Answer**
The certainty was that **Christ would be magnified.** Paul’s supreme objective was not his own comfort or survival, but the glory of Jesus.

*   **By Life:** If Paul lived, he would continue preaching the Gospel, defending the truth, and modeling the power of God to keep a man from sinning even in prison. This magnifies Christ’s power to sustain His saints.
*   **By Death:** If Paul was executed (martyred), his unwavering faith in the face of death would serve as a powerful testimony to the reality of the resurrection and the value of the Truth.

This reflects the core of the **Great Controversy**. Satan claims that men only serve God for selfish gain (Job 1:9–11). When a believer like Paul is willing to die rather than disobey or deny his Lord, Christ is magnified, and Satan’s accusations are refuted.

**[ILL] The Telescope**
A telescope does not generate light; it catches the light of a distant star and magnifies it so people on earth can see it clearly. Paul realized his body was like a telescope. Whether he was standing tall (life) or being broken down (death), as long as the lens was focused on Jesus, the world would see Christ more clearly through him.

### Q5. In what other words does he express the same sentiment?

**Scripture**
> “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.” (Philippians 1:21)

**Answer**
This verse reiterates the sentiment that Christ is the center of all things for Paul. As the note in the lesson suggests, the "gain" here can be understood in two ways, both consistent with Scripture:

1.  **Gain to Paul:** Relief from the "thorn in the flesh," persecution, and the struggle against the powers of darkness. It is the sleep of the weary warrior (Job 3:17).
2.  **Gain to the Cause:** The blood of the martyrs is often the seed of the church. Paul’s death would seal his testimony. When a champion of truth lays down his life, it often emboldens others to stand firm (Philippians 1:14).

The "gain" is not that Paul immediately enters heaven as a disembodied spirit, but that his course is finished, his race is won, and his crown is secured (2 Timothy 4:8), awaiting the Day of the Lord.

**[ILL] The Artist’s Masterpiece**
When an artist finishes a masterpiece, he lays down his brush. The work is done. He gains the satisfaction of completion, and the world gains the beauty of the art. Paul’s life was a canvas; death was merely laying down the brush because the picture of Christ in his character was complete.

### Q6. What, then, inclined Paul to the side of life?

**Scripture**
> “Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.” (Philippians 1:24)

**Answer**
Paul was inclined to live because of **love for the church.** Though his personal desire was for the rest of death and the ultimate reward of being with Christ, he recognized that the Philippians (and the wider church) still needed his guidance, instruction, and encouragement.

This is the practical application of **Righteousness by Faith**. True faith works by love (Galatians 5:6). A "justified" man does not live for himself. Just as Jesus left the comfort of heaven to minister to humanity, Paul was willing to postpone his own relief to minister to the flock.

*   **Self-Sacrifice:** The spirit of Christ is self-sacrificing love. Paul preferred the needs of others over his own desire for release.

**[ILL] The Mother’s Vigil**
A mother sitting by the bedside of a sick child may be desperate for sleep. Her body screams for rest. Yet, she stays awake. Why? Because her presence is "more needful" for the child. Her love outweighs her physical need. Paul chose to "stay awake" in this world of suffering for the sake of his spiritual children.

### Q7. What inclined him to prefer to depart, or lay down this life?

**Scripture**
> “For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.” (Philippians 1:23)

**Answer**
Paul was inclined toward death by the desire **to be with Christ.** He knew that as long as he was in this mortal body, he was "absent from the Lord" in the visible, literal sense (2 Corinthians 5:6).

It is important to note the phrasing. He does not say "depart and immediately be with Christ." He links the two events—departure (death) and being with Christ—because for the believer, there is no conscious interval between them. The next voice the faithful dead hear is the voice of Christ calling them to life.

*   **The Hope of Glory:** Paul longed for the day when the mortal would put on immortality (1 Corinthians 15:53). This longing for the presence of God is the mark of a converted heart.

**[ILL] The Long Journey Home**
If a man travels a long distance to see his king, the journey is exhausting. He desires to arrive. He desires the journey to end *so that* he may see the king. The end of the journey (death) is the necessary step to the meeting (resurrection).

### Q8. How long after his departure before he would be with Christ?

**Scripture**
> “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17)
> *See also 1 Corinthians 15:51-54; 2 Timothy 4:7, 8.*

**Answer**
According to Paul’s own teaching, the reunion with Christ takes place **at the Second Coming (the Resurrection).**

Paul consistently pointed to "that day" as the time of his reward. In 2 Timothy 4:8, he says, "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me **at that day**: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."

*   **The Order of Events:**
    1.  **Death (Departure):** The believer sleeps in Jesus.
    2.  **The Interim:** The state of unconscious rest (the grave).
    3.  **The Second Coming:** The Lord descends.
    4.  **The Resurrection:** The dead in Christ rise first.
    5.  **Being with Christ:** "So shall we ever be with the Lord."

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Currently, Christ is interceding in the Heavenly Sanctuary. When He finishes that work, He will put on His kingly robes and come to gather His people. We do not go to Him individually at death; He comes for us collectively at the harvest.

**[ILL] The Alarm Clock**
When you go to sleep at night, you may set an alarm for 6:00 AM. You fall asleep, and while you sleep, hours pass. The moon moves, the earth rotates, but you know nothing of it. The very next moment you are aware of is the alarm ringing. To you, the moment of falling asleep and the moment of waking up seem connected, though hours of time separates them. So it is with death and the resurrection.

### Q9. If none go to be with Christ till after the resurrection, how would it have been better for Paul, so far as he was concerned, to depart then, rather than live on?

**Scripture**
> “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing...” (Ecclesiastes 9:5)
> “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” (Psalm 146:4)

**Answer**
It would be "far better" for Paul because, in the unconscious sleep of death, there is no perception of time.

*   **Definition:** *State of the Dead* refers to the biblical teaching that death is a state of unconsciousness, often called "sleep" by Jesus (John 11:11–14). It is not a place of bliss or torment, but a resting place awaiting the resurrection.

If Paul were to die in the first century, and the resurrection happens thousands of years later, to Paul, it would feel like the **twinkling of an eye.** He closes his eyes in death, exhausted and worn from battle; the very next split-second of his consciousness, he sees Jesus coming in the clouds of heaven.

Therefore:
1.  **Subjectively:** He bypasses all the intervening centuries of sin, woe, and history.
2.  **Practically:** He rests from his labors (Revelation 14:13) and escapes the horrific persecutions that were coming upon the church.

This view upholds the beauty of the **Resurrection**. If Paul were already in heaven enjoying bliss, the resurrection of his body would be a minor event. But because he sleeps in the grave, the Resurrection is the glorious, central hope of the Christian faith—the moment victory is swallowed up in life (1 Corinthians 15:54).

**[ILL] The Surgery**
When a patient undergoes surgery, they are put under anesthesia. The surgery might take ten hours. But to the patient, they count backward "10, 9, 8..." and instantly wake up in the recovery room. They skipped the pain and the waiting. For Paul, death was the anesthesia; the Resurrection is the waking up in the recovery of eternal life.
