## Slide 1 – Q1: The Finished Earthly Work

- **Question:** At the death of Christ, what miracle signified that the priestly work of the earthly sanctuary was finished?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 27:50, 51 – “Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **A Divine Signal:**
  - The tearing of the veil was a signal from God that the earthly sacrificial system was fulfilled.
  - For centuries, this curtain barred the way to the Shekinah glory (God’s visible presence); only the High Priest could enter once a year.
- **Type Met Antitype:**
  - The earthly lamb was a shadow (Type); Christ is the substance (Antitype).
  - When the true “Lamb of God” died, the shadow was no longer needed.
- **The Way is Open:**
  - The veil tore “from top to bottom,” signifying God removed the barrier.
  - We no longer need human priests to mediate; the way to the Father is open through Jesus.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Photograph and the Person:**
  - Imagine a father keeping a photograph (the Type) of his son who is away at war.
  - When the son returns home (the Antitype), the father puts the photo down to embrace the real person.
  - It would be foolish to talk to the photo when the son is standing there.
  - The earthly sanctuary was the photo; Christ is the Son.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Location of Ministry

- **Question:** Where has the work of the sanctuary been conducted since the ascension of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 8:1 – “Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.”
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **A Literal Reality:**
  - Since the ascension, the center of the plan of salvation is in heaven.
  - The Bible speaks of a literal, physical reality where God rules.
- **Christ’s Position:**
  - He is at the “right hand” of the Father, a place of authority.
- **Christ’s Activity:**
  - He is not inactive; He is working as our High Priest.
  - He applies the benefits of His sacrifice to individual believers who come to Him by faith.

## Slide 6 – Q3: The Identity of the Priest

- **Question:** Who is this high priest?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:11 – “But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points

- **Superior to Aaron:**
  - Earthly priests were sinful men subject to death.
  - Christ is the sinless, eternal Son of God.
- **"Good Things to Come":**
  - Earthly priests dealt with shadows.
  - Christ deals with realities: actual cleansing from sin and restoration of communion with God.
- **"Not Made With Hands":**
  - The heavenly sanctuary is God’s dwelling place, not a human construction.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Perfect Advocate:**
  - If you are on trial for your life, you do not want a lawyer who is also a criminal and might die before the verdict.
  - You want an advocate who has never lost a case, is friends with the Judge, and lives forever.
  - That is Jesus, our High Priest.

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Builder of the Sanctuary

- **Question:** Who erected this heavenly tabernacle, of which Christ is the minister?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 8:2 – “A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Original Sanctuary:**
  - Moses built a copy in the wilderness; God established the original in heaven.
- **The Scale:**
  - The earthly was portable and small.
  - The heavenly accommodates millions of angels and the throne of God (Daniel 7:9–10).
- **The Minister (*Leitourgos*):**
  - Christ’s ministry is essential to salvation.
  - The Cross provided the **sacrifice**.
  - The Ministry in heaven provides the **intercession**.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Priesthood on Earth

- **Question:** Could Christ be a priest while He was on earth, and before the old priesthood ceased?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 8:4 – “For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points

- **Restricted by Law:**
  - The earthly law restricted the priesthood to the tribe of Levi.
  - Jesus was from the tribe of Judah (Hebrews 7:14 – “For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.”).
- **Separation of Duties:**
  - On earth, Jesus was the **Sacrifice** (Lamb) and **Prophet**.
  - He entered His priestly office only *after* His sacrifice and ascension.
- **A New Order:**
  - Christ is a priest “after the order of Melchizedek” (Psalm 110:4).

## Slide 13 – Q6: Significance of Earthly Service

- **Question:** What did the service of the earthly priests signify?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 8:4, 5 – “There are priests that offer gifts according to the law: Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things...”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Shadow:**
  - A shadow has no substance; it exists because of the reality casting it.
  - Earthly rituals (blood, incense) had no power to save (Hebrews 10:4).
  - They pointed faith to the coming Messiah.
- **The Lesson Plan:**
  - **Justification:** Daily sacrifices taught that sin results in death.
  - **Sanctification:** Washing and incense taught the need for cleansing and prayer.
  - **Judgment:** The Day of Atonement taught that God will eventually eradicate sin.

## Slide 15 – Q7: Design of the Earthly Sanctuary

- **Question:** What was the earthly sanctuary designed to be?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:8, 9 – “The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: Which was a figure for the time then present...”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points

- **A "Figure" (Parable):**
  - God used the earthly sanctuary to teach the ABCs of salvation to a sinful world.
  - It demonstrated that God is holy, man is sinful, and a mediator is required.
- **Limited Access:**
  - Common people could not enter; even priests were restricted from the Most Holy Place.
  - This illustrated that the way to full fellowship with God was not yet fully revealed until Christ’s work was complete.

## Slide 17 – Q8: Apartments of the Sanctuary

- **Question:** Are there different apartments of the heavenly sanctuary in which Christ ministers?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:24 – “For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Key Points

- **Structural Parallel:**
  - The text uses the plural “holy places.”
  - The earthly was a figure of the true, implying the heavenly also has phases of ministry.
- **Two Phases of Ministry:**
  - **Daily (Holy Place):** Intercession, forgiveness, and acceptance (Revelation 8:3–4).
  - **Yearly (Most Holy Place):** Judgment, cleansing, and the final removal of sin.

## Slide 19 – Q9: The Ark in Heaven

- **Question:** Does the heavenly sanctuary contain an ark of the testament (covenant)?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 11:19 – “And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.”

## Slide 20 – Q9: Key Points

- **The Contents:**
  - The earthly ark contained the Ten Commandments.
  - The heavenly ark contains the original standard of righteousness.
- **The Law Remains:**
  - God’s Law was not abolished at the cross; it is beneath the Mercy Seat in heaven.
  - Judgment is based on this Law (James 2:12).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot keep this Law in our own strength.
  - We need the blood (Justification) and the Law written in the heart by the Spirit (Sanctification).

## Slide 21 – Q10: Necessity of Cleansing

- **Question:** The earthly sanctuary was cleansed by a high priest. Is it necessary for the heavenly sanctuary also to come to a time of cleansing, or purifying?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:23 – “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.”

## Slide 22 – Q10: Key Points

- **Why Cleanse Heaven?**
  - Heaven is perfect, but the **record** of sins is preserved there.
  - Confessed sins are transferred by faith to the sanctuary books.
- **Antitypical Day of Atonement:**
  - In the type, the sanctuary was cleansed once a year (Yom Kippur).
  - Before Christ returns, there is a work of judgment to examine the books and blot out sin.
  - This separates sin from God’s people forever.

## Slide 23 – Q11: Cleansing from What?

- **Question:** From what will it be cleansed, or purified?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:26 – “For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.”

## Slide 24 – Q11: Key Points

- **Putting Away Sin:**
  - The objective of the final work is to “put away sin” from the record.
- **The Record Books:**
  - Sins are recorded (Jeremiah 2:22).
  - Forgiveness covers them, but the final cleansing “blots them out” (Acts 3:19).
- **Vindication:**
  - This judgment shows that the saved have truly entered a relationship with Christ and are “overcomers.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Merchant's Ledger:**
  - A merchant keeps a ledger of debts (record of sin).
  - When a customer pays, the merchant writes "Paid," but the record remains.
  - At the end of the year, accounts are finalized and old debts closed out completely.
  - The cleansing of the sanctuary is the final audit and closing of the books of sin.

## Slide 26 – Q12: Transferring the Sins

- **Question:** When the earthly high priest came out to the people after making the atonement, how did he transfer the sins of the people from himself?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 16:21 – “And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness.”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points

- **The Sequence:**
  - This happened *after* the High Priest finished the work in the Most Holy Place.
- **The Azazel Goat:**
  - The priest placed his hands on the scapegoat (Azazel).
  - He confessed the sins of Israel—already atoned for—onto the live goat.
- **Banishment:**
  - The goat was not killed as a sacrifice but sent into the wilderness to carry the sins away forever.

## Slide 28 – Q13: Christ Finishing the Work

- **Question:** How will it be when Christ has finished the atonement for his people?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:28 – “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Key Points

- **Probation Closes:**
  - Christ ceases intercession; the sins of the righteous are blotted out.
- **Responsibility Placed on Satan:**
  - Christ will place the responsibility for sin on Satan (the antitypical Scapegoat).
  - Satan does not save us; he bears the punishment for instigating the rebellion.
- **Coming "Without Sin":**
  - Christ returns not to deal with the sin problem again, but to rescue His people.

## Slide 30 – Q14: Blotting Out Sins

- **Question:** When will the sins of the righteous be blotted out?
- **Key Text:** Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: Key Points

- **The Event:**
  - The “blotting out” is linked to the “times of refreshing” (Latter Rain) and judgment.
- **Prerequisites:**
  - Repentance and Conversion are required.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - We cannot hide cherished sin.
  - The blotting out implies a people who have allowed Christ to give them victory over known sin.
  - The Spirit cannot fall on hearts filled with rebellion.

## Slide 32 – Q15: Following the Blotting Out

- **Question:** What immediately follows the blotting out of sins?
- **Key Text:** Acts 3:20, 21 – “And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.”

## Slide 33 – Q15: Key Points

- **The Second Coming:**
  - Once the sanctuary is cleansed, the mandate is given: “He shall send Jesus.”
- **Restitution:**
  - This is the restoration of the earth to Edenic beauty.
  - It is the restoration of humanity to God’s direct presence.

## Slide 34 – Q16: Christ receives the Kingdom

- **Question:** While Christ as high priest is still before the Father, what is given Him?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:13, 14 – “...one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days... And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him...”

## Slide 35 – Q16: Key Points

- **The Coronation:**
  - At the end of the judgment, Christ changes roles from High Priest to King of Kings.
- **The Kingdom:**
  - This is a literal, eternal dominion.
  - He receives His subjects—the people vindicated in the judgment.

## Slide 36 – Q17: Christ’s Purpose at Coming

- **Question:** And when He comes to earth; what is His purpose?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17 – “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout... and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air...”

## Slide 37 – Q17: Key Points

- **Gathering the Subjects:**
  - **Resurrection:** To wake the “dead in Christ.”
  - **Translation:** To catch up the living righteous.
  - **Reunion:** To take them to the Father’s house (John 14:1–3).

## Slide 38 – Q18: The Prior Decision

- **Question:** But before any are thus raised at Christ's coming, what decision must be rendered in their cases?
- **Key Text:** Luke 20:35 – “But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.”

## Slide 39 – Q18: Key Points

- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - Before resurrection, there must be a decision of who is “accounted worthy.”
  - Not everyone rises to life (John 5:29).
- **The Basis of Worthiness:**
  - It is not based on human merit.
  - It is based on:
    1.  Faith in Jesus’ blood (Justification).
    2.  A life of obedience through His power (Sanctification).
  - The robe of righteousness is worn by those who have surrendered their will.

## Slide 40 – Q19: The Time of Cleansing

- **Question:** Is there a specified time for the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

## Slide 41 – Q19: Key Points

- **Prophetic Time:**
  - In prophecy, a day represents a literal year (Ezekiel 4:6).
  - This indicates a period of 2,300 years.
- **The Event:**
  - At the end of this period, the antitypical Day of Atonement begins.
  - This marks the final phase of Christ’s ministry.

## Slide 42 – Q20: Identifying the Sanctuary

- **Question:** How may one know that this does not refer to the earthly sanctuary?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:17 – “So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.”

## Slide 43 – Q20: Key Points

- **Historical Context:**
  - The earthly temple was destroyed in A.D. 70.
  - The 2,300-year prophecy began in 457 B.C. and ended in **1844 A.D.**
- **Conclusion:**
  - In 1844, there was no earthly temple.
  - The prophecy must refer to the **Heavenly Sanctuary**.
  - In 1844, Christ entered the Most Holy Place to begin the investigative judgment.

## Slide 44 – Q20: Illustration

- **The Wrong Address:**
  - If a navigation app says you will arrive at 5:00 PM, and at that time you are standing in front of a new mansion rather than your old demolished house, you know the destination is the mansion.
  - The prophecy points to 1844.
  - Since the earthly temple was gone, the "destination" of the prophecy is the Temple in Heaven.
