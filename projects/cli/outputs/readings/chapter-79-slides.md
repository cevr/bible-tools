## Slide 1 – Q1: The Power of the Gospel
- **Question:** Of what did Paul say he was not ashamed?
- **Key Text:** Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **Defining the Gospel:**
  - The word "gospel" means "good news."
  - It is the glad tidings that God has provided a way for sinners to be reconciled to Himself.
- **Power, Not Just Theory:**
  - The gospel is the *power* (Greek: *dunamis*) of God, not just a philosophy or code of ethics.
  - It breaks the chains of sin (Romans 6:14 – “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”).
  - It transforms the character (2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Condition of Faith
- **The Condition:**
  - The power operates "to everyone that believeth."
  - Faith is the hand that grasps the power. Without faith, the power is external; with faith, it becomes internal.
- **Illustration: The Live Wire**
  - A wire connected to a power plant looks dead until it touches a lamp, bringing light.
  - To the skeptic, the gospel seems foolish.
  - To the believer, it connects the soul to the infinite power of Heaven, lighting the mind and driving the life in obedience.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Angel’s Message
- **Question:** What good tidings did the angels announce to the shepherds?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:10, 11 – “And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points
- **Universal Joy:**
  - The message is for "all people." Salvation is a universal offer of grace (Titus 2:11 – “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men”).
- **The Identity of the Babe:**
  - **Christ (Messiah):** The Anointed One promised in prophecy (Daniel 9:25 – “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks...”).
  - **Lord:** The Creator taking on humanity (John 1:14 – “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us...”).
- **The Necessity:**
  - The title "Saviour" implies humanity is lost and needs rescue from outside itself.

## Slide 6 – Q3: Simeon’s Prophecy
- **Question:** What did Simeon say after seeing the Saviour?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:34 – “And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary His mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points
- **The Crisis of Decision:**
  - Christ is the "Stone of Stumbling" and "Rock of Ages" (1 Peter 2:6 – “Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.”).
- **The Fall:**
  - Those who cling to pride and refuse God’s way will fall (Matthew 21:44 – “And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.”).
- **The Rising Again:**
  - Those who humble themselves are raised to new life (James 4:10 – “Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.”).

## Slide 8 – Q3: Application
- **A Revealer of Hearts:**
  - Christ’s presence compels men to show their true colors.
  - The light reveals who loves darkness and who seeks truth (John 3:19 – “And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.”).

## Slide 9 – Q4: Anna’s Witness
- **Question:** To whom did Anna the prophetess speak of the Saviour?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:38 – “And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of Him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points
- **The Remnant of Faith:**
  - Even in spiritual darkness, God preserves a people who study prophecy and long for deliverance.
  - They looked for **redemption**—deliverance from the guilt and power of sin—not just political revolution.
- **Sharing the News:**
  - Like the shepherds and Simeon, Anna could not keep silent.
  - True faith always leads to witnessing: finding the Remedy naturally leads to telling the dying patients where to find the Cure.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Saved FROM Sin
- **Question:** In his pre-announcement of Christ's birth and name, what did the angel say Christ should do?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 1:21 – “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their sins.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Not Saved *IN* Sin:**
  - Jesus saves us *from* sin—from its penalty (guilt) and its power (dominion).
  - We cannot be saved while cherishing and practicing iniquity.
- **The Nature of Sin:**
  - Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”).
- **A Miraculous Change:**
  - God implants a new nature that hates sin and loves righteousness (Ezekiel 36:26 – “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.”).

## Slide 13 – Q5: Illustration
- **Illustration: The Drowning Man**
  - If a lifeguard saves a drowning man, he pulls him *out* of the water.
  - He does not leave him in the water and merely pronounce him "dry."
  - Christ pulls us out of the ocean of sin; He does not leave us drowning in disobedience while calling us "saved."

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Condition of Salvation
- **Question:** On what condition was He to save them?
- **Key Text:** John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points
- **The Motivation:**
  - "God so loved." Salvation originates in the Father's love; He desired to save us.
- **The Cost:**
  - He "gave" His Son. The broken law demanded the life of the transgressor.
  - Christ gave His life to meet that demand so mercy could be extended (Romans 3:25 – “Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood...”).
- **Saving Faith:**
  - More than intellectual assent.
  - It is a transaction: the sinner gives his life to Christ and accepts Christ’s life (Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me...”).

## Slide 16 – Q6: Definition – Justification
- **Justification:**
  - The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is righteous.
  - Based solely on the merits of Christ.
  - Received by faith (Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ”).

## Slide 17 – Q7: Retroactive Atonement
- **Question:** Christ saves believers from their sins under the Christian dispensation; but does His blood atone for sins committed in the old dispensation?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:15 – “And for this cause He is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points
- **One Way of Salvation:**
  - There are not two ways to be saved (works in OT vs. grace in NT).
  - All are saved by the blood of Christ (Acts 4:12 – “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”).
- **The Credit of the Cross:**
  - Before the cross, believers looked *forward* in faith, offering sacrifices that pledged Christ’s future death.
- **The Reality:**
  - Now that Christ has died, the debt is paid in full.
  - Sins under the "first testament" are redeemed by the death of the Testator.

## Slide 19 – Q8: Abel’s Faith
- **Question:** How did Abel show his faith in the coming Saviour?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:4 – “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts...”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points
- **The Blood vs. The Fruit:**
  - Cain brought the fruit of the ground (human effort/works).
  - Abel brought a lamb, representing faith in the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29 – “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”).
- **Confession of Sin:**
  - Slaying the lamb was a confession: "I am a sinner worthy of death; I trust in the Substitute."
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Abel was accounted righteous because he relied on the merits of the promised Redeemer.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Ceremonial Law
- **Question:** What did the ceremonial law of the Jews contain?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:1 – “For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points
- **Shadow vs. Substance:**
  - A shadow is cast by a solid object. The ceremonial system was the shadow cast backward by the cross.
- **Educational Tool:**
  - Taught the cost of sin and holiness of God.
  - Every sacrifice cried out: “...without shedding of blood is no remission” (Hebrews 9:22).
- **Definitions:**
  - **Type:** An OT symbol or event foreshadowing spiritual reality (e.g., Passover Lamb).
  - **Antitype:** The fulfillment or reality (e.g., Christ our Passover).

## Slide 23 – Q10: Good Things to Come
- **Question:** What were these "good things to come" which this law foreshadowed?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:11 – “But Christ being come a High Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (Sanctuary)
- **The True Tabernacle:**
  - The earthly sanctuary was a model of the heavenly sanctuary, which the Lord pitched (Hebrews 8:2).
- **The True Priest:**
  - Earthly priests were shadows.
  - Christ is our High Priest who lives forever to make intercession (Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”).
- **The Better Sacrifice:**
  - Animal blood could not take away sin (Hebrews 10:4).
  - Christ’s blood cleanses the conscience (Hebrews 9:14).

## Slide 25 – Q11: Knowledge of Sin Before Sinai
- **Question:** Did those of the patriarchal age have a knowledge of sin?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 20:9 – “Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? ...thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points
- **Sin in Genesis:**
  - Abimelech knew adultery was a "great sin."
  - Cain knew murder was wrong (Genesis 4:7).
  - Sodom was "wicked and sinners before the Lord" (Genesis 13:13).
- **The Implication:**
  - Since "sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4), the moral law must have existed from the beginning.
  - It was written in conscience and handed down from Adam before being codified at Sinai.

## Slide 27 – Q12: Detecting Sin
- **Question:** By what means must they have gained that knowledge?
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 3:20 – “...for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”
  - Romans 7:7 – “...I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points & Illustration
- **The Detector:**
  - Just as a straight ruler reveals a crooked line, the law reveals moral crookedness.
- **Conviction:**
  - The law goes deep, exposing motives (like coveting) not just actions.
- **Illustration: The Mirror:**
  - The law is a mirror; it reveals the dirt on our face (sin).
  - The mirror cannot wash the face.
  - The gospel is the water and soap that cleanses.
  - We do not break the mirror for showing the dirt; we thank it and seek the Cleanser.

## Slide 29 – Q13: Ancient Priesthood
- **Question:** Was there a priesthood in the days of Abraham, to minister for the sins of the people?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 7:1 – “For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points
- **Mediators:**
  - God has always provided mediation, teaching that sinful man cannot approach a holy God on his own merit.
- **Melchizedek and Christ:**
  - Melchizedek is a type of Christ.
  - He was both King and Priest, just as Jesus is King of Kings and High Priest (Zechariah 6:13 – “...and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.”).

## Slide 31 – Q14: The Gospel to Abraham
- **Question:** And was the gospel preached to Abraham?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:8 – “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.”

## Slide 32 – Q14: Key Points
- **Abraham's Gospel:**
  - Abraham understood the promise to refer to the coming Messiah (Galatians 3:16).
- **Justification by Faith:**
  - Abraham believed God, and it was counted for righteousness (Genesis 15:6 – “And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.”).
  - This is the same gospel Paul preached: righteousness by faith, not works.
- **One Covenant of Grace:**
  - The method of salvation is eternal: grace accepted by faith, leading to obedience.

## Slide 33 – Q15: Christ and the Law
- **Question:** But when Christ came, did He expect to put away the law of God in order to save men?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:17 – “Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Key Points
- **Fulfill means "Fill Full":**
  - To "fulfill" is to perfectly exemplify, not abolish.
  - Christ "magnified the law and made it honorable" (Isaiah 42:21).
- **Why It Cannot Be Destroyed:**
  - If the law could be changed, Christ need not have died.
  - Because the law is immutable, the penalty had to be paid by the Son of God.
  - He died to pay the debt, not to remove the standard.

## Slide 35 – Q15: Illustration
- **Illustration: The Lifeboat**
  - A man falls off a ship because he ignored the railing (the law).
  - The captain throws a life preserver (the gospel).
  - Once saved and back on deck, the captain does not tear down the railing.
  - The saved man appreciates the railing (the law) more than ever.

## Slide 36 – Q16: The Law’s Permanence
- **Question:** How much of the law did Christ say should remain in force?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:18 – “For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points
- **Perpetuity:**
  - Since heaven and earth are still here, the law is still here.
- **Complete Authority:**
  - Men cannot edit God's law (e.g., removing the commandment against idols or changing the Sabbath).
  - Jesus affirms the entire code; to break one point is to be guilty of all (James 2:10 – “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.”).

## Slide 38 – Q17: Faith Establishes the Law
- **Question:** Then if we have faith in Christ and the gospel, how does that affect the law?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:31 – “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points
- **Making Void vs. Establishing:**
  - If faith led to disobedience, it would make the law void.
  - True faith works by love (Galatians 5:6) and establishes the law in the life.
- **The New Covenant Promise:**
  - The Holy Spirit writes the law upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”).
  - The believer obeys not *to be* saved, but because he *is* saved.

## Slide 40 – Q17: Sanctification
- **Sanctification Defined:**
  - The ongoing work of grace by which the believer is made holy (1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”).
- **Fulfilling Righteousness:**
  - The righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us who walk after the Spirit (Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”).

## Slide 41 – Q18: One Lawgiver
- **Question:** How many lawgivers are there?
- **Key Text:** James 4:12 – “There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?”

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points
- **Sovereignty:**
  - No human or church authority can alter God's moral law.
  - Tampering with the law is usurping God's throne (Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the most High... and think to change times and laws...”).
- **Authority:**
  - Only the Creator has the authority to judge, save, or destroy.

## Slide 43 – Q19: Christ Our Advocate
- **Question:** What part does Christ act in behalf of the sinner?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 2:1 – “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.”

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points
- **The Problem:**
  - Even believers may stumble. We have an Accuser (Satan).
- **The Solution:**
  - We have an Advocate (Intercessor) in the heavenly court.
  - He pleads His own righteousness and His wounded hands.
- **Imputed Righteousness:**
  - He credits His perfect life to our account so we stand accepted.

## Slide 45 – Q19: Illustration
- **Illustration: The Defense Attorney**
  - Imagine standing in court, guilty of a capital crime, with no defense.
  - The Judge's Son steps down: "I have paid the fine. I served the time. Let him go free."
  - This is what Jesus does for us in the heavenly sanctuary.

## Slide 46 – Q20: The Final Harmony
- **Question:** In the closing message to the world, how are the law and the gospel associated?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 47 – Q20: Key Points (The Remnant)
- **Commandments of God:**
  - God’s final people uphold His moral standard, including the Sabbath, as a sign of loyalty.
- **The Faith of Jesus:**
  - Not just faith *in* Jesus, but the *faith of* Jesus—the same trust and victory He possessed.
- **The Harmony:**
  - The Law reveals the standard; the Faith of Jesus provides the power.
  - They are partners in restoring the image of God in man.
