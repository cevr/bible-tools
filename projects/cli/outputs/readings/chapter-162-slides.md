## Slide 1 – Q1: The Strength of Envy
- **Question:** Give Solomon's words concerning the over powering strength of envy.
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 27:4 – “Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Nature of Envy)
- **A Deep-Seated Condition:**
  - Wrath is like a passing storm; envy is a persistent state of the heart.
  - It mirrors the spirit of Lucifer, who envied the position of the Son of God (Isaiah 14:12–14 – “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! ... For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God...”).
- **A Secret Destroyer:**
  - Wrath is loud and visible; envy works in the shadows.
  - It masquerades as concern or justice while spreading poison.
- **The Need for Divine Aid:**
  - Human willpower cannot withstand envy ("Who is able to stand?").
  - We need the indwelling Spirit of Christ to replace selfishness with His love.
- **Sanctification:**
  - The Holy Spirit must cleanse the "thoughts and intents of the heart" (Hebrews 4:12 – “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword... and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The House Fire vs. Termites:**
  - **Wrath** is like a sudden explosion in the kitchen: terrifying and damaging, but visible and extinguishable.
  - **Envy** is like termites in the foundation:
    - They work silently, day and night.
    - They remain unseen until the structural integrity is gone.
    - The building eventually collapses.
- **Lesson:** One requires a fire hose; the other requires a complete renewal of the structure.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Cruelty of Jealousy
- **Question:** What Scripture shows the exceeding cruelty of jealousy?
- **Key Text:** Song of Solomon 8:6 – “Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (A Consuming Fire)
- **Inexorable as Death:**
  - The grave (*Sheol*) never says "It is enough" (Proverbs 30:16 – “The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.”).
  - A jealous spirit is never satisfied; it demands total control.
- **Vehement Flame:**
  - Jealousy burns up reason, kindness, and sympathy.
  - It sears the conscience.
- **The Contrast:**
  - The text contrasts **Love** (strong as death) with **Jealousy** (cruel as the grave).
  - Love seeks the good of others; jealousy seeks the satisfaction of self.
- **The Heart's Fruit:**
  - If fueled by the Holy Spirit, the heart produces righteousness (Galatians 5:22–23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Burning Coal:**
  - Imagine a man holding a burning coal, waiting for a chance to throw it at someone else.
  - While he waits, his own hand is being burned and scarred.
- **Lesson:** Jealousy injures the one who holds it far more than the one against whom it is directed.

## Slide 7 – Q3: A Striking Biblical Illustration
- **Question:** What striking illustration do we find of this?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:12 – “Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Cain and Abel)
- **Religious Envy:**
  - Cain was a worshiper, not an atheist.
  - He tried to approach God with human works (fruit) rather than the blood sacrifice (faith).
- **The Root of Murder:**
  - Cain killed Abel because Abel’s obedience exposed Cain’s disobedience.
  - "Men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil" (John 3:19).
- **Justification by Faith:**
  - **Abel:** Represents those justified by faith in the Lamb of God.
  - **Cain:** Represents those relying on their own merits (legalism).
  - When legalism confronts righteousness by faith, persecution follows (Galatians 4:29 – “But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.”).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Classroom Test:**
  - Two students take a test.
  - Student A studies hard and gets an 'A' (representing a righteous life).
  - Student B refuses to study and fails.
  - Student B becomes angry—not at his own laziness, but at Student A.
  - Why? The 'A' proves that success was possible.
  - Tearing up the other student’s paper is the spirit of Cain.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Murder in the Spirit
- **Question:** Can a man be a murderer in spirit?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:15 – “Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (The Seed and the Fruit)
- **God Looks at the Heart:**
  - Murder is the fruit; hatred is the seed.
  - God judges by the heart (1 Samuel 16:7 – “...for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.”).
- **Destruction of Self-Righteousness:**
  - We may not use weapons, but if we hold grudges, we are guilty of the spirit of murder (Matthew 5:21–22).
- **Need for Imparted Righteousness:**
  - Forgiveness covers the past; **imparted righteousness** changes the nature.
  - We need Jesus to live out His life of love *in* us (Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”).

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Acorn and the Oak:**
  - An acorn is not an oak tree in size, but it is an oak tree in nature.
  - If planted and watered, it produces nothing but an oak.
  - **Hatred is the acorn; murder is the tree.**
  - To God, the nature of the seed is what matters.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Examples of Envy
- **Question:** Give other circumstances where men have been controlled by an envious spirit, and state the result.
- **Key Text 1:** Acts 7:9 – “And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him.”
- **Key Text 2:** Acts 13:45 – “But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Disrupting God's Work)
- **Joseph and His Brothers:**
  - *Cause:* Jacob’s favor and Joseph’s dreams.
  - *Result:* Betrayal of their own brother; yet God overruled it for salvation (Genesis 50:20).
- **The Jews and Paul:**
  - *Cause:* Loss of influence as crowds flocked to the Gospel of grace.
  - *Result:* Rejection of saving truth to protect their pride.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Just as the brothers expelled Joseph (a type of Christ), envy leads us to expel the Holy Spirit from the soul temple.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Ship Captain:**
  - A captain sees a younger sailor navigating with great skill, receiving praise.
  - Instead of rejoicing that the ship is safe, the captain sabotages the compass.
  - He risks the lives of everyone on board just to protect his reputation.
  - **Lesson:** Envy risks the wreck of the church to protect individual pride.

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Reign of Envy
- **Question:** What is the condition of things where envy reigns?
- **Key Text:** James 3:16 – “For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points (Moral Chaos)
- **Confusion (Babel):**
  - God is the author of peace, not confusion (1 Corinthians 14:33).
  - Envy introduces a "Babylonian" element into the heart, twisting motives and breaking unity.
- **Every Evil Work:**
  - Envy is a "gateway sin."
  - It opens the door to lying, theft, malice, and hatred.
- **The Contrast:**
  - Wisdom from above is pure, peaceable, and gentle (James 3:17).
  - Envy is the fruit of the flesh; peace is the fruit of the Spirit.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Drop of Poison:**
  - If you put a single drop of poison into a glass of clear water, the whole glass is undrinkable.
  - You cannot say, "The poison is only in the corner."
  - Envy permeates "every work"—tainting prayers, service, and relationships.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Effect on the Possessor
- **Question:** What effect does envy have upon its possessor?
- **Key Text 1:** Job 5:2 – “For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.”
- **Key Text 2:** Proverbs 14:30 – “A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Health Reform Connection)
- **Rottenness of the Bones:**
  - Negative emotions like envy release harmful chemicals, depressing the immune system.
  - Solomon’s wisdom anticipates modern medical science.
- **Self-Destruction:**
  - Envy is a self-inflicted wound.
  - It destroys the peace and health of the envier, regardless of what happens to the one envied.
- **A Sound Heart:**
  - A heart resting in the finished work of Christ brings life to the body.
  - "A merry heart doeth good like a medicine" (Proverbs 17:22).

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Acid:**
  - Acid creates a chemical reaction that eats through the container holding it.
  - Envy is an acid that destroys the vessel (the human body and mind) in which it is stored.

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Persistency of Envy
- **Question:** Show the persistency of those who are actuated by envy.
- **Key Text:** Romans 1:29, 32 – “Being filled with all unrighteousness... full of envy, murder, debate, deceit... Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (The Reprobate Mind)
- **Full of Envy:**
  - Envy becomes the defining characteristic of the life.
- **Knowing the Judgment:**
  - The sinner knows the law and the penalty (Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death...”).
  - Yet, the momentum of sin drives them forward.
- **Ultimate Rebellion:**
  - Taking pleasure in the sins of others is a total rejection of God's government.
- **The Remedy:**
  - The Gospel is the "power of God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16) to break this chain, if the sinner will turn.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Icy Mountain:**
  - A man sliding down a steep, icy mountain may know there is a cliff at the bottom.
  - He may fear the fall, but momentum prevents him from stopping.
  - **Sin is that momentum.**
  - Only the hand of Christ can arrest the slide.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Freedom from Malice
- **Question:** How free from malice should the child of God be, even toward an enemy?
- **Key Text 1:** Proverbs 24:17 – “Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth.”
- **Key Text 2:** Matthew 5:44 – “But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points (Christian Perfection)
- **The Negative Command:**
  - Do not rejoice in an enemy's failure.
  - We must share the sorrow of Christ, who weeps over the lost.
- **The Positive Command:**
  - Active love: Bless, do good, pray.
  - This love is evidence that we have passed from death unto life (1 John 3:14).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot manufacture this love.
  - We consent to let Christ love them *through* us.
  - "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost" (Romans 5:5).

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Sandalwood Tree:**
  - The sandalwood tree perfumes the very axe that cuts it.
  - Even while being destroyed, it gives off fragrance, not poison.
  - This illustrates the nature of Christ in the believer toward their enemies.

## Slide 28 – Q10: Envy and Salvation
- **Question:** Will any be saved who retain the spirit of envy in the heart?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:21 – “Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”

## Slide 29 – Q10: Key Points (Fitness for Heaven)
- **A Solemn Warning:**
  - Those who retain envy "shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
- **The Atmosphere of Heaven:**
  - Heaven is a place of self-sacrificing love.
  - An envious person would be miserable there; they are unfit for the environment.
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - Before Christ returns, the character must be cleansed.
  - We must exchange the "filthy rags" of self for the white raiment of Christ’s character (Zechariah 3:3–5; Revelation 3:5).
  - Sins must be blotted out now.

## Slide 30 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Fish on Dry Land:**
  - A fish cannot live on dry land; its nature is suited only for water.
  - An envious man cannot live in heaven; his nature is suited only for the kingdom of self.
  - God does not arbitrarily lock him out; the man has rendered himself unfit for the place.

## Slide 31 – Q11: The Justice of God
- **Question:** Is this sentence just?
- **Key Text:** Romans 2:2 – “But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.”

## Slide 32 – Q11: Key Points (According to Truth)
- **Judgment by Reality:**
  - God judges based on what is truly in the heart, not outward appearance.
  - He sees that envy is the seed of murder and rebellion.
- **Protecting the Universe:**
  - To secure eternal peace, the root of sin must be eradicated.
  - Affliction shall not rise up the second time (Nahum 1:9).
- **The Merciful Judge:**
  - He acts as a Surgeon, removing the disease to save the universe.
  - He offers to give us His own heart *now* if we will accept the cure.

## Slide 33 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Surgeon:**
  - If a surgeon removes a gangrenous limb to save a patient's life, is he cruel?
  - No, he acts according to the truth of the medical condition.
  - God's judgment against sin is a necessary act to preserve life.

## Slide 34 – Q12: The Fountain of Conduct
- **Question:** What is the fountain from which both good and evil spring?
- **Key Text:** Luke 6:45 – “A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.”

## Slide 35 – Q12: Key Points (The Heart Treasure)
- **The Storehouse:**
  - The heart stores our thoughts and desires.
  - What is stored within inevitably comes out in words and actions.
- **Transformation:**
  - We cannot change the fruit without changing the root.
  - We need the "evil treasure" replaced with the "good treasure"—Jesus Christ.
- **The New Covenant Promise:**
  - "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).
  - **Sanctification:** The daily work of emptying the heart of self and filling it with the Word.

## Slide 36 – Q12: Illustration
- **The Poisoned Well:**
  - If a well is poisoned, painting the pump handle will not make the water safe.
  - You must clean out the source.
  - Religious forms are like painting the handle; the Gospel cleans the well.

## Slide 37 – Q13: Guarding the Heart
- **Question:** Then why should the heart be watched closely?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 4:23 – “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.”

## Slide 38 – Q13: Key Points (Diligence and Surrender)
- **Constant Watchfulness:**
  - We must guard the "avenues of the soul" (reading, watching, listening).
  - Every action flows from the heart.
- **How to Keep the Heart:**
  - The heart is "deceitful above all things" (Jeremiah 17:9); we cannot keep it ourselves.
  - We must give it to Christ every morning.
- **The Prayer of Surrender:**
  - "Take my heart; for I cannot give it. It is Thy property. Keep it pure, for I cannot keep it for Thee." (*Christ's Object Lessons*, p. 159).

## Slide 39 – Q13: Illustration
- **The City Water Supply:**
  - An ancient city was only as safe as its water supply.
  - If the enemy poisoned the spring, the city fell without a battle.
  - Satan seeks to drop the poison of envy into our hearts.
  - We must let the Angel of the Lord stand guard at the spring.
