## Slide 1 – Q1: Assurance in Christ
- **Question:** What promise is made to those who look for the appearing of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:28 – “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Salvation and the Sanctuary
- **Complete Salvation:** The promise is a final deliverance from the very presence of sin and this dying world.
- **The First Advent (Justification):** 
  - Christ appeared as the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29 – “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”) to offer Himself as a sacrifice.
  - He bore our sins on the cross (1 Peter 2:24 – “Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree...”).
- **The Second Advent (Glorification):** 
  - He appears “without sin”—not to make another atonement, but as a conquering King.
  - This indicates His work as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary is finished.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** 
  - As Israel waited for the High Priest to exit the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement, we wait for Jesus to finish His work of judgment and step out to bless His people.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Active Preparation
- **“Them that look for Him”:** This implies active preparation, not passive waiting.
- **Sanctification:** To look for Him means living with the eye of faith fixed on Jesus, allowing Him to do His work of sanctification in our hearts today.
- **Illustration:** 
  - Imagine a family waiting for a father to return from war. 
  - They keep his picture visible, talk of him daily, and keep the house ready.
  - Believers "look" for Jesus by keeping the heart swept and garnished by grace, ready to welcome the King.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Basis of Reward
- **Question:** How many will receive a reward when He comes?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 16:27 – “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every man according to his works.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Judged by Works
- **Universal Reward:** Every person will receive a reward: either eternal life or the wages of sin.
- **Works as Evidence:** 
  - We are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8 – “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God”).
  - However, we are judged *by* our works because works are the infallible evidence of faith.
  - Faith without obedience is dead (James 2:26 – “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”).
- **Investigative Judgment:** Before the reward is given at the Second Coming, heaven examines the records to see who has retained the “robe of righteousness.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Illustration:** 
  - A fruit tree is not an apple tree *because* it bears apples; it bears apples because it *is* an apple tree.
  - The fruit is the proof of the tree’s nature.
- **Application:** 
  - At the harvest, God rewards the tree based on the fruit.
  - God looks at our works as evidence that we are truly grafted into the Vine, Christ Jesus.
  - True righteousness is the life of Christ implanted in the believer, naturally producing good works.

***

## Slide 7 – Q3: Death vs. The Coming
- **Question:** Did the disciples think that death would be the second coming of Christ?
- **Key Text:** John 21:21-23 – “...Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?... yet Jesus said not unto him, he shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Distinctions
- **The Misunderstanding:** The disciples mistakenly thought John would live until the Second Advent.
- **Jesus’ Clarification:** Jesus contrasted “dying” with “tarrying till I come.” If death were the Second Coming, His statement would make no sense.
- **Biblical View of Death:** 
  - The Bible consistently teaches that death is a sleep (John 11:11 – “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.”).
  - The dead wait in the grave for the resurrection (John 6:40 – “...and I will raise him up at the last day.”).
- **Conclusion:** If believers went straight to heaven at death, there would be no need for a Second Coming to “receive” them.

***

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Manner of His Coming
- **Question:** If death is not the coming of Christ, how will He come?
- **Key Text:** Acts 1:11 – “...Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: In Like Manner
- **The Pattern:** The ascension sets the pattern for the return.
- **Characteristics:**
  1. **Personal:** “This same Jesus”—the Savior with nail prints, not a spirit or force (Zechariah 13:6 – “And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands?...”).
  2. **Visible:** They “beheld” Him; it was not secret.
  3. **Physical:** He was taken up bodily.
  4. **With Clouds:** A cloud received Him; He returns with clouds (Revelation 1:7).

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration & Application
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - Because it is “this same Jesus” returning—the One who loved us and gave Himself for us—we need not fear the judgment if we abide in Him.
  - The Judge is our Friend and Savior.
- **Illustration:**
  - If a friend leaves your house walking down the driveway and promises to return “in like manner,” you do not expect a ghost or a text message.
  - You expect to see him physically walk back up the driveway. Jesus returns physically and visibly.

***

## Slide 12 – Q5: Universal Visibility
- **Question:** How many will behold Him when He comes?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 1:7 – “Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points
- **Public Event:** The Second Coming is not secret. It is the most public event in history.
- **The Wicked and Righteous:** All classes of people will witness it (Matthew 24:30 – “...and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.”).
- **Special Resurrection:** 
  - “They also which pierced Him” refers to a special resurrection of those instrumental in Christ’s suffering.
  - They are raised to witness His glorification (Daniel 12:2 – “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake... some to shame and everlasting contempt.”).

***

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Sounds of the Advent
- **Question:** What wonderful demonstration will accompany the Lord's coming?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: A Wake-Up Call
- **Overwhelming Sound:** 
  - **A Shout:** The command of the King.
  - **Voice of the Archangel:** Michael (Christ) asserting dominion over death (Jude 9).
  - **Trump of God:** The sound that wakes the dead.
- **No Secret Rapture:** A shout, a voice, and a trumpet describe a noisy, visible event, not a silent disappearance.
- **The Archangel:** In Scripture, this title is associated with Michael, the pre-incarnate Christ, the protector of His people (Daniel 12:1).

***

## Slide 16 – Q7: The Great Change
- **Question:** What will then take place?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 – “We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Resurrection and Translation
- **Two Miracles:**
  1. **Resurrection:** The righteous dead are raised with "incorruptible" bodies.
  2. **Translation:** The righteous living are instantly transformed from mortal to immortal without dying.
- **Nature of Immortality:**
  - Humans do not possess natural immortality.
  - Immortality is a gift brought by Christ at His appearing (2 Timothy 1:10 – “...who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel”).
- **Sanctification:** Our characters are purified *before* He comes; our bodies are glorified *when* He comes (Philippians 3:21).

***

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Waiting Martyrs
- **Question:** Have not the martyrs of old gone to their reward?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:39-40 – “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise, God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Together in Glory
- **Not Yet Rewarded:** Though saved by faith, the heroes of old are sleeping in the grave.
- **Communal Salvation:** 
  - God’s plan is for the entire family of the redeemed to be gathered home *together*.
  - Paul, David, and the martyrs are waiting for *us*.
- **Illustration:** 
  - Like a graduation ceremony: Students finish exams at different times, but they receive their diplomas together at the ceremony.
  - The saints sleep in peace until the Grand Graduation Day at the resurrection.

***

## Slide 20 – Q9: Timing of the Recompense
- **Question:** When were the disciples to be recompensed?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:14 – “For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Point
- **Resurrection, Not Death:** 
  - Jesus explicitly places the timing of the reward at the resurrection.
  - This confirms that between death and the resurrection, the dead are asleep, awaiting the call of the Life-giver.

***

## Slide 22 – Q10: The Preparation
- **Question:** How is this to be brought about?
- **Key Text:** John 14:3 – “If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points
- **Personal Return:** Jesus returns to “receive” His people, like a Bridegroom claiming His bride.
- **Preparation:** 
  - He is preparing a place (New Jerusalem) for us.
  - We must allow Him to prepare *us* for that place.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Heaven is a place of perfect holiness.
  - Unless we have the character of Christ (the law written on the heart), we would not be happy there.
  - We are fitted for heaven by His imparted righteousness now.

***

## Slide 24 – Q11: Enoch’s Prophecy
- **Question:** What was Enoch's belief about this event?
- **Key Text:** Jude 14-15 – “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment upon all.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Executive Judgment
- **Myriads of Angels:** The "saints" here refer to the holy angels (Matthew 25:31 – “...and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory”).
- **Purpose:** To "execute judgment."
- **Two Phases of Judgment:**
  - The *Investigative Judgment* happens in heaven before He comes (Daniel 7:9-10).
  - The *Executive Judgment* happens when He returns—saving the righteous and separating the ungodly.

***

## Slide 26 – Q12: Job’s Confession
- **Question:** What was Job's hope when in the depths of affliction?
- **Key Text:** Job 19:25-26 – “For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Bodily Resurrection
- **“In My Flesh”:** 
  - Job understood that even though his body would decompose, God would recreate him.
  - He did not expect to be a disembodied spirit, but to see God in a restored body.
- **The Guarantee:** 
  - The resurrection is certain because our Redeemer lives.
  - John 14:19 – “...because I live, ye shall live also.”

***

## Slide 28 – Q13: David’s Joy
- **Question:** How did David express himself on this point?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 96:13 – “For He cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth; He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with His truth.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Judgment as Good News
- **Vindication:** For the believer covered in Christ’s righteousness, judgment means deliverance from oppression and the setting right of all wrongs.
- **The Standard:** 
  - He judges with “His truth.”
  - This reveals that God’s law is holy, just, and good, and His government is based on love.

***

## Slide 30 – Q14: Daniel and Deliverance
- **Question:** Did Daniel teach this same sentiment?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 12:1 – “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people;... and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: Close of Probation
- **“Michael Stand Up”:** 
  - In a court, the judge stands to render the verdict.
  - This signifies the close of human probation and the end of intercessory work in the sanctuary.
- **The Book of Life:** 
  - Deliverance is for those found “written in the book.”
  - These are the overcomers who wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 3:5 – “He that overcometh... I will not blot out his name out of the book of life”).
- **Application:** Now is the time to ensure our names are in that book through repentance and surrender.

***

## Slide 32 – Q15: The Glory of the Coming
- **Question:** In what splendor will the Saviour come?
- **Key Text:** Luke 9:26 – “For whosoever shall be ashamed of Me... of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when He shall come in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels.”

## Slide 33 – Q15: Threefold Glory
- **The Splendor:**
  1. **His Own Glory:** As Conqueror of sin and death.
  2. **The Father’s Glory:** Infinite majesty.
  3. **The Angels’ Glory:** Countless millions of shining beings.
- **Consuming Fire:**
  - To sin, this glory is a “consuming fire” (Hebrews 12:29).
  - Only those purified by grace and clothed in Christ's righteousness can endure the brightness.
  - To the righteous, this light is the welcome of home.

***

## Slide 34 – Q16: The Transfiguration
- **Question:** When Christ, at the transfiguration, represented His future glory, how did He appear?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 17:2 – “And was transfigured before them; and His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was white as the light.”

## Slide 35 – Q16: A Miniature Kingdom

  - **Raiment white as light:** Symbolizing the perfect righteousness that clothes Him and His people.
- **Significance:** The Transfiguration was a glimpse of the Kingdom of Glory in miniature.

***

## Slide 36 – Q17: Angelic Majesty
- **Question:** What is the appearance of an angel?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 10:6 – “His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire... and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.”

## Slide 37 – Q17: Power of the Hosts
- **Overwhelming Power:** 
  - A single angel has the appearance of lightning and fire.
  - One angel caused the Roman guards at the tomb to fall as dead men (Matthew 28:4 – “And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.”).
- **The Scene:** Imagine the majesty when *all* the holy angels accompany Christ! We need a Savior to stand before such power.

***

## Slide 38 – Q18: God’s Glory
- **Question:** What is the appearance of the glory of God Himself?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 1:27-28 – “...I saw as it were the appearance of fire... As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.”

## Slide 39 – Q18: Justice and Mercy
- **The Fire:** Represents God’s holiness and His justice against sin (Deuteronomy 4:24 – “For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire...”).
- **The Rainbow:** Represents God’s covenant of mercy and grace (Genesis 9:13 – “I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant...”).
- **The Gospel in the Glory:** 
  - Even in the brightness of justice, the rainbow of promise encircles the throne.
  - God is both Just and the Justifier of those who believe in Jesus.

- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 4:8 – “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.”

## Slide 41 – Q19: The Crown of Righteousness
- **Timing:** Paul expected the crown “at that day” (the Second Coming), not at his death.
- **Loving His Appearing:** Those who love sin fear His return; those who love righteousness long for it.
- **Meaning of the Crown:** 
  - It is a “crown of righteousness” because it is given to those who allowed Christ to work His righteousness in them.
  - It is for the victor who overcomes the world by faith (1 John 5:4 – “...this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”).

  - Matthew 5:8 – “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”
- **Physical Likeness:** When He comes, our bodies are changed to be like His glorious body.
- **The Principle:** By beholding, we become changed (2 Corinthians 3:18).

***

## Slide 44 – Q21: The King of Kings
- **Question:** What description does the beloved John give of His appearance?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 1:14-16 – “His eyes were as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass... and His voice as the sound of many waters... And His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.”

## Slide 47 – Q22: Inheritance and Restoration
- **“Come, Ye Blessed”:** The sweetest words ever spoken. We are accepted in the Beloved.
- **“Inherit the Kingdom”:** 
  - We are children of the King and joint-heirs with Christ.
  - The plan of salvation restores what Adam lost—eternal life and face-to-face communion with God.
- **Appeal:** 
  - To hear "Come" then, we must hear His voice now: Matthew 11:28 – “Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”

## Slide 48 – Q22: Illustration
- **Illustration:**
  - When a ship has been tossed by storms in the dark, nothing is sweeter to the crew than the harbor lights and the pilot's call.
  - This world is the storm-tossed sea. Christ is the Pilot.
  - The Second Coming is the entrance to the harbor of eternal peace. Let us be ready for that day.
