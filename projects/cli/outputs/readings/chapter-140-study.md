### Q1. With what adversary does man have to contend?

**"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." 1 Peter 5:8.**

**Answer:**
The Christian life is not a playground; it is a battleground. The Scriptures reveal that we are engaged in a high-stakes conflict within the **Great Controversy** between Christ and Satan. Our adversary is not merely an abstract concept of evil, but a personal, powerful, and malicious foe—the Devil.

*   **The Nature of the Enemy:** He is described as a "roaring lion," symbolizing his great power and ravenous desire to destroy souls. He is the accuser of the brethren (Revelation 12:10) and the father of lies (John 8:44).
*   **The Call to Sobriety:** To be "sober" means to be serious-minded and spiritually awake. We cannot afford to be intoxicated with the cares or pleasures of this life (Luke 21:34).
*   **The Call to Vigilance:** Because the enemy is invisible to human eyes, we must be constantly alert. This vigilance is not paranoia, but a reliance on the Captain of our Salvation, Jesus Christ.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
We cannot defeat a supernatural enemy with natural strength. To fight the devil with human willpower is to invite defeat. **Justification** (being declared righteous) places us under Christ's protection, and **Sanctification** (being made righteous) provides the spiritual armor to withstand the enemy's assaults (Ephesians 6:11–13).

> **[ILL]** Imagine a small sheep grazing in a field where a lion prowls. If the sheep tries to fight the lion, it will surely perish. The sheep’s safety lies not in its own teeth or claws, but in staying close to the Shepherd. The moment the sheep wanders away from the Shepherd, it becomes prey. So it is with us; our victory is found only in abiding in Christ.

### Q2. When is a man tempted?

**"But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed." James 1:14.**

**Answer:**
While Satan is the external instigator, he often finds an ally within the human heart. This text highlights that temptation often leverages our own fallen nature.

*   **The Process of Temptation:**
    1.  **Drawn Away:** We lose our focus on Christ.
    2.  **Lust:** This refers to strong, disordered desires (whether for power, appetite, or pride) inherent in our fallen nature.
    3.  **Enticed:** The sin is presented as attractive or necessary.
*   **Temptation vs. Sin:** It is crucial to understand that *being tempted* is not the same as *sinning*. Jesus was tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15). Sin occurs when the will consents to the temptation.
*   **The Role of the Heart:** The problem lies deep within. As Jeremiah says, "The heart is deceitful above all things" (Jeremiah 17:9). Therefore, outward reformation is not enough; we need a new heart.

**Key Term:**
*   **Lust:** In Scripture, this is not limited to sexual desire; it is any intense craving or desire that is contrary to the will of God (1 John 2:16).

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
Since the pull of sin comes from within our own nature ("the flesh"), we cannot "fix" ourselves. We need the **imparted righteousness** of Christ. God promises not just to forgive past sins, but to write His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10), giving us new desires that align with His will.

***

### Q3. Is there still another obstacle to man's spiritual advancement?

**"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." 1 John 2:15.**

**Answer:**
The believer faces a three-fold enemy alliance: the Devil (Q1), the Flesh (Q2), and now, the World.

*   **What is "The World"?** It is not the physical earth, but the organized system of human society that functions without God—its maxims, fashions, politics, and pursuit of pleasure/power.
*   **The Exclusivity of Love:** We cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24). To love the world's methods and spirit is to be at enmity with God (James 4:4).
*   **Spiritual Advancement:** Just as a balloon cannot rise if it is tethered to the ground, a Christian cannot ascend in spiritual experience while tied to the vanities of the world.

**Sanctuary Connection:**
In the earthly sanctuary, the priest had to wash at the laver before entering the Holy Place (Exodus 30:19–21). This represents a cleansing from the filth of the world before we can commune with God. We must be "in the world, but not of it" (John 17:14–16).

> **[ILL]** A boat is designed to be in the water; that is its purpose. But if the water gets *into* the boat, the boat will sink. The Christian is designed to live in the world to witness for Christ, but if the spirit of the world gets *into* the Christian, their spiritual life will sink.

***

### Q4. Can anyone overcome these enemies in his own strength alone?

**"I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing." John 15:5.**

**Answer:**
This is the foundational text of **Righteousness by Faith**. It destroys all human pride and legalism.

*   **The Absolute Negative:** Christ does not say, "Without me you can do only a little," but "Without me ye can do *nothing*." We cannot generate a single thought of true holiness apart from Him.
*   **The Source of Life:** Just as a branch draws sap from the vine to produce grapes, the believer draws spiritual life and power from Jesus to produce the "fruit of the Spirit" (Galatians 5:22–23).
*   **Abiding:** This implies a continuous, daily connection. It is not enough to be grafted in once (conversion); we must remain connected moment by moment.

**Practical Application:**
Attempting to keep the law of God without Christ is legalism and leads to failure (Romans 7:14–24). Keeping the law *through* the power of Christ is the Gospel (Romans 8:3–4). Victory over sin is the natural result of a living connection with the Saviour.

***

### Q5. What is required on our part if we are kept from our foes?

**"Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." Matt. 26:41.**

**Answer:**
While Christ provides the power, He does not override our will. We have a cooperative part to play in the plan of salvation.

1.  **Watch:** This is the work of the intellect and the will. It means to guard the avenues of the soul (senses) and to be aware of Satan's devices.
2.  **Pray:** This is the work of faith. It connects our weakness to God's omnipotence.
3.  **The Weakness of the Flesh:** Even a converted person ("the spirit is willing") still dwells in fallen human nature ("the flesh is weak"). Therefore, we can never trust our past victories or our current feelings to sustain us.

**Key Term:**
*   **Sanctification:** The daily work of setting ourselves apart for God's use, dying to self, and living unto Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 1 Corinthians 15:31).

> **[ILL]** A soldier on guard duty may be loyal (willing spirit), but if he falls asleep due to exhaustion (weak flesh), the enemy can slip past. Prayer is the lifeline that keeps the soldier awake and calls for reinforcements when the enemy attacks.

***

### Q6. How much should we pray?

**"Pray without ceasing." 1 Thess. 5:17.**

**Answer:**
Prayer is not merely an event; it is a lifestyle.

*   **Unbroken Communion:** This does not mean we must always be on our knees or speaking words. It means living in a constant atmosphere of prayer, where the heart is open to God just as a flower is open to the sun.
*   **Dependency:** Continual prayer is the expression of continual dependence. As soon as we cease to pray, we begin to rely on self.
*   **The Breath of the Soul:** Ellen White famously wrote, "Prayer is the breath of the soul." We do not breathe only when we feel like it; we breathe to live.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
Faith is the hand that takes hold of God's promises. "Praying without ceasing" means keeping that hand constantly extended to receive Christ's imparted righteousness for every duty and trial.

***

### Q7. On what occasions did David receive strength and encouragement?

**"When I remember Thee upon my bed, and meditate on Thee in the night watches." Ps. 63:6.**

**Answer:**
David, a man after God's own heart, found strength in solitude and meditation, particularly during the quiet hours of the night.

*   **The Night Watches:** In the distraction-free silence of the night, the soul can hear God's voice most clearly. It is a time to recount God's past providences.
*   **Meditation:** Biblical meditation is not emptying the mind (as in Eastern mysticism), but *filling* the mind with the character, works, and law of God.
*   **Memory:** "Remembering" God is an active defense against discouragement. When we look at our problems, we despair; when we remember God's faithfulness, we are strengthened (Psalm 77:11–12).

***

### Q8. What did he say of the man who was truly blessed?

**"His delight is in the law of the Lord; and in His law doth he meditate day and night." Ps. 1:2.**

**Answer:**
This verse reveals the heart of the **New Covenant** experience.

*   **Delight, not Duty:** The converted man does not view the Law of God as a burden or a "yoke of bondage." He sees it as a transcript of God's character—holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12). He delights in it because his nature has been changed to love what God loves.
*   **The Subject of Meditation:** By meditating on the Law, the believer sees the standard of righteousness. This drives him to Christ for forgiveness (Justification) and for power to obey (Sanctification).
*   **Stability:** The context of Psalm 1 says this man is like a "tree planted by the rivers of water." His roots go deep into God's truth.

**Key Term:**
*   **The Law written on the heart:** The promise that God will put His laws into our mind and write them in our hearts, so that obedience becomes a natural outflow of love (Hebrews 8:10; Jeremiah 31:33).

> **[ILL]** If you receive a letter from a government tax office, you read it with dread or indifference. But if you receive a letter from someone you deeply love, you read every word with delight; you memorize it and think about it all day. The legalist reads the Bible like a tax code; the true believer reads it as a love letter from God.

***

### Q9. Will such a condition of mind be distasteful to one who really loves God?

**"My meditation of Him shall be sweet." Ps. 104:34.**

**Answer:**
To the carnal mind, thinking about God and His holiness is uncomfortable or boring (Romans 8:7). But to the renewed mind, it is "sweet."

*   **Transformation of Taste:** Sanctification involves a change in our spiritual taste buds. We lose our taste for the artificial stimulants of the world and gain a hunger for the Bread of Life.
*   **Relationship:** One naturally enjoys thinking about the person they love most. If we love Jesus, our meditation upon Him—His sacrifice, His ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary, His coming Kingdom—will be our greatest joy.

***

### Q10. How long ought one to continue in this constant devotion?

**"Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing." 1 Thess. 5:16, 17.**

**Answer:**
This devotion is to be a permanent condition of the Christian life, characterized by joy and perseverance.

*   **Rejoice Evermore:** Joy is a fruit of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22). It is not based on circumstances but on the assurance of salvation and the presence of Christ.
*   **Perseverance:** The Christian race is not a sprint; it is a marathon. We must continue in prayer and rejoicing until the end.
*   **Union of Joy and Prayer:** Prayer brings us into God's presence, and "in Thy presence is fullness of joy" (Psalm 16:11).

### Q11. What is the special duty of those who live in the time when the Lord's coming is expected?

**"Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is... Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: lest coming suddenly He find you sleeping. And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch." Mark 13:33-37.**

**Answer:**
We are living in the solemn time of the end, the antitypical Day of Atonement. Jesus emphasizes "watching" because there is a danger of spiritual slumber.

*   **The Danger of Sleeping:** This represents spiritual indifference, being caught up in the world, and losing a sense of the imminence of judgment. This is the condition of the foolish virgins (Matthew 25:5).
*   **Investigative Judgment:** We know that Christ is currently ministering in the Most Holy Place. We do not know when our names will come up in judgment or when probation will close. Therefore, we must live every day in a state of readiness.
*   **Universal Command:** "What I say unto you I say unto all." No one is exempt from this need for vigilance.

**Sanctuary Connection:**
On the earthly Day of Atonement, the people were required to afflict their souls and abstain from work to focus on the cleansing of the sanctuary (Leviticus 23:27–29). Today, we should be afflicting our souls through repentance and prayer, ensuring every sin is confessed and blotted out.

***

### Q12. As the Lord's coming draws near, what will make the duty of prayer and watchfulness more imperative?

**"Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time." Rev. 12:12.**

**Answer:**
As we approach the end, the battle intensifies.

*   **Satan's Wrath:** The enemy knows the prophecies better than many Christians. He knows his end is near, so he works with desperate energy to deceive and destroy.
*   **Increased Deception:** We can expect an increase in false miracles, spiritualism, and intense temptations (Matthew 24:24).
*   **The Need for Power:** Ordinary prayer will not suffice for extraordinary times. We need the experience of Jacob—wrestling with God for the blessing—to stand during the "time of trouble" (Daniel 12:1).

**Great Controversy Theme:**
We are the spectacle to the universe (1 Corinthians 4:9). God is demonstrating through His remnant people that His law can be kept and His character reflected even amidst the height of Satan's rage.

***

### Q13. Can we at that time have all the help we desire to withstand our enemies?

**"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you." John 16:23.**

**Answer:**
Despite the fury of the enemy, the provision of grace is abundant.

*   **"In My Name":** This is more than a phrase to end a prayer. It means praying in the authority and character of Jesus. It is presenting Christ's righteousness as our claim to be heard.
*   **Unlimited Resources:** The Father is willing to give us the Holy Spirit to overcome sin. There is no limit to the power available to the one who asks in faith (Luke 11:13).
*   **Mediator:** Jesus stands before the Father as our Intercessor. When we pray, He mixes the incense of His own merits with our prayers, making them acceptable (Revelation 8:3–4).

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
We do not earn God's help by our long prayers or fasting. We receive it as a gift because of what Jesus has done. Faith claims the victory that Christ has already won.

***

### Q14. If help does not come when it is first asked, what should one do?

**"And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them? I tell you that He will avenge them speedily." Luke 18:7, 8. "Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord." Ps. 27:14.**

**Answer:**
God sometimes delays His answers, not because He is unwilling, but to deepen our faith and purify our desires.

*   **Importunity:** Like the widow in the parable (Luke 18), we must be persistent. This persistence shows that we value what we are asking for.
*   **Developing Character:** "Wait on the Lord." The waiting period is a time of character building. It teaches us patience and total reliance on God's timing.
*   **The Promise:** He *will* avenge them speedily. From the perspective of eternity, God's deliverance is always on time.

> **[ILL]** When a parent teaches a child to walk, they may stand a few steps away and wait while the child struggles to come to them. They do not wait because they don't care, but because the struggle strengthens the child's muscles. God waits so that our faith muscles may grow strong.

***

### Q15. What promise is vouchsafed to those who are found watching when the Lord comes?

**"Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when He cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them." Luke 12:37.**

**Answer:**
This is one of the most astonishing promises in Scripture.

*   **The Divine reversal:** Usually, servants serve the master. Here, the King of Glory girds Himself (as He did at the Last Supper) and serves His faithful watchers.
*   **The Marriage Supper:** This points to the great celebration in heaven (Revelation 19:9).
*   **The Reward:** The vigilance, the prayer, the battle against sin, and the endurance of the cross are all worth it for the joy of sitting at the table with Jesus.

**Conclusion:**
Let us therefore "watch and pray," clothed in the righteousness of Christ, that we may be found ready when He appears.
