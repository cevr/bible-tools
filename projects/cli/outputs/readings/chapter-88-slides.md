## Slide 1 – Title Slide
- **Title:** Sunday Sacredness and the New Testament
- **Theme:** An examination of every reference to the "first day of the week" in the New Testament.
- **Focus:**
  - The immutability of God’s Law.
  - The consistency of Apostolic practice.
  - True obedience through faith.

## Slide 2 – Q1: Matthew’s Testimony
- **Question: In what part of the New Testament is found the first day of the week?**
- **Key Text:** Matthew 28:1 – “In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Distinction of Days
- Matthew wrote this Gospel under inspiration several years after the resurrection.
- He maintains a clear distinction between the two days:
  - The seventh day is titled “the Sabbath.”
  - The following day is simply “the first day of the week.”
- If the sanctity had been transferred, Matthew would have recorded it here.
- **Righteousness by Faith and the Law:**
  - Faith establishes the law rather than voiding it.
  - Romans 3:31 – “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.”
  - The Sabbath remains the sign of the God who sanctifies us (Exodus 31:13).

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration (The Will)
- **The Last Will and Testament:**
  - Once a testator dies, their will cannot be altered.
  - Galatians 3:15 – “Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.”
- **Application:**
  - Jesus sealed the new covenant with His blood on Friday.
  - If He intended to change the Sabbath to Sunday, He had to do so *before* His death.
  - Since He did not, the commandment remains unchanged in the New Covenant.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Mark’s Testimony
- **Question: Where is the first day next mentioned?**
- **Key Text:** Mark 16:1, 2 – “And when the Sabbath was past,... very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points & Sanctuary Connection
- **“When the Sabbath was Past”:**
  - Mark, writing years later, proves the Sabbath and the first day are distinct.
  - The holy time of the Sabbath ended before the first day began.
- **A Common Day:**
  - The women came to do work (anointing the body) which was not lawful on the Sabbath.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The earthly sanctuary contained the Law in the Ark; the heavenly sanctuary holds the same reality.
  - Revelation 11:19 – “And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Resurrection
- **Question: On what day was Jesus raised from the dead?**
- **Key Text:** Mark 16:9 – “Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Event vs. Command
- **The Historical Fact:**
  - It is undisputed that Christ rose on the first day (Sunday).
  - However, Scripture nowhere commands that the *day of the event* be kept as a Sabbath.
- **The True Memorial:**
  - The memorial of the resurrection is not a day of rest, but **Baptism**.
  - Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- We honor the resurrection by dying to sin and living a holy life through Christ’s power.
- **Key Text:** Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”
- The power that raised Jesus is the same power that raises us from the death of sin to the life of obedience.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Sequence of Days
- **Question: On what day was Christ laid in the tomb?**
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:52–54 – “This man [Joseph] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Passion Week Timeline
- This text establishes the unshakeable sequence:
  1.  **The Preparation Day:** Friday (Day Christ died).
  2.  **The Sabbath:** Saturday (Day Christ rested in the tomb).
  3.  **The First Day:** Sunday (Day Christ rose).
- The Sabbath is biblically fixed as the day *between* Friday and Sunday.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Obedience of the Believer
- **Question: What did the holy women do, after seeing where He was laid?**
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:56 – “And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: True Obedience
- **“According to the Commandment”:**
  - Luke, writing decades after the Cross, notes they rested according to the eternal Commandment, not merely Jewish custom.
- **Nature of True Obedience:**
  - These women loved Jesus intimately.
  - Their obedience was not legalism, but a result of grace.
  - Romans 1:5 – “By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Application (Sanctification)
- **The Law in the Heart:**
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”
- **Delight in the Law:**
  - Romans 7:22 – “For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.”
- **Sanctification Defined:**
  - The Holy Spirit imparting Christ’s righteousness, resulting in obedience.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Resuming Work
- **Question: What work did they postpone till the first day because they would not do it on the Sabbath?**
- **Key Text:** Luke 24:1 – “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Secular vs. Sacred
- **Secular Work:**
  - Carrying spices and embalming was considered inappropriate for the Sabbath.
  - It was perfectly acceptable for the first day of the week (Sunday).
- **Inspiration’s Verdict:**
  - The Holy Spirit categorizes the first day as a day for labor and travel.
  - This stands in direct contrast to the holy stillness of the Sabbath.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration (Public Holiday)
- **The King’s Holiday:**
  - If a Governor declares a "Public Holiday," offices close.
  - If you go to work the next day, it is a "business day."
- **Application:**
  - The women treated the Sabbath as the King’s Holiday.
  - They treated Sunday as a regular business day to resume their work.

## Slide 18 – Q7: John’s Testimony
- **Question: How does John speak of these events?**
- **Key Text:** John 20:1 – “The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: No Sacred Title
- John wrote his Gospel very late (approx. 97 A.D.).
- If Sunday had become holy, John would have used a sacred title like “The Lord’s Day.”
- Instead, he uses the plain, secular title: “the first day of the week.”
- All four Gospel writers agree: there is no hint of a change.

## Slide 20 – Q8: The First Meeting
- **Question: What took place in the evening of that same first day?**
- **Key Text:** John 20:19 – “Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Fear, Not Worship
- **Context of the Assembly:**
  - They were assembled “for fear of the Jews.”
  - They were hiding behind locked doors.
  - They did not yet believe He had risen (Mark 16:11-14).
- **Christ’s Ministry:**
  - Jesus came to dispel fear and offer peace, not to inaugurate a new Sabbath.

## Slide 22 – Q9: The Road to Emmaus
- **Question: Had Jesus previously appeared to some of His disciples?**
- **Key Text:** Mark 16:12 – “He appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Travel and Sanctuary
- **Sunday Travel:**
  - Disciples walked roughly seven miles to Emmaus on Sunday.
  - Jesus walked with them and did not rebuke them for traveling on a holy day.
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - Jesus explained the necessity of His sacrifice from the Scriptures.
  - He pointed to Himself as the antitype of the sanctuary sacrifices.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Disbelief
- **Question: When they went and told the others who were assembled, how did they receive the news?**
- **Key Text:** Mark 16:13 – “And they went and told it unto the residue; neither believed they them.”
- **Significance:**
  - This confirms the upper room assembly was not a celebration of the resurrection.
  - One cannot celebrate a resurrection one does not believe in.

## Slide 25 – Q11: The Rebuke
- **Question: When Jesus afterward met the eleven, what did He say to them?**
- **Key Text:** Mark 16:14 – “Afterward He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Faith and Salvation
- **The Rebuke:**
  - Jesus scolded them for “unbelief,” not for failing to keep Sunday holy.
- **Hardness of Heart:**
  - Salvation is accessed by faith.
  - Their hardness of heart prevented them from grasping the gospel.
- **Conclusion:**
  - A meeting characterized by fear, unbelief, and rebuke cannot be the inauguration of a new Sabbath.

## Slide 27 – Q12: Timeline
- **Question: Did Christ appear to the eleven while the two who had seen Him at Emmaus were relating their experience?**
- **Key Text:** Luke 24:33–36 – “And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together... And as they thus spake, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them...”
- **Point:** This confirms the meeting occurred late Sunday night, immediately after the return from Emmaus.

## Slide 28 – Q13: Not Communion
- **Question: Were the disciples here assembled to partake of the communion?**
- **Key Text:** Luke 24:41–43 – “And while they believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them, Have ye here any meat? And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And He took it, and did eat before them.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Physical Proof
- **Common Meal:**
  - They ate fish and honeycomb.
  - There is no mention of bread and wine or the New Covenant symbols.
- **Purpose:**
  - Jesus ate to prove He was a physical resurrected being, not a spirit.
- **Time:**
  - By Bible reckoning (sunset to sunset), Sunday night is the beginning of the second day (Monday).

## Slide 30 – Q14: Domestic Setting
- **Question: Where did the disciples live when in Jerusalem?**
- **Key Text:** Acts 1:13 – “And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode Peter, and James, and John...”
- **Point:**
  - The "upper room" was their living quarters.
  - Jesus met them in their home. His presence sanctifies us, but it does not legally change a day of the week into a Sabbath.

## Slide 31 – Q15: The Next Meeting
- **Question: When did the Saviour next meet with His disciples?**
- **Key Text:** John 20:26 – “And after eight days, again His disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.”

## Slide 32 – Q15: No Pattern Established
- **"After Eight Days":**
  - This phrase is indefinite; it could mean the following Monday or Sunday.
- **Missing Sundays:**
  - Jesus appeared only occasionally over 40 days.
  - He did not meet with them every Sunday to establish a worship pattern.
- **Doors Shut:**
  - The context implies continued fear and privacy, not public worship.

## Slide 33 – Q15: Illustration (Corporate Meeting)
- **The CEO Analogy:**
  - If a CEO holds a meeting on Monday the 1st, and another on Monday the 8th, does that make Monday a corporate holiday?
  - No, it simply means two meetings occurred.
- **Lesson:** Without a divine decree or commandment, the legal status of the day remains unchanged.

## Slide 34 – Q16: The Troas Meeting
- **Question: On what day did Paul once meet with the brethren at Troas?**
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:7 – “And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.”

## Slide 35 – Q16: A Farewell Gathering
- **Timing:**
  - Biblical days begin at sunset. A "first day" meeting that goes until midnight is **Saturday night**.
- **Purpose:**
  - Paul was "ready to depart on the morrow." This was a farewell meeting.
- **Breaking Bread:**
  - This phrase was used for common meals (Acts 2:46 – “And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness...”)
  - Even if it were the Lord's Supper, it is not limited to a specific day (1 Corinthians 11:26).

## Slide 36 – Q17: Confirmation of Time
- **Question: At what time of day was this meeting held?**
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:8 – “And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.”
- **Point:**
  - "Many lights" confirms a night meeting.
  - The dark part of the first day is Saturday night.
  - Sunday morning is the light part of the day.

## Slide 37 – Q18: Paul’s Company
- **Question: How many accompanied Paul on his journey into Asia on this occasion?**
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:4 – “And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.”
- **Point:** Paul was traveling with a large group of believers whose actions reflect apostolic practice.

## Slide 38 – Q19: Sunday Travel
- **Question: While Paul was walking across the peninsula (nineteen and one half miles) to Assos, what were his companions doing?**
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:13 – “And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.”

## Slide 39 – Q19: Apostolic Labor on Sunday
- **Sunday Morning Activity:**
  - While Paul walked 19 miles overland, his companions sailed a ship.
  - Both walking and sailing are hard physical labor.
- **Paul’s Example:**
  - The apostle to the Gentiles used Sunday as a travel day.
  - If Sunday were holy, he would have spent it in rest and worship.
- **Conclusion:** Acts 20:7 describes a Saturday night meeting followed by Sunday morning travel.

## Slide 40 – Q20: Laying in Store
- **Question: What did Paul tell the Corinthian church to do on Sunday?**
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 16:2 – “Upon the first day of the week let everyone of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.”

## Slide 41 – Q20: Private Accounting
- **"Lay by him in store":**
  - The Greek *par' heauto* means "by himself" or "at home."
- **The Instruction:**
  - Believers were to calculate their weekly earnings and set aside a portion *at home* on Sunday morning.
- **The Reason:**
  - So that "no gatherings" (collections) would be needed when Paul arrived.
  - This is an instruction for private bookkeeping, not a public church service.

## Slide 42 – Q21: The Collection
- **Question: What was the collection for?**
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 16:1 – “Now concerning the collection of the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.”
- **Context:**
  - This was for the poor saints in Jerusalem (Romans 15:26 – “For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.”).
  - It was a specific project, not a weekly tithe or worship ritual.

## Slide 43 – Q22: The Lord’s Day
- **Question: When was John in the Spirit?**
- **Key Text:** Revelation 1:10 – “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.”
- **Biblical Definition Needed:**
  - John does not identify the day here.
  - We must use Scripture to interpret Scripture.
  - Isaiah 28:10 – “For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little.”

## Slide 44 – Q23: God’s Holy Day
- **Question: What day has God called His?**
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:13 – “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day...”
- **The Commandment:**
  - Exodus 20:10 – “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work...”
- **Deduction:**
  - If the Sabbath is the only day God calls "My holy day," then the Sabbath is the Lord's Day.

## Slide 45 – Q24: The Lord of the Sabbath
- **Question: Of what day has Christ claimed to be Lord?**
- **Key Text:** Mark 2:28 – “Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”
- **Creator and Redeemer:**
  - Jesus created all things.
  - John 1:3 – “All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.”
  - As Creator, He instituted the Sabbath. As Redeemer, He kept it.

## Slide 46 – Conclusion
- **Summary of Evidence:**
  - Not a single command in the NT to keep Sunday holy.
  - No instance of the title "holy" applied to Sunday.
  - Disciples worked (Luke 24:1), traveled (Acts 20:13), and did accounting (1 Cor 16:2) on Sunday.
- **Gospel Application:**
  - Righteousness by Faith involves writing God's eternal law on the heart.
  - The Sabbath is the sign of allegiance to the Creator.
  - We rest in His finished work, trusting in the God who makes us holy.

## Slide 47 – Conclusion: Illustration
- **The Mirror and the Water:**
  - The Law is a mirror that shows us the "dirt" of sin.
  - If we see dirt, we do not smash the mirror or get a different one.
  - We go to the water (Jesus) to be washed.
- **Sunday vs. Sabbath:**
  - Sunday sacredness attempts to change the mirror.
  - The Sabbath keeper looks into God’s unchanging law, sees his need, and flees to Christ for cleansing and power to obey.
