### Q1. What will pride do for him who cherishes it?

**"A man's pride shall bring him low." Proverbs 29:23.**

**Answer:**
The Bible presents a spiritual paradox: in the kingdom of this world, pride pushes a man upward to positions of power and fame; but in the kingdom of God, the way up is down. Pride is the primary characteristic of the author of sin, Lucifer, who said in his heart, "I will ascend... I will be like the most High" (Isaiah 14:13–14). Consequently, he was brought down to the lowest depths.

1.  **The Nature of the Fall:** Just as gravity acts upon physical objects, spiritual law acts upon moral character. Pride inflates the ego with self-importance, making a person unteachable and independent of God. Because God is the only source of life and stability, to separate oneself from Him through pride is to ensure an eventual collapse (Proverbs 16:18).
2.  **The Barrier to Faith:** Pride is the greatest enemy of **Righteousness by Faith**.
    *   **Justification** (being declared righteous) requires us to admit we have no merit of our own (Romans 3:23–24). Pride refuses to admit total bankruptcy.
    *   **Sanctification** (being made holy) requires daily dependence on Christ’s power (John 15:5). Pride insists on self-sufficiency.
3.  **The Sanctuary Lesson:** In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner had to bring a sacrifice to the altar. He had to lay his hand on the victim's head and confess his sin (Leviticus 4:29). This was an act of public humiliation. A proud man cannot approach the altar because he will not admit he deserves death.

**[ILL]** Imagine a man trying to fill a balloon with his own breath until it is huge and impressive. The larger it gets, the thinner its skin becomes, and the closer it is to bursting. In contrast, the wise builder digs deep down into the earth—lowering himself—to set a foundation on the rock. The higher the building, the deeper the foundation must be. The Christian life is a race to the bottom, to be "rooted and grounded" in love (Ephesians 3:17).

### Q2. How does the Lord regard the proud?

**"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble." James 4:6.**
**"Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will not I suffer." Psalm 101:5.**

**Answer:**
This is one of the most solemn warnings in Scripture. God does not merely ignore the proud; He actively *resists* them.

1.  **God in Battle Array:** The Greek word for "resist" implies setting oneself in battle array against an opponent. When we cherish pride, we position ourselves as adversaries of God. We align ourselves with the principle of Satan.
2.  **The Condition for Grace:** The text promises **grace** only to the humble.
    *   **Definition of Grace:** Grace is not merely an attitude of forgiveness; it is the active, enabling power of God to overcome sin and transform the character (Titus 2:11–12; 2 Corinthians 12:9).
    *   God cannot pour this power into a heart that is already full of self. Humility is the emptying of the vessel so that the "oil" of the Holy Spirit may fill it.
3.  **Sanctuary Context:** The High Priest could only make **atonement** (reconciliation/at-one-ment) for the people when they were afflicting their souls (Leviticus 23:27–29). To have a "high look" during the Day of Atonement was to be cut off from the people. We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement now; it is a time for deep heart-searching, not arrogance.

**[ILL]** Water always flows to the lowest point. It bypasses the high mountain peaks, leaving them barren and rocky, but it settles in the low valleys, making them green and fruitful. So it is with the grace of God. If you lift yourself up like a mountain peak in pride, the river of life flows past you. If you humble yourself like the valley, God’s power fills you to overflowing.

### Q3. Will Jesus dwell with the proud?

**"The proud He knoweth afar off." Psalm 138:6.**

**Answer:**
Intimacy with Christ is impossible while cherishing pride, for two cannot walk together unless they be agreed (Amos 3:3).

1.  **Distance of Character:** Jesus is "meek and lowly in heart" (Matthew 11:29). His character is self-sacrificing love. The proud heart is self-exalting. These two natures are diametrically opposed. God knows the proud "afar off" because they have removed themselves far from His likeness.
2.  **The Fellowship of Suffering:** To dwell with Jesus, we must be willing to walk the path He walked. He "made himself of no reputation" (Philippians 2:7). The proud man seeks reputation. Therefore, he cannot abide in the presence of the humble Nazarene.
3.  **The Laodicean Danger:** This is the specific danger for the church in the last days. The Laodicean church says, "I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing" (Revelation 3:17). This spiritual pride keeps Jesus outside the door, knocking to get in. He cannot dwell *in* the heart until the pride is cast *out*.

**[ILL]** Consider two magnets. If you try to push the "north" poles of two magnets together, they will repel each other. An invisible force keeps them apart. But if you turn one around, they snap together. God is holy; the proud man sets himself up as a god. Two "gods" cannot dwell together. Only when the sinner turns around (repents) and acknowledges God’s supremacy can union occur.

### Q4. Can those who are filled with pride be truly wise?

**"He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words." 1 Timothy 6:4.**

**Answer:**
The world often mistakes intellectual arrogance for wisdom, but the Bible declares that the proud man "knows nothing" of what truly matters.

1.  **Spiritual Blindness:** Pride acts as a blindfold. A person may know theology, Greek, and Hebrew, yet if they are proud, they do not know God, for "God is love" (1 John 4:8). The Pharisees were the theological experts of their day, yet their pride led them to crucify the Lord of Glory.
2.  **Strife and Debate:** The text notes that pride leads to "strifes of words." A proud heart seeks to win arguments rather than win souls. It uses the truth as a club to beat others, rather than as bread to feed them.
3.  **True Wisdom:** True wisdom begins with the "fear of the Lord" (Proverbs 9:10). It acknowledges that we are dust and that God is infinite.
    *   **Imparted Righteousness:** True wisdom is practical. It is the character of Christ lived out in daily life—"pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated" (James 3:17). Pride destroys this peace.

**[ILL]** A man who has been blind from birth may argue eloquently about the physics of light, but a small child who can see knows more about the sunrise than the blind philosopher. Pride is spiritual blindness. Until the Holy Spirit applies the "eyesalve" (Revelation 3:18), the proud man argues about the Bible but does not see the Savior.

### Q5. Why should we not indulge in pride?

**"A high look and a proud heart... is sin." Proverbs 21:4.**

**Answer:**
We often categorize pride as a minor flaw or a personality trait, but Scripture defines it as **sin**.

1.  **The Essence of Sin:** The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). The foundation of God's law is love for God and neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40). Pride is the love of self above all else. Therefore, pride is a direct violation of the entire law of God.
2.  **The Root of Rebellion:** Pride is the mother of all other sins.
    *   Why does a man steal? Because he feels *he* deserves what belongs to another.
    *   Why does a man get angry? Because *his* ego has been offended.
    *   Why does a man refuse the Sabbath? Because *his* convenience or tradition is placed above God’s command.
3.  **Victory over Sin:** This is where the message of **Righteousness by Faith** becomes practical. We cannot merely trim the branches of sin (bad habits) while leaving the root (pride) in the soil. We must ask Christ to crucify the "old man" (Romans 6:6). The victory Jesus offers is a victory over the selfish, proud heart, replacing it with His own Spirit of humility.

**[ILL]** Imagine a gardener who keeps cutting the heads off the dandelions but leaves the roots in the ground. Within days, the weeds return. Indulging in pride while trying to stop "sinning" is like that gardener. Pride is the root. Unless the root is dug out by the grace of Christ, the fruit of sin will continue to grow.

### Q6. Will the Lord bless the proud?

**"Blessed is that man that... respecteth not the proud." Psalm 40:4.**

**Answer:**
God cannot place His seal of blessing upon that which destroys His character in the human soul.

1.  **The Source of Blessing:** The Beatitudes (Matthew 5) begin with "Blessed are the poor in spirit." The blessing of the Kingdom is reserved for those who know they have nothing to offer God.
2.  **Respecting the Proud:** The verse warns against "respecting" (admiring, envying, or following) the proud. If we flatter the arrogant or seek their approval, we partake in their spirit. We are called to be a "peculiar people" (1 Peter 2:9), distinct from the world's hierarchy of power.
3.  **The Exchange:** To be blessed, we must exchange our pride for Christ's righteousness.
    *   **Imputed Righteousness:** We accept His record in place of our failures.
    *   **Imparted Righteousness:** We accept His Spirit to live His life in us.
    *   This exchange is impossible if we are "rich" in our own estimation.

**[ILL]** A wealthy king offers a beggar a golden cup filled with life-giving water. But the beggar is clutching a handful of mud that he refuses to let go of. He cannot receive the blessing until he opens his hand and drops the mud. Pride is the mud we clutch; God's blessing is the golden cup we cannot receive until we let go.

### Q7. What will be one great sin of the last days?

**"Men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud." 2 Timothy 3:2.**
**"The child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient." Isaiah 3:5.**

**Answer:**
Prophecy indicates that as we approach the end of time, the restraint of the Holy Spirit will be withdrawn, and the natural fruit of the human heart—pride—will ripen fully.

1.  **The Character of the Last Days:** The apostle Paul lists "lovers of their own selves" as the leading sin of the "perilous times." This is the age of the "selfie," of self-promotion, and self-worship. It is the spirit of Antichrist, who "exalteth himself" (2 Thessalonians 2:4).
2.  **Rebellion Against Authority:** Isaiah predicts a breakdown in social and spiritual order, where the youth behave proudly against the "ancient" (the elders or the established wisdom of God). This represents a rejection of the **Ancient of Days** and His law.
3.  **The Final Test:** In the last days, the Great Controversy will center on authority.
    *   God’s Seal involves submission to the Creator's authority (the Sabbath).
    *    The Mark of the Beast involves exalting human authority above God's.
    *   Only the humble, who "keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12), will stand. The proud will inevitably side with the beast power because it appeals to human greatness.

**[ILL]** In the days of Noah, the proud antediluvians mocked the humble boat-builder. They trusted in their own scientific knowledge and the permanence of nature. Their pride was their ruin. So it will be in the last days; those who are too proud to enter the "ark" of safety—Christ and His truth—will be swept away.

### Q8. How are the proud generally regarded at the present time?

**"Now we call the proud happy." Malachi 3:15.**

**Answer:**
We live in an inverted world where the values of heaven are turned upside down.

1.  **The Illusion of Happiness:** Society celebrates the aggressive, the arrogant, and the self-sufficient. We put them on magazine covers and call them "stars." The prophet Malachi saw a time when God's people would be tempted to think, "It pays to be proud."
2.  **The Reality of the Heart:** Despite outward appearances, "there is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked" (Isaiah 57:21). Pride requires constant maintenance and defense. The proud man is easily offended, constantly jealous, and never satisfied. True happiness is found only in the rest of Jesus: "Come unto me... and ye shall find rest" (Matthew 11:28).
3.  **The Witness of the Church:** The church is called to demonstrate a different kind of happiness—the joy of service and humility. When the world sees a people who do not grasp for power but serve one another in love, they see the character of Christ.

**[ILL]** Stage lighting can make a painted backdrop look like a solid castle. But walk behind the curtain, and it is just wood and canvas. The world "calls the proud happy" because they only see the stage lighting of fame and wealth. But God sees behind the curtain of the heart, where there is fear, emptiness, and spiritual poverty.

### Q9. What does the prophet say will be their fate?

**"Behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud... shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up." Malachi 4:1.**

**Answer:**
The ultimate result of pride is total destruction. This is not an act of arbitrary anger by God, but the necessary result of His holiness encountering sin.

1.  **Stubble and Fire:** Stubble is dry, dead material. It has no life in it. When fire touches it, it is instantly consumed.
    *   **God is a Consuming Fire:** (Hebrews 12:29). His presence is pure holiness and love.
    *   **The Proud:** Those who have clung to self and refused the life of Christ are like dry stubble. They have no connection to the Source of life. When Christ returns in His glory, the proud cannot exist in His presence any more than darkness can exist in the presence of the sun.
2.  **The Cleansing of the Universe:** The **Sanctuary** message teaches that sin must eventually be blotted out to secure the peace of the universe. Pride originated sin; therefore, pride must be eradicated.
3.  **The Hope:** The only way to survive this "everlasting burnings" (Isaiah 33:14) is to let the fire of the Holy Spirit consume our pride *now*.
    *   We must die to self daily (1 Corinthians 15:31).
    *   We must be covered in the fire-proof robe of Christ’s righteousness.
    *   **Sanctification** is the work of letting God burn out the dross of pride from our characters today, so we may stand in His presence tomorrow.

**[ILL]** When a silversmith refines silver, he puts it in the fire to burn away the dross (impurities). He knows the process is complete when he can see his own reflection clearly in the metal. God puts us in the fire of trial now to burn away our pride. If we resist this process, we remain "dross" and will be consumed at the last day. If we submit, we will reflect His image and endure forever.
