### Q1. Against whom do we wrestle?

**“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” Ephesians 6:12**

**Answer:**

The Christian life is portrayed in Scripture not merely as a journey, but as a warfare. This text pulls back the curtain of the visible world to reveal the invisible conflict raging behind it.

*   **The Nature of the Conflict:** Our primary struggle is not against human beings ("flesh and blood"). While people may oppose the truth, they are often unwitting captives of a higher power. The real enemy is spiritual and organized.
*   **The Organized Ranks of Evil:** The terms "principalities," "powers," and "rulers" suggest a hierarchy within the satanic rebellion. Satan has organized his forces with military precision to deceive humanity and oppose the government of God (Revelation 12:7–9).
*   **The Great Controversy:** This battle is cosmic in scope. It is a war over the character of God and the allegiance of the human heart. The "darkness of this world" refers to the moral ignorance and rebellion that separates man from God (Isaiah 59:2).
*   **Victory Through Christ:** Because the enemy is supernatural, human strength is insufficient. We cannot overcome the devil by willpower alone. We need the "whole armor of God" (Ephesians 6:13). This is a key aspect of **Righteousness by Faith**: we stand not in our own strength, but hidden in the merit and power of Christ.

**[ILL]** Imagine a soldier on a battlefield fighting a visible enemy, only to realize that the true commander directing the opposing army is invisible and operating from a hidden bunker. If the soldier only fights the foot soldiers (human opposition) but ignores the strategist (Satan), he will lose. We must recognize the spiritual source of temptation to effectively use the spiritual weapons of prayer and the Word of God.

### Q2. When the evil angels first sinned, where were they cast and why?

**“For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.” 2 Peter 2:4**

**Answer:**

This verse sheds light on the origin of evil forces and their current location.

*   **The Origin of Evil:** Sin did not originate with humanity, but with Lucifer and the angels who joined his rebellion against God’s law of love (Isaiah 14:12–14; Ezekiel 28:15). God, being just, could not allow rebellion to flourish unchecked in heaven.
*   **"Cast Down to Hell":** The Greek word used here is *Tartarus*, which does not refer to a place of fire at this time, but rather a condition of restraint. They were cast out of heaven and confined to the "darkness" of this earth's atmosphere (Ephesians 2:2). They are restricted to this planet, which has become the theater of the universe where the consequences of sin are played out.
*   **Reserved Unto Judgment:** The devil and his angels do not reign in hell; they are prisoners awaiting sentencing. There is a set time for the final executive judgment.
    *   **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the sins of Israel were transferred to the sanctuary and eventually placed on the scapegoat (Azazel) on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), so too is Satan reserved to bear the ultimate responsibility for the sin he instigated, before his final destruction.

**[ILL]** Consider a dangerous criminal who has been arrested. He is not yet executed, but he is placed in a holding cell—a place of restriction and darkness—awaiting his trial and final sentencing. He is "reserved" for that day. Similarly, fallen angels are currently restricted to this earth, awaiting the final "court date" of the Great White Throne judgment (Revelation 20:11–15).

### Q3. What is Satan himself called?

**“The god of this world.” 2 Corinthians 4:4**
**"The prince of this world." John 14:30**
**"The prince of the power of the air." Ephesians 2:2**

**Answer:**

These titles reveal the extent of Satan's usurped authority over this planet.

*   **The Usurper:** Adam was originally given dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26). When Adam obeyed Satan rather than God, he surrendered that dominion to the deceiver (Romans 6:16). Satan thus claims to be the "prince" of this world.
*   **God of this World:** This signifies that the world's systems, maxims, and carnal principles are under his influence. He blinds the minds of those who do not believe, preventing the light of the gospel from shining unto them.
*   **The Prince of the Power of the Air:** This suggests his influence is invisible and pervasive, surrounding us like the atmosphere. He influences the "spirit of the age."
*   **Christ the Conqueror:** It is vital to note that Jesus said, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me" (John 14:30). Satan had no foothold in Christ.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** Through the cross, Christ has "cast out" the prince of this world (John 12:31). When we are in Christ, Satan’s legal claim over us is broken. We are transferred from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God’s dear Son (Colossians 1:13).

**[ILL]** Imagine a ship that has been hijacked by pirates. The pirate captain declares himself the "captain" of the ship and forces the crew to serve him. However, the rightful owner arrives with a superior force to retake the vessel. Satan is the hijacker (the usurper), but Christ is the rightful Owner who has boarded the ship to set the captives free.

### Q4. What is the chief work of the devil and his angels? How earnestly does he carryon this work?

**“And he [Jesus] was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan.” Mark 1:13**
**"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." 1 Peter 5:8 (See Revelation 12:9, 12; 16:14)**

**Answer:**

Satan’s work is the direct opposite of Christ’s work. While Christ seeks to save, Satan seeks to destroy.

*   **Temptation and Deception:** His primary method is deception (Revelation 12:9). He presents sin as desirable and God's law as a burden. He tempted Christ in the wilderness to doubt God’s love and to presume upon His power. If he attacked the spotless Son of God, he will surely attack us.
*   **Accusation:** He is known as the "accuser of our brethren" (Revelation 12:10). He tempts men to sin, and then accuses them before God, claiming they are unworthy of salvation.
    *   **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner brought a lamb. In the heavenly sanctuary, Jesus stands as our High Priest and Advocate against the accuser (1 John 2:1).
*   **Earnestness of the Enemy:** He is described as a "roaring lion" and one who walks about "seeking." He is active, diligent, and ruthless. He studies human character to find our weakest points.
*   **The Promise of Victory:** We are told to be "sober" and "vigilant." We are not to be afraid, but aware.
    *   **Victory over Sin:** The Bible promises, "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you" (James 4:7). How do we resist? "Steadfast in the faith" (1 Peter 5:9). Faith lays hold of Christ’s power, which is greater than Satan’s power.

**[ILL]** A lion hunting prey does not announce its presence with a bell. It stalks silently, looking for the straggler, the weak, or the careless one who has wandered away from the shepherd. Yet, the lion fears the Shepherd. When we stay close to the Shepherd (Christ), the lion cannot devour us.

### Q5. What are we warned not to do?

**“Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil." Ephesians 4:26, 27**

**Answer:**

This passage provides a practical strategy for spiritual warfare: closing the door to the enemy.

*   **Cherished Sin as a Foothold:** The phrase "give place" means to give the devil an opportunity, a beachhead, or room to operate. Cherished sins—especially anger, bitterness, and unforgiveness—act as open doors for satanic influence.
*   **Anger and the Spirit:** While there is a righteous indignation against sin (Jesus was angry at the hardening of hearts, Mark 3:5), human anger often degenerates into resentment and malice. "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath" teaches the necessity of immediate reconciliation and the cleansing of the heart.
*   **Sanctification of the Temper:** God calls for a complete transformation of character.
    *   **Definition of Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the believer acts, thinks, and feels more like Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:23).
    *   **Practical Application:** We often excuse a "bad temper" as a family trait. But the gospel provides power to overcome even hereditary tendencies. By surrendering our emotions to Christ, He calms the storm within.

**[ILL]** If you live in a dangerous neighborhood, you would not leave your front door open, even by an inch. Leaving it ajar invites the thief to enter. Unresolved anger or a cherished grudge is like leaving the door of the soul slightly ajar. Satan needs only a small opening to insert his foot and eventually take over the house.

### Q6. As we near the close of human probation and the end of time, why may we expect an increase in demon manifestations?

**“Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time." Revelation 12:12**

**Answer:**

We are living in the time of the end, and the conflict is intensifying.

*   **The Shortness of Time:** Satan is a student of prophecy. He knows the signs of the times better than many Christians. He realizes that the "mystery of God" is about to be finished (Revelation 10:7) and that Christ is preparing to leave the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.
*   **Definition of Probation:** **Probation** is the period of time God grants to humanity to accept the gospel and have their characters transformed before the final judgment closes. When probation closes, the destiny of every soul is fixed (Revelation 22:11).
*   **Great Wrath:** Because his time is limited, Satan works with desperate energy. We see this in the rise of violence, moral anarchy, and occult activity in the world today. He aims to deceive the very elect if possible (Matthew 24:24) and to keep the world distracted from the solemn work of preparation for Christ's return.
*   **The Call to Readiness:** Knowing the enemy is wrathful should drive us to the sanctuary—to deep prayer and soul-searching—ensuring our sins are blotted out by the blood of the Lamb.

**[ILL]** A sports team that is losing the game plays with frantic intensity in the final two minutes. They take risks and use every tactic available because the clock is ticking down. Satan knows the "game clock" of history is near zero, and his fury is unleashed to ruin as many as possible before the end.

### Q7. What warning has been especially given to us who live in these last days?

**“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils." 1 Timothy 4:1**

**Answer:**

The final deception will not necessarily look like open evil; it will often come disguised as "new light" or spiritual advancement.

*   **Departure from the Faith:** This refers to an apostasy among those who once held the truth. It warns that knowledge of the Bible alone is not enough; one must have a love of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:10).
*   **Seducing Spirits:** This points to the rise of modern spiritualism—the belief that the living can communicate with the dead.
    *   **The State of the Dead:** The Bible teaches that the dead "know not anything" (Ecclesiastes 9:5) and sleep until the resurrection. Therefore, any spirit claiming to be a deceased loved one or a prophet is a lying spirit—a demon in disguise (Isaiah 8:19–20). This is a crucial protection against end-time delusions.
*   **Doctrines of Devils:** These are teachings that originate from the father of lies. They may lower the standard of God’s law, deny the divinity of Christ, or teach that man can be his own savior.
*   **The Safeguard:** "To the law and to the testimony" (Isaiah 8:20). We must test every spirit and every teaching by the written Word of God. Emotional experiences and miracles are not the test of truth; the Bible is.

**[ILL]** A counterfeiter does not make bills that look obviously fake (like a $3 bill). He makes them look almost exactly like the real thing. In the last days, Satan's deceptions will closely mimic Christianity, using miracles and emotional appeals. Only those who know the "security features" of the Bible will be able to spot the fake.

### Q8. What will be the final doom of Satan, his angels, and all the wicked of earth?

**“Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:" Matthew 25:41**
**"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch." Malachi 4:1**

**Answer:**

The Great Controversy ends not with eternal torture, but with the total eradication of sin and sinners.

*   **The Purpose of the Fire:** The fire is "prepared for the devil and his angels." Human beings only share this fate if they cling to Satan and refuse the separation from sin that Christ offers.
*   **Root and Branch:** Malachi uses vivid imagery. Satan is the "root," and his followers are the "branches." To be left with "neither root nor branch" means total annihilation.
*   **"Everlasting Fire":** In Scripture, the *effect* of the fire is everlasting (eternal destruction), not the duration of the burning process. Jude 7 tells us Sodom and Gomorrah suffered the vengeance of "eternal fire," yet they are not burning today. They were turned to ashes (2 Peter 2:6).
    *   **God’s Character of Love:** A God of infinite love and justice does not delight in torture. He will cleanse the universe of the cancer of sin. The wicked will be "stubble"—consumed and turned to ashes (Malachi 4:3). They will cease to exist (Obadiah 1:16).
*   **The Cleansed Universe:** After this fire purifies the earth, God will create a new heaven and a new earth (2 Peter 3:13). Sin will never rise up a second time (Nahum 1:9). The dark ministry of evil angels will be over forever, and God will be all in all.

**[ILL]** If a house is infected with a deadly plague that cannot be removed, the authorities may burn the house down to protect the community. The fire burns until the house is gone—it turns to ash. The fire goes out, but the destruction is permanent (eternal). This is the fire of the last days: it cleanses the universe of the plague of sin forever.
