## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Acquaintance with Us
- Question: How well acquainted is God with the life of each person on earth?
- Key Text: Psalm 139:2-4 – “Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: God’s Scrutiny and Care
- **Absolute Omniscience**
  - God does not observe from a distance; He knows our secret motives and daily habits.
  - To the unrepentant, this is terrifying (Hebrews 4:13 – “Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.”).
- **Comfort for the Believer**
  - For those resting in Christ, God’s knowledge is a comfort. He knows our frame and remembers we are dust (Psalm 103:14 – “For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.”).
  - He understands our struggles and provides grace exactly where we are weak.

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Sanctuary and Judgment
- **The Investigative Judgment**
  - Our lives are recorded in heaven. We live in the time of judgment where lives are reviewed (Daniel 7:10 – “...the judgment was set, and the books were opened.”).
  - Every word and thought is weighed (2 Corinthians 5:10 – “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ...”).
- **The High Priestly Work**
  - This reality underscores our need for Christ’s righteousness.
  - We cannot hide defects, but we can confess them.
  - Jesus, our High Priest, blots out the sins of the penitent with His blood.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Master Weaver**
  - Imagine a master weaver watching an apprentice at a loom.
  - The master sees every thread, knot, and potential mistake before it happens.
  - If the apprentice hides the mistake, the fabric is ruined.
  - If the apprentice works under the master’s eye and asks for help, the master turns even broken threads into a beautiful pattern.
- **Application**
  - God watches us not to catch us, but to perfect us in love.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Beginning of Wisdom
- Question: What is the beginning of genuine wisdom?
- Key Text: Psalm 111:10 – “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Fear of the Lord and Obedience
- **True Wisdom**
  - Wisdom is not just intellect; it is moral alignment with the Creator.
  - “The Fear of the Lord” is not terror, but reverential awe of God’s character (Revelation 14:7 – “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come...”).
- **Understanding through Doing**
  - Spiritual understanding comes from living the truth, not just reading it.
  - John 7:17 – “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Righteousness by Faith Application
- **Empowered Obedience**
  - We do not keep commandments to *earn* salvation.
  - We receive the life of Christ through faith, which empowers us to obey.
- **The Law of Liberty**
  - A home built on this reverence sees God’s law not as a burden, but as a path of happiness.
  - James 1:25 – “But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Lighthouse Keeper**
  - A keeper understands the ocean by respecting its power and keeping the light burning.
  - If he loses respect (“fear”) for the ocean, he becomes careless, and ships wreck.
- **Application**
  - A wise home respects God’s moral laws (the Ten Commandments).
  - These laws are safety barriers protecting the family from the shipwrecks of sin.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Parental Instruction
- Question: How are parents instructed to bring up their children?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:4 – “And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: The Atmosphere of Grace
- **Provoke Not to Wrath**
  - Parents must avoid arbitrary power, harshness, and anger.
  - James 1:20 – “For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.”
  - The home should be a refuge of love, not a place of tyranny.
- **Nurture and Admonition**
  - *Nurture:* Training and education given with tenderness.
  - *Admonition:* Mild rebuke and warning to guide the mind.
- **Modeling God’s Character**
  - Parents represent God to their children (Romans 2:4 – “...despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”).

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Wise Gardener**
  - A gardener does not scream at a rosebush to make it grow.
  - He does not violently yank the plant upward.
  - Instead, he prepares the soil, waters it, provides sunlight, and gently prunes.
- **Application**
  - A child is a tender plant needing the sunshine of love and water of instruction.
  - They need consistent care, not the storm of parental anger.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Teaching the Word of God
- Question: How important is it that parents teach the Word of God to their children?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 6:6, 7 – “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: The New Covenant in the Home
- **First, In the Heart**
  - The parent must possess the law in their own heart before giving it to the child.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”
  - Hypocrisy is detected by children; parents need the daily converting power of the Spirit.
- **Diligent Teaching**
  - Instruction should be constant and incidental, not just formal preaching.
  - Religion is the fabric of daily life—at meals, during walks, morning and night.

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Pitcher and the Cup**
  - To fill a cup with water, the pitcher itself must contain water.
  - If the pitcher is dry, you can tip it over, but nothing comes out.
- **Application**
  - Parents must be filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18 – “...be filled with the Spirit;”).
  - Only then will living water naturally flow out to the children in daily conversation.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Value of Early Instruction
- Question: What is the value of careful early instruction?
- Key Text: Proverbs 22:6 – “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Training for Eternity
- **"Train Up"**
  - Implies dedicating and guiding early habits before sin hardens the heart.
- **"The Way He Should Go"**
  - This refers to “The Way” of the Lord (Acts 18:25 – “This man was instructed in the way of the Lord...”).
  - It is the path of self-denial, service, and faith.
- **Co-operating with God**
  - Parents are co-workers with God.
  - Early habits of obedience and reverence lay a foundation the Holy Spirit uses to build character.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Young Sapling**
  - While a sapling is green and tender, it can be gently bent to grow straight by tying it to a stake.
  - Once it becomes an old, gnarled oak, no amount of force can straighten it.
- **Application**
  - Early training bends the “twig” of the child’s character toward the “Sun of Righteousness” (Malachi 4:2 – “But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings...”).

## Slide 18 – Q6: Timothy’s Example
- Question: How early was the Bible taught to Timothy?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 3:15 – “And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Christ-Centered Teaching
- **"From a Child"**
  - Timothy learned of God in infancy through the voice and love of his mother and grandmother.
- **Wise unto Salvation**
  - The Bible is not just for historical knowledge; it reveals sin and points to the remedy.
- **Faith in Christ Jesus**
  - Scripture must be taught with a focus on Jesus.
  - Old Testament stories are shadows pointing to the Cross.
  - The “faith of Jesus” unlocks the power of the Word (Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”).

## Slide 20 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Map and the Guide**
  - A map is useless unless you know the destination.
  - The Bible is the map; Christ is the destination and the Guide.
- **Application**
  - Timothy’s mother did not just show him the map.
  - She walked the path of faith with him, leading him by the hand to the Savior.

## Slide 21 – Q7: The Trust Committed to Abraham
- Question: Why did God confide in Abraham and commit important trusts to him?
- Key Text: Genesis 18:19 – “For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.”

## Slide 22 – Q7: Faith, Works, and Witness
- **Commanding the Household**
  - Abraham used spiritual authority combined with love.
  - He did not allow idolatry or sin to flourish in his camp.
- **Justice and Judgment**
  - These are the foundations of God’s throne (Psalm 89:14 – “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.”).
- **Justification and Works**
  - Abraham was justified by faith (Genesis 15:6 – “And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.”).
  - His faith was made perfect by his works in managing his family (James 2:22 – “Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?”).

## Slide 23 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Ship Captain**
  - A captain is responsible for the safety and conduct of his crew.
  - If he allows mutiny or laziness, the ship is in danger.
- **Application**
  - Abraham was the “captain” of his household.
  - He ensured everyone under his roof knew the sailing orders of the Captain of our Salvation.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Abraham’s Constant Practice
- Question: Wherever Abraham journeyed, what was his constant practice?
- Key Text: Genesis 12:8 – “And there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.”

## Slide 25 – Q8: The Family Altar
- **The Tent and the Altar**
  - The tent showed he was a pilgrim (Hebrews 11:9 – “By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles...”); the altar showed he was a citizen of heaven.
- **Sanctuary Connection**
  - The ancient sanctuary had morning and evening sacrifices (Exodus 29:38-39 – “...The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:”).
  - The father acts as the priest of the household, gathering the family for morning and evening worship.
- **Atonement**
  - The altar signifies the family rests on the Atonement—the blood of Christ.
  - We confess sins daily and invite Jesus’ presence.

## Slide 26 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Power Grid**
  - Imagine a house with no connection to the power grid.
  - Appliances are present, but the house is dark and cold because there is no electricity.
- **Application**
  - The “Family Altar” (worship) connects the home to Heaven’s power.
  - Morning and evening prayer “switches on” the light of God’s presence.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Thanksgiving
- Question: Should we thank God for our food, and health and all that we have?
- Key Text: 1 Thessalonians 5:18 – “In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.”

## Slide 28 – Q9: Gratitude and Health
- **The Source of All Good**
  - James 1:17 – “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights...”
  - Recognizing God as the Giver destroys pride (1 Corinthians 4:7 – “...and what hast thou that thou didst not receive?”).
- **Protection Against Apostasy**
  - Romans 1:21 – “Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful...”
  - A complaining spirit is the first step away from God.
- **Health and Temperance**
  - We eat to God’s glory, sustaining the “temple of the Holy Ghost” (1 Corinthians 10:31 – “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”).

## Slide 29 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Beggar and the Banquet**
  - A beggar who receives a royal banquet but eats without thanking the King is considered rude.
  - We are all beggars before God.
- **Application**
  - God feeds us daily with physical bread and the Bread of Life.
  - Saying grace and offering thanks is the politeness of a soul realizing its dependence on the King of Kings.
