## Slide 1 – Q1: The Vision’s Setting
- Question: Where was Daniel at the time that this vision was given to him?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:2 – “I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **The Prophetic Setting**
  - Although physically in Babylon, Daniel was transported in vision to Shushan (Susa), the future Persian capital.
  - This signifies that the prophecy concerns events after the fall of Babylon.
- **Historical Accuracy**
  - The river Ulai (Eulaeus) flowed near Susa, confirming the historical reality of Daniel's experience.
  - It is a revelation from the God of history, not a myth.
- **Preparation for the Future**
  - God was preparing His people for the transition of empires (Babylon to Medo-Persia).
  - God mapped out the history of nations long before they rose to power.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Architect’s Blueprint**
  - Before a building is constructed, the architect draws the plans.
  - Similarly, before Persia or Greece rose, the Great Architect of history mapped out the rise and fall of nations.
  - This proves God is in control:
    - Isaiah 46:9–10 – “Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.”

## Slide 4 – Q2: The First Symbol
- Question: In this vision, what did Daniel see first?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:3 – “Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points
- **The Symbol of Power**
  - In the ancient world, horns symbolized power and authority.
  - Zechariah 1:18–19 – “Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
- **Two Aspects of One Power**
  - The ram had two horns, but one was higher and came up last.
  - This illustrates the Medo-Persian empire:
    - The Medes rose first.
    - The Persians rose later but became the dominant force under Cyrus.
- **Divine Foreknowledge**
  - God accurately described the political dynamic of a superpower centuries before it happened.

## Slide 6 – Q3: The He Goat
- Question: What was next shown to him?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:5 – “As I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.”
- Key Text: Daniel 8:7 – “And I saw him come close unto the ram... and smote the ram, and brake his two horns... and cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him...”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points
- **The Identity**
  - Represents the empire of Greece (Daniel 8:21).
  - The "Notable Horn" represents Alexander the Great.
- **Speed of Conquest**
  - "Touched not the ground" signifies the incredible speed of Alexander’s conquests.
  - In roughly a decade, he conquered the Persian Empire.
- **The Fury of Power**
  - Greece sought bitter vengeance against Persia for previous invasions.
- **Human Power is Fleeting**
  - Even the greatest conquerors cannot secure eternal life.
  - "He waxed very great," yet worldly greatness is temporary.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Falling Star**
  - Alexander rose like a blazing meteor but burned out instantly.
  - Isaiah 40:6 – “The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.”
- **True Greatness**
  - True greatness is not conquering nations, but conquering self through Christ.
  - Proverbs 16:32 – “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.”

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Broken Horn
- Question: When the notable horn was broken, what came up next?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:8 – “When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points
- **Broken When Strong**
  - Alexander died at the height of his power (age 32), not in defeat or old age.
  - His death was reportedly due to fever aggravated by intemperance (drinking).
- **Lesson on Temperance**
  - A Christian must exercise self-control through the Holy Spirit.
  - 1 Corinthians 9:25 – “And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.”
- **Four Notable Ones**
  - The empire was divided among four generals (Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, Ptolemy) toward the four winds (N, S, E, W).
  - History confirms this specific four-way division exactly.

## Slide 11 – Q5: The Little Horn
- Question: What important horn came out of one of these horns?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:9–10 – “Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great... even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points
- **Origin and Identity**
  - Rose from the West ("one of them" referring to the winds).
  - Represents **Rome** in two phases:
    1. **Pagan Rome:** Political empire that crucified Christ.
    2. **Papal Rome:** Religio-political power that persecuted the church.
- **War on the Host**
  - Persecuted the "stars" (faithful teachers/leaders).
  - This spans the martyrdom of early Christians and the 1260 years of papal supremacy.
- **The Great Controversy**
  - This is the cosmic conflict played out on earth.
  - The Little Horn attempts to obscure Christ’s ministry and destroy His people.

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Command to Explain
- Question: What command was then given to an angel that stood nearby?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:16 – “I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points
- **The Commander**
  - The "man's voice" belongs to the Prince of the host, Jesus Christ.
- **Gabriel’s Mission**
  - Gabriel stands in God's presence and is commissioned to interpret prophecy (Luke 1:19 – “And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.”).
- **Our Need for Understanding**
  - God gives prophecy to save us, not confuse us.
  - We must pray for the Spirit to open our minds.
  - John 16:13 – “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.”

## Slide 15 – Q7: Time of the End
- Question: What were the first words that the angel then spoke to the prophet?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:17 – “Understand, a son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points
- **Message for the Final Days**
  - The vision applies to the "time of the end," not just local Jewish history.
  - It stretches to the final scenes of earth's history.
- **Importance for Us**
  - Since we live in the "time of the end," Daniel 8 is crucial.
  - It reveals the specific attack Satan has launched against Christ's intercessory ministry.

## Slide 17 – Q8: The Interpretation
- Question: Did the angel then explain about the ram and the he-goat?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:20–21 – “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Key Points
- **Biblical Interpretation**
  - We do not need to guess symbols; the Bible provides its own dictionary.
  - Ram = Media and Persia.
  - Goat = Greece.
- **Certainty of Faith**
  - This explicit identification gives us confidence to identify the subsequent symbols (Rome/Papacy) using the same historicist method.

## Slide 19 – Q9: The Four Kingdoms
- Question: What is represented by the four horns that come up in place of the broken one?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:22 – “Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.”

## Slide 20 – Q9: Key Points
- **Fulfillment**
  - Represents the Hellenistic kingdoms following Alexander.
- **"Not in His Power"**
  - None of the divided kingdoms equaled the strength of the unified empire.
  - Division always leads to weakness.
  - Mark 3:24 – “And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.”

## Slide 21 – Q10: Meaning of the Little Horn
- Question: What is the meaning of the "little horn" in verse 9?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:23 – “In the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.”

## Slide 22 – Q10: Key Points
- **Fierce Countenance**
  - Ruthless and unyielding; Rome was the "kingdom of iron."
  - Daniel 2:40 – “And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things...”
- **Understanding Dark Sentences**
  - Skilled in intrigue, diplomacy, and policy.
  - Represents a power using craft to deceive.
- **Spiritual Application**
  - A religious system that substitutes human mediators for the Divine Mediator.
  - Claims the prerogatives of God.

## Slide 23 – Q10: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Counterfeit**
  - To deceive, a counterfeit must look like the real thing.
  - The Little Horn is Satan’s masterpiece.
  - It is a religious system that looks like Christianity but removes the power of Christ’s direct mediation in the heavenly sanctuary.

## Slide 24 – Q11: Attack on the Sanctuary
- Question: What was this little horn to do to God's sanctuary?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:11 – “Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points
- **Against the Prince**
  - The power sets itself as a rival to Jesus Christ, the "Prince of the host."
- **Taking Away the "Daily" (The Continual)**
  - *Ha-tamid* refers to Christ’s continual ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - By establishing an earthly priesthood and the sacrifice of the Mass, the system obscured Christ's work in heaven.
- **Casting Down the Sanctuary**
  - It directed people to look to men on earth for forgiveness rather than Jesus in heaven.
  - Hebrews 8:2 – “A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **True Righteousness by Faith**
  - Relies entirely on Christ's work *in heaven* for us (Justification) and *in us* by the Spirit (Sanctification).
  - Any system placing human works or earthly priests between the sinner and the Savior "casts down" the truth.
- **The Definition**
  - The Heavenly Sanctuary is where Jesus ministers His blood to blot out sins and restore us to God's favor.

## Slide 27 – Q12: The Judgment
- Question: What was finally to happen to this persecuting power?
- Key Text: Daniel 7:26 – “The judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points
- **The Judgment**
  - The reign of the Little Horn is ended by God's judgment.
  - An investigative judgment reviews the records before Christ returns.
- **Vindication and Assurance**
  - God vindicates His truth and His people.
  - The judgment is good news for the saints; it decides in their favor.
  - Daniel 7:22 – “Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: The 2300 Days
- Question: At what time, according to this important prophecy, was the sanctuary to be cleansed?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:14 – “He said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points (Prophetic Time)
- **The Time Period**
  - 2,300 prophetic days = 2,300 literal years.
  - Numbers 14:34 – “After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years...”
  - Ezekiel 4:6 – “...I have appointed thee each day for a year.”
- **The Date**
  - Begins with the decree to restore Jerusalem (457 B.C.).
  - Ends in **1844 A.D.**

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points (The Event)
- **Cleansing the Sanctuary**
  - Corresponds to the ancient Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16).
  - A day of judgment and final removal of sin.
  - In 1844, Jesus entered the Most Holy Place to begin the "blotting out" of sins.
  - Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.”
- **Sanctification**
  - God calls for a people cleansed from all sin by the indwelling life of Christ.

## Slide 32 – Q14: The Effect on Daniel
- Question: How did this view of desolation and persecution by the little horn power affect the prophet?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:27 – “I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points
- **The Weight of the Vision**
  - Daniel was overcome by the reality of the conflict and the long delay (2,300 years).
- **Faithfulness in Duty**
  - Despite the burden, he "rose up, and did the king's business."
  - Waiting for the Lord does not mean idleness.
  - Luke 19:13 – “And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Watchman**
  - A watchman sees danger and is burdened, yet does not abandon his post.
  - He stays alert and warns the city.
  - We are called to be watchmen, faithful in daily tasks while warning the world that the hour of God's judgment is come.
