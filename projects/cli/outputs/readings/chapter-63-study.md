### Q1. Name the principal result of man's fall.

“Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Rom. 5:12.

**Answer:**

The principal and immediate result of the fall was the entrance of **sin** and
its inevitable consequence, **death**.

1.  **The Law of Heredity:** Adam was the representative head of the human race.
    When he fell, the nature of humanity changed from holy to carnal (Romans
    8:7). Because the fountain became polluted, every stream flowing from
    it—every human life—shares in that fallen condition.
2.  **Separation from Life:** God is the only source of life (Psalm 36:9). Sin
    acts as a separator between the soul and God (Isaiah 59:2). Therefore, when
    humanity chose sin, we were cut off from the Source of vitality, making
    death a biological and spiritual certainty.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** We cannot fix this condition on our
    own. Just as we inherited a nature of death from the "first Adam" without
    our consent, we may inherit a nature of life and righteousness from the
    "second Adam," Jesus Christ, by our consent through faith (1 Corinthians
    15:22).

- **Definition—Sin:** The transgression of God's law (1 John 3:4); a state of
  rebellion and separation from God.
- **Definition—The Fall:** The moment humanity distrusted God and chose
  disobedience, resulting in a broken relationship with the Creator and a
  decaying world.

[ILL] **The Cut Flower:** Imagine a beautiful flower cut from its bush. For a
few hours or days, it may look alive and vibrant in a vase. However, it is
legally and biologically dead the moment it is severed from the root. It has no
source of life. Similarly, since the fall, humanity is "cut off" from the Source
of life. We exist for a short time, but without reconnection to the Root
(Christ), we must eventually wither and die.

### Q2. In what condition is man while in the grave?

“Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work,
nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest." Ecc.
9:10.

**Answer:**

The Bible describes the state of man in the grave as a state of **total
unconsciousness**, often referred to as "sleep."

1.  **Suspended Activity:** The verse is explicit. There is no "work" (physical
    activity), "device" (planning), "knowledge" (memory or awareness), or
    "wisdom" (intellectual capacity) in the grave.
2.  **Soul Sleep:** Scripture consistently compares death to a sleep (John
    11:11–14; 1 Thessalonians 4:13). In sleep, a person is unaware of the
    passage of time, feels no pain, and engages in no activity until they wake
    up.
3.  **A Merciful Provision:** This doctrine is a comfort. Our loved ones who
    have died are not watching our sorrows from heaven, nor are they suffering
    in a burning hell. They are resting peacefully, awaiting the call of the
    Life-giver.

- **Definition—Mortal:** Subject to death; capable of dying. The Bible teaches
  that God alone possesses natural immortality (1 Timothy 6:16). Man is mortal
  and must "put on" immortality at the resurrection.

[ILL] **The Dreamless Nap:** When a tired laborer lays down for a nap and falls
into a deep, dreamless sleep, the hours pass in an instant. He closes his eyes,
and the very next moment (to his consciousness) is the morning light. So it is
with the dead. Adam closed his eyes thousands of years ago; to him, the next
split second will be seeing the face of Jesus at the resurrection.

### Q3. What has been promised in order that man may be redeemed from this condition?

“I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death:
O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction." Hosea
13:14.

**Answer:**

God has promised a **ransom** and a **resurrection** to break the permanent hold
of the grave.

1.  **Breaking the Prison:** The grave is viewed as a prison house that holds
    captives. God promises not merely to open the door, but to destroy the
    prison itself ("O grave, I will be thy destruction").
2.  **The Cost of Ransom:** A ransom is a price paid to deliver a captive. The
    price paid to release us from the wages of sin (death) was the life of the
    Son of God (Matthew 20:28).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot ransom ourselves. We are "sold under
    sin" (Romans 7:14). Our deliverance relies entirely on the merit of Another.
    We trust in Christ's payment, not our own suffering or penance.

- **Definition—Redemption:** The act of buying back something that was lost or
  sold, by paying a ransom price (1 Peter 1:18–19).

---

### Q4. Through whom will come this redemption from the grave?

“For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For
as in Adam all die, even so In Christ shall all be made alive." 1 Cor.
15:21, 22. (John 5: 26-29).

**Answer:**

Redemption from the grave comes exclusively through **Jesus Christ**.

1.  **The Two Representatives:**
    - **Adam:** Through his disobedience, he opened the door to sin and death
      for the entire human family.
    - **Christ:** Through His perfect obedience and sacrificial death, He opened
      the door to righteousness and life for all who believe.
2.  **The Key to the Grave:** Jesus holds the "keys of hell [the grave] and of
    death" (Revelation 1:18). Because He conquered death by rising from the
    tomb, He has the legal right and power to release its captives.
3.  **Union with Christ:** The phrase "in Christ" is vital. Only those who are
    spiritually united with Him—who have His life "imparted" to them through the
    Spirit—participate in the resurrection of the just. Righteousness by faith
    means Christ's life becomes our life (Galatians 2:20).

[ILL] **The Head and the Body:** If a man is submerged in water, as long as his
head breaks the surface and rises, the body will surely follow. Christ is the
Head of the church (the body). Because the Head has risen above the waters of
death, the body is guaranteed to rise also.

### Q5. What would be the result to the dead had not Christ procured their release from the grave?

“For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not
raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are
fallen asleep in Christ are perished." 1 Cor. 15:16-18.

**Answer:**

Without the resurrection, the dead would have **perished forever**.

1.  **No Natural Immortality:** If humans had immortal souls that went to heaven
    immediately at death, Paul could not say they have "perished" if there is no
    resurrection. They would still be alive in bliss! This verse proves that
    without the body's resurrection, there is no afterlife.
2.  **The Necessity of the Resurrection:** The Christian hope hangs entirely on
    the resurrection. If the grave is the end, then the plan of salvation has
    failed, and sin has won.
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** The High Priest's work is not finished until He
    comes out of the sanctuary to bless the people. If Christ remains in the
    tomb (or if we remain in ours), the atonement is not completed in the
    restoration of the believer.

---

### Q6. Where are the dead when they hear the voice of Christ calling them to life?

“Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the
graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth." John 5:28, 29.

**Answer:**

The dead are **in the graves** (not in heaven or hell) when they hear Christ's
voice.

1.  **Location of the Dead:** Jesus affirms that the dead are in the dust of the
    earth. They are called "forth" from the tomb, just as Lazarus was called
    "forth" (John 11:43).
2.  **The Voice of the Archangel:** It is the voice of Christ that wakes the
    dead (1 Thessalonians 4:16). This is the same voice that spoke the worlds
    into existence (Psalm 33:6, 9). Re-creation is an act of the same power as
    creation.

[ILL] **The Roll Call:** In a military barracks, soldiers sleep until the
morning bugle sounds. They are in their bunks, unconscious of the night's
passing. When the reveille sounds, they rise to duty. The grave is the dormitory
of the earth; the voice of Jesus is the reveille that wakes the sleeping saints.

### Q7. How many distinct classes will have a resurrection?

“There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust." Acts.
24:15.

**Answer:**

There are **two distinct classes** and two separate resurrections: the **just**
(righteous) and the **unjust** (wicked).

1.  **The Just:** Those who have accepted the sacrifice of Christ, whose sins
    have been blotted out in the judgment, and who have been covered by the robe
    of Christ’s righteousness.
2.  **The Unjust:** Those who rejected the offer of salvation and insisted on
    holding onto their sins.
3.  **Universal Resurrection:** No human being stays in the grave forever.
    Everyone is raised to face the judgment of God—either to receive life or to
    receive the final execution of the sentence against sin.

- **Definition—Justification:** The legal declaration by God that a sinner is
  righteous, based solely on their faith in Christ's atoning blood.

---

### Q8. How long do the others wait after the first resurrection?

“And they [the righteous] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But
the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.
This is the first resurrection." Rev. 20:4, 5.

**Answer:**

The "rest of the dead" (the unjust) wait for **one thousand years** (the
Millennium) after the first resurrection.

1.  **The First Resurrection:** This occurs at the Second Coming of Christ. It
    is for the "blessed and holy" (Rev 20:6).
2.  **The Second Resurrection:** This occurs at the end of the 1,000 years. It
    is the resurrection of damnation for the wicked (John 5:29).
3.  **The Millennium:** During this 1,000-year interval, the righteous are in
    heaven judging the world (1 Corinthians 6:2–3), while the earth lies
    desolate (Jeremiah 4:23–26), and the wicked remain in their graves.

---

### Q9. When are the righteous recompensed?

“For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just." Luke 14:14.

**Answer:**

The righteous receive their reward (recompense) **at the resurrection**, not at
the moment of death.

1.  **Future Reward:** This teaching contradicts the popular idea that believers
    go to their reward immediately upon dying. Jesus points us forward to the
    resurrection day as the time of victory.
2.  **The Investigative Judgment:** Before the reward can be handed out, a
    judgment must take place to determine who is accounted worthy. This takes
    place in the heavenly sanctuary before Christ returns (Daniel 7:9–10). When
    He returns, "His reward is with Him" (Revelation 22:12).

- **Definition—Recompense:** To repay, reward, or give what is due.

### Q10. In what condition did David expect to rise?

“As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when
I awake, with Thy likeness." Ps. 17:15.

**Answer:**

David expected to rise in a state of **satisfaction**, beholding God's face in
**righteousness** and bearing His **likeness**.

1.  **Restoration of God's Image:** The plan of salvation aims to restore the
    image of God in man (Genesis 1:26), which was marred by sin.
    - _Sanctification now:_ Restores the moral image (character) through the
      Spirit.
    - _Resurrection then:_ Restores the physical image (immortal body).
2.  **Righteousness Realized:** David expects to behold God "in righteousness."
    This means he dies trusting in the righteousness of God, and he wakes up
    fully restored, free from the very presence of sin.
3.  **Victory:** To be "satisfied" implies that all longings, all trials, and
    all sufferings of this life are outweighed by the glory of that moment.

[ILL] **The Reflection:** A silversmith refines silver until he can see his face
perfectly reflected in it. God refines His people through the trials of life
(sanctification) until His character is reflected in them. At the resurrection,
this work is completed, and we reflect His likeness perfectly in body and soul.

### Q11. What great contrast will be seen between the present body, and the one to be put on at the resurrection?

“So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised
in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory, it is sown in
weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown in a natural body, it is raised a
spiritual body." 1 Cor. 15:42-44.

**Answer:**

The contrast is between the **mortal, decaying body** we have now and the
**immortal, glorified body** we will receive.

- **Sown vs. Raised:**
  - _Corruption_ (decay/sickness) $\rightarrow$ _Incorruption_
    (ageless/perfect).
  - _Dishonor_ (humiliation of death) $\rightarrow$ _Glory_ (radiant beauty).
  - _Weakness_ (limitations) $\rightarrow$ _Power_ (tireless vitality).
  - _Natural_ (governed by physical cravings) $\rightarrow$ _Spiritual_
    (governed by the Holy Spirit).
- **Note on "Spiritual Body":** This does not mean a ghost or spirit-essence.
  Jesus had a "spiritual body" after His resurrection, yet He said, "Handle me,
  and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (Luke
  24:39). A spiritual body is a real, tangible body that is fully energized and
  directed by the Spirit of God, no longer subject to death or sinful appetites.

---

### Q12. After whose body will the resurrected ones be fashioned?

“We look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body,
that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body." Phil. 3:20, 21.

**Answer:**

Our resurrected bodies will be fashioned like **Christ’s glorious body**.

1.  **The Pattern:** Jesus is the "firstfruits" (1 Corinthians 15:20). As He
    rose, so shall we. He is not merely a spirit; He is a glorified Human-Divine
    being.
2.  **Identity Preserved:** Just as the disciples recognized Jesus after His
    resurrection (John 21:7), our identity will be preserved. We will know one
    another. The "vile" (humble/lowly) limitations are removed, but the
    individuality remains.
3.  **Sanctuary Thought:** The High Priest bears the names of His people on His
    breastplate. He represents us. He has carried humanity into the courts of
    heaven, and He will bring that glorified humanity back to us.

### Q13. What will the righteous do upon rising from the grave?

"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and
sing, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth
shall cast out the dead." Isa. 26:19 (1 Cor. 15:55).

**Answer:**

Upon rising, the righteous will **awake and sing** with joy and triumph.

1.  **The Song of Victory:** The first sound from the lips of the resurrected
    saints is a shout of victory: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where
    is thy victory?" (1 Corinthians 15:55).
2.  **From Dust to Life:** The imagery of "dew of herbs" suggests a fresh,
    springing vitality. Just as rain revives parched grass, the power of God
    revives the dust of the saints.
3.  **Contrast:** This is not a scene of fear (as it will be for the wicked),
    but of overwhelming relief and gratitude. The "Great Controversy" is
    effectively over for them; the battle is won.

---

### Q14. How long will they be permitted to live?

“Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the angels; and are the
children of God, being the children of the resurrection." Luke 20:36.

**Answer:**

They will live **forever**, for they can **die no more**.

1.  **Equality with Angels:** This refers to their state of immortality, not
    their nature. Humans do not become angels; they remain human, but like the
    angels, they are now beyond the reach of death.
2.  **Children of the Resurrection:** This phrase signifies a new kind of birth.
    Born from the grave into eternal life.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Eternal life is the gift of God (Romans 6:23).
    We do not possess it inherently; we receive it through relationship with
    Christ. Because He lives, we live also (John 14:19).

- **Definition—Immortality:** The condition of being exempt from death.

---

### Q15. What will become of those who are unworthy of a part in the first resurrection?

“But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers and
whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part
in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death."
Rev. 21:8.

**Answer:**

Those unworthy of the first resurrection will eventually suffer the **second
death** in the lake of fire.

1.  **The Character of the Lost:** The list includes "fearful and
    unbelieving"—those who lacked the faith to trust God—as well as those who
    practiced open sin. This emphasizes that salvation is about a transformed
    character. A heart not cleansed by Christ cannot exist in a holy heaven.
2.  **The Second Death:** This is the final, eternal cessation of life. It is
    not eternal life in torture; it is death. From the first death (the grave),
    there is a resurrection. From the second death, there is no return. It is
    total destruction (Malachi 4:1).
3.  **Sanctuary Truth:** This represents the final "cleansing of the camp." Sin
    and sinners are consumed so that the universe may be clean. It is God's
    "strange act" (Isaiah 28:21), necessary to secure the peace of eternity.

---

### Q16. What will then take place?

“The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." 1 Cor. 15:26.

**Answer:**

The **destruction of death** itself takes place.

1.  **The End of the Enemy:** Death is not a friend; it is an "enemy"—an
    intruder into God's perfect creation.
2.  **No More Sorrow:** When death is cast into the lake of fire (Revelation
    20:14), the universe is restored to its original perfection. "And there
    shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying" (Revelation 21:4).
3.  **The Vindication of God:** The plan of redemption is complete. God has
    proven that His law is a law of life, and sin is a law of death.

---

### Q17. How will the righteous ever afterward appear?

“Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear." Matt. 13:43.

**Answer:**

The righteous will **shine forth as the sun**, reflecting the glory of their
Father.

1.  **Glorification:** We will reflect the physical light of God's glory, much
    like Moses' face shone after being in God's presence (Exodus 34:29), but
    permanently.
2.  **Moral Reflection:** More importantly, we will shine with the moral beauty
    of Jesus. The universe will look at the redeemed and see the character of
    Christ perfectly reproduced.
3.  **The Result of Righteousness by Faith:** This is the climax of the gospel.
    The sinner, once dark with guilt, has been washed, justified, sanctified,
    and finally glorified.

[ILL] **The Diamond:** A rough diamond looks like a common pebble. But after the
Gem Cutter cuts and polishes it (sanctification) and places it in the light of
the sun (glorification), it blazes with brilliant fire. We are God's jewels
(Malachi 3:17), destined to shine in His kingdom forever.
