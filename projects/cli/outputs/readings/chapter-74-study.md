### Q1. To the believer what does Christ become? “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth." Rom. 10:4.

**Answer:**

The Apostle Paul here presents the beautiful relationship between the law of God and the Son of God. To the believer, Christ becomes the very goal, purpose, and fulfillment of everything the law requires.

1.  **The Meaning of "End":** The word translated "end" is the Greek *telos*. While it can mean "termination" in some contexts, in the context of God’s eternal government, it signifies the "goal," "purpose," or "culmination." Christ is not the *termination* of the law in the sense of destroying it (Matthew 5:17), but He is the *goal* toward which the law points.
2.  **The Function of the Law:** The moral law acts as a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ (Galatians 3:24). It reveals the holiness of God and, by contrast, the sinfulness of man (Romans 3:20). Once the law has convicted a man of sin, it can do no more for him; it cannot justify or cleanse. It points the sinner to Christ, who alone possesses the righteousness the law demands.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** The text says Christ is the end of the law *for righteousness*.
    *   **Justification:** The law demands perfect righteousness, which no fallen human can offer. Christ offers His perfect life to cover our past sins. This is *imputed righteousness*—credited to our account (Romans 4:22–24).
    *   *Definition—Justification:* The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is righteous, not because of their own works, but solely because of the merits of Jesus Christ (Romans 3:24–26).
4.  **The Believer’s Privilege:** To "everyone that believeth," Christ becomes the realization of the law's demand. We stop looking to our own commandment-keeping as a method of salvation (which is legalism) and look to Christ, who is the living embodiment of the law.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a man looking through a telescope at a magnificent star. The telescope represents the law; its purpose is not to be looked *at*, but to be looked *through*. If the man focuses only on the glass and brass of the telescope, he sees nothing of the star. But if he uses the telescope as intended, his vision is carried to the star. Christ is the Star. The law is the instrument designed to focus our vision upon Him. We do not throw away the telescope, but we understand that its "end" or purpose is to reveal the glory of the Star.

### Q2. In what sense is the word end (Greek, telos) sometimes used in the Scriptures? Object, intention, or design? "Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord." James 5:11.

**Answer:**

Here, Scripture interprets Scripture. By examining how the apostles used the word *telos* ("end"), we see that it refers to the final outcome, purpose, or intent of a thing, rather than its abolition.

1.  **The Case of Job:** James speaks of "the end of the Lord" in the story of Job. Does this mean the Lord ceased to exist? Certainly not. It refers to the *conclusion* or *purpose* God had in Job's trials—which was to demonstrate that "the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy" (James 5:11). The "end" was the restoration and blessing of Job.
2.  **Applying to the Law:** Similarly, when Paul speaks of Christ as the "end of the law," he means that Christ is the *crowning design* of the law. The law was given to outline the character of God; Christ came to live out that character in human flesh.
3.  **The Consistency of God:** God’s law is a transcript of His character (Psalm 19:7–9). Since God does not change (Malachi 3:6), His law—the expression of His will—does not cease. Instead, its design is realized when a sinner is transformed into the image of Jesus.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Consider an architect's blueprint for a house. When the house is finally built, the blueprint has reached its "end" (*telos*). The blueprint is not destroyed or burned; rather, its purpose is fulfilled in the actual building. The building is the physical realization of what was on the paper. So Christ is the living realization of the written law.

### Q3. What was the object of the law?” And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death." Rom. 7:10.

**Answer:**

Paul reveals the original, dual nature of the law's interaction with humanity: it was designed for life, but due to sin, it results in the death of the self-sufficient sinner.

1.  **Ordained to Life:** God created man to live in harmony with His law. Obedience to the law of God is the condition of existence in the universe. If Adam had remained obedient, the law would have been a guarantee of eternal life and happiness (Proverbs 19:16; Matthew 19:17).
2.  **Found to be Unto Death:** Because "all have sinned" (Romans 3:23), the law—which cannot tolerate sin—condemns the transgressor. The law serves as a diagnostic tool; it reveals the fatal disease of sin but offers no cure.
    *   *Definition—Condemnation:* The judicial sentence of death passed upon the sinner by the broken law (Romans 6:23).
3.  **The Schoolmaster's Role:** By slaying our hope in our own righteousness ("I found to be unto death"), the law drives us to seek life elsewhere. It forces us to look away from ourselves to the Sanctuary in heaven, where Christ our High Priest ministers.
4.  **Sanctuary Insight:** In the earthly sanctuary, the law was inside the Ark of the Covenant. Above it was the Mercy Seat, sprinkled with blood. The law condemned the sinner to death, but the blood interposed to offer life. The object of the law is to drive us to the Mercy Seat.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A high-precision level is used by a builder to ensure a wall is straight. The "object" of the level is to ensure a perfect building. However, if a wall is built crookedly, the level reveals the error. The level does not fix the wall; it only declares, "This is crooked; it must come down." The law is that spiritual level. It was ordained to verify our perfection, but instead, it exposes our crookedness (sin) and declares we are unfit for heaven, prompting us to call for the Master Builder (Jesus) to rebuild us.

### Q4. What further is the end, or object, of the law? “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart." 1 Tim. 1:5.

**Answer:**

The ultimate spiritual goal (*telos*) of the commandment is to produce a character defined by divine love.

1.  **Charity (Agape):** The KJV uses the word "charity," which is the translation of the Greek *agape*—self-sacrificing, principled love. This is not mere sentimental feeling, but the principle of God's own government (1 John 4:8).
2.  **A Pure Heart:** Notice the source of this love: it flows "out of a pure heart." The law requires inward purity, not just outward compliance (Psalm 51:6, 10). A distinct mark of the New Covenant is that God writes His law *in the heart* (Hebrews 8:10).
3.  **Sanctification:** This verse describes the work of sanctification. The law aims to restore the image of God in man. When a believer is fully surrendered to Christ, the "end" of the commandment is realized in them because their life becomes a life of love.
    *   *Definition—Sanctification:* The ongoing process by which the Holy Spirit imparts the nature of Christ to the believer, separating them from sin and making them holy in character (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If you plant an apple seed, the "end" or object of that seed is not just a sapling or leaves, but the fruit—the apple. The "seed" of the commandment is planted in the heart to bear the fruit of the Spirit, which is love (Galatians 5:22). If there is no fruit of love, the purpose of the commandment has not yet been realized in that life.

### Q5. What is charity, or love? “Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." Rom. 13:10 (1 John 5:3).

**Answer:**

The Bible defines love not as an emotion that overrides the law, but as the active principle of obedience to the law.

1.  **Love as Action:** True love "worketh no ill." It does not steal, it does not commit adultery, it does not covet, it does not kill. Therefore, one cannot claim to have "Christian love" while willfully breaking God's commandments.
2.  **Fulfilling, not Replacing:** Romans 13:10 states love *is* the fulfilling of the law. It does not say love *replaces* the law. To "fulfill" means to fill it up full of meaning and action.
3.  **The Test of Love:** The Apostle John clarifies: "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments" (1 John 5:3). There is no genuine love for God that results in rebellion against His government.
4.  **Christ the Example:** Jesus said, "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love" (John 15:10). Christ’s love was demonstrated by His perfect obedience.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A train needs two rails to run effectively. Let us call one rail "The Law" and the other rail "Love." If you try to run the train on the "Law" rail alone, it is heavy, grinding, and leads to legalism. If you try to run it on the "Love" rail alone (without the definition of the law), the train derails into sentimentalism and sin. The train of Christian life moves forward only when Love and Law are parallel, with Love being the power that moves us along the tracks of God's commandments.

### Q6. Why did God send His Son to the world?” For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us." Rom. 8:3, 4.

**Answer:**

This passage is the heart of the "Righteousness by Faith" message. It explains *why* the law cannot save and *how* Christ provides the remedy.

1.  **The Law's Inability:** "What the law could not do." The law has no power to save or strengthen. It acts like a mirror; a mirror can show you the dirt on your face, but it cannot wash it off.
2.  **Weakness of the Flesh:** The fault lies not in the law (which is "holy, just, and good"—Romans 7:12), but in our "flesh." Our fallen nature is antagonistic to God’s law (Romans 8:7). We are too weak to obey it in our own strength.
3.  **Christ's Incarnation:** God sent His Son "in the likeness of sinful flesh." Christ took upon Himself our fallen humanity yet without sinning (Hebrews 4:15). He met the temptations of life in the same territory where Adam fell and where we struggle.
4.  **Condemning Sin in the Flesh:** By living a perfect life *in human flesh*, Jesus proved that sin is not a necessity. He "condemned sin"—He broke its power and authority. He showed that humanity, combined with divinity, can keep the law of God.
    *   *Definition—Atonement:* The reconciliation of God and man through the life, death, and priestly ministry of Christ. It includes both the payment for sin (at the Cross) and the removal of sin from the sinner (in the Sanctuary) (Leviticus 16; Hebrews 2:17).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a man trapped in a deep pit. A rope is thrown down to him—this represents the Law. The rope is strong and good, but the man has two broken arms ("weak through the flesh"). The rope cannot save him, not because the rope is bad, but because the man is too weak to grab it. Christ does not just throw a rope; He climbs down into the pit ("likeness of sinful flesh"), takes the man in His arms, and carries him out. He does what the rope (the law) could not do.

### Q7. Then what is one enabled to do through Christ? “That the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us." Rom. 8:4 (see margin of Revised Version).

**Answer:**

This is the glorious result of the Gospel. The plan of salvation aims not merely to forgive us, but to restore us to harmony with God’s law.

1.  **Fulfilled IN Us:** Notice the text does not say the righteousness of the law is fulfilled *instead* of us, but *in* us. While our title to heaven is Christ's righteousness imputed *for* us, our fitness for heaven is Christ's righteousness imparted *in* us.
2.  **Walking in the Spirit:** The verse continues, "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Romans 8:4). Through the indwelling Spirit, the believer is empowered to live a life of obedience.
3.  **Imparted Righteousness:** This is the experience of having the law written on the heart. It means that through faith, the believer actually begins to live the life of Christ. The commandments are kept, not to *earn* salvation, but as the *fruit* of a salvation already received.
    *   *Definition—Imparted Righteousness:* The righteousness that God puts *inside* the believer, transforming their character and empowering them to obey God's will (Galatians 2:20).
4.  **Victory Over Sin:** This doctrine assures us that there is no known sin that the Christian must bow to. "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13). The "requirement of the law" is love and holiness; Christ gives us His own life to meet that requirement.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Consider a glove. A glove cannot pick up a Bible or turn a page by itself; it is "weak." It has the *form* of a hand (like the law has the form of righteousness), but no power. But if a living hand is inserted into the glove, the glove can do everything the hand does. We are the glove; Christ is the Hand. When He lives in us, the "righteousness of the law" is fulfilled in our lives because He is the one doing the work through us.
