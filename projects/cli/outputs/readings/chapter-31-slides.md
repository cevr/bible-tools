## Slide 1 – Q1: Abraham’s Call
- Question: What command did the God of heaven give to Abraham?
- Key Text: Genesis 12:1 – “Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Surrender)
- God called Abraham to complete separation from idolatry to become the father of the faithful.
- **The First Step is Surrender:**
  - Faith often requires leaving "country" (politics), "kindred" (social pressure), or "father's house" (tradition) when they conflict with God (2 Corinthians 6:17 – “Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.”).
- **Walking by Faith, Not Sight:**
  - God did not name the land immediately.
  - True faith trusts God's character even when the roadmap is hidden.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - God established a "beachhead" of truth in a world taken captive by Satan’s deceptions after the Flood.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Sealed Orders**
  - Imagine a ship captain receiving sealed orders from an Admiral.
  - He is told to leave the harbor and sail into the open ocean; the destination will only be revealed after he departs.
  - If the captain refuses to leave the dock until he sees the destination, he is not acting in faith.
  - Abraham cast off the lines, fully trusting the Admiral of the universe.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Immediate Obedience
- Question: Did Abraham obey this command?
- Key Text: Genesis 12:4 – “So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Faith & Action)
- Abraham’s response was immediate; he did not debate or delay.
- **Inseparable Principle:** Faith and obedience are inseparable.
- **Obedience Acts:**
  - Belief is not just intellectual agreement; it is an active response to God's voice.
- **No Age Limit:**
  - At seventy-five, Abraham showed there is no retirement from the service of the King.
- **The "So" of Faith:**
  - "So Abram departed" indicates cause-and-effect. Because God spoke, Abraham moved.

## Slide 6 – Q3: The Fruit of Faith
- Question: Of what was Abraham's obedience the result, or fruit?
- Key Text: Hebrews 11:8 (R.V.) – “By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points (Source of Obedience)
- Abraham’s obedience was the direct fruit of his **faith**.
- He obeyed because he believed the promise, not to earn favor.
- **Source of Action:**
  - Obedience flows from the inward spring of faith.
  - Attempting to obey without faith is **Legalism** (works of the flesh).
  - Claiming faith without obedience is **Presumption**.
- **Trusting in the Dark:**
  - Faith is willing to be led by the Spirit even when human reason cannot see the end (Proverbs 3:5–6 – “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”).

## Slide 8 – Q3: Righteousness by Faith
- Abraham’s journey illustrates the Righteousness by Faith message.
- **Faith Defined:**
  - The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Hebrews 11:1 – “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”).
  - It is taking God at His word.
- **Legalism Defined:**
  - Attempting to produce righteousness by one's own power to merit salvation.
- Abraham believed God (faith), and that belief propelled him to move (obedience).

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Supreme Test
- Question: What later command did the Lord give to Abraham?
- Key Text: Genesis 22:2 – “And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points (Sanctuary & Surrender)
- God asked for the object dearest to Abraham's heart.
- **Sanctuary Typology:**
  - Abraham represented the Father; Isaac represented Christ, the only begotten Son offered for the world (John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”).
- **The Test of Idolatry:**
  - God tests us to ensure no gift has taken the place of the Giver (Exodus 20:3 – “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”).
- **True Surrender:**
  - Obedience holds nothing back, placing even the dearest affections on the altar.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Refiner’s Fire**
  - A refiner of gold keeps the metal in the fire until he can see his face reflected in it perfectly.
  - God brought Abraham to the fire of testing not to destroy him, but to refine him.
  - The goal was for the image of God—self-sacrificing love—to be perfectly reflected in Abraham’s character.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Renewal of Promises
- Question: Upon what ground were the previous promises made to Abraham later renewed?
- Key Text: Genesis 22:16–18 – “And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: that in blessing I will bless thee... because thou hast obeyed My voice.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Conditionality)
- The covenant blessings were ratified because Abraham **"obeyed My voice."**
- **Conditional Promises:**
  - God cannot pour fullness of blessing into a rebellious vessel (Isaiah 1:19 – “If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.”).
- **The Seed:**
  - The promise refers ultimately to Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:16 – “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made... And to thy seed, which is Christ.”).
- **Atonement Connection:**
  - Abraham’s willingness justified God’s choice of him and demonstrated the nature of the future sacrifice at the cross.

## Slide 14 – Q6: Enabling Power
- Question: What was it that enabled Abraham to obey the great test?
- Key Text: Hebrews 11:17 – “By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Victory by Faith)
- The enabling power for obedience is always **faith**.
- **Faith Grasps Omnipotence:**
  - Abraham believed God could raise Isaac from the dead to keep His promise (Hebrews 11:19).
- **The Principle of Victory:**
  - We overcome sin not by willpower alone, but by faith in Christ’s power to raise us to new life (Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”).
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - Like the sinner laying a hand on the sacrifice, Abraham laid total trust in God's provision.

## Slide 16 – Q7: Evidence of Faith
- Question: Of what were the works of Abraham an evidence?
- Key Text: James 2:21 – “Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points (Justification)
- James teaches that works are the **evidence** of genuine faith. This completes, rather than contradicts, Paul’s teaching.
- **Justification Before God:**
  - We are declared righteous solely by faith in Jesus' blood; God reads the heart (Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”).
- **Justification Before Men:**
  - We are shown to be righteous by works. The universe cannot read hearts; they see the life.
  - Abraham’s work proved to the watching universe that his faith was real.

## Slide 18 – Q8: Faith Made Perfect
- Question: By his actions, or works, what was shown to be perfect?
- Key Text: James 2:22 – “Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points (Sanctification)
- Works make faith "perfect" (complete). Faith without works is dead (James 2:26).
- **Faith Wrought with Works:**
  - Like two hands on a plow, they work together.
  - The "faith of Jesus" always produces the "commandments of God" (Revelation 14:12).
- **Sanctification:**
  - This process where faith produces obedience is Sanctification.
  - The Holy Spirit writes the law upon the heart (Hebrews 10:16 – “I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.”).

## Slide 20 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Fruit Tree**
  - Consider a fruit tree:
    - The life is in the sap (faith), which is invisible and underground.
    - If the sap is flowing, the tree *must* produce fruit (works).
  - If there is no fruit, the tree is dead at the root.
  - We do not tape fruit onto branches (legalism); we nurture the root, and fruit comes naturally.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Genuine Faith
- Question: What is genuine faith?
- Key Text: Galatians 5:6 – “In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Love & Law)
- Genuine faith is an active principle that **"worketh by love."**
- **Love and the Law:**
  - "Love is the fulfilling of the law" (Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.”).
  - If faith does not make us obedient to the moral law, it is not the faith of Jesus.
- **Ceremony vs. Character:**
  - External ceremonies (circumcision) passed away, but the moral obligation to love God and man remains.
- **Motivation:**
  - We obey because we love the One who died for us (John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”).

## Slide 23 – Q10: Purpose of Grace
- Question: What is the purpose of the grace of Christ?
- Key Text: Romans 1:5 (R.V.) – “Through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all nations, for His name's sake.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (Grace Defined)
- The purpose of grace is to bring about the **"obedience of faith."**
- **Grace is Power:**
  - Grace is unmerited favor, but also the power to do what we cannot do ourselves (2 Corinthians 12:9 – “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.”).
- **Restoration:**
  - Sin is lawlessness (1 John 3:4). Grace restores the sinner to harmony with God's law.
  - A gospel that does not lead to obedience is a false gospel.
- **For His Name's Sake:**
  - Obedience vindicates God’s character before the world.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Effect on Hearers
- Question: What was the effect of the Apostles' preaching upon the hearers?
- Key Text: Acts 6:7 – “And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (Victory of Truth)
- The Holy Spirit’s power reached even the Jewish priests, who were entrenched in legalism.
- **Victory of Truth:**
  - No one is beyond the reach of the Gospel.
  - "Obedient to the faith" implies surrendering human pride and tradition.
- **Sanctuary Shift:**
  - These priests moved from the earthly temple service to faith in Jesus, the High Priest of the heavenly sanctuary.

## Slide 27 – Q12: God’s Regard for Obedience
- Question: How highly does God regard obedience in the lives of men?
- Key Text: 1 Samuel 15:22 – “And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points (True Worship)
- **Context:** King Saul tried to cover partial disobedience with a religious sacrifice.
- **The Principle:**
  - Religious activity is an abomination if used to cloak willful sin (Proverbs 28:9 – “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.”).
- **Atonement as Remedy:**
  - Sacrifice was provided *because* of disobedience. It is a remedy, not a license.
  - To prefer the remedy while continuing the disease is to mock God.
- **True Worship:** The surrender of the will.

## Slide 29 – Q13: Christ’s Example
- Question: What example of obedience to the will of the Father has Christ given to us?
- Key Text: Philippians 2:8 – “And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points (The Pattern)
- Christ is the "Second Adam" who succeeded where the first Adam failed.
- **Imputed Righteousness:**
  - Christ’s perfect obedience is credited to the believer for Justification.
- **The Cost of Obedience:**
  - The "obedience of faith" involves self-denial (Luke 9:23 – “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.”).
- **Unto Death:**
  - The believer is never released from the duty to obey, even if it costs their life (Revelation 12:11).

## Slide 31 – Q14: Learning Obedience
- Question: At what great cost did even He learn the lesson of obedience?
- Key Text: Hebrews 5:8 – “Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered.”

## Slide 32 – Q14: Key Points (Sympathetic Priest)
- Christ learned the *experience* and *cost* of obedience in a world of sin.
- **Sympathetic High Priest:**
  - Because He suffered, He can help us when we are tempted (Hebrews 2:18 – “For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.”).
- **The School of Suffering:**
  - Suffering teaches us reliance on God and refines our character.

## Slide 33 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Captain in the Storm**
  - A captain may know the theory of sailing from a book.
  - He only "learns" the ocean by steering the ship through a storm.
  - Jesus, in His humanity, learned the reality of obedience by steering through the storms of Satan's fiercest temptations.

## Slide 34 – Q15: Author of Salvation
- Question: To whom did Christ become the author of salvation?
- Key Text: Hebrews 5:9 – “And being made perfect, He became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him.”

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points (Saved to Serve)
- Christ is the Author of salvation specifically to those who **"obey Him."**
- **No License to Sin:**
  - We are saved *by* grace, but *unto* good works (Ephesians 2:10).
  - One who claims salvation but willfully disobeys is deceived (1 John 2:4 – “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.”).
- **A Completed Work:**
  - Christ was "made perfect" (qualified) as High Priest and now dispenses salvation from the Heavenly Sanctuary.

## Slide 36 – Q16: Complete Obedience
- Question: How complete should this obedience be?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 10:5 – “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points (The Mind)
- **The Battleground:** The Great Controversy is fought in the mind.
- **Internal Obedience:**
  - God's law reaches the thoughts (e.g., "Thou shalt not covet").
  - Murder begins with anger; adultery begins with lust (Matthew 5:28).
- **The Remedy:**
  - We cannot control thoughts by willpower alone.
  - We must invite the Spirit of Christ to occupy the mind and bring thoughts into harmony with Him.

## Slide 38 – Q17: Tradition vs. Commandment
- Question: What important fact did Jesus mention about the Pharisees?
- Key Text: Mark 7:9 – “And He said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points (Authority)
- Jesus exposed the danger of placing human tradition above God's law.
- **Tradition vs. Truth:**
  - The church often substitutes human ordinances for divine commands.
  - *Example:* The substitution of Sunday (tradition) for the Seventh-day Sabbath (commandment) parallels the Pharisees' error.
- **The Test of Authority:**
  - The "obedience of faith" accepts the Bible as supreme, rejecting traditions that conflict with "Thus saith the Lord" (Acts 5:29 – “We ought to obey God rather than men.”).

## Slide 40 – Q18: Future Accountability
- Question: What will be the future of those who refuse to obey the gospel of Christ?
- Key Text: 2 Thessalonians 1:7, 8 – “And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven... in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 41 – Q18: Key Points (Judgment)
- **Obeying the Gospel:**
  - The Gospel requires obedience (repentance and faith), not just mental assent.
- **The End of Sin:**
  - God’s love requires the eventual destruction of sin. Those who cling to sin will be consumed with it.
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - Before this event, the judgment determines who has the "seal of God" (obedience) and who has the "mark of the beast" (rebellion).

## Slide 42 – Q19: Result of Obedience
- Question: What is the result of faithfully obeying the truth by the enabling grace of Christ?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 1:22 – “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.”

## Slide 43 – Q19: Key Points (Love)
- **Sanctification:**
  - Peter defines it as purifying the soul *through* the Spirit *in* obeying the truth.
- **The Goal is Love:**
  - The end of the commandment is charity (love) (1 Timothy 1:5 – “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart...”).
  - True obedience softens the heart; it does not make one cold or critical.
- **"Through the Spirit":**
  - We cannot purify ourselves. The Spirit works as we choose to obey.

## Slide 44 – Conclusion
- **Promise:** “If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.” (Isaiah 1:19).
- **Summary:**
  - The New Earth is for those restored to the joy of obedience through Christ's merits.
  - God's law is the law of the universe.
  - Righteousness by Faith brings the believer to delight in God's will (Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”).
