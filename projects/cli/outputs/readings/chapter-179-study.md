### Q1. Has God prepared a dwelling place for His people?
"But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city." Heb. 11:16.

**Answer:**
The Bible reveals that the ultimate reward for the faithful is not a disembodied existence floating on clouds, but a tangible, prepared home in a real city.

1.  **A Prepared Place for a Prepared People:** Just as God prepared the Garden of Eden for Adam and Eve, Christ is currently preparing a home for His people in the heavenly sanctuary (John 14:1–3). This preparation involves two aspects:
    *   **Physical:** He creates a glorious environment suited for eternal life.
    *   **Spiritual:** Through His work as High Priest, He prepares *us* to dwell there by cleansing our characters from sin.
2.  **The Desire of the Faithful:** The text says the patriarchs "desired a better country." This implies a dissatisfaction with the sinful, temporary nature of this world. The heart that has been touched by the grace of Christ longs for a kingdom where righteousness dwells (2 Peter 3:13).
3.  **God’s Pride in His Children:** The verse states God is "not ashamed to be called their God." This is a marvel of grace. Though we have been sinners, when we accept the righteousness of Christ by faith, God looks upon us and sees His own Son. He claims us as His own family.

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** The earthly tabernacle was a "type" or shadow of God's dwelling place. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate realization of the sanctuary promise: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them" (Exodus 25:8).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a wealthy father building a magnificent estate for his son who has been lost in a distant, war-torn land. The father spares no expense, ensuring every room is perfect. However, the son must leave the rebellion of the far country to inhabit the home. The home is a gift, entirely "prepared" by the father, but the son must journey home to receive it.

### Q2. Where is this city? And what is it called?
"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all." Gal. 4:26.

**Answer:**
The city is currently in heaven, distinct from the earthly Jerusalem in the Middle East which has been the site of so much conflict.

1.  **"Jerusalem Which is Above":** This city is the headquarters of God's government. It is the location of the heavenly sanctuary where Christ now ministers in the presence of God for us (Hebrews 8:1–2).
2.  **The City of Freedom:** Paul contrasts this heavenly city with the earthly Jerusalem.
    *   **Earthly Jerusalem (Hagar):** Represents the covenant of works—trying to save oneself by human effort and law-keeping in the flesh, which leads to bondage.
    *   **Heavenly Jerusalem (Sarah):** Represents the covenant of grace. It is "free" because its citizens are born of the Spirit, not the flesh. They are justified freely by God's grace and serve Him out of love, not forced servitude.
3.  **"The Mother of Us All":** Just as a mother gives life, the new birth that makes us citizens of this city comes from above. We are "born again" by the Spirit (John 3:3).

*   **Definition - Justification:** A legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is righteous. This grants us the *title* or right to enter the New Jerusalem, based solely on Christ's merits, not our own works (Romans 3:24).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Two women stand before a judge. One tries to pay for her freedom with a handful of counterfeit coins she made herself (legalism/works). The other presents a pardon signed by the King himself (grace/faith). The second woman is "free" and a citizen of the King's city. The first remains in bondage.

### Q3. After sojourning in the land of promise as a stranger and a pilgrim, to what did Abraham look forward?
"For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God." Heb. 11:10.

**Answer:**
Abraham lived in tents, moving from place to place, because he understood that nothing on this present earth is permanent.

1.  **The City with Foundations:** Tents have stakes, but they have no permanent foundations. They are easily moved or destroyed by storms. The city of God, however, has eternal foundations. It cannot be shaken. This represents the unchangeable nature of God’s Kingdom and His law (Psalm 111:7–8).
2.  **Builder and Maker is God:** Salvation is not a human construction project. We cannot build our way to heaven (like the Tower of Babel).
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** We do not construct our own character to merit heaven; we submit to the Master Builder. "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works" (Ephesians 2:10). God is the architect of our salvation and the builder of our eternal home.
3.  **The Pilgrim Mindset:** A believer in this world is a "sojourner." We use the things of this world, but we do not set our hearts on them. Our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If you are staying in a hotel for one night, you do not repaint the walls or buy new furniture for the room. You settle in lightly, knowing you are leaving in the morning. Your real investment goes into your permanent home. Similarly, Christians live in this world as guests, investing their true treasure in the world to come.

### Q4. When we embrace Christ, unto what do we come by faith?
"But ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels." Heb. 12:22.

**Answer:**
Though our bodies are on earth, our faith connects us instantly to the heavenly reality.

1.  **Access by Faith:** We do not have to wait until death or the Second Coming to connect with heaven. Through prayer and faith in Jesus, our High Priest, we "come unto" the heavenly sanctuary right now.
2.  **The Communion of Saints and Angels:** When a believer prays, they are joining an "innumerable company of angels." We are never alone in our struggle against sin. The forces of heaven are allied with the believer who trusts in Jesus.
3.  **Mount Sion (Zion):** In the Old Testament, Zion was the place of the King and the Ark of the Covenant. In the New Testament reality, it represents the throne of grace where we find mercy (Hebrews 4:16).

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Under the old covenant, the people stood far off at Mount Sinai in fear (Hebrews 12:18–21). Under the new covenant, the blood of Jesus opens the way for us to enter the Holy of Holies by faith (Hebrews 10:19).

### Q5. What did John see concerning this city?
"And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband." Rev. 21:2.

**Answer:**
John saw the descent of the Holy City to the earth at the conclusion of the millennium (the 1,000 years described in Revelation 20).

1.  **Coming Down from God:** The city originates in heaven. It is a gift of grace, descending to earth to make this planet the center of the universe.
2.  **Prepared as a Bride:** The city is personified as a bride because it contains the Bride of Christ—His church (Revelation 21:9–10).
    *   **Adorned:** How is the church adorned? Not with outward jewelry, but with "the righteousness of saints" (Revelation 19:8).
    *   **RBF Application:** A bride makes herself beautiful for her husband, but she does not design the wedding dress; it is given to her. We are clothed in the robe of Christ’s righteousness—His perfect life covers our imperfections, and His Spirit beautifies our character.
3.  **The Marriage:** This symbolizes the final, inseparable union of Christ and His people. The Great Controversy is over; the separation caused by sin is ended.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
At a wedding, all eyes are on the bride. She is radiant, spotless, and joyful. She has laid aside her work clothes and is dressed in white. This represents the church after the judgment—cleansed of all sin, trusting wholly in Christ, and ready for eternal union with Him.

### Q6. Is this the city for which Abraham looked?
"And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb." Rev. 21:14. Compare with Heb. 11:10.

**Answer:**
Yes, it is the same city. The plan of salvation connects the believers of the Old Testament (represented by the gates named after the 12 tribes, see Rev 21:12) with the believers of the New Testament (the 12 apostles).

1.  **Unity of the Faith:** There are not two ways of salvation (one for Jews, one for Gentiles). Abraham looked for the city built by God; the Apostles preached that same city.
2.  **The Foundation:** The church is built upon the "foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone" (Ephesians 2:20). The doctrine of the apostles—which is simply the gospel of Jesus Christ—undergirds our hope of heaven.
3.  **Permanence:** A city with such foundations cannot fall. Those who build their lives on the teachings of Jesus are building on the rock (Matthew 7:24).

---

### Q7. What is the measurement of the city?
"And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth; and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs." Rev. 21:16.

**Answer:**
The physical dimensions of the city are staggering, demonstrating that God's grace is vast enough to save a "great multitude which no man could number" (Revelation 7:9).

1.  **Foursquare:** The city is a perfect square. In ancient thought, the square represented perfection, stability, and equality. It faces north, south, east, and west equally—the gospel is available to all corners of the earth.
2.  **Vastness:** 12,000 furlongs is approximately 375 miles per side (or 1,500 miles in circumference, depending on interpretation).
    *   *Note:* This area would cover a region larger than many modern countries. There is no shortage of room in our Father's house (John 14:2).
3.  **God's Generosity:** Human cities are crowded and polluted. God's city is spacious and grand. This reflects the generous character of God, who "abundantly pardons" (Isaiah 55:7).

---

### Q8. What was the height of the wall?
"And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits." Rev. 21:17.

**Answer:**
The wall stands at approximately 216 feet (or 144 cubits).

1.  **Security and Separation:** In Bible times, walls meant safety from enemies. In the New Earth, there are no enemies, yet the wall remains as a symbol that the "Holy City" is distinct. It separates the holy from the profane.
2.  **The Number 144:** This number connects to the 144,000 (Revelation 14:1), the special group of redeemed who live through the final events of earth's history and reflect the perfect character of Christ.
3.  **Sanctuary Imagery:** Just as the courtyard wall of the earthly sanctuary separated the tabernacle from the camp, this wall defines the sacred space of God's immediate presence.

---

### Q9. Of what material is the wall constructed?
"And the building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass." Rev. 21:18.

**Answer:**
The materials reflect the glory and purity of God.

1.  **Jasper:** In Revelation 4:3, the One sitting on the throne looks like a jasper stone. The wall reflects the very glory of God Himself.
2.  **Pure Gold like Glass:** Earthly gold is opaque and often hides impurities. The gold of the New Jerusalem is transparent.
    *   **Character Lesson:** This represents a character that is pure through and through. There is no hypocrisy, no hidden sin, no "whitewashed tomb" nature. The believer's life has been refined by the fire of faith (1 Peter 1:7) until it reflects the image of Jesus perfectly.
    *   **Sanctuary Connection:** The Most Holy Place was overlaid with pure gold, representing the divine nature. We are to become "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4) through Christ's dwelling in us.

### Q10. With what are the twelve foundations (or as some suppose, ornamental bases) of the wall adorned?
"And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst." Revelation 21:19, 20.

**Answer:**
The foundations are decorated with precious gems, displaying a rainbow of brilliant colors.

1.  **The High Priest’s Breastplate:** These stones closely mirror the stones in the High Priest’s breastplate (Exodus 28:17–20), which bore the names of the twelve tribes.
    *   **Sanctuary Truth:** This confirms that the New Jerusalem is the center of the High Priestly work. As the High Priest carried the names of Israel over his heart, so the very foundations of the city bear witness that God holds His people in His heart.
2.  **Variety and Beauty:** God loves diversity. Each stone captures the light differently. Similarly, God's people have different personalities and experiences, but all reflect the light of the "Sun of Righteousness."
3.  **Value:** God calls His people "My jewels" (Malachi 3:17). To the world, the faithful may seem poor or despised, but to God, they are the building blocks of His eternal city.

### Q11. Of what are the twelve gates composed?
"And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl; and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass." Rev. 21:21.

**Answer:**
Each massive gate is made of a single pearl.

1.  **The Pearl of Great Price:** Jesus compares the kingdom of heaven to a merchant seeking goodly pearls, who sold all he had to buy one "pearl of great price" (Matthew 13:45–46). This pearl represents Christ and the truth of His gospel. We enter the city only through Him (the Gate).
2.  **Suffering and Glory:** A pearl is formed when a living organism (an oyster) is injured by an irritant. It covers the injury with layer upon layer of precious material.
    *   **[ILL] Illustration:** The gates remind us that the beauty of heaven is the result of the suffering of Christ. By His stripes, we are healed. Furthermore, "we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22). Our trials, when covered by God's grace, become the pearls of our character.
3.  **Transparent Streets:** We walk on gold—material that men kill for on earth is trodden underfoot in heaven. In the New Jerusalem, material wealth is the paving stone, not the idol.

---

### Q12. What will be excluded from that city?
"And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie." Rev. 21:27.

**Answer:**
The city is exclusive in one sense: Sin cannot exist there.

1.  **The Necessity of Purity:** God is a consuming fire to sin. If a person clinging to sin were admitted to heaven, they would be miserable in the presence of absolute holiness.
2.  **Defilement and Lies:** This includes all idolatry ("abomination") and all falsehood. The Great Controversy began with a lie (Satan in Eden); it ends with the exclusion of all lies.
3.  **How to Enter?** Since "all have sinned" (Romans 3:23), how can anyone enter?
    *   **Atonement:** We must have our sins "blotted out" before Christ returns (Acts 3:19). This is the work of the Investigative Judgment. We must allow Jesus to take away our filthy garments and clothe us in His righteousness (Zechariah 3:3–5).
    *   **Sanctification:** We must be willing to part with every known sin. We cannot hold onto a "favorite sin" and hold onto Jesus at the same time.

*   **Definition - Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God's grace by which the believer is made holy. It is having the law of God written in the heart so that we naturally hate sin and love righteousness.

### Q13. Who will be welcomed there?
"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." Rev. 22:14.

**Answer:**
Those who have been restored to harmony with God's law will find a home there.

1.  **Obedience as the Fruit of Faith:** We do not keep the commandments to *earn* a ticket to heaven. That is legalism. Rather, because we have been saved by grace and have the Spirit of Christ within us, we walk as He walked.
    *   *Key Text:* "Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).
2.  **The Right to the Tree:** The word "right" (or power/privilege) implies legal standing. This right was lost by Adam through disobedience; it is restored by the Second Adam (Christ) through His obedience, which is credited to us and worked out in us.
3.  **Harmony with the Law:** The law of God is the transcript of His character. The citizens of the New Jerusalem keep the law not because it is written on stone tablets, but because it is written on their hearts (Hebrews 8:10). They love God supremely and their neighbors as themselves.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A fish is only free when it is in the water; put it on land, and it suffers. A train is only free when it stays on the tracks. Likewise, a human being is only truly free and happy when living in harmony with the design of the Creator—God's law. Heaven is a place of perfect obedience, which is why it is a place of perfect happiness.

### Q14. In what condition will those be who are permitted to dwell in the holy city?
"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away." Rev. 21:4.

**Answer:**
The curse of sin is entirely reversed.

1.  **God Wipes the Tears:** This is an intimate, tender picture. The sorrows of this life—loss, persecution, regret—are healed by the personal comfort of God.
2.  **No More Death:** The "last enemy" to be destroyed is death (1 Corinthians 15:26). The cycle of sin bringing forth death (James 1:15) is broken.
3.  **Former Things Passed Away:** The history of rebellion, the reign of Satan, and the misery of the "reign of sin" are over. The universe is clean. This is the ultimate hope of the Great Controversy—not just that we are saved, but that the universe is secure from evil forever.

---

### Q15. What is to be a prominent object in the city?
"And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of God and of the Lamb, shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him." Rev. 22:3.

**Answer:**
The Throne of God is the center of the city and the center of the universe.

1.  **The Throne of the Lamb:** Notice that the Lamb (Jesus) shares the throne. The sacrifice of Christ is not forgotten in eternity; it is the center of our worship.
2.  **Service:** Heaven is not a place of idleness. "His servants shall serve Him." We will have active work, ruling with Christ, exploring the universe, and fulfilling the purpose for which we were created.
3.  **No More Curse:** The curse pronounced in Genesis 3 is lifted.
    *   **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the Ark of the Covenant represented God's throne. It was hidden behind a veil. In the New Jerusalem, the throne is visible, and we shall see His face (Rev 22:4).

---

### Q16. What will flow from under the throne of God?
"And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb." Rev. 22:1.

**Answer:**
A life-giving river flows directly from God's presence.

1.  **Source of Life:** All life flows from God. We are not self-existent; we will depend on God for life throughout eternity just as much as we do now.
2.  **Pure and Clear:** There is no sediment, no pollution. This represents the pure truth of God and the refreshing power of the Holy Spirit, often symbolized by water (John 7:38–39).
3.  **Proceeding from the Throne:** Grace and life are not things we generate; they flow down to us from the Sovereign King.

---

### Q17. What stands on either side of that river?
"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations." Rev. 22:2.

**Answer:**
The Tree of Life, lost in Eden, is restored to the redeemed family.

1.  **Restoration:** Genesis begins with the loss of access to this tree (Genesis 3:22–24). Revelation ends with full access restored. The circle of the plan of salvation is complete.
2.  **Perpetual Fruit:** It yields fruit every month. This suggests that eternity will not be static; there will be cycles of time, gathering for worship (Isaiah 66:23), and continual fresh provision from God.
3.  **Healing Leaves:** Even though there is no sickness, the "healing" (or *therapeia*, meaning service/health-giving) implies that this tree perpetuates our immortality and vitality. It is the antidote to death.

**Conclusion:**
The New Jerusalem is the tangible proof of God's love. It calls us today to "wash our robes" in the blood of the Lamb, to allow His Spirit to write His law in our hearts, so that we may be fitted for this holy society.

*   **Definition - Atonement:** The work by which God and man are brought back into "at-one-ment." This includes Christ's sacrifice on the cross, His ministry in the sanctuary, and the final restoration of the New Jerusalem.
