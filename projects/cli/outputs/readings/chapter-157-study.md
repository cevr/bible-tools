### Q1. In what way has the Lord spoken of covetousness?

"And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life
consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." Luke 12:15.

**Answer:** The Lord Jesus issues a double warning here: "Take heed" and
"beware." This suggests that covetousness is a subtle, deceptive foe that can
creep into the heart unnoticed. It is a direct violation of the Tenth
Commandment (Exodus 20:17), which deals not with the outward act, but with the
inward desire.

- **The Definition:** **Covetousness** is the strong, self-centered desire to
  possess what belongs to another, or an excessive love for material gain. It is
  the worship of "self" over God.
- **The Great Deception:** The world teaches that a man is successful based on
  what he owns—his estate, his bank account, and his goods. Christ teaches that
  life is defined by relationship with God and the development of a holy
  character.
- **The Root of Sin:** Covetousness was the original sin of Lucifer, who coveted
  the position of God (Isaiah 14:13–14). It is the exact opposite of the spirit
  of Christ, who, though He was rich, for our sakes became poor (2 Corinthians
  8:9).

**[ILL] Saltwater Thirst:** Covetousness is like drinking saltwater. A
shipwrecked sailor, surrounded by water, may be tempted to drink from the ocean
to quench his thirst. But saltwater does not satisfy; it only dehydrates the
body further and makes the thirst more agonizing. So it is with the love of
money and possessions—the more a man gets, the more he wants, until his
spiritual life dries up completely.

### Q2. What showed this principle to be strong in the rich man who had already more than he knew how well to take care of?

"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and
there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul,
thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be
merry." Luke 12:18, 19.

**Answer:** In this parable, the rich man’s speech betrays the condition of his
heart. Notice the repetition of the personal pronouns: "I will do," "I will pull
down," "my barns," "my fruits," "my goods," "my soul."

- **Self-Centeredness:** His entire universe revolved around himself. He saw his
  abundance not as a responsibility to bless others, but as a means to pamper
  himself.
- **The Mistake:** He confused his "goods" with his "good." He thought that
  because his barns were full, his soul was safe. He planned for a long life on
  earth but made no provision for eternity.
- **Forgetting the Source:** He failed to acknowledge God as the Giver of the
  rain and the harvest. When we forget that God is the Owner of all things, we
  inevitably begin to hoard what belongs to Him.

**[ILL] The Dead Sea:** The Sea of Galilee receives water from the north and
flows out to the south; it is teeming with life. The Dead Sea receives water but
has no outlet; it keeps every drop for itself. As a result, the water is
stagnant, salty, and unable to sustain life. The heart that hoards God's
blessings without flowing out to others becomes spiritually dead.

### Q3. But what did God say to him?

"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of
thee; then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?" Luke 12:20.

**Answer:** God’s judgment stands in stark contrast to the world’s applause. The
world called him successful; God called him a "fool."

- **The Investigative Judgment:** This verse reminds us that our time on earth
  is a probation. We do not know when our names will come up in the review of
  heaven, or when our life will end. "It is appointed unto men once to die, but
  after this the judgment" (Hebrews 9:27).
- **Accountability:** The phrase "thy soul shall be required" implies a debt. We
  owe our lives to God. We are stewards, not owners. When the Master returns or
  calls for us, we must give an account of how we used His goods—whether for
  self-gratification or for the advancement of His kingdom.
- **The Futility of Hoarding:** Material wealth cannot cross the border of
  death. As it is written, "We brought nothing into this world, and it is
  certain we can carry nothing out" (1 Timothy 6:7).

---

### Q4. What application of this parable did the Saviour make?

"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God." Luke
12:21.

**Answer:** The tragedy of the rich fool was not that he had wealth, but that
the wealth had him.

- **Rich Toward God:** To be "rich toward God" means to possess the gold of
  faith and love (Revelation 3:18) and the robe of Christ’s righteousness. It
  means investing our means in God's work—saving souls. When we use our
  resources to help the poor and spread the Gospel, we are transferring our
  wealth to the bank of heaven (Matthew 6:19–21).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** A man who is justified by faith understands that
  he is bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:20). He knows that his life is not
  his own. Therefore, the Holy Spirit writes the law of love on his heart,
  replacing the "stony heart" of selfishness with a "heart of flesh" that loves
  to give (Ezekiel 36:26).

---

### Q5. What does the apostle call covetousness?

"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which
is idolatry." Col. 3:5.

**Answer:** Paul equates covetousness with idolatry.

- **Idolatry Defined:** **Idolatry** is giving the supreme love, trust, and
  service that belongs to God to any created thing.
- **The Golden Calf:** A man may not bow down to a statue of wood or stone, but
  if he loves his money, his property, or his career more than he loves obeying
  God, he is an idolater. Mammon (wealth) becomes his god (Matthew 6:24).
- **Breaking the First Commandment:** While covetousness is specifically the
  Tenth Commandment, Paul shows that it actually breaks the First Commandment:
  "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3).

**[ILL] The Monkey's Trap:** Hunters in some cultures catch monkeys by placing a
nut inside a jar with a narrow neck. The monkey reaches in, grabs the nut, and
makes a fist. But the fist holding the nut is too wide to pull back out of the
jar. To be free, the monkey only has to let go of the nut—but because it is
covetous and refuses to let go, it remains trapped and is captured. Sinners are
often trapped by the devil because they refuse to let go of the world's
trinkets.

### Q6. What does he say the things here enumerated have brought upon mankind?

"For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
disobedience." Col. 3:6.

**Answer:** God is not indifferent to the sin of covetousness. It brings His
wrath—not because He is arbitrary, but because selfishness is the principle of
death that destroys His creation.

- **The Wrath of God:** This refers to God’s necessary reaction against sin,
  eventually resulting in the "seven last plagues" (Revelation 15:1) and the
  final destruction of evil.
- **Sanctuary Truth:** In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ is currently
  ministering His blood to _remove_ these sins from our record and our lives. If
  we cling to covetousness, we refuse the remedy, and we must face the
  consequences of our own "disobedience."
- **The Need for Cleansing:** Justification forgives the past, but
  Sanctification (the work of a lifetime) involves the Holy Spirit rooting out
  these deep-seated traits of selfishness so we can stand in God's presence.

### Q7. What did Judas' covetousness lead him to do?

"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray
Him to them. And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him
money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray Him." Mark 14:10, 11.

**Answer:** Judas illustrates the terrifying progression of covetousness.

1.  **Small Beginnings:** Judas did not start by betraying Christ. He started by
    pilfering from the money bag (John 12:6). He cherished a secret sin.
2.  **Hardening the Heart:** As he continued to steal, his conscience became
    seared. The love of money crowded out the love of Jesus.
3.  **The Final Act:** Eventually, he sold the Lord of Glory for thirty pieces
    of silver—the price of a slave (Exodus 21:32).

- **The Lesson:** No man can serve two masters. If the love of the world is not
  expelled by the love of Christ, it will eventually lead a man to betray his
  Lord.

---

### Q8. How does the lord regard the covetous man?

"For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom
the Lord abhorreth." Ps. 10:3.

**Answer:** This is strong language. The word "abhor" means to regard with
extreme repugnance or loathing.

- **Why God Abhors It:** God is love (1 John 4:8). His very nature is
  self-sacrificing; He gives everything, including His Son. Covetousness is the
  exact opposite nature—it is self-seeking. It is incompatible with the
  atmosphere of heaven.
- **World vs. God:** Notice the contrast: The world "blesseth the covetous"
  (praises the rich and ruthless), but the Lord "abhorreth" them. We must not
  take our standard of success from society, but from the Sanctuary.

---

### Q9. Then can God trust such men to bear responsibilities in His work?

"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God,
men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of
thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens." Ex.
18:21 (1 Tim. 3:2, 3).

**Answer:** God cannot build His church with stones of selfishness. Leaders in
God’s cause must possess a specific character profile:

1.  **Fear God:** Reverence for divine authority.
2.  **Men of Truth:** Integrity and honesty.
3.  **Hating Covetousness:** Not just avoiding it, but _hating_ it.

- **Why This Requirement?** A leader who loves money will eventually compromise
  the truth for gain (like Balaam or Judas). A leader who hates covetousness
  will make decisions based on principle, not profit.
- **Sanctification in Leadership:** This qualification is a fruit of the Spirit.
  Only the grace of Christ can make a human being genuinely _hate_ the
  selfishness that is natural to the fallen heart.

### Q10. What is certain to follow the desire to be rich?

"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition." 1 Tim.
6:9.

**Answer:** The danger lies not just in _being_ rich, but in the _will_
(determination) to be rich.

- **The Snare:** The pursuit of wealth often requires small compromises—a little
  dishonesty here, a little Sabbath-breaking there, a neglect of family or
  prayer. These are the snares of Satan.
- **Destruction:** The imagery is of a man drowning. He thinks he is swimming in
  luxury, but the weight of his cares and lusts pulls him under.
- **The Remedy:** "But godliness with contentment is great gain" (1 Timothy
  6:6). The only safety is to seek first the Kingdom of God (Matthew 6:33).

---

### Q11. Will covetousness be one of the specially prevalent sins of the last days?

"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall
be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers." 2 Tim.
3:1, 2.

**Answer:** Yes. Paul lists "lovers of their own selves" and "covetous" at the
very top of the list of last-day sins.

- **The Laodicean Condition:** The prophecy for the church of the last days
  (Laodicea) describes a people who say, "I am rich, and increased with goods,
  and have need of nothing" (Revelation 3:17). This spiritual pride and
  materialism blind them to their true nakedness.
- **The Call:** We are living in these perilous times. The culture of
  consumerism promotes covetousness as a virtue. God calls His remnant people to
  come out of Babylon—not just physically, but to come out of her spirit of
  greed.

---

### Q12. What will these selfish ones be doing for themselves?

"Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness
against you, and shall eat your flesh as It were fire. Ye have heaped treasure
together for the last days." James 5:3.

**Answer:** James gives a fearful description of the judgment upon those who
hoarded wealth while the world perished.

- **Cankered Gold:** Gold does not rust physically, but unused wealth "rusts"
  spiritually. The money that should have been used to feed the hungry and
  spread the gospel becomes a witness against the hoarder in the judgment.
- **Witness Against You:** In the Investigative Judgment, the books of record
  show the means God entrusted to us. If those means are found heaped up in
  "last days" hoards while God's cause suffered, that record testifies to our
  selfishness.
- **Heaping Treasure:** There is a terrible irony here. Men heap up treasure to
  feel safe in the last days, but that very treasure becomes the fuel for their
  destruction.

---

### Q13. What admonition does the apostle give to the rich?

"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor
trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all
things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
distribute, willing to communicate." 1 Tim. 6:17, 18.

**Answer:** Paul does not command the rich to throw their money away, but to
change their relationship to it.

- **Trust:** Do not trust in the gift; trust in the Giver.
- **Action:** Be "ready to distribute, willing to communicate" (share).
- **The Antidote:** The only cure for covetousness is active benevolence. By
  constantly giving, we break the hold of selfishness on our hearts. This is
  practical Righteousness by Faith—Christ's love flowing through the believer to
  the world.

**[ILL] The Flowing Stream:** Water that flows rapidly remains clear and pure.
Water that stops flowing becomes a swamp. To keep the heart pure, the stream of
benevolence must be kept flowing. We give, not to buy heaven, but because Christ
is in us, and His nature is to give.

---

### Q14. What does the Lord say of giving?

"I have showed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought to support the
weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is more
blessed to give than to receive." Acts 20:35 (Prov. 11:24, 25).

**Answer:** This saying of Jesus, preserved by Paul, reveals the fundamental law
of the universe.

- **The Law of Life:** God gives to all life and breath. The sun gives light;
  the clouds give rain; the plants give fruit. Only the selfish heart of fallen
  man seeks to "get."
- **The Blessing:** There is a joy in self-forgetful giving that the covetous
  man never knows. It is the joy of being like Jesus.
- **Sanctuary Reflection:** The Cross is the supreme example of "more blessed to
  give." Christ gave Himself for us. When we give, we enter into fellowship with
  His sufferings and His love.

---

### Q15. To whom does the money we have belong?

"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts." Haggai 2:8.

**Answer:** This is the foundational truth of stewardship.

- **God's Ownership:** We created nothing. We own nothing. Even the power to get
  wealth comes from God (Deuteronomy 8:18).
- **Our Role:** We are managers, or stewards.
- **Stewardship Defined:** **Stewardship** is the responsible management of
  resources that belong to someone else.
- **Practical Application:** When we return tithe and give offerings, we are
  acknowledging God's sovereignty. When we withhold, we are effectively stealing
  from God (Malachi 3:8).

---

### Q16. Men are simply stewards of God's treasures. (Luke 16:1-8). As such, what does the Lord admonish us to do?

"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting
habitations." Luke 16:9. "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister
the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God." 1 Peter
4:10.

**Answer:** Jesus advises us to use "mammon" (worldly wealth) to make "friends"
for eternity.

- **Investing in Souls:** How do we make friends for eternity? By using our
  means to spread the gospel. When money is used to print Bibles, support
  missionaries, or build churches, souls are won to Christ.
- **The Welcome:** When "ye fail" (when you die, or when the world ends), those
  souls who were saved through your sacrifice will welcome you into heaven.
- **Manifold Grace:** Peter reminds us that our gifts vary, but the principle is
  the same. Whether we have money, talent, or time, we are to "minister" it to
  others, acting as channels of God's grace.

---

### Q17. How does God regard the spirit of sacrifice?

"I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you,
an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God. But my
God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ
Jesus." Phil. 4:18, 19.

**Answer:** Paul uses sanctuary language here. The gift sent by the Philippians
is called "an odor of a sweet smell."

- **Worship:** In the Old Testament, the smoke of the sacrifice ascended to God.
  Today, acts of self-denial and generosity are viewed by Heaven as acts of
  worship.
- **The Promise:** Verse 19 ("God shall supply all your need") is often quoted,
  but it is conditional. It is a promise specifically made to those who have
  sacrificed to support God’s work (v. 18). When we take care of God's business,
  He takes care of ours.

---

### Q18. Whom will Christ gather to Himself when He comes?

"He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that He may judge
His people. Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant
with Me by sacrifice." Ps. 50:4, 5.

**Answer:** The gathering of the saints at the Second Coming is based on a
covenant relationship.

- **Covenant by Sacrifice:** The "Covenant" was ratified by the sacrifice of
  Jesus Christ. We enter into that covenant by accepting His sacrifice, but also
  by surrendering ourselves—becoming "living sacrifices" (Romans 12:1).
- **Total Surrender:** There is no Christianity without sacrifice. The believer
  sacrifices his sins, his pride, and his covetousness. He lays all on the
  altar.
- **The Final Test:** In the last days, as the beast power imposes economic
  sanctions (no buying or selling - Revelation 13:17), only those who have cut
  their dependence on worldly treasure and made a "covenant by sacrifice" will
  be able to stand.

---

### Q19. Heaven gave its choicest Treasure to redeem us. (1 Peter 1:18, 19). Will we not partake of the same spirit, if we are God's children?

"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so
be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together." Rom. 8:17.

**Answer:** The plan of salvation is a plan of giving. God gave His Son; the Son
gave His life; the Spirit gives His power.

- **Joint Heirs:** To be a joint heir with Christ means we share His
  inheritance, but we must also share His spirit. We cannot possess the
  character of Christ while retaining the spirit of the world.
- **Suffering with Him:** This includes the suffering of self-denial. It means
  saying "no" to selfish desires so that we can say "yes" to the needs of
  others.
- **Victory:** By the grace of God, the covetous heart can be changed. When we
  look at the Cross, the things of earth grow strangely dim. The love of Christ
  constrains us (2 Corinthians 5:14), making sacrifice a joy rather than a
  burden. This is the triumph of Righteousness by Faith—Christ living His
  self-sacrificing life in us.
