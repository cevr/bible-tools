## Slide 1 – Q1: Christ’s Sinlessness
- **Question:** What testimony is borne concerning Christ's life on earth?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 2:22 – “Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Defining Sin and Guile
- **The Definition of Sin:**
  - Scripture defines sin as “the transgression of the law” (1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”).
  - Christ lived in perfect harmony with the Ten Commandments, in letter and spirit.
- **Freedom from Guile:**
  - “Guile” refers to deceit or hypocrisy.
  - Jesus was transparent and honest; His outward life perfectly matched His inner purity.

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Sanctuary and Righteousness by Faith
- **The Sanctuary Type:**
  - In the Old Testament sanctuary, the sacrificial lamb had to be “without blemish” (Leviticus 4:32).
  - Christ, the Antitype, had to be morally perfect to offer Himself as a sacrifice for the world.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Because Christ lived a sinless life, He has perfect righteousness to offer us.
  - **Justification:** God accepts Christ’s perfect life as if it were our own (2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”).
  - **Sanctification:** By the Holy Spirit, He imparts His sinless life to us, empowering us to overcome (Revelation 3:21).

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Perfect Mold:**
  - Imagine a potter trying to cast a vase. If the mold is cracked, every vase produced will be flawed.
  - Adam, the first mold of humanity, was "cracked" by sin; we are all born with that flaw.
  - Christ came as the "Second Adam" (1 Corinthians 15:45)—a new, perfect mold without a single crack of sin.
  - By faith, we are "remolded" into His image.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Human Condition
- **Question:** What is true of all other members of the human family?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Doctrinal Points
- **Universal Need:**
  - Except for Christ, every human being has fallen into rebellion against God.
  - We are born separated from God with a nature prone to selfishness (Psalm 51:5 – “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.”).
- **Falling Short of Glory:**
  - The “glory of God” refers to His character (Exodus 34:6–7).
  - The Law is a transcript of that character; to fail the Law is to fall short of God’s glory.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Since *all* have sinned, no human can redeem another.
  - We are bankrupt debtors in need of a Savior who stands outside the circle of condemnation.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Archer:**
  - The New Testament word for sin (*hamartia*) often means "missing the mark."
  - Imagine archers trying to hit a target representing God's perfect Law.
  - Some may shoot further than others (moral people vs. criminals), but *all* fall short of the target.
  - An arrow one inch short is just as useless as one ten yards short. Only Christ hit the bullseye for us.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Christ’s Challenge
- **Question:** With what question did Christ challenge His enemies?
- **Key Text:** John 8:46 – “Which of you convinceth Me of sin?”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Significance of the Challenge
- **Public Scrutiny:**
  - Jesus lived openly before Pharisees, Sadducees, and the common people.
  - His enemies were desperate to condemn Him but could not name a single sin.
- **Testimony of Enemies:**
  - **Judas:** “I have betrayed the innocent blood” (Matthew 27:4).
  - **Pilate:** “I find in him no fault at all” (John 18:38).
- **The Foundation of Faith:**
  - If Jesus had sinned once, He would have needed a Savior Himself.
  - His unanswered challenge proves He is the qualified Redeemer.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Diamond:**
  - If you claim to have a flawless diamond, you are not afraid to hand it to a jeweler with a magnifying glass.
  - Jesus offered His life to the "magnifying glass" of His critics.
  - They looked for flaws—pride, selfishness, impatience—but found only the pure light of God’s love.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Reality of Temptation
- **Question:** To what extent was Christ tempted?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 4:15 – “[He] was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Categories of Temptation
- **Reality of the Struggle:**
  - Christ felt the pull of hunger, rejection, and the pressure to use divine power for self.
- **"In All Points":**
  - He faced every *category* of temptation mentioned in 1 John 2:16:
    - The lust of the flesh (appetite/passion).
    - The lust of the eyes (presumption/vanity).
    - The pride of life (love of power).
- **Temptation vs. Sin:**
  - Temptation is not sin; sin is the will consenting to temptation (James 1:15). Jesus never consented.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Application and Hope
- **Sympathetic High Priest:**
  - Because He conquered temptation in human flesh, He can give us victory.
  - He knows our weaknesses but offers His strength.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - As our High Priest, He understands the struggle of the people He represents.

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Fortress:**
  - A fortress that surrenders at the first shot never knows the full pressure of a siege.
  - Only a fortress that is attacked with full force and *never surrenders* knows the true weight of the battle.
  - We often give in early; Christ bore the full pressure of every temptation and never broke.

## Slide 15 – Q5: The Incarnation
- **Question:** In His humanity, of what nature did Christ partake?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:14 – “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Destroying the Power of Death
- **Partaking of the Same:**
  - Christ took the "same" flesh and blood as the children (us).
  - He entered the human family with its hereditary weaknesses, yet did not sin.
- **Defeating the Enemy:**
  - Satan claimed God’s law could not be kept by humans.
  - Jesus proved him a liar by living a perfect life in human flesh.
- **Method of Victory:**
  - Christ conquered not by using divine omnipotence to blast Satan away, but by using human weapons: faith, the Word, and prayer.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Rescue Swimmer:**
  - To save a drowning man, a lifeguard cannot stay dry on the boat.
  - He must dive into the same cold, dark water the victim is in and feel the same currents.
  - Jesus dove into the deep waters of our humanity to pull us out; He took our nature to take our place.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Sharing Our Humanity
- **Question:** How fully did Christ share our common humanity?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:17 – “Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Our Faithful High Priest
- **"Like Unto His Brethren":**
  - Jesus is not ashamed to call us brethren (Hebrews 2:11).
  - He accepted human limitations: fatigue, thirst, hunger, and sorrow.
- **Sanctuary Ministry:**
  - To be a faithful High Priest, He must understand those He represents.
  - Because He walked in our shoes, He pleads for us with perfect empathy.
- **Reconciliation:**
  - He bridges the gap between a holy God and sinful man because He is *both*.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Victory in the Flesh
- **Question:** Where did God, in Christ, condemn sin, and gain the victory for us over temptation and sin?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:3 – “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Condemning Sin
- **Weakness of the Law:**
  - The Law acts as a mirror; it reveals dirt but cannot wash it off.
  - Our flesh is weak and cannot submit to the law without divine aid (Romans 8:7).
- **Likeness of Sinful Flesh:**
  - Christ took our nature and entered the enemy's territory.
- **The Victory:**
  - He condemned sin *in the flesh*—on our turf.
  - He proved that humanity, united with Divinity, can keep God’s law.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Fulfilling the Law:**
  - Because Christ defeated sin in the flesh, the "righteousness of the law" can be fulfilled in us (Romans 8:4).
  - We walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
- **Assurance:**
  - Sin is not a necessity of human nature; Christ has broken its power.

## Slide 23 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Invader:**
  - Imagine a deadly virus (sin) infects a city.
  - A great physician (Christ) enters the city, exposing himself to the infection.
  - His immune system destroys the virus *within his own body*.
  - He now offers those antibodies (Grace/Spirit) to everyone in the city. He conquered the virus from the inside.

## Slide 24 – Q8: The Source of Power
- **Question:** By whose power did Christ live the perfect life?
- **Key Texts:**
  - John 5:30 – “I can of Mine own self do nothing.”
  - John 14:10 – “The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself: but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doth the works.”

## Slide 25 – Q8: Dependence vs. Independence
- **Dependence on the Father:**
  - Though fully God, Christ laid aside the independent use of His divinity (Philippians 2:5–7).
  - He lived as a man, totally dependent on the Father for wisdom and strength.
- **The Channel of Power:**
  - Christ was the vessel; the Father was the source.
  - He maintained connection through prayer and the Word.

## Slide 26 – Q8: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Our Example:**
  - We are not called to overcome by our own willpower.
  - We must depend on Christ just as He depended on the Father.
  - John 15:5 – “Without Me ye can do nothing.”
  - Philippians 4:13 – “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.”

## Slide 27 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Glove:**
  - A glove is lifeless on its own; it cannot turn a page or do work.
  - When a living hand fills the glove, it becomes powerful.
  - Jesus allowed the Father to "fill the glove" perfectly.
  - Now, He asks us to be the glove and let *Him* be the hand living in us.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Unselfish Purpose
- **Question:** What unselfish purpose did Jesus ever have before Him?
- **Key Text:** John 6:38 – “For I came down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me.”

## Slide 29 – Q9: Surrender of the Will
- **The Battle of the Will:**
  - Sin is selfishness ("my will"); Righteousness is love ("Thy will").
  - Christ submitted fully: “Not my will, but thine, be done” (Luke 22:42).
- **Service to Others:**
  - Jesus lived entirely for others: “Even Christ pleased not Himself” (Romans 15:3).
- **Sanctification:**
  - True conversion is surrendering the will.
  - When we ask, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (Acts 9:6), we begin to walk in His steps.

## Slide 30 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Ambassador:**
  - An ambassador in a foreign land does not speak his own opinions.
  - He speaks only what his King tells him to speak.
  - Jesus was the faithful Ambassador of Heaven, perfectly representing the Father's character to a lost world.
