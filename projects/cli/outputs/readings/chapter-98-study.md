### Q1. Who should be subject to civil government?
**“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God." Romans 13:1.**

**Answer:**
The Bible teaches that the Christian is not an anarchist but a model citizen. God is a God of order (1 Corinthians 14:33), and civil government is His appointed agency to maintain order in a sinful world.

*   **The Extent of Submission:** The command applies to "every soul." No Christian is exempt from the laws of the land simply because they are citizens of heaven (Philippians 3:20).
*   **The Source of Authority:** All authority originates with God. He permits kings to rise and fall (Daniel 2:21) to serve His purpose in the Great Controversy.
*   **The Believer’s Attitude:** We submit not merely to avoid punishment, but out of conscience, recognizing that chaos and lawlessness are contrary to the character of God.

**Definition:**
*   **Civil Government:** The system of earthly rule established to regulate the relationships between people (the "second table" of the Ten Commandments) and to maintain civil order.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a busy intersection. Without traffic lights or rules, there is chaos, injury, and blockage. The traffic authority exists to keep traffic moving and people safe. Even if the driver is a holy person, they must stop at the red light. The civil law protects the community.

### Q2. By whom are the powers ordained?
**“The powers that be are ordained of God." Verse 1.**

**Answer:**
While God does not necessarily approve of the *character* of every ruler (for many have been wicked), He ordains the *office* of government itself.

*   **Sovereignty of God:** God is the supreme Ruler of the universe. He delegates authority to human governments to prevent the world from becoming a hell on earth through unchecked crime.
*   **God's Hand in History:** Even under heathen kings like Nebuchadnezzar or Cyrus, God called them His "servants" or "shepherds" insofar as they executed His will in history (Jeremiah 27:6; Isaiah 44:28).

**Definition:**
*   **Ordained:** Appointed, established, or ordered by a superior authority. In this context, it means government is God's idea, not Satan's.

***

### Q3. What does one resist who resists just civil authority?
**“Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation." Verse 2.**

**Answer:**
When a civil government enacts laws that protect life, property, and justice (laws that do not contradict God's law), disobeying them is an act of rebellion against God Himself.

*   **The Principle of Law:** God’s kingdom is founded on law. To habitually break just civil laws (like stealing, speeding, or tax evasion) reveals a heart that is not submissive to the principle of lawfulness.
*   **Righteousness by Faith Application:** A Christian who has the law of God written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10) will naturally be the most law-abiding citizen in the nation regarding civil duties. We cannot claim to be led by the Spirit while willfully violating the laws of the land that protect our neighbors.

**[ILL]**
A father tells his child to obey the babysitter while he is away. If the child kicks and bites the babysitter, the child is actually disobeying the father. Similarly, when we disregard just civil laws, we disrespect the God who established civil order.

***

### Q4. What are the proper sphere and work of civil authorities?
**“For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil... If thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil." Verses 3-4.**

**Answer:**
The Bible clearly delineates the jurisdiction of the state. It is to regulate "works" (actions), specifically focusing on the relationship between man and man.

*   **To Protect Rights:** The magistrate bears the sword to punish those who violate the rights of others (thieves, murderers, attackers).
*   **Not to Regulate Conscience:** The ruler judges "evil works," not thoughts or religious convictions. The sword cannot change the heart; only the Spirit of God can do that (Zechariah 4:6).
*   **A Minister of Justice:** In the civil sphere, the judge acts as God's agent to execute immediate consequences for crime, foreshadowing the final judgment.

**Definition:**
*   **The Sword:** A symbol of the power to punish, coerce, or enforce law, including capital punishment. In the Bible, force is allowed for civil governments to keep the peace, but never to the church to spread the Gospel (Matthew 26:52).

***

### Q5. Who is it that receives the enforcement of law?
**“Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient ." 1 Timothy 1:9.**

**Answer:**
This is a profound truth regarding **Righteousness by Faith**. External force is only necessary for those who lack internal control.

*   **The Righteous Man:** A person justified by faith and indwelt by Christ does not need the threat of jail to keep him from murdering or stealing. He is constrained by the love of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:14).
*   **The Lawless:** Those who reject God's grace need the "bit and bridle" of civil law to restrain their selfish impulses.
*   **Internal vs. External:** The Gospel implants a new nature (Ezekiel 36:26). If everyone were truly converted, civil police would have little work to do.

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit imparts the character of Christ to the believer, so that they obey God's law out of love rather than fear.

**[ILL]**
A man who deeply loves his wife does not need a law saying, "Do not hit your wife." His love is a higher law that prevents him from hurting her. The law against assault is made for the man who has no love in his heart.

***

### Q6. How should Christians respect civil authority?
**“Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work." Titus 3:1. "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well... Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king." 1 Peter 2: 13-17. "For this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour." Romans 13:6, 7.**

**Answer:**
Christians are to be exemplary in their duties to the state, showing that the Gospel makes us better citizens, not rebels.

*   **Paying Taxes:** We pay "tribute" (taxes) honestly. This supports the infrastructure and protection the government provides.
*   **Honor and Respect:** Even if a ruler is personally flawed, we respect the office they hold. We avoid slander and sedition.
*   **For the Lord's Sake:** Our submission is an act of worship to God. By being good citizens, we "adorn the doctrine of God our Savior" (Titus 2:10) and silence the ignorance of foolish men.

***

### Q7. In what words does Christ reveal that there are two spheres of authority: one that belongs to earthly governments, and another, higher one, that belongs to God alone?
**“Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." Matthew 22:21.**

**Answer:**
Here Jesus establishes the foundational principle of the **Separation of Church and State**.

*   **Caesar's Realm:** Money (bearing his image), civil obedience, taxes, and respect for civil order.
*   **God's Realm:** The conscience, the soul (bearing God's image), worship, and religious faith.
*   **The Boundary:** Caesar has no right to demand what belongs to God (our worship). God does not ask Caesar to enforce religion. When Caesar crosses this line, he usurps the throne of God.

**[ILL]**
A coin bears the image of the Emperor; it belongs to the state. A human being bears the image of God (Genesis 1:27); they belong to the Creator. We pay the coin to the state, but we give ourselves only to God.

***

### Q8. To whom alone did Jesus say that worship can and must be given to?
**“Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve." Matthew 4:10.**

**Answer:**
Worship is an exclusive relationship between the created being and the Creator.

*   **The First Table:** The first four commandments of the Decalogue deal with our duty to God. No human government has the authority to legislate these (determining who, when, or how we worship).
*   **Satan's Ambition:** The context of this verse is Satan wanting Jesus to bow to him. Throughout the Great Controversy, the enemy tries to force worship through civil powers (Revelation 13:15), but true worship must be free and voluntary.

***

### Q9. What decree did King Nebuchadnezzar once make to all the citizens of his empire?
**“That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace." Daniel 3:5, 6.**

**Answer:**
This historical event illustrates the abuse of civil power. The king united **State Power** (the furnace) with **Religious Observance** (worshiping the image).

*   **Uniformity:** The king sought to unify his empire through a common religion.
*   **Coercion:** He used the threat of death to enforce a religious act. This is the spirit of the Antichrist, not the Spirit of Christ.

***

### Q10. What answer did the three faithful Hebrew captives give?
**"O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us... But if not... we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up." Verses 16-18.**

**Answer:**
This is one of the noblest examples of loyalty to God in the Bible.

*   **Polite but Firm:** They did not revile the king, but they flatly refused to disobey the Second Commandment (Exodus 20:4-5).
*   **Faith over Feeling:** They did not know if God *would* save them physically, but they knew He was *able*. Their loyalty was not based on escaping pain, but on doing right.
*   **Civil Disobedience:** When the law of the land conflicts with the Law of God, the Christian must peacefully disobey the land to obey the Lord.

***

### Q11. What did Nebuchadnezzar then do?
**“He commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace." Verse 20.**

**Answer:**
Persecution is the inevitable result when the state attempts to enforce religion. The "wrath of the dragon" (Revelation 12:17) is manifested through the civil arm against those who keep the commandments of God.

***

### Q12. After their miraculous deliverance, what did Nebuchadnezzar then declare to everyone?
**“Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God." Verse 28.**

**Answer:**
God vindicated His servants. By "changing the king's word" (overruling his decree), God demonstrated that He is the High King above all earthly potentates.

*   **The Fourth Man:** Jesus (the Son of God) walked with them in the fire (Verse 25). He does not always save us *from* trouble, but He promises to be with us *in* trouble (Isaiah 43:2).

***

### Q13. In what way alone were the envious leaders of Medo-Persia able to complain about Daniel?
**“We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God." Daniel 6:5.**

**Answer:**
Daniel was "faultless" in his civil duties (Verse 4). He was not corrupt, lazy, or rebellious. The only way to entrap him was to create a conflict between his civil duty and his religious duty. This testifies to his life of **Sanctification**—his character was blameless before men.

***

### Q14. What religious law did they succeed in urging the king to enact?
**“That whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, a king, he shall be cast into the den of lions." Verse 7.**

**Answer:**
This was a statute regulating prayer—a purely religious exercise. It placed the king in the place of God (a type of the "man of sin" in 2 Thessalonians 2).

***

### Q15. Did Daniel obey this new governmental edict?
**“He went into his house, and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did a foretime." Verse 10.**

**Answer:**
Daniel did not hide his faith, nor did he flaunt it aggressively. He simply continued his habit of communion with God.

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** He prayed toward Jerusalem, where the temple (sanctuary) had been. This showed his faith in the sacrifices and the mediation that the temple represented (1 Kings 8:29-30).
*   **Consistency:** He did "as he did aforetime." His faith was a daily lifestyle, not a crisis reaction.

***

### Q16. What was done to Daniel for disobeying it?
**“Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions." Verse 16.**

**Answer:**
Again, the penalty for violating a religious law enforced by the state was death. Satan hates prayer because it connects the soul to the Source of power.

***

### Q17. What did Darius say when Daniel was taken out of the lions' den?
**"O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?" Verse 20.**

**Answer:**
Even the heathen king recognized that Daniel served God "continually." A life of constant connection with Christ is the only preparation for the time of trouble.

***

### Q18. What was Daniel's reply to the king?
**"O king, live for ever, My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before Him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt." Verses 21-2.**

**Answer:**
Daniel affirms two innocencies:
1.  **Before God:** He was faithful to the divine law.
2.  **Before the King:** Even though he disobeyed the decree, he had "done no hurt" to the king or the state. Practicing true religion is never an actual threat to the stability of a government.

***

### Q19. What parting command did Christ give to His disciples?
**“Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." Mark 16:15.**

**Answer:**
The "Great Commission" is the marching order of the church. It is a command from the King of Kings. No earthly stop sign can invalidate this divine green light.

***

### Q20. What counter command did the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem soon give them?
**“And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus." Acts 4:18.**

**Answer:**
Here is a direct conflict: God says "Go and speak"; the authorities say "Stop speaking." The authorities were religious leaders utilizing civil power (the temple guard and Sanhedrin) to silence truth.

***

### Q21. What reply did Peter and John give to these authorities?
**“Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard." Verses 19-20.**

**Answer:**
They appealed to the logic of the authorities: Is a lower officer obeyed above a superior general?
*   **Constraint of Love:** "We cannot but speak." When Christ is in the heart, the testimony flows out. It is not merely a duty, but a result of a transformed life.

***

### Q22. For continuing to preach the Word of God, after being forbidden to do so, what was the result?
**“Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees) and were filled with indignation, and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison." Acts 5:17, 18.**

**Answer:**
The attempt to suppress the truth by force is a sign of spiritual weakness. Truth relies on the power of the Holy Spirit and the Word; error relies on indignation and prisons.

***

### Q23. Did God then reveal Himself to be on the side of governmental authorities when they did wrong?
**“But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life." Verses 19-20.**

**Answer:**
God voted against the Sanhedrin. By miraculously releasing the apostles, God demonstrated that civil authority has no jurisdiction over the preaching of the Gospel. The command was renewed: "Go, stand and speak."

***

### Q24. When the apostles were called before the council again, what question did the high priest ask them?
**“Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us." Verse 28.**

**Answer:**
The authorities were concerned with their own reputation ("bring this man's blood upon us") and their authority ("did not we command you?"). They were fighting to preserve their power, while the apostles were fighting to save souls.

***

### Q25. What reply did the apostles make to the authorities?
**“We ought to obey God rather than men." Verse 29.**

**Answer:**
This is the Christian's "Declaration of Independence" regarding conscience.
*   **The Rule:** When man's law and God's law agree, we obey both. When they disagree, God's law is supreme.
*   **The Conscience:** Conscience is the voice of God in the soul. To violate it is to commit spiritual suicide.

**Definition:**
*   **Liberty of Conscience:** The freedom to believe and practice one's religion according to the dictates of one's own heart, without interference from the state, as long as the rights of others are not violated.

***

### Q26. Who is higher than the "higher powers" of this earth?
**“If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a provine, marvel not at the matter: for He that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they." Ecclesiastes 5:8.**

**Answer:**
There is a Supreme Court in heaven.
*   **The Investigative Judgment:** Every ruler, president, and king will stand before the judgment seat of Christ. Their secret acts of oppression are recorded in the books of heaven.
*   **Hope for the Oppressed:** When justice is denied on earth, the believer looks to the heavenly sanctuary where Christ ministers true justice.

***

### Q27. Because Mordecai refused to bow down before Haman, a leading official of Medo-Persia, what emperial decree did Haman succeed in enacting?
**“And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey." Esther 3:13.**

**Answer:**
This foreshadows the final conflict in the Great Controversy.
*   **The Issue:** A refusal to give divine honor to a man (Mordecai would not bow).
*   **The Decree:** A universal death decree against God's people (Revelation 13:15).
*   **The Spirit:** Satan seeks to wipe out the people who keep the commandments of God.

***

### Q28. What is religion?
**“The recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and obedience." Webster. Other definitions equally good are: "The duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it." "Man's personal relation of faith and obedience to God."**

**Answer:**
True religion is a matter of the heart (the New Covenant—Jeremiah 31:33). It cannot be legislated, forced, or proxied. It is the vertical relationship between the soul and its Maker. Because it is a "duty to the Creator," no creature (government) has the right to interfere with it.

***

### Q29. In religious things, whom alone dare we call "Father”?
**“And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven." Matthew 23:9.**

**Answer:**
In the spiritual sense, we have no earthly superior who can dictate our faith. We are all brethren. To give a religious leader the title or authority of "Father" (in the sense of spiritual infallibility or control) is to usurp the place of God.

***

### Q30. When tempted to bow down before Satan, what reply did Christ make?
**“Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve." Matthew 4:10. (See Deuteronomy 6:13; 10:30.)**

**Answer:**
Jesus used the Sword of the Spirit (the Word of God) to define the boundaries of worship. Worship belongs to God *only*. Any power—whether civil or ecclesiastical—that demands worship is acting as an agent of Satan.

***

### Q31. To whom alone, then, is each one accountable in religion?
**“So then everyone ofus shall give account of himself to God." Romans 14:12.**

**Answer:**
Individual accountability is a pillar of truth.
*   **No Proxies:** A priest cannot answer for you; a king cannot answer for you; a pastor cannot answer for you.
*   **The Judgment:** Since you alone must answer to God in the judgment for your religious life, you alone must have the freedom to decide how to worship Him.

***

### Q32. What do those do, therefore, who make men accountable to them in matters of religion?
**They put themselves in the place of God. (See 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4.)**

**Answer:**
This is the definition of the "Anti-Christ" spirit—placing man in the temple of God. Any system that inserts a human priesthood or civil magistrate between the soul and God denies the sole priesthood of Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5).

***

### Q33. Why is it, that in areas of religion, Christ declared that men must not be called masters?
**“Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ." Matthew 23:10.**

**Answer:**
In the church, there is no hierarchy of lordship. Christ is the Head; we are the body.
*   **Equality:** We are all sinners saved by grace. No believer has the spiritual authority to force the conscience of another believer.
*   **RBF:** Our righteousness comes from Christ, not from adherence to human leaders.

***

### Q34. To whom, then, as servants of God, are we responsible in matters of faith and worship?
**“Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth." Romans 14:4.**

**Answer:**
Just as a neighbor has no right to come into your house and fire your gardener, no human has the right to judge God's servant in matters of conscience. God is the Master; He alone determines if the servant stands or falls. And the promise is, "he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand."

***

### Q35. Whose servants are we not to be?
**"Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men." 1 Corinthians 7:23.**

**Answer:**
*   **The Price:** We were purchased with the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19).
*   **The Ownership:** We belong to Jesus. If we allow men to dictate our religion contrary to the Bible, we are robbing Christ of His property. We must be free in Christ, not enslaved to human tradition or civil decrees.

***

### Q36. Where must all men finally appear to render account of their lives and actions?
**“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad." 2 Corinthians 5:10.**

**Answer:**
The final argument for religious liberty is the Final Judgment.
*   **The Scene:** The books are opened. The Investigative Judgment reviews every life.
*   **The Conclusion:** Since God holds every individual personally responsible for their decisions, every individual must have the liberty to make those decisions.
*   **The Gospel:** In that day, only the righteousness of Christ—imputed to us by faith and imparted to us by His Spirit—will stand. No civil law or human decree can save us. Therefore, we must follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth (Revelation 14:4).

**[ILL]**
If a student is taking a final exam, the teacher does not allow anyone else to hold the pen or whisper the answers. The student passes or fails on their own work. Life is the testing time; the Judgment is the exam. We must be free to write our own answers in the book of life.
