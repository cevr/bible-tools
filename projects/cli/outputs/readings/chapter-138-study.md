### Q1. By nature, what is the condition of all men?

**“For all men have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” Romans 3:23.
Read also verses 10-12.**

**Answer:** According to the Scriptures, the natural condition of humanity is
one of total bankruptcy in spiritual matters. Paul emphasizes that "there is
none righteous, no, not one" (Romans 3:10).

- **The Definition of Sin:** Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4).
  Because all have broken God’s moral law, all stand guilty before the judgment
  bar of God.
- **Falling Short of Glory:** The "glory of God" represents His character, which
  is defined by goodness, mercy, and truth (Exodus 33:18–19; 34:6–7). To "come
  short" means that in our natural, fallen state, we fail to reflect the image
  of God in which we were originally created.
- **The Universal Need:** This text establishes the foundation for the
  **Gospel**. Unless a man realizes he is sick, he will not seek a physician
  (Matthew 9:12). We must acknowledge our lost condition to appreciate the need
  for a Savior.

**[ILL] The Broken Mirror:** Imagine a mirror designed to reflect the sun
perfectly. If that mirror is shattered into a thousand pieces, it can no longer
reflect the perfect image of the sun; it only reflects broken, distorted
fragments. Humanity was made to reflect God’s character. Sin shattered that
image. No matter how much we polish the shards (human effort), we cannot restore
the reflection. We need a new mirror—a new nature.

### Q2. How may one's nature be changed?

**“Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature; old things are passed
away; behold, all things are become new.” 2 Corinthians 5:17.**

**Answer:** The change required is not merely an improvement of the old life,
but a creation of a completely new one. This is the experience of the "new
birth" (John 3:3–5).

- **In Christ:** This phrase signifies a vital, spiritual union. Just as a
  branch is grafted into a vine (John 15:5), the believer is united with Christ
  by faith.
- **A New Creation:** The Greek implies a "new species" or "new creation." God,
  who spoke light into existence, speaks spiritual life into the dead soul
  (Ephesians 2:1).
- **The Transformation:**
  - **Old things pass away:** The love of sin, worldly ambition, and selfishness
    are displaced.
  - **All things become new:** New motives, new tastes, and a new love for God’s
    law take their place.
- **Regeneration:** _The spiritual work of God by which a new nature is
  implanted in the believer._ This is the beginning of the path to perfection of
  character.

### Q3. What is it to be in Christ?

**“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who
walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” Romans 8:1.**

**Answer:** To be "in Christ" is to have both a new standing and a new walk.

1.  **No Condemnation (Justification):**
    - **Justification:** _The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner
      is righteous, based solely on the merits of Jesus Christ._
    - Because Jesus paid the penalty for sin on the cross (Isaiah 53:5), the law
      no longer condemns the one who hides in Christ.
2.  **Walking after the Spirit (Sanctification):**
    - **Sanctification:** _The ongoing process of being made holy by the power
      of the Holy Spirit._
    - The evidence that one is "in Christ" is that they no longer follow the
      dictates of the fallen nature ("the flesh") but follow the leading of the
      Holy Spirit.
    - This verse links **pardon** (no condemnation) with **power** (walking in
      the Spirit). God never justifies a soul without also beginning the work of
      sanctifying them.

**[ILL] The Lifeboat:** A sailor drowning in the ocean is "condemned" to death
by the water. If he is pulled into a lifeboat, he is "in the boat." He is no
longer condemned to drown (change of status), but he must also remain in the
boat and live by the rules of the captain (change of walk). To jump back into
the water is to leave the place of safety.

---

### Q4. What are the works of the flesh?

**“Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery,
fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred,
variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
drunkenness, revelings, and such like.” Galatians 5:19-21.**

**Answer:** The "works of the flesh" are the natural byproducts of the sinful
human heart when separated from God.

- **Manifest:** These sins are open and obvious. They are the breaking of the
  Ten Commandments in thought and act.
- **Categories of Sin:**
  - _Sensual sins:_ Adultery, uncleanness (violations of the 7th Commandment).
  - _Religious sins:_ Idolatry, witchcraft (violations of the 1st and 2nd
    Commandments).
  - _Interpersonal sins:_ Hatred, wrath, envy (violations of the 6th and 9th
    Commandments).
  - _Intemperance:_ Drunkenness, revelings (violations of the laws of health and
    sobriety).
- **The Warning:** Paul adds in verse 21 that "they which do such things shall
  not inherit the kingdom of God." One cannot willfully cherish these sins and
  remain a Christian. They must be overcome by the power of the Spirit.

---

### Q5. And what is the fruit of the Spirit?

**“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” Galatians 5:22, 23.**

**Answer:** In contrast to the "works" (plural, manufactured effort) of the
flesh, the Spirit produces "fruit" (singular, organic growth).

- **The Unity of the Fruit:** The singular "fruit" suggests that all these
  virtues are part of one cluster. They are all manifestations of **Love**—God's
  character.
  - _Joy_ is love exulting.
  - _Peace_ is love resting.
  - _Longsuffering_ is love enduring.
  - _Temperance_ (Self-control) is love overcoming.
- **Against Such There is No Law:** The law of God requires these very things.
  Therefore, the person filled with the Spirit is naturally fulfilling the law
  (Romans 8:4).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot manufacture this fruit by grinding our
  teeth and trying harder. Fruit only grows when the branch stays connected to
  the vine. As we abide in Christ, His life flows through us and produces this
  character naturally (John 15:4-5).

---

### Q6. How are those denominated who are led by the Spirit?

**“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”
Romans 8:14.**

**Answer:** The defining mark of a true child of God is submission to the
Spirit's leading.

- **Being Led:** This implies active following. The Spirit leads us away from
  sin and into truth (John 16:13). He leads us to the foot of the Cross and to
  obedience to God's commandments.
- **Sons, not Slaves:** In the Roman world, a son had privileges and an
  inheritance that a slave did not have. We are adopted into the heavenly
  family, becoming heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17).
- **Character Evidence:** We cannot claim to be sons of God if we are led by the
  spirit of the world (1 John 2:15).

---

### Q7. What assurance is given to the sons of God?

**“Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall
be; but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall
see Him as He is.” 1 John 3:2.**

**Answer:** This text provides assurance for the present and hope for the
future.

- **Present Reality:** "Now are we the sons of God." Even though we may still
  struggle with weakness and are not yet glorified, our standing is secure in
  Christ right now.
- **Future Transformation:** When Jesus returns, the work of restoration will be
  completed. Our vile bodies will be changed to be like His glorious body
  (Philippians 3:21).
- **Like Him:** This is the goal of the plan of salvation—to restore the image
  of God in man perfectly. To see Him "as He is" requires holiness, for "without
  holiness no man shall see the Lord" (Hebrews 12:14).

---

### Q8. If one has this hope, what will he surely do?

**“And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He
[Christ] is pure.” 1 John 3:3.**

**Answer:** The hope of the Second Coming is not a sedative; it is a powerful
stimulant to holy living.

- **Active Purification:** The text says he "purifieth himself." This does not
  mean we save ourselves, but that we actively co-operate with God's grace. We
  "cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit" (2 Corinthians
  7:1) by availing ourselves of the blood of Christ and choosing to turn from
  sin.
- **The Standard:** The standard is not the pastor, the church members, or
  society. The standard is "even as He [Christ] is pure."
- **Preparation:** In the typical sanctuary service, the people had to afflict
  their souls and cleanse themselves on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus
  16:29–30). We are living in the great anti-typical Day of Atonement. Now is
  the time to put away every known sin so we may stand when He appears.

**[ILL] The Bride's Dress:** A bride preparing for her wedding day does not roll
in the mud. Because she has the "hope" and expectation of the ceremony, she
keeps her garment spotless. The church is the Bride of Christ, preparing for the
marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7–8).

---

### Q9. Is the doctrine of perfection taught in the Bible?

**“But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
wanting [lacking] nothing.” James 1:4.**

**Answer:** Yes, the Bible teaches a doctrine of Christian perfection.

- **Definition of Perfection:** In the Bible, "perfection" often means
  _maturity_ or _completeness_. It does not mean we will not make mistakes in
  judgment or knowledge, but that our love for God is wholehearted and our
  surrender is complete.
- **Letting Patience Work:** Character is developed through trial. "Patience"
  here is endurance. When we endure trials without losing faith or murmuring,
  the character is refined.
- **Entire/Wanting Nothing:** God wants us to have a balanced character—not
  strong in one area and weak in another (e.g., zealous but unkind, or kind but
  compromising truth). He seeks a whole character.

---

### Q10. Is one perfected when he receives the principles of Christ?

**“Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto
perfection.” Hebrews 6:1.**

**Answer:** No, conversion is only the beginning.

- **Leaving the Principles:** This does not mean abandoning the basics
  (repentance, faith, baptism), but moving past them as a foundation to build
  the superstructure. We do not lay the foundation forever; we build upon it.
- **Go On:** The Christian life is a march, not a resting place. There is no
  neutral ground; we are either advancing toward holiness or sliding back toward
  the world.
- **Unto Perfection:** The goal is spiritual maturity—the full measure of the
  stature of Christ (Ephesians 4:13).

---

### Q11. In order to accomplish this, what must be done?

**“But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.” 2 Peter 3:18.**

**Answer:** Perfection of character is the result of continuous growth.

- **Grow in Grace:** Grace is not only unmerited favor (forgiveness) but also
  divine power (enablement). To grow in grace is to become increasingly
  dependent on Christ's power to overcome.
- **Grow in Knowledge:** This is not merely intellectual data, but relational
  knowledge. "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
  God" (John 17:3).
- **No Stagnation:** Just as a plant that stops growing begins to die, a
  Christian who stops seeking a deeper experience with Jesus begins to
  spiritually wither.

---

### Q12. How may one grow in grace?

**“And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to
virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience;
and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to
brotherly kindness, charity.” 2 Peter 1:5-7.**

**Answer:** Peter presents a "Ladder of Sanctification." We climb this ladder by
adding one virtue to another through the power of the Spirit.

1.  **Diligence:** Salvation is free, but it requires our full effort and
    attention to cooperate with God.
2.  **Faith:** The foundation.
3.  **Virtue:** Moral courage and integrity.
4.  **Knowledge:** Understanding of God's will.
5.  **Temperance:** Self-control over appetite and passion.
6.  **Patience:** Endurance under trial.
7.  **Godliness:** Reverence and piety.
8.  **Brotherly Kindness:** Love for the household of faith.
9.  **Charity (Agape):** The crowning virtue—unselfish, divine love.

- **The Result:** Verse 8 tells us that if these things abound in us, we shall
  be neither barren nor unfruitful.

---

### Q13. In requiring so much of His followers, what is the design of Christ?

**“That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or
wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.”
Ephesians 5:27.**

**Answer:** Christ’s ultimate purpose is to restore humanity to complete
holiness, vindicating God's character before the universe.

- **Without Spot:** A spot represents the defilement of sin.
- **Without Wrinkle:** A wrinkle represents signs of age or decay. The church is
  to have the vigor of eternal youth.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest
  cleansed the sanctuary of the record of sin once a year (Leviticus 16).
  Christ, our High Priest, is currently performing a work of judgment and
  cleansing in the heavenly sanctuary to prepare a people who reflect His image
  fully before He returns. He does this by the "washing of water by the word"
  (Ephesians 5:26).

---

### Q14. What will cause the Christian to grow?

**“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow
thereby.” 1 Peter 2:2.**

**Answer:** The Word of God (the Bible) is the essential nourishment for the
spiritual life.

- **Sincere Milk:** Pure, unadulterated truth. We must accept the Bible as it
  reads, not twisting it to fit our desires.
- **Desire:** A healthy baby has an intense craving for milk. If a Christian has
  no appetite for the Bible, it is a sign of spiritual sickness.
- **Grow Thereby:** We cannot grow by emotional highs or social gatherings
  alone. We grow by feeding on the promises, warnings, and instructions of
  Scripture.

---

### Q15. In order to grow by the word of God, what must one do with it?

**“Thy work have I hid in mine heart.” Psalm 119:11.**

**Answer:** Mere reading is not enough; we must internalize the Scripture.

- **Hid in the Heart:** This implies memorization and meditation. The "heart" is
  the seat of the will and affections.
- **The Purpose:** The verse concludes, "...that I might not sin against Thee."
- **The Weapon:** When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, He met every
  temptation with "It is written" (Matthew 4:4). By having the Word hidden in
  His heart, the Holy Spirit could bring it to His mind at the moment of attack.
  We must do the same.

**[ILL] The Reservoir:** If a city is besieged and the water supply is cut off,
it will surrender. But if there is a hidden reservoir inside the city walls, the
people can stand firm. Hiding God's Word in the heart creates a reservoir of
strength for times of temptation when no Bible is close at hand.

---

### Q16. And what must that word become to the heart?

**“Thy words were found, and I did eat them: and thy word was unto me the joy
and rejoicing of mine heart; for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.”
Jeremiah 15:16.**

**Answer:** The Word must become a part of our very being, bringing deep joy.

- **Eating the Word:** Just as physical food is digested and becomes flesh and
  blood, the Word of God must be assimilated by faith until it shapes our
  character. Jesus said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and
  they are life" (John 6:63).
- **Joy and Rejoicing:** Obedience to God’s Word is not a burden to the
  converted heart; it is a delight. "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea,
  thy law is within my heart" (Psalm 40:8).

---

### Q17. In building up the character, what else is necessary?

**“But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in
the Holy Ghost.” Jude 20.**

**Answer:** Prayer is the breath of the soul. Character building requires
constant communication with the Architect.

- **Building Up:** Character is not inherited; it is built, brick by brick,
  through daily decisions and habits.
- **Most Holy Faith:** Our foundation is the truth revealed in God's Word.
- **Praying in the Holy Ghost:** This refers to prayer inspired and guided by
  the Spirit. The Spirit helps our infirmities and teaches us how to pray as we
  ought (Romans 8:26). Prayer keeps the channel open between the human soul and
  God's infinite power.

---

### Q18. What advantage will prayer be to one engaged in such work?

**“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” James 1:5.**

**Answer:** Prayer supplies the wisdom necessary to navigate the battle against
self and sin.

- **We Lack Wisdom:** We often do not know how to handle specific temptations or
  difficult people. We cannot trust our own understanding (Proverbs 3:5).
- **God Gives Liberally:** God does not scold ("upbraid") us for asking; He
  delights to give wisdom to those who feel their need.
- **The Promise:** "It _shall_ be given him." We can claim this promise by faith
  when we are struggling with a defect of character.

---

### Q19. On what occasions is it proper to ask God for help?

**“Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.” Philippians 4:6.**

**Answer:** There is no time and no place where prayer is inappropriate.

- **Be Careful for Nothing:** "Careful" here means anxious or full of worry.
- **In Everything:** No problem is too small for God to notice, and no problem
  is too big for Him to solve. Whether it is a crisis or a minor daily
  irritation, we should take it to the Lord in prayer.
- **With Thanksgiving:** Gratitude opens the heart to receive more. We should
  thank God for what He has done and for what He has promised to do.

---

### Q20. If we fulfill the conditions of the Bible, how perfect may we expect God's care for us to be?

**“And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole
spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ.” 1 Thessalonians 5:23.**

**Answer:** God's plan is for the total restoration of the human being.

- **Sanctify You Wholly:** God does not do halfway work. He wants to sanctify
  the:
  - _Spirit:_ The higher powers of the mind and conscience.
  - _Soul:_ The life, emotions, and personality.
  - _Body:_ The physical vessel. This validates the health message—our physical
    habits affect our spiritual holiness.
- **Preserved Blameless:** This is the condition of the saints waiting for the
  Second Coming ("unto the coming of our Lord").
- **God's Work:** Note that _God_ is the one who sanctifies. Our job is to
  surrender, to believe, and to obey His promptings; He supplies the power to
  make us blameless. "Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it" (1
  Thessalonians 5:24).

**[ILL] The Refiner's Fire:** A silversmith keeps the silver in the fire until
the dross is burned away and he can see his own reflection in the metal. God
allows us to go through the fires of life, not to destroy us, but to burn away
the dross of sin until He can see the perfect reflection of Jesus in our
characters.
