## Slide 1 – Q1: The Condition for Guidance

- **Question:** What class of persons will the Lord direct?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 25:9 – “The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Defining Meekness & Sanctuary Light

- **Defining Meekness:**
  - Meekness is not weakness; it is "strength under control" or "mildness of temper."
  - In the biblical sense, it is the **silence of self**.
  - It is a spirit willing to submit to God’s will without arguing and endure wrong without retaliating.
- **The Condition for Guidance:**
  - God cannot guide the proud because they rely on their own wisdom (Proverbs 3:5–7 – “Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding...”).
  - To be guided in "judgment" (discerning right from wrong), we must distrust our own hearts and lean entirely upon Christ.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Just as the priest washed at the **Laver** (cleansing) before entering the Holy Place, the believer must be cleansed of intellectual pride (meekness) to receive light from the **Candlestick** (the Holy Spirit’s guidance).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Broken Horse:**
  - Imagine a horse that has not been broken in.
  - It fights the bit and bridle, refusing to turn when the rider pulls the reins. It cannot be guided.
  - Now imagine a "meek" or broken horse. It is strong, but its strength is under control.
  - It turns at the slightest touch of the master’s hand.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - God can only direct the life that has ceased fighting against His will.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Source of Meekness

- **Question:** Who could truly say he possessed this principle?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 11:29 – “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points – Christ Our Righteousness

- **Christ is the Source:**
  - Meekness is not a trait we manufacture; it is the nature of Christ.
  - When Jesus says "learn of Me," He invites us to partake of His character (Philippians 2:5–7 – “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who... made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant...”).
- **The Yoke of Union:**
  - To "take His yoke" means to unite our lives with His in service.
  - If we are yoked with Christ, we walk at His pace and go where He goes.
- **Finding Rest (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - The "rest" promised is rest from the heavy burden of self-justification and pride.
  - When we accept the "lowly" position of a learner at Jesus' feet, we stop trying to be "great" and find peace in His finished work.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Oxen in the Yoke:**
  - Two oxen in a yoke must walk together.
  - If one is much stronger, it bears the burden for the weaker one.
  - **Christ is the strong One.**
  - When we take His yoke, we are not carrying the heavy load of salvation alone.
  - We are simply walking beside Him, letting His strength and meekness carry us through.

## Slide 7 – Q3: An Example of Transformation

- **Question:** Who was the meekest man on earth before Christ came?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 12:3 – “(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points – Sanctification

- **Transformed by Grace:**
  - Moses was not meek by nature; he was impulsive and hot-tempered (killing the Egyptian in Exodus 2:11-12).
  - His meekness was the fruit of forty years of unlearning pride in the desert and learning dependence on God.
  - This proves **Sanctification** can transform a fiery temper into patience.
- **Strength Under Control:**
  - When attacked by Aaron and Miriam (Numbers 12), Moses did not defend himself.
  - True meekness allows God to be the Defender. Moses stood aside and let the Lord handle his reputation.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Typology of Christ

- **Question:** Of whom was Moses a type?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 18:18 – “I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.”
- **Secondary Text:** Acts 3:22 – “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points – Type and Antitype

- **Definition:**
  - A "type" is a symbol or shadow in the Old Testament (like Moses).
  - The "antitype" is the reality in the New Testament (Christ).
- **The Mediator:**
  - Moses pleaded for the people when they sinned (Exodus 32:30–32).
  - Christ stands in the heavenly sanctuary as our Mediator and High Priest (1 Timothy 2:5).
- **The Deliverer:**
  - Moses led Israel out of physical bondage.
  - Christ leads spiritual Israel out of the bondage of sin and condemnation (Romans 8:1–2).
- **The Law-Giver:**
  - Moses brought the law on stone; Christ writes the law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).

## Slide 11 – Q5: The Invitation

- **Question:** Whom should we follow in this?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 11:28 – “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Application – Righteousness by Faith

- **The Personal Call:**
  - We cannot learn meekness from a set of rules; we learn it by coming to a Person.
- **Rest for the Heavy Laden:**
  - "Heavy laden" refers to the burden of sin and the futile attempt to earn salvation by works.
  - Jesus offers rest as a free gift. This is the peace of **Justification** (being declared righteous by faith).
- **Cessation of Effort:**
  - This does not mean we stop working *for* God.
  - It means we stop working *for acceptance*. We rest in His finished work, and serve Him from that position of rest (Hebrews 4:9–10).

## Slide 13 – Q6: How to Receive Instruction

- **Question:** How is one to receive the instruction he needs on this point?
- **Key Text:** James 1:21 – “Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points – Repentance and Faith

- **Lay Apart (Repentance):**
  - Before we receive, we must let go.
  - "Filthiness" and "superfluity of naughtiness" must be discarded through repentance.
- **Receive with Meekness (Faith):**
  - We do not create the word; we *receive* it.
  - Meekness is the lack of resistance to God's truth. It says, "Lord, I accept Your diagnosis and Your remedy."
- **The Engrafted Word:**
  - The life of Christ must be grafted into our nature (Galatians 2:20).
  - This is **Righteousness by Faith**: An outside life coming in to bear fruit.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Illustration

- **Grafting the Tree:**
  - A gardener grafts a branch of a sweet apple tree into a sour crabapple tree.
  - The sap flows through the new branch, and the tree produces sweet apples.
  - The tree cannot change its own fruit; it must receive the graft.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - We are the sour tree; Christ is the "engrafted word."
  - We receive Him by faith, and He produces the fruit of righteousness in us.

## Slide 16 – Q7: The Method of Witnessing

- **Question:** When asked for a reason of our hope of heaven, how should we answer?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:15 – “But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points – Witnessing

- **Sanctifying the Lord:**
  - This means setting Christ apart as King in the heart. Self is dethroned.
- **With Meekness and Fear:**
  - Truth presented in a proud or argumentative manner hardens hearts.
  - The "fear" is a holy reverence for God, ensuring we do not misrepresent His character.
- **Practical Application:**
  - When sharing distinct truths (Sabbath, Second Coming), avoid a combative spirit.
  - We are not winning a debate; we are winning a soul.
  - The power of the argument lies in the spirit of the speaker as much as the text.

## Slide 18 – Q8: Meekness as Fruit

- **Question:** Of what is meekness a fruit?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:22, 23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points – Law and Gospel

- **Fruit of the Spirit:**
  - Fruit is not made by straining; it is the natural byproduct of life flowing from the vine.
  - If the Holy Spirit dwells in us, meekness appears naturally.
- **"Against Such There is No Law":**
  - The law of God condemns sin, but it has no condemnation for the character of Christ.
  - When the Spirit produces these traits in us, the law is fulfilled (Romans 8:4).
  - This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**: The law is kept not by human effort, but by the spiritual life indwelling the believer.

## Slide 20 – Q9: The Focus of the Mind

- **Question:** If one really has the Spirit of God, what things will he look after?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:5 – “For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points – Two Natures

- **The Conflict:**
  - Paul describes the conflict between the "flesh" (selfish nature) and the "Spirit."
- **The Test of True Religion:**
  - We can tell which power controls us by what occupies our thoughts ("minding" the things).
  - **The Flesh seeks:** Self-promotion, revenge, appetite, worldly praise.
  - **The Spirit seeks:** Humility, prayer, the good of others, God's glory.
- **Sanctification:**
  - This is a daily choice to yield to God's influence rather than natural impulses.

## Slide 22 – Q10: The Evidence of Salvation

- **Question:** What is the evidence that we are Christ’s?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:9 – “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points – Assurance

- **A Vital Truth:**
  - Profession or knowledge of doctrine is not enough; we must have the Spirit.
- **The Spirit of Christ:**
  - Based on context, this is a spirit of meekness, humility, and love.
  - Cherishing pride or an unforgiving spirit contradicts the claim of being a Christian.
- **Assurance:**
  - "Ye are not in the flesh... if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you."
  - If we have surrendered, we are no longer defined by our old nature. God sees us in the Spirit (Romans 8:1).

## Slide 24 – Q11: Restoring the Fallen

- **Question:** If a brother is overcome by a fault, who only should undertake his restoration, and in what way?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:1 – “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points – Restoration

- **Who Should Restore:**
  - "Ye which are spiritual" (those walking in the Spirit/meekness).
  - An angry or judgmental person is "carnal" and will make the wound worse.
- **The Goal:**
  - The word "restore" refers to setting a broken bone. The goal is healing, not punishment.
- **Self-Distrust:**
  - "Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
  - The meek man knows his own weakness and that only grace keeps him from falling. This prevents a "holier-than-thou" attitude.

## Slide 26 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Surgeon:**
  - If a surgeon operates on a delicate body part, he washes his hands thoroughly.
  - He uses a gentle touch; he does not hack away carelessly.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - Dealing with a brother’s sin is surgery on a soul.
  - Only the clean hands of a spiritual person, moving with the gentleness of Christ, can heal the wound.

## Slide 27 – Q12: True Adornment

- **Question:** How should Christian women adorn themselves?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:3, 4 – “Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points – The Hidden Man of the Heart

- **True Value:**
  - The world values gold and fashion (which perish).
  - God values character. A meek spirit is "of great price" in His sight.
- **Principle of Modesty:**
  - The focus of life should not be outward display (feeding the flesh) but developing inward character (the Spirit).
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the glory was hidden behind the veil in the Most Holy Place.
  - In the believer, the true glory is the Shekinah of God's character dwelling in the inmost heart.

## Slide 29 – Q13: The Final Result

- **Question:** What will the Lord finally do for those who cultivate the spirit of meekness?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 149:4 – “For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points – Beautified with Salvation

- **The Robe of Righteousness:**
  - To be "beautified with salvation" is to be clothed in Christ’s character.
  - **Imputed:** Covered by Christ's merit (Justification).
  - **Imparted:** Changed into His image internally (Sanctification).
  - **Glorification:** Changed physically at His coming.
- **God's Pleasure:**
  - The Lord takes pleasure in His people because He sees the reflection of His own Son in them.

## Slide 31 – Q14: The Inheritance

- **Question:** What will the meek inherit?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:5 – “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.”

## Slide 32 – Q14: Key Points – The Earth Made New

- **The Great Reversal:**
  - Now, the proud and aggressive seem to rule the world.
  - In God’s plan, this is temporary.
- **The New Earth:**
  - After the cleansing of the universe, the earth is given to those who have learned the laws of the kingdom (love and humility).
- **Security:**
  - Those who have not learned meekness would destroy the peace of heaven.
  - Only those who have allowed the Spirit to tame their hearts are safe to live eternally in God's universe.

## Slide 33 – Q15: Preparation for the End

- **Question:** What graces are the meek of the earth exhorted to seek that they may be hid in the day of the Lord's fierce anger?
- **Key Text:** Zephaniah 2:3 – “Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Key Points – Seeking Cover

- **Progressive Sanctification:**
  - The verse tells the "meek of the earth" to "seek meekness."
  - We never "arrive." We need *more* of Christ's righteousness every day.
- **Preparation for Judgment:**
  - "The day of the Lord's anger" refers to the final judgments.
  - To be "hid" corresponds to having the seal of God and the covering of Christ.
- **The Covering:**
  - In the time of trouble, our own character will not stand.
  - Only those who have ceased to trust in themselves (meekness) will hold fast to Christ.

## Slide 35 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Diver:**
  - A diver seeking pearls must hold his breath and dive deep. He cannot stay on the surface.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The Christian must dive deeper into the ocean of God’s love.
  - We cannot be content with yesterday's meekness.
  - We must seek a fresh supply from Christ today to be ready for the final test.
