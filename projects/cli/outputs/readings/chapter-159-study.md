### Q1. What is the definition of presumption?

**"The act of believing upon probable evidence, or taking for granted; belief upon incomplete proof; opinion. The act of venturing beyond due bounds; forward, venturesome, overconfident, or arrogant opinion or conduct; unreasonable confidence." - Webster.**

**Answer:**
To understand presumption spiritually, we must contrast it with genuine faith. While faith claims God’s promises and rests upon His word, presumption claims God’s blessings while disregarding His conditions.

1.  **Counterfeit Faith:** Presumption is often called "Satan’s counterfeit of faith." Faith takes hold of God's power to obey Him; presumption expects God's power to sustain us while we disobey Him.
2.  **Venturing Without a Warrant:** As the definition suggests, it is "venturing beyond due bounds." In the spiritual life, the "bounds" are the commandments of God and the clear teachings of Scripture (Isaiah 8:20). To expect God’s protection or salvation while willfully stepping outside His law is presumption.
3.  **Self-Confidence:** True faith relies wholly on Christ’s righteousness; presumption often relies on human reasoning or feeling, assuming God is too "merciful" to punish willful sin.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a man standing on a high cliff. Faith is stepping onto a bridge that the architect has promised is safe. Presumption is jumping off the cliff into thin air, hoping the architect will catch you before you hit the bottom, even though he warned you not to jump. Faith trusts the Word; presumption tests the Word.

### Q2. How does God look upon presumption, as indicated by His dealing with ancient Israel?

**"But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people." Num. 15:30.**

**Answer:**
This verse distinguishes between sins of ignorance or weakness and "high-handed" (presumptuous) rebellion.

1.  **Reproaching the Lord:** The Hebrew text suggests acting with a "high hand"—shaking a fist in God's face. It is not merely a slip or a fall; it is a calculated rejection of God's authority. God views this as a direct insult ("reproach") to His character and government.
2.  **The Sanctuary Distinction:** In the earthly **sanctuary** service, sacrifices were provided for sins committed through ignorance or weakness (Leviticus 4:2, 27). However, for willful, defiant rebellion where there was no repentance, there was no sacrifice initially available—the sinner was "cut off."
3.  **The Need for Atonement:** This highlights the danger of **willful sin** (Hebrews 10:26). While the blood of Christ can cover any sin repented of, presumption hardens the heart so that the sinner refuses to repent.
    *   **Atonement:** *The work by which God and man are reconciled. In the type, the sinner transferred sin to the lamb; in the antitype, we transfer sin to Christ.*
    *   God cannot justify (declare righteous) a person who willfully clings to rebellion, for that would make God a minister of sin (Galatians 2:17).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A child who accidentally breaks a vase while trying to help clean is treated differently than a child who looks the parent in the eye and smashes the vase on purpose. One needs instruction and forgiveness; the other needs a change of heart (conversion) before forgiveness can be received, because the rebellion blocks the relationship.

### Q3. If a prophet of old presumed to speak in the name of God that which he had not commanded, what was the result?

**"But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die." Deut. 18:20.**

**Answer:**
God guards the purity of His channel of communication with jealous care.

1.  **Usurping Authority:** For a human being to claim the authority of heaven for their own words is treason against the divine government. It leads people away from the Bible and the Law of God.
2.  **Modern Application:** We must be careful not to attribute to the Holy Spirit our own impulses, emotions, or political opinions. To say "The Lord told me" when the Lord has not spoken is a violation of the third commandment (taking God's name in vain).
3.  **The Test:** We are told to test the spirits (1 John 4:1). If a message contradicts the law and the testimony, there is no light in it (Isaiah 8:20). Presumption ignores the written Word to follow subjective feelings or false teachers.

### Q4. What befell the Israelites when, having reached the promised land, they attempted to fight against the Canaanites without God's consent?

**"But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses departed not out of the camp, Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah." Num. 14:44, 45.**

**Answer:**
This incident at Kadesh-Barnea is a classic lesson in the difference between faith and presumption.

1.  **Faith vs. Works:**
    *   Initially, God said "Go up," but they refused through unbelief.
    *   After being rebuked, they tried to "make up" for their sin by going up in their own strength.
    *   This was **legalism** (trying to earn favor by works) mixed with **presumption**. They thought the action of fighting would save them, even without God’s presence.
2.  **The Absence of the Ark:** The text notes the "ark of the covenant... departed not out of the camp." The Ark contained the Ten Commandments (the standard of righteousness) and the Mercy Seat (God's grace).
    *   Any effort to conquer the enemy (sin or nations) without the Law and the Gospel (the Ark) is doomed to failure.
3.  **Victory by Faith:** Victory is not achieved by human zeal or warfare, but by abiding in Christ. When we move without His Spirit, we are defeated by our enemies.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A soldier who refuses to march when the general commands, but then charges the enemy line alone after the army has retreated, is not brave—he is insubordinate and foolish. He will be captured or killed. We must move only when the Cloud (the Spirit) moves.

### Q5. What was withdrawn from the antediluvians because they had persisted in their evil course?

**"And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive with man." Gen. 6:3.**

**Answer:**
The antediluvians (people before the Flood) presumed upon God's patience until they exhausted it.

1.  **The Striving Spirit:** The Holy Spirit pleads with the conscience, convincing of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). This is the agency of **Sanctification**—the Spirit working to restore the image of God in man.
2.  **The Limit of Grace:** God is long-suffering, but He is not "forever-suffering." There comes a point where the conscience is "seared with a hot iron" (1 Timothy 4:2). The withdrawal of the Spirit is not because God stops loving, but because the sinner has become incapable of responding.
3.  **Probation:**
    *   *Definition:* The period of time granted to mankind to choose between loyalty to God or rebellion.
    *   Just as the door of Noah's ark was shut by God, there is a time when the investigative judgment concludes, and the destiny of souls is fixed (Revelation 22:11). Presumption assumes we can repent "later," but "later" may be too late.

### Q6. Of what presumptuous act were men guilty soon after the flood?

**"And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven." Gen. 11:4.**

**Answer:**
The Tower of Babel was a monument to human pride and distrust of God's covenant.

1.  **Distrust of God's Promise:** God had promised never to flood the earth again (Genesis 9:11). Building a tower to escape a flood was a direct declaration that they did not believe God’s word.
2.  **Self-Salvation:** They wanted to reach heaven by their own engineering and works. This is the spirit of Babylon—saving oneself by human merit rather than relying on God's provided way of salvation.
3.  **Self-Exaltation:** "Let us make us a name." The motive was glory for self, whereas the motive of the Christian is glory to God (1 Corinthians 10:31).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
The builders of Babel were like men trying to build a ladder to the moon. No matter how high they built, they could never bridge the gap between sinful man and a holy God. Only the ladder Jacob saw—Christ—can bridge that gap (Genesis 28:12; John 1:51).

### Q7. What did the Lord say of them?

**"And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do." Gen. 11:6.**

**Answer:**
God recognized the power of unity, even when used for evil.

1.  **Unity in Rebellion:** Satan seeks to unite the world in confederacies of evil. When men unite against God's law, their combined presumption strengthens them in sin.
2.  **Unrestrained Evil:** If left unchecked, this centralized rebellion would have completely erased the knowledge of the true God from the earth. God intervenes not to be cruel, but to preserve a remnant through whom the Messiah could eventually come.

### Q8. What befell them in consequence of their presumption?

**"The Lord did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth." Gen. 11:9.**

**Answer:**
1.  **Confusion:** The word "Babel" means confusion. Presumption always leads to confusion—doctrinally, morally, and socially. When men turn away from the law of God, they lose the only standard that can keep society truly orderly.
2.  **God's Sovereignty:** Man proposed to stay together; God disposed that they should scatter to fill the earth (as He had originally commanded in Genesis 9:1). We cannot outmaneuver God.
3.  **A Lesson for the End Times:** Revelation speaks of "Babylon the Great"—a final system of religious presumption that unites the world against God's law. Like ancient Babel, it will end in confusion and destruction (Revelation 18).

### Q9. What befell Nadab and Abihu for their presumption in offering strange fire that the Lord had not commanded?

**"And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire there in, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord." Lev. 10:1, 2.**

**Answer:**
This narrative is one of the most solemn warnings in Scripture regarding the **Sanctuary** and worship.

1.  **Strange Fire:** The fire on the altar of burnt offering was originally kindled by God Himself (Leviticus 9:24). It was holy. The priests were commanded to use *only* that fire to burn incense. Nadab and Abihu used common fire—fire of their own kindling.
2.  **Spiritual Meaning:**
    *   *Holy Fire:* Represents the righteousness of Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit, which alone makes our prayers (incense) acceptable to God.
    *   *Strange Fire:* Represents human works, emotional excitement, or man-made doctrines substituted for the truth of God.
3.  **Exact Obedience:** Presumption argues, "Fire is fire; what difference does it make?" But God requires exact obedience to His commands. We cannot worship God according to our own devices.
4.  **The Cause:** Leviticus 10:9 suggests they may have been under the influence of alcohol, dulling their ability to distinguish between the "holy and unholy." Presumption often arises when the mind is clouded by the things of this world.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If a doctor prescribes a specific life-saving medicine, but the pharmacist decides to substitute it with a mixture of his own invention because it "looks the same," the patient dies. The "strange fire" is the pharmacist’s fatal presumption. We must take the Gospel cure exactly as the Great Physician prescribed it.

### Q10. How was the little horn, the papacy, to show its presumption?

**"And he [the little horn] shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws." Dan. 7:25.**

**Answer:**
Prophecy identifies a power arising from the Roman empire that would exhibit the height of presumption.

1.  **Speaking Against the Most High:** This power claims titles and prerogatives that belong only to God (e.g., the power to forgive sins, or to be the head of the church).
2.  **Thinking to Change Times and Laws:** This is the ultimate act of presumption—attempting to edit the Constitution of the Universe, the Ten Commandments.
    *   The Papacy admits to changing the Sabbath from the seventh day (Saturday) to the first day (Sunday), with no scriptural authority, claiming the church's authority is above the Bible.
3.  **The Law and the Gospel:** By changing the law, the definition of sin is obscured. When the law is obscured, the need for Christ's justification is obscured. Thus, this presumption strikes at the heart of the plan of salvation.

### Q11. What is this power, therefore, called by the apostle?

**"And that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth, and exalteth himself above all that is called God." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.**

**Answer:**
Paul identifies this same power as the "mystery of iniquity."

1.  **The Man of Sin:** This title suggests the embodiment of rebellion. Sin is "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). Therefore, the "Man of Sin" is the representative of lawlessness.
2.  **Self-Exaltation:** "Exalteth himself." This was the original sin of Lucifer: "I will ascend... I will be like the Most High" (Isaiah 14:14).
3.  **In the Temple:** The text says he sits in the "temple of God." This refers to the church (the spiritual temple). This is not an outside enemy like atheism, but a presumption *inside* the church, claiming God’s authority while usurping His place.

### Q12. What does the psalmist call the sin of presumption?

**"Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me; then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression." Ps. 19:13.**

**Answer:**
David prays for deliverance from two types of sin: secret faults (v. 12) and presumptuous sins (v. 13).

1.  **Dominion:** "Let them not have dominion over me."
    *   If we cherish a known sin, refusing to give it up, it gains **dominion** over the will.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** The promise of the New Covenant is that "Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace" (Romans 6:14). Grace breaks the power of presumptuous sin.
2.  **The Great Transgression:** Continued, willful presumption leads to the "great transgression"—the unpardonable sin (blasphemy against the Holy Spirit). This is not a specific act, but a final hardening of the heart where the soul no longer desires repentance.
3.  **The Remedy:** The only safety is to pray, as David did, for God to "keep back" His servant. We cannot keep ourselves; we need the indwelling Christ to guard the avenues of the soul.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A boat drifting on a river can be easily steered with a rudder. But if it drifts into the rapids of a waterfall (presumption), the rudder is useless. We must ask God to keep us from entering the rapids in the first place.

### Q13. What admonition does the apostle give concerning our course toward the truth?

**"And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption." Eph. 4:30.**

**Answer:**
The antidote to presumption is a sensitive, tender conscience toward the Holy Spirit.

1.  **Grieving the Spirit:** The Spirit is a Person who can be grieved by our willful disregard for His voice. When we presume on God’s grace—sinning because we know He is forgiving—we grieve Him deeply.
2.  **The Sealing Work:**
    *   **Definition:** *The "seal of God" is the intellectual and spiritual settling into the truth so that one cannot be moved.*
    *   We are sealed for the "day of redemption." Those who persist in presumption eventually grieve the Spirit away and cannot be sealed. They receive the "mark of the beast" instead—the mark of rebellion.
3.  **Walking Humbly:** Instead of presumption, the Christian is called to "fear God, and give glory to him" (Revelation 14:7). This is not a fear of terror, but a holy reverence that trembles at His word (Isaiah 66:2) and seeks to obey His commandments through the power of His indwelling life.

**Summary:** Presumption is a fatal counterfeit of faith. True faith works by love and purifies the soul. It leads to obedience. Presumption claims the safety of the believer while living the life of the rebel. Let our prayer be, "Lord, keep back thy servant from presumptuous sins."
