## Slide 1 – Q1: Lot’s Choice

- **Question:** When Abraham gave Lot his choice of where to live, what did Lot
  choose for himself and his family?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 13:10, 11 – “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all
  the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord
  destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord. ...Then Lot
  chose him all the plain of Jordan.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Walking by Sight vs. Faith

- **Walking by Sight:**
  - Lot “lifted up his eyes” and looked for temporal advantages: fertile land,
    water, and economic potential.
  - To the natural eye, it looked like Eden; spiritually, it was a trap.
- **Neglecting the Altar:**
  - Abraham stayed in the hills where he could maintain his altar and communion
    with God.
  - Lot chose the ease of the plain, prioritizing physical well-being over
    spiritual protection.
- **The Danger of Prosperity:**
  - The path of least resistance and greatest financial gain is often the path
    of greatest spiritual danger.
- **Defining Faith:**
  - Faith is trusting God’s word even when it contradicts visible evidence.
  - Hebrews 11:1 – “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
    of things not seen.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Poisonous Berry:**
  - Imagine a man in a forest seeing a bright, beautiful berry. It looks sweet
    and satisfying to the eye.
  - A local guide knows it is poisonous.
  - If the man eats based on sight, he dies. If he listens to the guide (faith),
    he lives.
- **Application:**
  - Lot chose the “poisonous berry” of the plain because it looked like the
    Garden of Eden, ignoring the hidden danger of the city’s corruption.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Approach to Sodom

- **Question:** Where did this choice take him?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 13:12 – “Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot
  dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **The Approach of Sin:**
  - Sin rarely captures a believer instantly.
  - It begins with a look, then a step, then a tent pitched _toward_ the world.
- **Sanctification and Separation:**
  - God calls His people to be separate.
  - 2 Corinthians 6:17 – “Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye
    separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will
    receive you.”
- **Reversing Sanctification:**
  - Sanctification is being set apart for holy use (1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For
    this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”).
  - By pitching his tent toward Sodom, Lot allowed the world’s atmosphere to
    permeate his home.
- **The Slide into the City:**
  - Lot moved from looking at the city, to living near it, to eventually sitting
    in its gate (Genesis 19:1).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Compass and the Magnet:**
  - If you place a compass near a strong magnet, the needle will drift away from
    true north.
  - The magnet doesn’t have to touch the compass to affect it; it just needs to
    be close.
- **Application:**
  - Lot pitched his tent close to the “magnet” of Sodom.
  - Inevitably, his family’s moral compass began to drift away from God.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Character of the City

- **Question:** What were the inhabitants of that city like?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 13:13 – “But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners
  before the Lord exceedingly.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Sinners Before the Lord:**
  - Their sin was not just a social offense; it was open rebellion against the
    Creator.
  - Psalm 51:4 – “Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
    thy sight...”
- **Exceedingly Wicked:**
  - They had rejected the light of nature and conscience, searing their hearts
    against truth.
- **The Environment of Rebellion:**
  - To voluntarily live among those who hate God’s law is to expose oneself to
    constant spiritual battle.
  - Jesus associated with sinners to save them, but He did not make His home in
    the center of corruption to enjoy their lifestyle.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Quarantine Zone:**
  - A doctor enters a quarantine zone to treat patients with a deadly virus. He
    wears protective gear and leaves when his work is done.
  - He does not move his healthy family into the sick ward to live there
    permanently.
- **Application:**
  - Lot moved his family into the “plague ward” of sin without a mission to
    heal, but with a desire to profit.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Root of Sodom’s Sin

- **Question:** What additional description of this city is given us in the Word
  of God?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 16:49, 50 – “Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister
  Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in
  her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And
  they were haughty, and committed abomination before Me: therefore I took them
  away as I saw good.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Roots of Sin)

- **The Soil of Sin:**
  - **Pride:** Self-exaltation.
  - **Fullness of Bread:** Gluttony and luxury.
  - **Abundance of Idleness:** Laziness and lack of useful labor.
- **Result:**
  - When people live only for pleasure without useful labor, the door opens to
    every other vice.
  - This “haughty” spirit led directly to the commission of “abominations”
    (gross sexual perversions).

## Slide 12 – Q4: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **True Righteousness Works by Love:**
  - A person justified by Christ cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of
    others.
  - Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
    thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”
- **Definition of Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Experiencing Christ’s forgiveness (justification) and His indwelling power
    (sanctification).
  - Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness,
    which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
    righteousness which is of God by faith.”
- **Sodom’s Failure:**
  - Their selfishness and neglect of the needy proved they were devoid of the
    love of God.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **Stagnant Water:**
  - Stagnant water becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes and disease. A
    flowing river stays clear.
- **Application:**
  - “Abundance of idleness” is like stagnant water in the soul.
  - Without the flow of service to God and others, the “larvae” of terrible sins
    begin to breed.

## Slide 14 – Q5: The Cost of Compromise

- **Question:** How did their conduct affect Lot?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 2:7, 8 – “And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy
  conversation of the wicked: (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in
  seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their
  unlawful deeds).”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Justification & Vexation)

- **Vexation of Soul:**
  - To a heart that knows God, sin is repulsive.
  - Lot retained his justification (standing with God), but he sacrificed his
    peace.
- **The Eye and the Ear:**
  - The senses are avenues to the soul.
  - 2 Corinthians 3:18 – “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
    glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image...”
  - By beholding evil, Lot had to constantly fight against being changed into
    its image.
- **Justification Defined:**
  - The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is accounted righteous
    through the merits of Jesus.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
    that is in Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Factory of Smoke:**
  - If a man lives in a factory filled with smoke and soot, he may scrub himself
    clean every night (repentance).
  - However, all day long he breathes in poison and his clothes are stained.
- **Application:**
  - Lot lived in the “smoke” of Sodom; it made his daily walk with God
    incredibly difficult and painful.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Divine Deliverance

- **Question:** Before destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, whom did the Lord send to
  deliver Lot and his family?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 19:1, 12, 13 – “And there came two angels to Sodom at
  even.” “And the men [angels] said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides?
  ...bring them out of this place... for the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Investigative Judgment)

- **The Investigative Judgment Type:**
  - Before execution, God investigated. He came down to “see” if their sin was
    full (Genesis 18).
  - This typifies the Investigative Judgment: God reviews the case before
    passing sentence.
  - Daniel 7:10 – “The judgment was set, and the books were opened.”
- **Angelic Ministry:**
  - God sends angels to minister to heirs of salvation (Hebrews 1:14).
  - Even in the wickedest city, God had His eye on the faithful.
- **Family Salvation:**
  - God desires the parents’ faith to encompass the children.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Building Inspector:**
  - Before a building is demolished by a wrecking crew, inspectors go through
    the rooms to ensure no one is sleeping inside.
- **Application:**
  - The angels were heaven’s “inspectors,” clearing out the righteous before the
    demolition of Sodom began.

## Slide 20 – Q7: A Failed Witness

- **Question:** Was Lot successful in warning his married children?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 19:14 – “And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in
  law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for
  the Lord will destroy this city, But he seemed as one that mocked unto his
  sons in law.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **Loss of Moral Authority:**
  - Lot had lived, traded, and intermarried with Sodom.
  - His sudden call to “holiness” and “judgment” sounded like a joke to his
    family.
- **The Danger of “Mocking”:**
  - The sons-in-law thought Lot was mocking, but they were actually mocking
    God’s warning.
  - 1 Corinthians 1:18 – “For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish
    foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.”
- **Action vs. Words:**
  - If we live like the world, we cannot effectively warn the world of coming
    judgment.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Prankster:**
  - If a man known for practical jokes runs into a room shouting, “Fire! Fire!”,
    people will likely laugh and stay seated.
- **Application:**
  - Lot had played with the world so long that when he finally told the truth
    about God’s judgment, his family thought it was just another game.

## Slide 23 – Q8: The Urgent Command

- **Question:** What did the angels tell Lot the next morning?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 19:15-17 – “Arise... lest thou be consumed in the
  iniquity of the city ...Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither
  stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points

- **Corporate Guilt (“Lest Thou Be Consumed”):**
  - If the righteous voluntarily remain with the wicked after the warning, they
    share in the plagues.
  - Revelation 18:4 – “Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of
    her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.”
- **“Look Not Behind”:**
  - This is the essence of conversion. To look back implies a longing for the
    sin we are leaving.
  - Luke 9:62 – “No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is
    fit for the kingdom of God.”
- **Escape to the Mountain:**
  - The plain represented compromise; the mountain represented safety and
    communion with God.

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Swimmer and the Lifeguard:**
  - A swimmer is caught in a current heading for a waterfall.
  - A lifeguard throws a rope and shouts, “Grab hold and don't let go!”
  - The swimmer cannot hold the rope with one hand and paddle back toward the
    falls with the other. He must commit fully to the rescue.

## Slide 26 – Q9: The Destruction of Sodom

- **Question:** What occurred next?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 19:24-25 – “Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon
  Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and He overthrew
  those cities...”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points (Judgment & Hell Fire)

- **Source of Judgment:**
  - The fire came “from the Lord.” It was a supernatural act of divine justice.
- **The Nature of Hell Fire:**
  - Jude 7 says Sodom suffered the vengeance of “eternal fire.”
  - The cities are not burning today; the _result_ was eternal (they turned to
    ashes).
  - Malachi 4:3 – “And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes
    under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this...”
- **Executive Judgment:**
  - This is the final act of God in destroying sin and cleansing the universe of
    rebellion.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Surgeon:**
  - When a surgeon removes a cancerous tumor, he burns or cuts it out completely
    so it cannot regrow.
- **Application:**
  - God’s judgment on Sodom was the “surgery” to remove a cancer of iniquity
    from the land.

## Slide 29 – Q10: Lot’s Wife

- **Question:** Because the affections of Lot’s wife were still in Sodom, what
  happened to her?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 19:26 – “But his wife looked back from behind him, and
  she became a pillar of salt.”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points (Surrender)

- **A Divided Heart:**
  - Her body left Sodom, but her heart remained there.
  - 1 John 2:15 – “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
    If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”
- **Disobedience:**
  - The command was “Look not behind.” Her look was an act of rebellion.
- **A Monument of Warning:**
  - Luke 17:32 – “Remember Lot’s wife.”
  - We cannot serve God and mammon; we must be fully surrendered to Christ.

## Slide 31 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Ship’s Anchor:**
  - A ship may be pulled out of the harbor, but if the anchor is still hooked on
    the bottom, the ship will be ripped apart or snapped back.
- **Application:**
  - Lot’s wife had her “anchor” hooked in the possessions of Sodom. When she
    tried to move forward, that attachment destroyed her.

## Slide 32 – Q11: As in the Days of Lot

- **Question:** Foretelling the condition of the world just prior to His Second
  Advent, to what did Christ liken it?
- **Key Text:** Luke 17:28-30 – “Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot...
  Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.”

## Slide 33 – Q11: Key Points (Sanctuary & End Times)

- **Absorption in the Material:**
  - They ate, drank, bought, sold. These are not inherently sinful, but they let
    temporal things crowd out God.
- **Suddenness of Destruction:**
  - Destruction came “the same day” Lot left. The world will cry “Peace and
    safety” just before sudden destruction.
  - 1 Thessalonians 5:3 – “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then
    sudden destruction cometh upon them...”
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Just as the angels’ departure signaled the end of mercy for Sodom, when
    Christ finishes His work in the Most Holy Place, mercy will cease, and
    plagues will fall.

## Slide 34 – Q11: Illustration

- **Picnic on the Tracks:**
  - Imagine a group having a picnic on a railroad track, convinced that trains
    no longer run.
  - The danger isn’t the picnic; the danger is the location and the refusal to
    listen to the whistle of the oncoming train.
- **Application:**
  - The world ignores the warning signs of the times.

## Slide 35 – Q12: Type and Antitype

- **Question:** Of what great final event is the destruction of Sodom and
  Gomorrah a pattern or type?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 2:6 – “And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into
  ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those
  that after should live ungodly.”

## Slide 36 – Q12: Key Points

- **Universal Judgment:**
  - Fire cleansed the plain; fire will cleanse the whole earth.
  - 2 Peter 3:10 – “The earth also and the works that are therein shall be
    burned up.”
- **Total Eradication:**
  - The result was “ashes.”
  - God will not maintain a torture chamber; He will reduce sin to ashes to
    create a clean universe.
- **Modern “Sodoms”:**
  - The accumulation of power and vice in modern cities makes them targets for
    moral decay and eventual destruction.

## Slide 37 – Q13: The Seventh Plague

- **Question:** What is to take place under the seventh plague?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:17-19 – “And the seventh angel poured out his vial
  into the air... saying, It is done... And the great city was divided into
  three parts, and the cities of the nations fell...”

## Slide 38 – Q13: Key Points (It is Done)

- **“It is Done”:**
  - This voice comes from the temple/throne of heaven.
  - It signifies the completion of the Plan of Redemption and the end of
    Christ’s intercession.
- **The Fall of Cities:**
  - “The cities of the nations fell.”
  - Human engineering and financial strongholds (Babylon) will collapse before
    the power of God.
- **The Call to Readiness:**
  - Since all these things will be dissolved, we must be holy in conversation
    and godliness.
  - 2 Peter 3:11 – “Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what
    manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness.”

## Slide 39 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Titanic:**
  - The Titanic was a “floating city” deemed unsinkable by man. Yet, an iceberg
    tore it open, and it sank.
- **Application:**
  - The great cities of the world are like the Titanic—technologically advanced
    but sailing toward a collision with God’s justice.
  - The only lifeboat is Christ.
