## Slide 1 – Q1: The Blood and the Conscience

- Question: What effect is the application of the blood of Christ expected to have upon the conscience?
- Key Text: Hebrews 9:14 – “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Defining the Terms

- **Conscience**
  - The internal voice or moral faculty placed by God to distinguish right from wrong.
  - Without the Spirit, it can be defiled: Titus 1:15 – “Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.”
- **Purge**
  - To cleanse thoroughly or purify.
- **Dead Works**
  - Works done to earn salvation by human merit (legalism), which cannot bring life.
  - Sinful actions leading to death: Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Sanctuary & Justification

- **The Sanctuary Connection**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, blood was shed in the outer court to make atonement.
  - Christ, our perfect Sacrifice, shed His blood to deal with the guilt of sin once and for all.
- **Justification (Imputed Righteousness)**
  - Christ’s blood cleanses the *guilt* of past sins.
  - Romans 3:25 – “Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.”
- **Service of Love**
  - A guilty conscience hides from God (like Adam).
  - A cleansed conscience serves God out of love, not fear.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Serving the Living God**
  - We cannot serve God while burdened by the attempt to save ourselves ("dead works").
  - Faith lays hold of the blood of Christ, realizing the penalty is paid.
- **Grace and Works**
  - We serve because we *are* saved, not *to get* saved.
  - Ephesians 2:8–9 – “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Debt and the Ledger**
  - Imagine a merchant in hopeless debt. Every look at his ledger brings torment and fear of creditors.
  - His frantic efforts to pay it back are like "dead works"—fruitless.
  - A wealthy benefactor pays the debt in full and shows the receipt. The ledger is clean.
  - The merchant’s conscience is purged of the burden. He now works for the benefactor out of gratitude, not to pay a debt that is already gone.

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Purged Conscience

- Question: When once purged by the blood of Christ, in what condition is the conscience of an individual?
- Key Text: Hebrews 10:2 – “Because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Assurance of Acceptance

- **No More Conscience of Sins**
  - This does not mean we forget we were sinners or lose moral judgment.
  - It means the crushing weight of condemnation is removed.
  - Romans 8:1 – “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”
- **Accepted in the Beloved**
  - Old Covenant sacrifices were repeated daily, reminding people of sin.
  - Christ’s sacrifice was "once for all" (Hebrews 10:10).
  - We stand before God justified, as if we had never sinned (Ephesians 1:6).

## Slide 8 – Q2: Sanctuary Truth

- **The Heavenly High Priest**
  - Jesus lives to make intercession for us in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Because He is there, we do not carry the burden of past sins; they are transferred to the Lamb of God.
  - Hebrews 4:16 – “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”

## Slide 9 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Pardoned Prisoner**
  - A prisoner sits in a cell, guilty and restricted.
  - The governor issues a full pardon, and the door is unlocked.
  - If the man stays in the cell weeping over his crime, he rejects the reality of the pardon.
  - A "purged" conscience walks out of the prison, leaving the guilt behind, believing the pardon is real.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Paul’s Testimony

- Question: In his defense before a certain council, how did Paul say he, had constantly lived?
- Key Text: Acts 23:1 – “Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Integrity and Enlightenment

- **Integrity to Conviction**
  - Even as Saul the persecutor, he was sincere but sincerely wrong.
  - He thought he was doing God service: John 16:2 – “They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.”
- **The Necessity of Enlightenment**
  - Conscience alone is unsafe if not educated by the Word of God.
  - Once Paul received light on the road to Damascus, his conscience required immediate change.
- **Sanctification**
  - Walking in the light as God reveals it.
  - 1 John 1:7 – “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.”

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Compass and the Magnet**
  - A compass is designed to point North.
  - If a magnet (tradition, pride, sin) is held near it, the needle points elsewhere, though the mechanism works perfectly.
  - The conscience is the needle; the Word of God is true North.
  - We must ensure no "magnets" distort our conscience, so it aligns with God’s Law.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Exercising the Conscience

- Question: When one lives as the apostle declared he had, in all good conscience, in what condition will his conscience be?
- Key Text: Acts 24:16 – “And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward men.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Void of Offense

- **Toward God**
  - No known, unconfessed sin separating the soul from the Creator.
  - Isaiah 59:2 – “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.”
- **Toward Men**
  - Restitution for wrongs done; living a life of integrity.
- **The Standard**
  - A "good conscience" cannot exist while knowingly breaking God's law.
  - James 2:10 – “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.”

## Slide 15 – Q4: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **An Active Faith**
  - Paul says, "I *exercise* myself." It is not automatic.
  - This is the cooperative work of sanctification: God provides grace, but we must yield and watch.
- **Captive Thoughts**
  - We choose to bring every thought into captivity to Christ.
  - 2 Corinthians 10:5 – “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.”

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Daily Wash**
  - A surgeon washes hands before surgery. They do not wash once in a lifetime and claim they are forever clean.
  - They exercise care; if they touch anything unsterile, they wash again immediately.
  - "Exercising" a good conscience is the daily habit of washing in the water of the Word to remove any offense.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Baptism and Conscience

- Question: What does the apostle say the act of baptism is to the candidate?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 3:21 – “The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: The Pledge of a Good Conscience

- **The Meaning of "Answer"**
  - The word implies an appeal, pledge, or covenant transaction.
  - The candidate says: "I accept Your death as mine. I pledge my conscience to You."
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - We are buried with Him and raised to walk in newness of life.
  - Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”
- **Power of the Resurrection**
  - The power to keep a good conscience comes from the resurrected Christ dwelling within (Galatians 2:20).

## Slide 19 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Soldier's Uniform**
  - A soldier puts on a uniform to show he has joined the army.
  - The uniform doesn't make him a soldier; his oath and training do.
  - However, the uniform is the necessary public declaration of allegiance.
  - Baptism is the uniform; the "good conscience" is the oath of loyalty to the King of Kings.

## Slide 20 – Q6: Conscience and Suffering

- Question: What else will a good conscience lead one to do?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 2:19 – “For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.”

## Slide 21 – Q6: Enduring Wrongfully

- **Following Christ's Example**
  - The carnal nature wants to retaliate; the spiritual nature endures.
  - 1 Peter 2:23 – “Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.”
- **The Sanctuary Principle**
  - Judgment belongs to the Lord. We trust Him to vindicate us in His time.
- **Imparted Righteousness**
  - This demonstrates the "patience of the saints" (Revelation 14:12).
  - Only the Spirit of Christ can empower us to love our enemies.

## Slide 22 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Ship and the Anchor**
  - A ship in a storm is tossed by waves on the surface (circumstances/persecution).
  - If its anchor is fixed deep in the bedrock (conscience anchored in God), it will not drift onto the rocks.
  - The storm rages outside, but the connection to the anchor holds firm.

## Slide 23 – Q7: The Seared Conscience

- Question: If one repels the Spirit of God from him, and refuses to have his conscience, or knowledge of himself, quickened, what is the result?
- Key Text: 1 Timothy 4:2 – “Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.”

## Slide 24 – Q7: The Danger of Resistance

- **Seared with a Hot Iron**
  - Like flesh that has been cauterized, the nerve endings are destroyed.
  - A seared conscience no longer feels the conviction of the Holy Spirit.
- **The Process of Hardening**
  1. The Spirit convicts of sin (John 16:8).
  2. The individual resists or rationalizes ("speaking lies").
  3. Repeated resistance dulls the voice of the Spirit.
  4. The "moral nerve" dies—the capacity to want forgiveness is lost.

## Slide 25 – Q7: Warning Against Presumption

- **Do Not Trifle with Truth**
  - God is long-suffering, but we must not presume on His grace.
  - To know the right way and refuse it invites spiritual blindness.
  - James 4:17 – “Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.”

## Slide 26 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Alarm Clock**
  - If you set an alarm but hit "snooze" or ignore it every morning, your brain learns to tune it out.
  - Eventually, you sleep right through the ringing.
  - The alarm (Conscience) is still sounding, but you have "seared" your ability to hear it.

## Slide 27 – Q8: The Rejoicing Conscience

- Question: When one's conscience is well enlightened, what will it do for the individual?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 1:12 – “For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world.”

## Slide 28 – Q8: Simplicity and Sincerity

- **The Testimony of Conscience**
  - Self-examination reveals motives covered by Christ and a life guided by grace.
  - Result: Deep, abiding joy ("rejoicing").
- **Conversation (Lifestyle)**
  - A life governed by the grace of God.
  - Walking in the statutes of the Lord brings peace.
  - Psalm 119:165 – “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.”

## Slide 29 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Open Book**
  - A person with nothing to hide lives like an open book.
  - They do not fear who sees the pages; they live in the sunlight of truth.
  - A guilty conscience constantly guards the book, fearing the wind might turn a page and reveal a secret sin.

## Slide 30 – Q9: The Connection of Faith and Law

- Question: With what is a good conscience connected?
- Key Text: 1 Timothy 1:5 – “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.”

## Slide 31 – Q9: The Goal of the Commandment

- **The End is Charity (Love)**
  - The purpose of God's Law is to produce Agapē love.
  - God is love; His law is a transcript of His character (1 John 4:8).
  - Romans 5:5 – “And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.”

## Slide 32 – Q9: The Essential Trio

- **Three Prerequisites for True Love:**
  1. **Pure Heart:** Cleansed from the love of sin.
  2. **Good Conscience:** Cleansed from the guilt of sin.
  3. **Faith Unfeigned:** Genuine trust in God.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - You cannot have one without the others.
  - Faith without a good conscience is a shipwreck (1 Timothy 1:19).
  - Faith receives Christ's righteousness, which purifies the conscience and leads to obedience in love.

## Slide 33 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Three-Legged Stool**
  - Imagine a stool supported by:
    1. A Pure Heart
    2. A Good Conscience
    3. Unfeigned Faith
  - If you remove any one leg, the stool falls.
  - We cannot rest in God's love (Charity) if we are missing the support of a clear conscience or genuine faith.
