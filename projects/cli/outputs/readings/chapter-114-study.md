### Q1. In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, what is said to have become of Lazarus?

“And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom." Luke 16:22.

**Answer:**

In this parable, Jesus describes the death of Lazarus, a beggar who suffered greatly in this life but possessed faith in God. Upon his death, he is depicted as being carried to "Abraham's bosom." To understand this correctly, we must recognize the setting and the symbols:

*   **Abraham's Bosom:** This was a common Jewish phrase (a figure of speech) denoting a place of honor and intimate fellowship. At a feast, the guest of honor would recline next to the host, leaning on his "bosom" or chest (similar to John leaning on Jesus in John 13:23). It represents being accepted into the family of the faithful, not a literal geographical location in the third heaven.
*   **The Great Reversal:** The parable illustrates a reversal of fortunes. The rich man, who fared sumptuously every day, had no spiritual riches. Lazarus, though physically destitute, was rich in faith (James 2:5).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Lazarus could not earn his way to heaven; he was a helpless beggar. This represents the sinner who, realizing his spiritual bankruptcy (Matthew 5:3), casts himself entirely upon the mercy of God. He is carried by angels—messengers of grace—into the communion of the saints (represented by Abraham, the father of the faithful).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a homeless man standing outside a royal banquet hall, shivering and hungry. Suddenly, the King’s guards gently lift him up, wash him, clothe him in royal robes, and seat him at the right hand of the King himself. This is what happens spiritually. We are destitute in sin, but through faith in Christ, we are lifted from the dunghill of this world and seated in "heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:6).

### Q2. What befell the rich man?

“The rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom." Luke 16:22, 23.

**Answer:**

The rich man also dies, but his experience is depicted very differently.

*   **"In Hell":** The Greek word used here is *Hades*, which corresponds to the Hebrew *Sheol*. In the Bible, this word simply means "the grave" or the "unseen realm of the dead," not the final lake of fire (*Gehenna*).
*   **The Parabolic Nature:** That he lifts up his "eyes" and sees Abraham implies he has a body. Yet, the Bible teaches that the body returns to dust at death (Genesis 3:19). This confirms that Jesus is using a **parable**—a metaphorical story—to teach a moral lesson, rather than giving a literal geography of the afterlife. If taken literally, we would have to believe that heaven and hell are close enough for inhabitants to see each other and carry on conversations, a concept contrary to the peace of paradise.
*   **The Danger of Self-Sufficiency:** The rich man represents those who are satisfied with their earthly lot and feel no need of a Savior. He had the "law and the prophets" but did not let them change his character. He had outward wealth but inward poverty (Revelation 3:17).

**Definition:**
**Hades (Greek):** The grave or the realm of the dead; equivalent to the Hebrew *Sheol*. It is the temporary holding place of all the dead, righteous and wicked, until the resurrection.

### Q3. What request did the rich man make of Abraham?

“And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame." Luke 16:24.

**Answer:**

The rich man asks for the smallest mercy—a drop of water from the tip of a finger. This part of the narrative highlights several critical truths:

*   **The Finality of Death:** The request is denied because there is a "great gulf fixed" (Luke 16:26). This gulf represents the unchangeable nature of character once life has ended. Probation closes at death. There is no second chance, no "purgatory," and no crossing over from rebellion to obedience after the breath leaves the body.
*   **Physical Impossibility as Proof of Parable:** A literal drop of water on a physical tongue would not cool a man burning in literal fire. Jesus uses this imagery to show the intensity of the regret felt by those who waste their probation.
*   **The Atonement Connection:** We are currently in the time of atonement, where the "water of life" is freely available (Revelation 22:17). Jesus, our High Priest, offers us living water now. If we reject His Spirit in this life, we cut ourselves off from the Source of life forever.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If a man pours concrete for a foundation, while it is wet, he can shape it, smooth it, or remove it. But once the concrete sets, it becomes hard as rock. It can no longer be molded. Life is the wet concrete; death is when it sets. Our character—our decisions for or against Christ—becomes fixed at death (Revelation 22:11).

### Q4. Upon making the request for Lazarus to be sent to his father's house to warn his brethren, what did Abraham reply?

“Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." Luke 16:29.

**Answer:**

This is the central point of the entire parable. The rich man wants a supernatural sign to save his brothers, but Abraham points them to the Scriptures.

*   **The Sufficiency of Scripture:** "Moses and the prophets" refers to the Old Testament Scriptures. Jesus teaches that the written Word of God is sufficient for salvation. It contains the warnings against sin, the promise of the Messiah, and the path of righteousness.
*   **Faith vs. Sight:** True faith comes by hearing the Word of God (Romans 10:17), not by seeing ghosts or miracles. A faith based only on supernatural signs is shallow and will not stand the test of the final judgment.
*   **Christ in the Word:** Jesus told the Pharisees, "Search the scriptures... they are they which testify of me" (John 5:39). If the brothers would not listen to the Bible, they were rejecting the only means of understanding the plan of salvation.

**Definition:**
**Sanctification:** The process of being made holy through belief in the truth (John 17:17). This happens by studying and obeying God's Word, not by witnessing spectral apparitions.

### Q5. What earnest appeal did the rich man then make?

“And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent." Luke 16:30.

**Answer:**

The rich man argues with Abraham, believing that a sensational miracle—a dead man walking—would be more effective than the "old" Scriptures.

*   **The Human Delusion:** It is a common deception to think, "If I just saw a miracle, I would believe and obey." But the heart that is hardened against God's law will not be softened by a miracle. The Israelites saw the Red Sea part, yet they rebelled days later.
*   **The Definition of Repentance:** Repentance is a sorrow for sin and a turning away from it (Acts 3:19). It is a change of mind and heart induced by the Holy Spirit through the Word. It is not merely fear of punishment caused by seeing a ghost.
*   **Understanding the Note:** As the note in the lesson outline suggests, the rich man speaks of Lazarus returning "from the dead." This implies the rich man knows Lazarus is in the grave, effectively dead, and would need to be resurrected to go to the brothers.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a driver who ignores the speed limit signs (the Law) and the warnings of police officers (the Prophets). If that driver sees a terrible accident (a shock/sign), he may slow down for a mile or two out of fear. But once the fear fades, because his respect for the law hasn't changed, he will speed again. Only a change of heart (writing the law within) produces lasting obedience.

### Q6. But had Lazarus gone on such a mission, what must have taken place?

“And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead." Luke 16:31.

**Answer:**

This is the climax of the parable and a prophetic statement by Jesus.

*   **The Prophetic Fulfillment:** A short time after this parable, Jesus literally raised a man named Lazarus from the dead (John 11). Did the Jewish leaders repent? No. They plotted to kill both Jesus and Lazarus (John 12:10). Later, Jesus Himself rose from the dead, and they bribed the soldiers to lie about it (Matthew 28:11-15).
*   **The Hardness of Heart:** Jesus proves that if a man rejects the authority of God's Word ("Moses and the prophets"), no amount of supernatural evidence will convince him.
*   **The Lesson on State of the Dead:** As the note indicates, the phrase "rose from the dead" confirms the biblical teaching that the dead are in the grave. Lazarus was not asked to "come down from heaven" or "come up from hell," but to *rise from the dead*.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
We are saved by trusting the promise of God as revealed in His Word. This is the faith of Abraham (Romans 4:3). Seeking signs is often an evasion of the duty to repent and obey the plain teachings of the Bible.

### Q7. When are the wicked punished?

“The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished." 2 Peter 2:9.

**Answer:**

This verse provides the doctrinal timeline that clarifies the parable.

*   **"Reserved" vs. "Punished Now":** Peter clearly states that the unjust are "reserved" (kept in custody) *until* the day of judgment. A prisoner is not punished before his trial.
*   **Justice of God:** It would be unjust for God to throw a soul into hellfire at the moment of death, only to pull them out thousands of years later for the Judgment Day, and then throw them back in.
*   **The Order of Events:**
    1.  Death (Sleep in the grave).
    2.  Resurrection (John 5:28-29).
    3.  Judgment.
    4.  Reward or Punishment.
    Therefore, the rich man burning in flames immediately after death must be a figure of speech, not a literal reality, or else it contradicts Peter's plain teaching.

**Definition:**
**Investigative Judgment:** The work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary (Daniel 7:9-10), reviewing the records of men before He returns, to determine who is accounted worthy of the resurrection of life.

---

### Q8. When will the judgment take place?

“I charge thee therefore before God, and the lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom." 2 Tim. 4:1.

**Answer:**

*   **The Time of Judgment:** Paul charges Timothy by the judgment which happens "at His appearing." This refers to the Second Coming of Christ.
*   **The Implications:** If the judgment of the dead happens at Christ's appearing, then the dead cannot be in heaven or hell right now. They are waiting for that day.
*   **The Harmony of Scripture:** This verse aligns with the Great Controversy theme. The universe waits for the final vindication of God's character and the judgment of the wicked, which occurs at the end of the age, not individually at every funeral.

---

### Q9. When are the righteous to be recompensed?

“And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just." Luke 14:14.

**Answer:**

*   **Reward at Resurrection:** Jesus Himself teaches that the "recompense" (reward) is given at the "resurrection of the just."
*   **Not at Death:** If Lazarus literally went to his reward in heaven immediately at death, Jesus' statement in Luke 14:14 would be confusing. But if we understand death as a sleep until the resurrection, the Bible is consistent.
*   **The Blessed Hope:** The hope of the Christian is not death, but the resurrection from the dead at the return of Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4:16-18).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
When a worker labors all month, he does not get paid every hour. He waits for "payday." The Christian labors in this life, sleeps in death, and receives the reward on the great Payday—the Resurrection morning.

### Q10. When do the angels gather the elect to Christ?

“And they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24:30, 31.

**Answer:**

*   **The Gathering:** The angels gather the elect (the saved) when the trumpet sounds at the Second Coming.
*   **The Conclusion:** If the angels gather the saints *then*, they are not gathering them one by one at death now.
*   **Revisiting the Parable:** Since we have established from Scripture that (1) the wicked are reserved until judgment to be punished, and (2) the righteous are rewarded at the resurrection, we are forced to the conclusion—as the note states—that Jesus used a literary device called **personification**.

**Definition:**
**Personification:** A figure of speech where inanimate objects, abstract concepts, or the dead are described as having life, personality, and speech to make a vivid point.

### Q11. Does God in other places speak of things that do not exist, as though they did exist?

“(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations) before Him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were." Rom. 4:17.

**Answer:**

*   **God's Perspective:** God inhabits eternity. When He speaks of a future event that is certain to happen, He often speaks of it as if it has already happened.
*   **Certainty of Judgment:** In the parable, Jesus speaks of the future judgment of the wicked as if it were happening presently to the rich man. This emphasizes the *certainty* of the judgment, not the *timing*.
*   **Faith:** Just as Abraham was called a "father of many nations" before he had even one son, God speaks of the final separation of the righteous and wicked as a finished reality to warn us of the consequences of our choices.

---

### Q12. Name some instances given in the Old Testament which show that the figure of personification is a common mode of expression.

“For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it." Hab. 2:11. (See also 2 Kings 14:9; Judges 9:7-15; Gen. 4:10).

**Answer:**

The Bible frequently uses personification:

*   **Habakkuk 2:11:** Stones and beams are described as crying out and answering each other. We know stones do not have vocal cords or consciousness; this vividly illustrates that the crimes committed within those walls witness against the sinner.
*   **Genesis 4:10:** God told Cain, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground." Blood does not literally speak, but the injustice demanded attention.
*   **Judges 9:7-15:** Jotham tells a parable where trees (the olive, fig, and vine) talk to one another. No one interprets this to mean trees have personality.
*   **Application to Luke 16:** Similarly, Jesus gives the dead "tongues" and "eyes" and "voices" in the parable to teach a lesson, not to create a doctrine that contradicts the rest of Scripture regarding the unconscious sleep of the dead (Ecclesiastes 9:5).

---

### Q13. Does the New Testament sometimes use the same method?

“Behold the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth." James 5:4.

**Answer:**

*   **Inanimate Objects Speaking:** Here, unpaid wages ("hire") are said to "cry out." This is clearly metaphorical. The injustice is so great it is as if the money itself is screaming for judgment.
*   **Consistency:** If the New Testament can describe wages crying out without us believing coins have mouths, it can describe a rich man crying out in Hades without forcing us to believe the dead are conscious before the resurrection.
*   **Summary of the Study:**
    1.  The dead sleep until the resurrection (Job 14:12; John 11:11-14).
    2.  Rewards and punishments occur at the Second Coming (Matthew 16:27).
    3.  The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus uses the literary device of personification to teach that our character is fixed at death and that we must believe the Word of God ("Moses and the prophets") now, during our probation.
    4.  The "gulf fixed" is the decision of the will. We must choose Christ and His righteousness today, for we cannot choose Him after we die.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A map is a representation of reality, but it is not the land itself. A parable is a "map" of truth. We must not mistake the symbols on the map (fingers, tongues, water, bosoms) for the literal geography of the afterlife, but rather follow the direction the map points: to repentance, faith in God's Word, and preparation for the judgment.
