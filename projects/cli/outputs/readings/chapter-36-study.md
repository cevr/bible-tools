# Chapter 36: Sufferings of Christ

### Q1. Why did Christ come into the world?
“This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.” (1 Timothy 1:15)

**Answer:**
The primary mission of Jesus Christ was a rescue mission. He did not come merely to teach morality or to set a good example, but to intervene in a desperate situation where humanity was lost.

*   **To Save, Not Excuse:** The text says He came to *save* sinners, not to excuse sin or leave them in it. The name "Jesus" means "Jehovah saves" (Matthew 1:21), specifically "from their sins."
*   **The Universal Need:** Paul calls himself the "chief" of sinners. This highlights that no one is too far gone for the arm of Christ to reach.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Salvation involves two distinct but inseparable works:
    *   **Justification:** Being saved from the *penalty* of sin (death) by having Christ's past obedience credited to our account.
    *   **Sanctification:** Being saved from the *power* of sin in our daily lives by Christ’s indwelling Spirit. He comes to restore the image of God in man.

> **Definition:**
> **Salvation:** The complete work of God to rescue man from the ruin of sin, restoring him to favor with God (justification) and fitness for heaven (sanctification).

**[ILL]** Imagine a man drowning in a stormy ocean. He does not need a swimming instructor to shout lessons from the shore; he needs a lifeguard to jump in, pull him out, and resuscitate him. We were drowning in sin; Christ jumped into the "waters" of humanity to pull us out.

### Q2. What prompted God to give His Son to die for man?
“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16; see also 1 John 4:9, 10; Romans 5:8)

**Answer:**
The motive power behind the plan of salvation is the immense, self-sacrificing love of the Father.

*   **The Father’s Love:** A common error is to think Jesus died to convince an angry Father to love us. On the contrary, the Atonement was the *result* of the Father’s love. "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself" (2 Corinthians 5:19).
*   **The Cost:** God gave His "only begotten Son." This was an infinite sacrifice for the Father, equal to the sacrifice of the Son.
*   **The Great Controversy:** Satan charges that God is selfish. The cross demonstrates that God is love—willing to give everything to save His enemies (Romans 5:10).

> **Definition:**
> **Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man. It includes Christ’s sacrifice on the cross (the offering) and His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (the application of the blood) to cleanse us from sin.

**[ILL]** If a judge had to sentence his own son to a massive fine for a crime, justice would demand the fine be paid. If the judge then stood up, took off his robe, and paid the fine himself from his own bank account, he would satisfy both justice and love. God’s law could not be changed, so He gave Himself in His Son to pay the debt.

### Q3. What did the prophet say Christ would be called to endure?
“He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not his mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare His generation? for He was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was He stricken.” (Isaiah 53:7, 8)

**Answer:**
Isaiah prophesied the vicarious (substitutional) nature of Christ's suffering hundreds of years before the event.

*   **The Lamb of God:** This language points directly to the Sanctuary service. Every morning and evening, and on Passover, a lamb died for sins it did not commit. Christ is the Antitype (the fulfillment) of all those sacrifices (John 1:29).
*   **Silent Submission:** He did not argue or defend Himself. He trusted entirely in the Father for vindication (1 Peter 2:23).
*   **Substitution:** "For the transgression of my people was He stricken." He took the blow that the law aimed at the sinner.

> **Definition:**
> **Vicarious Atonement:** One standing in the place of another. Christ suffered *in our stead* so that we might receive the righteousness that belongs to Him.

**[ILL]** In the ancient sanctuary, the sinner placed his hand on the head of the innocent animal and confessed his sin. Symbolically, the sin moved from the man to the lamb. The man walked away free; the lamb died. At the cross, the "hand" of faith transfers our guilt to Jesus, the Lamb of God.

---

### Q4. Must not Christ have known beforehand of these things?
“Then He took unto Him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. For He shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on; and they shall scourge Him, and put Him to death.” (Luke 18:31-33)

**Answer:**
Yes, Christ walked into the jaws of death with His eyes wide open.

*   **Omniscience and Courage:** Jesus was not a victim of circumstance; He was a voluntary sacrifice. He knew every detail of the humiliation awaiting Him, yet He set His face like a flint to go to Jerusalem (Isaiah 50:7).
*   **Fulfillment of Prophecy:** Jesus confirms that the Old Testament prophecies (like Isaiah 53) were about Him.
*   **Love vs. Fear:** His foreknowledge highlights the depth of His love. Knowing the pain, He still chose us.

**[ILL]** A soldier might charge into battle hoping he won't be hit. A firefighter might rush into a building hoping to survive. But Jesus rushed into the "burning building" of this world knowing with 100% certainty that He would die in the flames, yet He went in anyway to save us.

---

### Q5. How did the Saviour feel when the sins of the world were upon Him?
“And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then saith He unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with Me.” (Matthew 26:37, 38)

**Answer:**
In Gethsemane, the spiritual weight of the world’s sin began to crush the life out of Christ.

*   **Sorrow unto Death:** This was not a fear of physical death (many martyrs have died singing). This was the horror of separation from God caused by sin (Isaiah 59:2). He was tasting the "second death"—the hopeless feeling of total abandonment by God—on behalf of every sinner (Hebrews 2:9).
*   **The Weight of Sin:** The guilt of every murder, every lie, every adulterous thought, and every act of selfishness was laid upon Him.
*   **Need for Sympathy:** In His humanity, He longed for human companionship ("watch with Me"), showing He was truly man, sharing our infirmities.

**[ILL]** Imagine wearing a coat that is heavy, filthy, and infected with a deadly disease. Now imagine that coat is glued to your skin. Sin is that coat. Christ, the Purity of Heaven, was clothed in the filthy rags of our unrighteousness, and the revulsion He felt was agonizing.

---

### Q6. In His distress, for what did He pray?
“And He went a little farther, and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.” (Matthew 26:39)

**Answer:**
He prayed for a way of escape, but ultimately for the will of God to be done.

*   **The Cup:** In Scripture, the "cup" often represents God's wrath or judgment against sin (Jeremiah 25:15; Revelation 14:10). Jesus was about to drink the penalty of the broken law.
*   **The Battle of Will:** This is the center of the plan of salvation. Adam fell because he exalted his will above God’s. The Second Adam (Christ) overcame because He surrendered His will entirely to God.
*   **The Model of Victory:** We overcome sin not by our own strength, but by this same surrender: "Not my will, but Thine be done."

> **Definition:**
> **Sanctification:** The process of having our will merged with God's will, so that we obey Him naturally and out of love.

**[ILL]** Two captains are steering ships in a storm. One insists on steering his own course and wrecks on the rocks. The other (Christ) hands the wheel over to the Admiral (the Father), even though the course leads through the darkest waves. Only through submission is the ship saved.

---

### Q7. How great was the agony of His soul?
“And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” (Luke 22:44)

**Answer:**
The mental and spiritual anguish was so intense that it broke the capillaries in His forehead, forcing blood into His sweat glands (hematidrosis).

*   **The Cost of Sin:** This reveals that sin is not a trivial mistake; it is a crushing burden that kills.
*   **The Real Sacrifice:** The physical pain of the cross was terrible, but the agony in Gethsemane shows that the true sacrifice was the rupture of the relationship between the Father and the Son caused by our sin.
*   **Victory:** He was winning the battle against Satan here. By accepting the cup, He secured the salvation of the human race.

---

### Q8. After this remarkable prayer, what happened to cause Him more grief?
“And while He yet spake, behold a mu1titude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss Him. But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?” (Luke 22:47, 48)

**Answer:**
He was betrayed by one of His own disciples, using a symbol of friendship and affection.

*   **Hypocrisy:** A kiss is a sign of affection. Judas used the forms of religion and love to serve the purposes of the enemy. This warns us against having a form of godliness while denying the power thereof (2 Timothy 3:5).
*   **Wounded in the House of Friends:** Zechariah 13:6 predicted He would be wounded in the house of His friends.
*   **Christ’s Patience:** Even in this moment, Jesus called him "Friend" (Matthew 26:50), giving Judas one last chance to repent, though his heart was hardened.

---

### Q9. To what place was He taken?
“Then took they Him, and led Him, and brought Him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.” (Luke 22:54)

**Answer:**
He was taken to the religious authorities—the High Priest’s house (Caiaphas and Annas).

*   **The Irony:** The True High Priest of the universe (Hebrews 8:1) stood to be judged by the earthly, corrupt high priest. The shadow (earthly priest) was judging the Substance (Christ).
*   **Following Afar Off:** Peter's physical distance reflected his spiritual distance. When we disconnect from Christ's presence, we are vulnerable to temptation.

---

### Q10. While at the high priest's house, what act of Peter's caused the Saviour additional suffering?
“Another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with Him; for He is a Galilean. And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. And the Lord turned; and looked upon Peter.” (Luke 22:59-61)

**Answer:**
Peter, the disciple who claimed he would die for Jesus, denied knowing Him three times with cursing.

*   **Self-Confidence Failed:** Peter had trusted in his own strength ("Though all men shall be offended... yet will I never," Matt 26:33). This illustrates that human promises and willpower are insufficient against Satan. We need Christ's power working *in* us.
*   **The Look of Love:** Jesus did not look at Peter with anger, but with pity and sorrow. That look broke Peter's heart and led to genuine repentance (godly sorrow), unlike Judas's remorse (worldly sorrow).

**[ILL]** A reed standing in a river might boast, "I will not bend." But when the flood comes, it snaps. Christ is the Rock. Only by being anchored in the Rock can we withstand the pressure to deny our Lord.

---

### Q11. What reproachful things were done to Christ while He was at the high priest's house?
“And the men that held Jesus mocked Him, and smote Him. And when they had blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face, and asked Him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?” (Luke 22:63, 64)

**Answer:**
He faced physical abuse and mockery of His prophetic office.

*   **Humiliation:** The Creator of the universe allowed His creatures to strike Him.
*   **Testing His Deity:** They challenged Him to use His divine power for self-defense ("Prophesy!"). Jesus always refused to use miracles to save Himself; His power was reserved for saving others.

---

### Q12. Where was Christ next taken?
“And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led Him into their council.” (Luke 22:66)

**Answer:**
He was taken before the Sanhedrin, the supreme religious court of Israel.

---

### Q13. What was their object in taking Him there, since it was not in their power judicially to sentence Him?
“Then said they all, Art Thou then the Son of God? And He said unto them, Ye say that I am. And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of His own mouth.” (Luke 22:70, 71)

**Answer:**
Their object was to secure a confession of "blasphemy" to justify a death sentence under Jewish law, which they would then translate into a political charge for the Romans.

*   **The Great Confession:** Jesus publicly affirmed His Divinity ("I am"). This is the central claim of Christianity. If He were not God, He would indeed be a blasphemer.
*   **Rejection of Truth:** The leaders had sufficient evidence (miracles, Scripture) that He was the Messiah, but their hearts were hard.

---

### Q14. Having procured the pretext they sought, what did they next do?
“And the whole multitude of them arose, and led Him unto Pilate.” (Luke 23:1)

**Answer:**
They took Him to the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.

*   **Church and State:** The religious power (Jewish leaders) sought the arm of the civil power (Rome) to enforce their decree and execute the "heretic." This is a prophetic type of how persecution arises in the end times (Revelation 13).

---

### Q15. When Pilate desired to let Christ go, how did they remonstrate?
“And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.” (Luke 23:5)

**Answer:**
They accused Him of sedition—stirring up trouble against the government. This was a lie, as Jesus taught, "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's" (Matthew 22:21).

---

### Q16. When Pilate heard that Christ had been in Galilee, what did he do?
“And as soon as he knew that He belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.” (Luke 23:7)

**Answer:**
Pilate tried to pass the responsibility to Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee.

*   **Evading Responsibility:** Pilate knew Jesus was innocent but feared the crowd. He hoped Herod would solve the problem. One cannot remain neutral about Jesus; we must decide.

---

### Q17. Did the chief priests and scribes follow Christ before Herod?
“And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.” (Luke 23:10)

**Answer:**
Yes, their hatred was relentless. They pursued Him from court to court.

---

### Q18. What indignity did Herod put upon the Saviour?
“And Herod with his men of war set Him at nought, and mocked Him, and arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him again to Pilate.” (Luke 23:11)

**Answer:**
Herod treated Jesus as a source of entertainment, then mocked Him when Jesus refused to perform miracles.

*   **Silence before Herod:** Jesus spoke to Pilate, but He said *nothing* to Herod. Herod had silenced his own conscience by murdering John the Baptist. When the conscience is seared, God’s voice is no longer heard.
*   **The Mock King:** They dressed Him in a robe, mocking His royalty. Yet, even in silence, His dignity condemned them.

---

### Q19. When Christ was again brought before Pilate, what did Pilate propose to do?
“I have found no cause of death in Him: I will therefore chastise Him, and let Him go.” (Luke 23:22)

**Answer:**
Pilate proposed a compromise: he would punish an innocent man (scourging) to appease the crowd, then release Him.

*   **The Danger of Compromise:** Pilate tried to find a middle ground between right and wrong. There is no middle ground. Once he agreed to punish an innocent man, he gave up his moral authority and eventually crucified Him.

---

### Q20. At this proposition, how did Christ's accusers act?
“And they were instant [earnest] with loud voices, requiring that He might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.” (Luke 23:23)

**Answer:**
The mob, incited by the priests, demanded the most shameful Roman death: crucifixion.

*   **Rejection of Grace:** By choosing Barabbas (a murderer) over Jesus, the people symbolically chose the character of Satan over the character of God.

---

### Q21. Besides yielding to the clamors of the Jews, what cruelty did Pilate inflict upon Christ?
“Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged Him.” (John 19:1)

**Answer:**
Jesus was subjected to the Roman scourge—a whip with bone or metal pieces designed to tear flesh.

*   **By His Stripes:** "With his stripes we are healed" (Isaiah 53:5). The physical tearing of His body symbolized the breaking of His life to provide healing for ours.

---

### Q22. What shameful treatment did He receive from the soldiers?
“And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon His head, and a reed in His right hand: and they bowed the knee before Him, and mocked Him, saying Hail, King of the Jews! And they spit upon Him, and took the reed, and smote Him on the head.” (Matthew 27:29, 30)

**Answer:**
They mocked His Kingship with a crown of thorns and a reed scepter.

*   **The Curse:** Thorns were the result of the curse of sin (Genesis 3:18). Jesus literally wore the curse on His head.
*   **True Royalty:** Even in this mockery, He was the true King. His ability to endure such abuse with love proves His divine nobility.

---

### Q23. After bringing Him to the place of crucifixion, what did they offer Him to stupefy Him?
“They gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall; and when He had tasted thereof, He would not drink.” (Matthew 27:34)

**Answer:**
They offered a narcotic mixture to dull the pain. Jesus refused it.

*   **Clear Mind:** Jesus refused to have His mind clouded. He needed to hold fast to His faith in God while the darkness of sin engulfed Him. He wanted to meet the enemy (death and Satan) with full consciousness.
*   **Temperance:** Even in death, Christ practiced strict temperance, refusing anything that would impair His reason.

---

### Q24. What prayer did He utter as they were nailing Him to the cross?
“Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” (Luke 23:34)

**Answer:**
While suffering the sharpest physical pain (the driving of nails), He prayed for the forgiveness of His tormentors.

*   **God's Character:** This is the ultimate revelation of God's heart. He loves His enemies.
*   **Imputed Righteousness:** He was pleading His blood on their behalf even before they asked. This gives us hope that He intercedes for us today.

**[ILL]** If you step on a flower, it crushes and dies, but in dying, it leaves its fragrance on your heel. Men crushed the "Rose of Sharon" (Jesus), and His response was the fragrance of forgiveness.

---

### Q25. With what words did they taunt Him while on the cross?
“Likewise also the chief priests mocking Him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; Himself He can not save. If He be the King of the Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.” (Matthew 27:41, 42)

**Answer:**
They taunted Him to save Himself, claiming that self-preservation would prove His divinity.

*   **The Great Truth:** They spoke a truth they did not understand: "Himself He cannot save." Why? Because love seeks not its own. If He had saved Himself, He could not have saved us. He chose to stay on the cross for you and me.

---

### Q26. As He cried out in agony on the cross, what was again offered Him?
“And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink.” (Matthew 27:48)

**Answer:**
In His thirst, they offered Him vinegar (sour wine). This fulfilled the prophecy of Psalm 69:21: "In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink."

---

### Q27. What closed this terrible scene?
“When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished: and He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost.” (John 19:30)

**Answer:**
With the shout of victory, "It is finished," Jesus died.

*   **Paid in Full:** The Greek word *Tetelestai* means "Paid in Full." The debt of sin was paid.
*   **Type Meets Antitype:** The sacrificial system pointed to this moment. The real Lamb had died; the shadow services were no longer needed.
*   **Atonement Secured:** The foundation for our salvation was laid.

---

### Q28. What wonderful demonstration attested nature's sympathy with the dying Son of God?
“And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.” (Luke 23:44, 45)

**Answer:**
Darkness covered the land, and the heavy veil in the temple tore from top to bottom.

*   **The Darkness:** God the Father was present, suffering with His Son, but veiled in darkness (Psalm 18:11). It symbolized the darkness of sin that Christ was bearing.
*   **The Rent Veil:** The barrier between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place was torn by an unseen hand. This signified:
    1.  The end of the earthly sanctuary system (the earthly lamb was no longer needed).
    2.  A new and living way was opened for us to access God directly through Christ (Hebrews 10:19-20).

> **Definition:**
> **Sanctuary Service:** The earthly model God gave Moses to illustrate salvation. The "Veil" separated the people from the direct presence of God. Christ's death tore that veil, giving us access to the Father.

---

### Q29. Was it necessary for Christ thus to suffer?
“For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.” (Hebrews 2:10)

**Answer:**
Yes, suffering was necessary to qualify Him as our High Priest and Saviour.

*   **Not Moral Improvement:** Jesus was already morally perfect and sinless.
*   **Experiential Perfection:** Being made "perfect" here means being *completely qualified* or *fitted* for the office of High Priest. By suffering as a human, He learned how to succor (help) those who are tempted (Hebrews 2:18). He knows our pain from the inside out.

**[ILL]** A doctor may know all the medical facts about a broken leg. But a doctor who has *had* a broken leg knows the pain personally. Christ is the Great Physician who has suffered our diseases so He can heal us with perfect sympathy.

---

### Q30. What follows from the fact that God gave us His only Son?
“He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” (Romans 8:32)

**Answer:**
This is the guarantee of all other blessings.

*   **The Argument from the Greater to the Lesser:** If God gave the greatest gift (Jesus) while we were enemies, will He withhold the lesser gifts (strength, wisdom, bread, power to overcome sin) now that we are His children?
*   **Power to Obey:** This verse is a rock for Righteousness by Faith. If you struggle with a specific sin, remember: God gave Jesus to die for that sin; He will surely give you the Holy Spirit's power to overcome it.

**Conclusion:**
The sufferings of Christ are the price of our redemption. They demonstrate the immutability of the Law (which required death for sin) and the immensity of God's Love (which provided the substitute). Through faith in this sacrifice, we are justified; and by the power of the risen Saviour living in us, we are sanctified.
