### Introduction

This study examines the vital role of obedience in the plan of salvation. From the standpoint of the "Third Angel’s Message" (Revelation 14:12), the remnant people of God are identified by two characteristics: the patience of the saints, keeping the commandments of God, and having the faith of Jesus.

Many confuse obedience with legalism (trying to earn heaven by works). However, true biblical obedience is the fruit of faith—it is the inevitable result of Christ living out His life within the believer (Galatians 2:20). God’s law is a transcript of His character; therefore, to be restored to His image means being brought back into harmony with His law through the power of the Holy Spirit.

### Q1. How does God regard obedience to His word?
“Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." 1 Samuel 15:22.

**Answer:**
God places the surrender of the will above all outward forms of religion. In this account, King Saul offered a sacrifice to God, yet he did so while willfully disregarding God’s specific instructions. Samuel’s rebuke teaches us that religious activity—church attendance, tithes, or ministry—cannot substitute for a heart that listens to and follows God’s voice.

*   **The Nature of True Obedience:** It is not merely outward compliance but an inward attitude of "hearkening" (listening with intent to follow). It springs from love, not fear of punishment (John 14:15).
*   **The Failure of Ritualism:** In the earthly sanctuary service, the "fat of rams" was meaningful only as it represented a contrite heart trusting in the coming Redeemer. When offered by a disobedient heart, it became an abomination (Proverbs 28:9).
*   **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** We cannot cover a cherished sin with a religious offering. We must surrender the sin to Christ. Justification (being declared righteous) is not a cloak for disobedience; it is the gateway to a life where the law is written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).

> **Definition:**
> *   **Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit sets the believer apart for God's use, transforming their character to be like Jesus, resulting in a life of willing obedience (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a child who breaks a vase because he was playing ball in the house after being told not to. He then brings his mother a bouquet of flowers to smooth things over, but immediately picks up the ball to play in the house again. Does the mother delight in the flowers? No. She desires a heart that respects her word. So it is with God; He desires the surrender of our will more than our "flowers" of formal worship.

### Q2. To what are rebellion and stubbornness likened?
“For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry." 1 Samuel 15:23.

**Answer:**
The Holy Spirit uses strong language here to show the true nature of sin.
*   **Witchcraft:** Witchcraft is seeking power or knowledge from a source other than God. When we rebel against God’s Word to follow our own way, we are effectively cutting ourselves off from God’s power and placing ourselves under the control of the enemy.
*   **Idolatry:** Stubbornness is called idolatry because it elevates the human will above the Divine will. When a man refuses to yield his opinion to a "Thus saith the Lord," he is worshipping himself. He has made an idol of his own mind.

This reveals that the root of all sin is self-worship (Isaiah 14:12–14). The remedy is the complete humbling of self and the enthroning of Christ in the heart.

### Q3. What excuse did Saul make for his disobedience?
“I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice." 1 Samuel 15:24.

**Answer:**
Saul’s downfall was the fear of man rather than the fear of God.
*   **The Trap of Peer Pressure:** Saul knew what was right, but the pressure of the crowd caused him to compromise. This is a warning for the last days, where popularity and majority opinion will often run contrary to the commandments of God (Exodus 23:2).
*   **Shifted Responsibility:** A sign of an unrepentant heart is blaming circumstances or other people for our sins. True repentance involves saying, "I have sinned," without adding "but..." (Psalm 51:3–4).

> **Definition:**
> *   **Transgression:** Literally "stepping across." It is the act of crossing the boundary line God has set for our protection and happiness (1 John 3:4).

**[ILL]**
A compass needle should point north. If you place a magnet near it, the needle will swing toward the magnet instead. Saul’s heart should have pointed to God, but the "magnet" of the people’s praise pulled him off course. We must be grounded in Christ so that no earthly magnet can divert our loyalty from His law.

### Q4. How strictly does God require His commandments to be kept?
"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you." Deuteronomy 4:2.

**Answer:**
God requires exact obedience because His law is perfect (Psalm 19:7).
1.  **No Adding:** We must not add human traditions or burdensome rules that God has not imposed (Matthew 15:9). This leads to legalism and Pharisees.
2.  **No Diminishing:** We must not explain away the parts of the Bible that are inconvenient or unpopular. This leads to liberalism and lawlessness.
3.  **The Standard:** God’s government is exact. Just as the laws of physics (gravity, inertia) are constant, so the moral law is unchangeable. Jesus came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill it—to show us how to keep it through the power of the Spirit (Matthew 5:17).

**[ILL]**
If a doctor writes a prescription for a specific medicine to cure a deadly disease, would you say, "I will take away two ingredients and add three of my own"? No. To alter the prescription is to invite death. God’s Word is the prescription for the sin-sick soul; we must take it exactly as the Great Physician has written it.

### Q5. Who was sent from Judah to Bethel with a message from God?
“And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense." 1 Kings 13:1.

**Answer:**
A nameless "man of God" (a prophet) was sent to rebuke King Jeroboam, who had set up a counterfeit system of worship (golden calves) to keep the people from going to Jerusalem. God sent a messenger to protest against this false worship, showing that God does not leave His people without warning when they drift into apostasy.

---

### Q6. What did king Jeroboam invite the man to do?
“And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward." 1 Kings 13:7.

**Answer:**
After the prophet gave his message, the king tried to neutralize the rebuke with hospitality and bribery. This is a common tactic of the enemy: if he cannot silence the truth with threats, he attempts to dilute it with worldly favor, compromise, and "rewards."

---

### Q7. What reply did he return to the king?
“If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place; for so was it charged me by the word of the Lord." 1 Kings 13:8, 9.

**Answer:**
At first, the man of God stood firm. He understood that to eat with the king would be to fellowship with his idolatry (1 Corinthians 5:11). His refusal was based on a direct command from God: "Eat no bread, nor drink water." His loyalty to God’s word was stronger than the allure of the king’s palace.

---

### Q8. Who also dwelt at Bethel?
“Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel." 1 Kings 13:11.

**Answer:**
This "old prophet" represents those who once knew the truth and had a reputation for godliness but had lost their connection with Heaven. He was living in the midst of idolatry (Bethel) without protesting against it. He represents a backslidden church or leader who retains the title of "prophet" but lacks the Spirit.

---

### Q9. What did this old prophet say to the man of God?
“Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread." 1 Kings 13:15.

**Answer:**
The temptation now came from a different source. It was no longer the wicked king, but a fellow "prophet." The test of obedience often becomes hardest when the temptation comes from within the church or from respected religious leaders.

---

### Q10. After hearing his refusal, and the reason for it, what did he say to the man of God?
“He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him." 1 Kings 13:18.

**Answer:**
This is the crux of the deception. The old prophet claimed to have a fresh revelation ("an angel spake unto me") that contradicted the plain Word of God given to the man of God earlier.
*   **The Test of Truth:** God does not contradict Himself (Malachi 3:6). If an angel, a prophet, or a miracle worker speaks something contrary to what God has already commanded in His Word, they are to be rejected (Galatians 1:8; Isaiah 8:20).
*   **The Danger:** We must never trust "impressions," "feelings," or the word of man above the written Word of God.

---

### Q11. What effect did this persuasive statement have upon him?
” So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water." 1 Kings 13:19.

**Answer:**
The man of God fell because he trusted the word of a man over the Word of God. He likely thought, "This man is older and more experienced; surely God has spoken to him." This illustrates a fatal error: delegating our conscience to others. Every believer must study the Word for themselves and obey it, regardless of what others say.

---

### Q12. What was the result of his yielding to the lying importunities of the prophet?
“Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou has disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee, but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulcher of thy fathers." 1 Kings 13:21, 22.

**Answer:**
The result was judgment and death (he was later killed by a lion). This severe outcome teaches us that God is particular. It might have seemed a "small thing" to eat a meal, but the act involved doubting God's veracity.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Faith is taking God at His word. When we disobey, we are demonstrating unbelief.
*   **Solemn Warning:** Even those who have been used by God to do great things (like this man of God) can fall if they take their eyes off the Master and listen to human voices.

### Q13. Where was the priest to obtain the fire with which he offered incense in the sanctuary?
” And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord." Lev. 16:12.

**Answer:**
In the earthly sanctuary, the fire on the altar of burnt offering was originally kindled by God Himself (Leviticus 9:24). It was "holy fire."
*   **Sanctuary Typology:** The fire represents the merit of Christ’s sacrifice and the work of the Holy Spirit. Only the fire that God provides can make our prayers (incense) acceptable. We cannot generate this heat or light ourselves.

---

### Q14. What two priests ventured to disobey this instruction?
“And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not." Lev. 10:1.

**Answer:**
Nadab and Abihu, the sons of the High Priest, used "strange fire"—common fire of their own kindling—instead of the holy fire from the altar.
*   **The Meaning of Strange Fire:** This represents trying to serve God with common, human energy, excitement, or methods, rather than the sanctified power of the Holy Spirit. It represents **Self-Righteousness**—bringing our own "good works" to God instead of relying wholly on the merits of Christ (the true Altar).
*   **Alcohol Connection:** Leviticus 10:9 suggest they may have been under the influence of alcohol, which clouded their ability to distinguish between the holy and the profane.

> **Definition:**
> *   **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation. In the sanctuary, this could only be accomplished by the blood (life) of the victim and the fire (power) of God. Man has no part in providing the atonement; his part is to accept it.

---

### Q15. And what came of their disobedience?
“And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord." Lev. 10:2.

**Answer:**
The fire of God’s presence, which is life to the obedient, became a consuming fire to the disobedient (Hebrews 12:29). This demonstrates that God is holy. We cannot approach Him in a careless, self-willed manner. The plan of salvation is designed to save us *from* sin, not *in* sin.

---

### Q16. For what purpose were these Old Testament examples written?
“Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come." 1 Cor. 10:11.

**Answer:**
These are not merely old stories; they are types and shadows for the church in the last days.
*   **Admonition:** We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement. Just as ancient Israel had to afflict their souls and put away sin during that day, so we, "upon whom the ends of the world are come," are called to a standard of holiness through faith in Jesus.
*   **Historicism:** We stand at the climax of the Great Controversy. The deceptions of the "old prophet" and the temptation of "strange fire" are rampant today. We need the Bible as our safeguard.

---

### Q17. In view of these examples, what ought all to do?
“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves." James 1:22.

**Answer:**
Hearing the truth, agreeing with the truth, or even teaching the truth does not save a man. The truth must be assimilated into the life.
*   **Self-Deception:** The most dangerous deception is believing we are saved because we know the correct doctrines, while our hearts remain unchanged and rebellious.
*   **Practical Application:** If we know the Sabbath is holy, we must keep it. If we know our bodies are temples, we must care for them. Faith that does not lead to action is dead (James 2:26).

**[ILL]**
A man may study a map for hours, memorizing every turn and landmark. But if he never gets in the car and drives, he will never reach his destination. Being a "hearer only" is like memorizing the map but staying home. Being a "doer" is traveling the path to the Kingdom.

---

### Q18. Who only will enter the kingdom of heaven?
” Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven." Matt. 7:21.

**Answer:**
Jesus destroys the false hope of those who claim a relationship ("Lord, Lord") without the reality of surrender.
*   **The Will of the Father:** This is summarized in the Ten Commandments and the law of self-sacrificing love.
*   **Imputed vs. Imparted Righteousness:** We are saved solely by Christ's merit (imputed righteousness), but the evidence that we have received this merit is that we begin to do the Father's will (imparted righteousness). A "faith" that does not produce obedience is a counterfeit.

---

### Q19. To whom does Christ liken the man who obeys the word of God?
“I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock." Matt. 7:24, 25.

**Answer:**
*   **The Rock:** The Rock is Jesus Christ and His unchangeable Word (1 Corinthians 10:4).
*   **The Wise Builder:** He digs deep. He doesn't just place his religious life on the surface of feelings or tradition. He digs down until he finds the solid Word of God and anchors his life there by obedience.
*   **The Storm:** Trials, temptations, and the final judgment will test every character. Those united with Christ by faith and obedience will stand.

---

### Q20. To whom does He liken him who hears, but does not obey?
“And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand, and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it." Matt. 7:26, 27.

**Answer:**
*   **The Sand:** Human theories, popular opinion, feelings, and traditions. Sand shifts. It looks solid in the sunshine, but it dissolves in the storm.
*   **The Foolish Builder:** Notice that he also built a house. He may have looked just like the wise man to the casual observer. He went to church, he heard the sayings of Jesus. But he did not *obey*. His religion was superficial.
*   **The Great Fall:** When the crisis comes, a character not formed by the indwelling power of Christ and obedience to His law will collapse.

**[ILL]**
Two ships may look identical in the harbor. But one has an anchor firmly lodged in the bedrock of the ocean floor; the other has an anchor that is just hanging in the water or resting on shifting mud. You cannot tell the difference in calm weather. But when the hurricane comes, one holds fast, and the other is driven onto the rocks. Obedience is the chain that connects us to the Anchor, Christ Jesus.

---

### Summary Note
God does not say one thing and mean another. As we have seen with Saul, the Man of God, and Nadab and Abihu, "small" deviations from God's express command are seen by Heaven as rebellion.

Today, the Christian world is tested on the Fourth Commandment. God says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord." Tradition says, "The first day." Like the Man of God in 1 Kings 13, we are faced with a choice: Do we follow the clear Word of the Lord, or the contradictory voice of "old prophets" and tradition? In the judgment, only the house built on the Rock of God's Word will stand.
