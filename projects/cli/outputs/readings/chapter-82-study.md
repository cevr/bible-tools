### Q1. In the old dispensation, how was an idolater punished?

**“And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.” (Deuteronomy 13:10 [verses 6–10])**

**Answer:**
Under the ancient Hebrew economy, idolatry was considered high treason against the King of kings. God had entered into a covenant relation with Israel, and He was their civil Ruler as well as their God. This form of government is known as a **Theocracy** (a government where God is recognized as the supreme civil ruler).

1.  **The Severity of the Sin:** Idolatry was not merely a difference of religious opinion; it was an act of sedition designed to "thrust" the people away from the Source of their life and liberty. Just as a traitor in wartime might face capital punishment for endangering the nation, the idolater endangered the spiritual existence of the entire camp.
2.  **The Lesson for Us:** While we do not live under a theocracy today, and therefore civil penalties for religious crimes have ceased, the spiritual reality remains. Idolatry separates the soul from God. To choose an idol—whether a literal statue or a cherished sin—is to cut oneself off from the only source of life.
3.  **Spiritual Application:**
    *   God is the "fountain of living waters" (Jeremiah 2:13). To turn to an idol is to choose a broken cistern that holds no water.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** The natural heart is an idol factory. We cannot cleanse ourselves of our hidden idols. We need the Spirit of God to write His law upon our hearts (Hebrews 8:10), displacing the love of self with the love of Christ.

**[ILL]** Imagine a deep-sea diver completely dependent on his air line for survival. If someone deliberately tries to sever that line, they are not just being annoying; they are attempting murder. In the wilderness, God was the "air line" for Israel. The idolater was attempting to cut the connection that kept the nation alive.

### Q2. What was done to a blasphemer?

**“And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him, as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land.” (Leviticus 24:16)**

**Answer:**
Blasphemy represents open defiance and contempt for the authority of the Creator. In the camp of Israel, it was an act of rebellion that threatened the covenant peace of the community.

1.  **The Holiness of God's Name:** The Third Commandment forbids taking the Lord's name in vain (Exodus 20:7). This is more than just using profanity; it is treating the holy character of God as common or unclean.
2.  **The Stranger and the Native:** Notice that the law applied to the "stranger" as well as the "born in the land." God’s moral government is universal.
3.  **The Heart Condition:** Blasphemy is the fruit of a heart at war with God (Romans 8:7). It indicates a character that has hardened itself against the influence of the Holy Spirit.
    *   **Sanctification:** A true Christian does not merely refrain from cursing; through the indwelling Christ, they learn to reverence God. Their speech becomes "always with grace, seasoned with salt" (Colossians 4:6).

**[ILL]** If a citizen in a kingdom were to walk into the throne room and spit upon the royal seal or the king’s crown, it would be an act of open insurrection. Blasphemy is the verbal act of spitting upon the character of the King of the Universe.

### Q3. How was a perverse son punished?

**“If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, ... all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die.” (Deuteronomy 21:18–21)**

**Answer:**
This statute reveals the foundational importance of the family unit in God's plan. This law was not for young children or minor offenses, but for a son who was old enough to be responsible ("a glutton and a drunkard," v. 20) and who persistently refused all parental authority and correction.

1.  **Authority and Order:** The Fifth Commandment, "Honor thy father and thy mother," is the first commandment with a promise (Ephesians 6:2). If authority is rejected in the home, it will eventually be rejected in society and against God.
2.  **The Danger of Rebellion:** A "stubborn and rebellious" spirit is akin to the "sin of witchcraft" (1 Samuel 15:23). It is the spirit of Satan, who rebelled against the Father.
3.  **The Gospel Appeal:**
    *   We are all, by nature, rebellious children. We have all strayed from our Heavenly Father.
    *   **Grace:** In the gospel, the Father does not stone the prodigal son; He runs to meet him (Luke 15:20). However, if we persistently reject His Spirit and refuse to obey His voice, we eventually cut ourselves off from His protection.

**[ILL]** A gangrene in a limb, if left unchecked, will poison the whole body and kill the patient. In the theocracy of Israel, such persistent, hardening rebellion was removed to save the rest of the "body" (the nation) from moral infection.

### Q4. What punishment was inflicted upon an adulterer?

**“The adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.” (Leviticus 20:10)**

**Answer:**
Adultery is a violation of the Seventh Commandment and strikes at the very heart of human society and the covenant relationship.

1.  **The Sacredness of Marriage:** Marriage is a symbol of the union between Christ and His church (Ephesians 5:31–32). To break the marriage vow is to violate a sacred trust and distort the image of God's faithfulness.
2.  **The Severity of the Consequence:** In the Old Testament, this sin was a capital offense because it destroyed family lines, inheritance, and the moral purity of the nation.
3.  **Christ’s Application:** When the woman caught in adultery was brought to Jesus, He did not deny that the law required death. Instead, He turned the searchlight of the law onto the accusers: "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone" (John 8:7).
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** Jesus told her, "Go, and sin no more." He provides the power to live a pure life. He does not condemn the penitent, but He does condemn the sin. His grace is not a license to sin, but the power to overcome lust (Titus 2:11–12).

**[ILL]** If you remove the supporting pillars of a house, the roof will collapse, destroying everyone inside. Marriage vows are the supporting pillars of society. Adultery removes those pillars. God's law was designed to protect the structure of the home.

### Q5. Has the death penalty for sin really been abolished?

**“For the wages of sin is death.” (Romans 6:23)**

**Answer:**
No, the penalty has not been abolished. The *administration* of the penalty by civil magistrates (stoning) has passed away with the theocracy, but the *moral* penalty remains unchanged. Sin inevitably produces death.

1.  **The Unchangeable Law:** God's law is a transcript of His character. It cannot change. Sin is the transgression of that law (1 John 3:4), and sin cuts the soul off from God, who is Life. Therefore, the inevitable result of sin is death.
2.  **The Nature of this Death:** This is not merely the first death (sleep in the grave), which all die, but the "Second Death"—eternal separation from God (Revelation 20:14).
3.  **The Gospel Solution:** The verse continues, "...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
    *   **Substitution:** Christ took the "wages" we earned (death) so that we might receive the "gift" He earned (life).
    *   **Justification:** God treats Christ as a sinner so He can treat us as righteous (2 Corinthians 5:21).
    *   **Sanctification:** If we accept the gift of life, we must cease working for the wages of sin. We cannot claim the gift while willfully continuing in the employment of Satan (Romans 6:16).

**[ILL]** If a man works all week at a job, he expects his paycheck. It is his "wages"—what he has earned. Sin pays a salary: death. We have all earned this salary. The only way to avoid "cashing that check" is to resign from the job of sinning and accept the free gift of life from Christ.

### Q6. Why is not the old penalty executed in this dispensation by gospel ministers?

**“Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.” (2 Corinthians 5:20)**

**Answer:**
In the New Testament dispensation, the church acts as an embassy of grace, not a court of civil justice.

1.  **Ambassadors, Not Executioners:** An ambassador represents a King in a foreign land. Their job is to deliver terms of peace and reconciliation, not to execute the King's judgment. That is reserved for the King Himself when He arrives.
2.  **Separation of Church and State:** Jesus taught, "My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight" (John 18:36). The church has no authority to use the sword of steel. We use the "sword of the Spirit," which is the Word of God (Ephesians 6:17).
3.  **The Day of Salvation:** We are currently in a time of probation—a period of grace where God is "beseeching" (begging) men to be reconciled. To execute immediate judgment now would cut short the time given for repentance (2 Peter 3:9).

**[ILL]** When a country is in rebellion, the King may send envoys offering full amnesty to anyone who lays down their arms. The envoys do not shoot the rebels; they plead with them to accept the pardon. We are those envoys.

### Q7. To whom does vengeance belong?

**“Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.” (Romans 12:19)**

**Answer:**
The authority to execute final vengeance and retribution belongs solely to God.

1.  **Human Limitation:** Humans cannot read the motives of the heart. We see the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). Therefore, we are unqualified to pass final judgment on any soul.
2.  **God's Justice:** God is the only Being in the universe capable of administering justice with perfect fairness, mingled with mercy. He waits until every case is decided and every heart revealed.
3.  **Practical Duty:** Because vengeance belongs to God, the Christian is called to forgive personal wrongs. "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good" (Romans 12:21). We are to leave the settling of accounts to the heavenly courts.

**[ILL]** A small child does not have the skill or judgment to perform complex surgery; if they try, they will only cause harm. Likewise, we do not have the wisdom to perform the "surgery" of divine judgment. We must leave the scalpel in the hands of the Great Physician and Judge.

### Q8. To whom has the execution of the death penalty for sin been committed?

**“For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.” (John 5:26, 27)**

**Answer:**
The final execution of judgment has been committed to Jesus Christ.

1.  **Why the Son of Man?** It is a profound comfort that our Judge is also our Saviour. Because He is the "Son of man," He has lived our life, felt our infirmities, and been tempted in all points as we are (Hebrews 4:15). He can judge with perfect empathy.
2.  **The Sanctuary Ministry:** In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ currently acts as our High Priest and Advocate. When the time of probation closes, He will stand up as the King and Judge (Daniel 12:1).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:**
    *   If we are "in Christ," we have nothing to fear from the judgment, for there is "no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus" (Romans 8:1).
    *   The Judge is our Friend. He desires to blot out our sins, not our names (Revelation 3:5). But we must cooperate with Him by repenting and allowing Him to cleanse us now.

**[ILL]** Imagine entering a courtroom trembling with fear, only to look up at the bench and realize the Judge is the very same person who sacrificed everything to pay your bail and defend your case. That is the position of the believer in Christ.

### Q9. And when will He execute it?

**“And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment upon all.” (Jude 14–15)**

**Answer:**
The execution of the penalty for sin takes place at the Second Coming and the final conclusion of the Great Controversy.

1.  **The Investigative vs. Executive Judgment:**
    *   **Investigative:** Before He comes, Christ examines the records to see who has accepted His robe of righteousness (Daniel 7:9–10). This is happening now in the heavenly sanctuary.
    *   **Executive:** When He returns, He brings His reward with Him (Revelation 22:12). The final destruction of sin and sinners (the "second death") occurs after the millennium (Revelation 20).
2.  **The Certainty of the Event:** Enoch, one of the earliest men, foresaw this day. It is the "blessed hope" for the righteous, but a day of terror for those who cling to sin.
3.  **Preparation:** Since judgment is certain, "what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness" (2 Peter 3:11)?
    *   **Definition - Atonement:** The process by which God reconciles humanity to Himself and cleanses the universe of sin.
    *   Now is the time to seek the Lord. The execution of judgment is "His strange act" (Isaiah 28:21), for He delights in mercy. But for the universe to be safe, sin must eventually be destroyed.

**[ILL]** A farmer allows the wheat and the tares (weeds) to grow together until the harvest. If he pulls them up too early, he might damage the wheat. But the harvest *is* coming. At the harvest, the separation is final. We are living in the growing season; the harvest is the executive judgment.
