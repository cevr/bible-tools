## Slide 1 – Q1: The Blotting Out of Ordinances

- **Question:** What was the result of blotting out the handwriting of ordinances?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 2:14–17
  - “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross...”
  - “Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days...”
  - “Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Laws and Shadows)

- **The Result:** The "blotting out" terminated the ceremonial system—the rituals, sacrifices, and festivals pointing to the Messiah.
- **Distinction Between Laws:**
  - The Bible distinguishes between the moral law (God's character) and the ceremonial law (remedy for sin).
  - Ceremonial laws were imposed until the time of reformation.
  - Hebrews 9:10 – “Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.”
- **Shadow vs. Body:**
  - A shadow has no substance; it is cast by a solid body.
  - The "body" is Christ. Since the reality has come, the shadows are no longer needed.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (The Cross)

- **Nailed to the Cross:**
  - Jesus’ death signaled the end of the earthly sacrificial system.
  - Matthew 27:51 – “And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.”
  - We no longer offer lambs because the Lamb of God has died.
- **Definitions:**
  - **Ceremonial Law:** Temporary types and symbols (sacrifices, festivals) teaching the gospel.
  - **Moral Law:** The Ten Commandments, defining sin and righteousness; eternal and unchangeable.
  - Psalm 111:7–8 – “The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Architect’s Blueprints:**
  - An architect draws blueprints to guide the construction of a house.
  - While building, the workers rely on the paper drawings.
  - Once the house is finished, you do not live in the paper blueprints; you live in the house.
- **Application:**
  - The ceremonial law was the blueprint or "shadow" of the plan of salvation.
  - Now that Christ (the House) is present, we do not cling to the old ritual system; we dwell in Him.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Writing of the Commandments

- **Question:** Upon what were the ten commandments written?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 4:13
  - “And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Permanence)

- **Written on Stone:**
  - Stone signifies durability, permanence, and an unchangeable nature.
  - Unlike ceremonial laws written in a book by Moses (Deuteronomy 31:24), the moral law was written directly by God.
  - This indicates the standard of righteousness is divine, not human.
- **New Covenant Connection:**
  - God does not abolish this law; He transfers the writing to the heart.
  - 2 Corinthians 3:3 – “Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Problem:** The fault was not the Law, but the stony hearts of the people.
- **Justification:** God forgives our transgressions of the law.
- **Sanctification:** God writes the principles of the law (love) into our nature, empowering obedience.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”
- **Transformation:**
  - Through faith, the external code on stone becomes an internal principle of the heart.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The King’s Decree:**
  - If a king writes a decree in sand near the ocean, the tide washes it away; it is temporary.
  - If he carves a decree into granite rock, it stands for ages.
- **Application:**
  - God wrote ceremonial ordinances on parchment (which decays).
  - He wrote the Ten Commandments on rock.
  - The method of atonement (sacrifices) changed, but the definition of right and wrong (the Law) stands forever.

## Slide 9 – Q3: The Manner of Writing

- **Question:** In what manner were they written on these tables of stone?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 32:16
  - “And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (God’s Finger)

- **Graven by God:**
  - They were engraved directly by God's finger.
  - Exodus 31:18 – “And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.”
- **Distinct from "Handwriting":**
  - Colossians 2:14 refers to the "handwriting" (*cheirographon*) of ordinances—Moses' writing.
  - The Ten Commandments are the "writing of God." God does not blot out His own character.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Judgment and Sanctuary

- **Basis of Judgment:**
  - Written by God, this law remains the standard of judgment.
  - James 2:12 – “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.”
- **Sanctuary Symbolism:**
  - The tables were placed *inside* the Ark, under the Mercy Seat.
  - Deuteronomy 10:5 – “And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me.”
  - God’s government is founded on law, covered by mercy.

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Constitution:**
  - A nation has temporary bylaws (like tax codes) that change with administrations.
  - The Constitution is the founding document defining the nation itself.
- **Application:**
  - Ceremonial laws were temporary bylaws for Israel.
  - The Ten Commandments are the Constitution of the Universe.
  - You cannot "blot out" the Constitution without destroying the government.

## Slide 13 – Q4: The Sabbath’s Purpose

- **Question:** For whom was the weekly Sabbath made?
- **Key Text:** Mark 2:27
  - “And He said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Key Points (For Man)

- **Universal Scope:**
  - "Made for man" means mankind, not just the Jews.
  - It applies to all people in all ages.
- **A Gift, Not a Burden:**
  - It is a delight, designed for refreshment and communion.
  - Isaiah 58:13 – “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable...”
- **Not "Against Us":**
  - Colossians 2:14 describes ordinances "against us."
  - The Sabbath is *for* us; it cannot be the thing described as contrary.

## Slide 15 – Q4: Application (Rest in Christ)

- **Sabbath and Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The Sabbath is the ultimate sign of resting in Christ’s finished work.
  - We cease from our own works to trust in His creation and redemption.
  - Hebrews 4:10 – “For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.”
- **Lesson:**
  - Keeping the Sabbath reminds us we cannot save ourselves; we rest in the Savior.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Origin of the Sabbath

- **Question:** When was the Sabbath made?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:1–3
  - “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made.”

## Slide 17 – Q5: Key Points (Creation)

- **Pre-Fall Institution:**
  - Established in Eden before sin existed.
  - Therefore, it cannot be a "shadow" or remedy for sin.
- **Sanctified in Time:**
  - God set the seventh day apart at the foundation of the world.
  - What God does is permanent.
  - Ecclesiastes 3:14 – “I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Wedding Ring:**
  - A wedding ring is given at marriage to mark the relationship.
  - If a couple gets into debt, they make a debt-payment plan (temporary).
  - Once the debt is paid, the plan ends, but the ring remains because the marriage remains.
- **Application:**
  - The Ceremonial Law was the debt plan for sin (temporary).
  - The Sabbath is the wedding ring of Creation; it remains forever.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Man’s Condition at Creation

- **Question:** What was man's condition then?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:31
  - “And God saw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.”

## Slide 20 – Q6: Key Points (Perfection)

- **Sinless Institution:**
  - The Sabbath was given to "very good," sinless man.
  - It is compatible with perfection and holiness.
- **Perpetuity in the New Earth:**
  - It will continue in God’s perfect plan for the future.
  - Isaiah 66:22–23 – “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me... from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Obedience and Righteousness

- **Question:** Had man faithfully obeyed God from the beginning, would He have been counted a sinner?
- **Key Text:** Romans 2:13
  - “For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.”

## Slide 22 – Q7: Key Points (The Human Dilemma)

- **Definition of Sin:**
  - Sin is the transgression of the law.
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **The Reality:**
  - If man had obeyed, he would have remained just.
  - But all have sinned.
  - Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

## Slide 23 – Q7: Application (The Gospel Solution)

- **Justification (Imputed Righteousness):**
  - We admit we are lawbreakers.
  - We accept Christ's perfect life. God sees Christ’s obedience in place of our sin.
  - Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
- **Sanctification (Imparted Righteousness):**
  - Christ lives in us, empowering us to become "doers of the law."
  - We obey not to *earn* salvation, but because we *have* a new heart.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Purpose of Ceremonial Sabbaths

- **Question:** For what purpose were the sabbaths instituted which formed a part of the "handwriting of ordinances?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 2:17
  - “Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.”

## Slide 25 – Q8: Key Points (Shadows)

- **Prophetic Teaching Tools:**
  - Feast days (Passover, Pentecost, etc.) were acted-out prophecies.
  - They pointed forward to Christ’s death and ministry.
- **Fulfillment:**
  - Once "the body" (Christ) arrived, the shadows were no longer needed.
  - We do not kill a Passover lamb because Christ has come.
  - 1 Corinthians 5:7 – “Purge out therefore the old leaven... For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.”

## Slide 26 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Photo and the Person:**
  - A wife keeps a photo of her husband while he is away at war.
  - When he returns, she puts the photo down to embrace him.
- **Application:**
  - Ceremonial sabbaths were the "photo" of the coming Savior.
  - Now that Jesus is here, we have the Person.
  - **Note:** We still keep the weekly Sabbath because it is not a photo of a missing Savior, but a day of present rest *with* Him.

## Slide 27 – Q9: The Direction of the Sabbath

- **Question:** To what does the Sabbath of the fourth commandment direct the mind?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:11
  - “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

## Slide 28 – Q9: Key Points (The Creator)

- **Sign of Authority:**
  - Identifies God as the Creator, distinguishing Him from false gods.
  - Jeremiah 10:11 – “...The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth...”
- **Direction:**
  - Ceremonial sabbaths pointed **forward** to the Cross.
  - The weekly Sabbath points **backward** to Creation.
- **Final Conflict:**
  - Revelation 14:7 calls us to worship Him "that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."

## Slide 29 – Q10: Local and Shadowy Sabbaths

- **Question:** Were there any sabbath days in the old dispensation that were local and shadowy?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 23:24
  - “In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath...”
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 23:27, 32
  - “Also the tenth day of the seventh month there shall be a day of atonement... It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls.”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points (Annual Sabbaths)

- **Floating Days:**
  - These fell on specific dates (e.g., 10th day of 7th month) and could land on any day of the week.
- **Shadows of Redemption:**
  - The Day of Atonement pointed to Christ’s High Priestly ministry and judgment (Hebrews 8 & 9).
  - They were "local" (Jewish economy) and "shadowy" (predictive).
- **Nature of Observance:**
  - Involved "afflicting souls" (repentance/judgment), unlike the joyful celebration of Creation in the weekly Sabbath.

## Slide 31 – Q11: Purpose of Feast Days

- **Question:** What were these days for?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 23:37
  - “These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, everything upon his day.”

## Slide 32 – Q11: Key Points (Sacrificial System)

- **Linked to Sacrifices:**
  - These days were for the administration of offerings (burnt, meat, drink).
  - They were inextricably linked to the shedding of animal blood.
- **Matching Colossians 2:**
  - The list in Leviticus (meat, drink, holy day) matches Paul’s list in Colossians 2:16.
  - Since animal sacrifices ceased at the cross, the days associated with them also lost their significance.

## Slide 33 – Q12: Distinction of Sabbaths

- **Question:** Were these entirely distinct from the seventh-day Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 23:38
  - “Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your free will offerings, which ye give unto the Lord.”

## Slide 34 – Q12: Key Points (Distinct Laws)

- **"Beside" Means "In Addition To":**
  - The yearly feasts were kept *in addition to* the weekly Sabbath.
  - They are not the same institution.
- **Ownership:**
  - Weekly Sabbath: "The Sabbath of the **Lord**" (Exodus 20:10).
  - Ceremonial sabbaths: Often called "her sabbaths" or "your sabbaths."
  - Hosea 2:11 – “I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.”

## Slide 35 – Q12: Conclusion

- **The Two Writings:**
  - **Handwriting of Ordinances (Shadows):** Nailed to the cross.
  - **Writing of God (Moral Law):** Written on the heart.
- **Our Obligation:**
  - Christians are free from Jewish feasts but remain under the Moral Law.
  - John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”
  - Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 36 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Two Books:**
  - **Book 1: Emergency Procedures:** Used for treating a specific disease. Once cured, the remedial book is no longer needed.
  - **Book 2: Rules for Healthy Living:** Guidelines for diet and rest. These are for permanent well-being.
- **Application:**
  - **Ceremonial Law:** The emergency procedure for sin (pointing to the Cure, Jesus).
  - **Moral Law:** The rule of healthy spiritual living for all eternity.
