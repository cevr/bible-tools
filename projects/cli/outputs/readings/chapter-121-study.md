### Q1. Does the Lord consider it important that His children walk in the light?

“Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you; for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.” John 12:35.

**Answer:**

The figure of "walking" implies that the Christian life is not a static position but an active journey. Light represents the revealed will of God, His truth, and His presence (Psalm 27:1; 1 John 1:5).

*   **The Urgency of Truth:** Jesus warns that light is not always guaranteed to remain if it is neglected. The opportunity to accept and live by God's truth is a passing privilege. If we delay obedience, the capacity to see the truth diminishes.
*   **Safety in Motion:** To "walk in the light" means to advance in the knowledge of God. In the plan of salvation, there is no neutral ground. We are either advancing toward the holiness of Christ, or we are sliding back into the darkness of the world.
*   **The Danger of Darkness:** Spiritual darkness is not merely the absence of light; it is the result of rejecting the light. When a soul refuses to advance with the opening providences of God, confusion follows. They no longer know "whither they go"—they lose their bearing in the Great Controversy and become susceptible to the enemy’s deceptions.

**[ILL]** Imagine a traveler on a treacherous mountain path as the sun begins to set. While the sun shines, he can see the safe footing and the dangerous drop-offs. If he sits down and refuses to move while the sun is up, he will eventually be overtaken by nightfall. Once in the dark, even though the path hasn't changed, his ability to navigate it safely is gone, and he is likely to fall. So it is with the soul that delays obedience to God's word.

### Q2. What must one do to obtain the benefits of the blood of Christ?

“But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.” 1 John 1:7.

**Answer:**

This text establishes a vital condition for the full efficacy of the gospel in our lives. The blood of Christ provides two great works: forgiveness (justification) and cleansing (sanctification).

*   **Condition of the Covenant:** The promise is conditional: "If we walk." This does not mean we earn salvation by walking, but that our walking in the light is the evidence that we have truly accepted Christ.
*   **Fellowship with Heaven:** Walking in the light brings us into harmony with God ("as He is in the light") and with the body of believers. Sin separates; truth and holiness unite.
*   **Cleansing from All Sin:** This is the heart of **Righteousness by Faith**. The text says the blood *cleanseth* (present continuous tense) us.
    *   **Justification:** We are forgiven of past sins (Romans 3:25).
    *   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work where the life of Christ, through the Holy Spirit, removes the love of sin from our hearts.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the blood was shed in the courtyard (the cross), but it was ministered by the priest in the Holy Place to make atonement. Similarly, Jesus, our High Priest, applies the merits of His blood to cleanse our record in heaven and our characters on earth (Hebrews 9:14). He designs to restore us to full obedience to God’s law.

> **Definition—Sanctification:** The continuous process by which the Holy Spirit imparts the righteousness of Christ to the believer, transforming their character to be like Jesus and empowering them to overcome sin (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:13).

**[ILL]** If a miner comes out of a coal mine covered in black dust, he needs soap and water. If he stands near the water but refuses to apply it, he remains dirty. The "soap" is available, but he must "walk" into the shower to receive the benefit. We cannot cling to the "mud" of our favorite sins and expect the blood of Christ to cleanse us. We must yield the sin to Him to be washed away.

### Q3. How long may the just expect light to shine on his pathway?

“But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” Prov. 4:18.

**Answer:**

The Christian experience is one of progressive growth. God does not reveal His entire will to a new believer all at once, lest they be discouraged.

*   **Progressive Revelation:** As we obey the truth we know, God gives more light. A man may first accept Christ as Savior, then learn of the claim of God's Law, then understand the Sabbath, then the principles of health reform, and the message of the sanctuary. Each step is "more and more" light.
*   **The Perfect Day:** This points to the final restoration when we shall see Him face to face. Until then, we are to be constantly growing in grace and knowledge (2 Peter 3:18).
*   **No Stopping Place:** There is no point in this life where a believer can say, "I know enough; I am holy enough." The standard is the character of Christ. As long as we look to Him, we will see new depths of His love and new heights of holiness to attain.

**[ILL]** Consider the sunrise. First, there is a faint gray dawn, then the rosy colors of morning, and finally the sun bursts forth, climbing higher until the "perfect day" of noon brightness. If the sun stopped rising at dawn, the day would never come. So the Christian must not stop at their conversion experience but must grow until they reach the measure of the stature of Christ (Ephesians 4:13).

### Q4. For whom is the light sown?

“Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.” Ps. 97:11.

**Answer:**

This agricultural metaphor suggests that light (truth) often lies dormant or hidden until the heart is prepared to receive it.

*   **The Soil of the Heart:** The "righteous" and "upright in heart" are those who are sincere and willing to do God’s will. When a man’s heart is honest, the seeds of truth found in the Word of God will sprout and bear fruit in his life.
*   **Sown in the Word:** Truth is scattered throughout the Scriptures. To the careless reader, it may be invisible. But to the one seeking God, the Holy Spirit illuminates the text, and the "seed" of light springs up into understanding.
*   **Gladness in Obedience:** The text links light with "gladness." While the world thinks God's law is a burden, the upright heart finds that obedience to the truth brings true joy and freedom (Psalm 119:165).

**[ILL]** A farmer sows seeds in a field. For a time, the field looks brown and empty. But the life is there, buried. When the rain and sun come, the green shoots appear. God has "sown" light in your Bible. You may read a chapter today and see little, but if you are "upright in heart," the Holy Spirit will cause that verse to spring up with power just when you need it, bringing light to your situation.

### Q5. What will become of the light which a person has if he fails to improve by it?

“The light of the body is the eye; therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. Take heed, therefore, that the light which is in thee be not darkness.” Luke 11:34, 35.

**Answer:**

Jesus teaches the necessity of a "single" eye—a focused, undivided loyalty to God.

*   **Use It or Lose It:** Light is given for use. If we see a duty in Scripture but refuse to do it because it conflicts with our business, our social standing, or our appetites, the "eye" becomes evil (double-minded).
*   **The Consequence of Rejection:** When a person knows what is right but persists in doing wrong, their conscience eventually becomes seared (1 Timothy 4:2). The truth they once knew becomes distorted to justify their sin. This is how light becomes darkness.
*   **Total Darkness:** The deepest spiritual darkness is not ignorance, but the rejection of known truth. As the pioneers taught, to reject the messages God sends (such as the Three Angels' Messages) leaves the soul without an anchor.

**[ILL]** If you bandage a healthy arm to your side and refuse to use it for months, the muscles will atrophy and wither. Even though the arm was once strong, the lack of exercise makes it useless. Similarly, if we do not exercise our faith by obeying the light we have, our spiritual faculties wither, and we become incapable of discerning truth from error.

### Q6. Why are those condemned who do not come to the light?

“And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.” John 3:19.

**Answer:**

The judgment of God is based not arbitrarily on His power, but on man's reaction to His mercy.

*   **The Root of Unbelief:** Men often claim they reject the Bible for intellectual reasons or lack of evidence. However, Jesus diagnoses the true disease: a love for sin ("deeds were evil").
*   **The Incompatibility:** Light exposes dirt. A man who loves his "pet sins"—whether pride, appetite, dishonesty, or resentment—hates the light because it calls him to repentance. He avoids the light to protect his sin.
*   **The Verdict:** This verse illuminates the **Investigative Judgment**. God does not condemn a man for what he did not know (Acts 17:30), but for turning away from the light that Christ brought into his life. To love darkness is to love death, for Christ is the Life.

**[ILL]** Imagine a room that is terribly messy and dirty. As long as the lights are off, the occupant can pretend the room is clean. If someone walks in with a bright lamp, the filth is revealed. The occupant has two choices: clean the room (repentance) or smash the lamp (rejection of truth). Many choose to smash the lamp because they love their mess.

---

### Q7. If one is really seeking for truth, what will he do?

“But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.” John 3:21.

**Answer:**

True faith is active. It is not merely thinking about truth, but "doing" it.

*   **Coming to the Light:** An honest heart has nothing to hide. They bring their life, their habits, and their business practices to the Bible to see if they align with God's will.
*   **Wrought in God:** This is a beautiful expression of **Righteousness by Faith**. The believer's good works are not manufactured by self-effort to earn heaven. They are "wrought in God"—worked out by God Himself dwelling in the soul.
*   **Dependence:** The true Christian acknowledges that any good thing in them is the result of Christ’s indwelling power (Galatians 2:20). They are not afraid of the light, because the light reveals Christ's work in them.

> **Definition—Justification:** The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is righteous, solely because of the merits of Jesus Christ, which are credited (imputed) to the believer's account (Romans 3:24; 5:1).

**[ILL]** A master architect provides a blueprint to a builder. The builder who wants to do a good job constantly checks his work against the blueprint (the Light). He is not afraid of the inspection; he welcomes it because he wants the building to stand. The honest Christian constantly checks their life against the Law of God, not to be saved by the law, but to ensure they are building on the Rock, Christ Jesus.

### Q8. What will those who reject light and truth, be finally led to believe?

“And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” 2 Thess. 2:11, 12.

**Answer:**

This is a solemn warning regarding the closing scenes of the Great Controversy.

*   **The Consequence of Choice:** God does not force men to lie; but when men stubbornly reject the truth because they have "pleasure in unrighteousness," God withdraws His restraining Spirit. The natural result is that they fall prey to the deception of Satan.
*   **Strong Delusion:** In the last days, the world will be swept away by spiritualism, false miracles, and a counterfeit gospel that dispenses with God's law. Those who did not receive the "love of the truth" (v. 10) will have no defense against these deceptions.
*   **Sanctification as Protection:** Our only safety against the "strong delusion" is a heart that loves the truth and a life that is sanctified by obedience to it. We must surrender the "pleasure in unrighteousness" now, so we are not deceived then.

**[ILL]** A ship captain who deliberately throws his compass overboard because he dislikes the direction it points is destined to be lost. When the storm comes, he will be "deluded" by shifting winds and currents, believing he is safe when he is heading for the rocks. The Word of God is our compass; to reject it is to guarantee shipwreck.

### Q9. From what source does one derive light?

“Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Ps. 119:105, 130 (Prov. 6:23).

**Answer:**

The only safe guide for the Christian is the Word of God—the Holy Scriptures.

*   **Sola Scriptura:** The Bible is the ultimate authority. Human traditions, feelings, and the opinions of the majority are not light. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20).
*   **Practical Guidance:** It is a "lamp unto my feet." It does not just show abstract theological theories; it shows us where to step next in our daily lives—how to treat our families, how to conduct business, and how to care for our bodies.
*   **The Entrance of Words:** Verse 130 says, "The entrance of thy words giveth light." It is not owning a Bible, but letting the Word *enter* the mind and heart through study and meditation that brings illumination.

**[ILL]** Imagine walking through a dark forest at night with a flashlight. The flashlight doesn't illuminate the whole forest at once, but it casts a circle of light right where you need to step. As you move forward, the light moves with you. The Bible is that lamp; it gives us enough light to take the next step of obedience today.

### Q10. Who was told by an angel of God that his way pleased the Lord?

“He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.” Acts 10:3, 4.

**Answer:**

Cornelius was a Roman centurion, a Gentile who did not yet know the full gospel of Christ, yet he was sincere in what he did know.

*   **Accepted Sincerity:** God saw the heart of Cornelius. He was living up to all the light he had. He feared God, gave alms, and prayed.
*   **God's Impartiality:** This account proves that God is not limited by race or nationality. "In every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him" (Acts 10:35).
*   **A Memorial:** His prayers ascended like incense in the sanctuary. God takes notice of every sincere effort to find Him.

**[ILL]** A small child may draw a picture for their father. It may be scribbled and imperfect, but the father accepts it with joy because of the love and intent behind it. Cornelius was offering his best to God, and God accepted the intent of his heart.

---

### Q11. Did the angel then tell him that he had nothing more to learn or do, in order to be saved?

“And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: he lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea-side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.” Acts 10:5, 6.

**Answer:**

This is a crucial point. Though Cornelius was sincere, his sincerity alone was not sufficient once greater light was available.

*   **More Light Required:** The angel did not say, "You are good enough as you are." He directed Cornelius to Peter to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ. To remain in God's favor, Cornelius had to advance from his limited knowledge to the full truth of the Gospel.
*   **The Agency of Men:** God used Peter to instruct Cornelius. God entrusts the "keys" of the gospel to His church to share with the world.
*   **Responsibility:** If Cornelius had refused to send for Peter, or refused to listen to the message of Christ, his former sincerity would have become darkness. We are saved by faith, but true faith always accepts new light when God sends it.

**[ILL]** A student in first grade may be an excellent student, getting perfect marks. But he cannot stay in first grade forever. If he refuses to move to second grade, he ceases to be a student and becomes a dropout. The Christian life is a school; we must constantly move up to the next grade of light and truth.

---

### Q12. In what are we exhorted to continue?

“For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.” Heb. 3:14 (Matt. 10:22).

**Answer:**

Salvation is not a one-time event, but a continuous relationship.

*   **Perseverance of the Saints:** The Bible does not teach "once saved, always saved" regardless of our choices. We are partakers *if* we hold fast.
*   **Steadfastness:** The Christian walk will face trials, temptations, and discouragements. The "beginning of our confidence" (our initial faith in Jesus) must be maintained until the very end.
*   **Abiding in Him:** To hold confidence steadfast means to abide in Christ daily (John 15:4). Just as a branch must remain connected to the vine to live, we must remain connected to Christ by faith to retain spiritual life.

> **Definition—Atonement:** The work of reconciliation by which God and man are brought back into oneness (at-one-ment). It involves Christ's sacrifice on the cross and His priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary to blot out sin (Romans 5:11; Leviticus 16).

**[ILL]** A drowning man is thrown a rope. He is safe as long as he holds on to the rope and lets the rescuer pull him in. If he lets go of the rope halfway to the boat, he is lost. Faith is the hand that grasps Christ; we must not let go.

### Q13. Among those that hear the prophecies of Revelation, who are to have a blessing from God?

“Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.” Rev. 1:3.

**Answer:**

The book of Revelation is not a sealed book, but an open revelation of Jesus Christ, specifically designed for the last days.

*   **Read, Hear, Keep:** The blessing is threefold. It is not enough to read (intellectual knowledge) or hear (attend church). One must *keep*—that is, obey and cherish—the things written.
*   **Prophetic Guidance:** Revelation unveils the final conflict between Christ and Satan. To "keep" these things means to heed the warnings of the Three Angels' Messages (Revelation 14:6-12), to separate from Babylon, and to refuse the Mark of the Beast.
*   **Sanctification in Prophecy:** The purpose of prophecy is not just to satisfy curiosity, but to prepare a people who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev 14:12).

**[ILL]** If a general sends an encrypted message to his troops detailing the enemy's location and the plan of attack, the soldiers are blessed if they decode it. But if they decode it and do not follow the orders, the message is useless. Revelation is our marching orders for the final conflict.

### Q14. Is there an example of God's overthrowing people whom He once favored, because they refused to obey Him?

“I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.” Jude 5.

**Answer:**

This historical example destroys the false sense of security that claims God will save His people regardless of their ongoing disobedience.

*   **Saved but Lost:** The Israelites were truly "saved" out of Egypt (a type of justification/deliverance from sin). They passed through the Red Sea (baptism). Yet, most of that generation died in the wilderness and missed the Promised Land.
*   **The Cause of Fall:** They were destroyed because they "believed not." In the Bible, unbelief and disobedience are the same thing (Hebrews 3:18-19). They refused to walk in the advancing light (the cloud) and refused to trust God for victory over the giants (sin).
*   **A Warning for Us:** Paul tells us these things happened as examples for us, upon whom the ends of the world are come (1 Corinthians 10:11). We have been saved from the Egypt of sin by the blood of the Lamb. Now we must walk by faith toward the heavenly Canaan. If we cherish sin and refuse to follow our Captain, we, like them, will fail to enter His rest.
*   **The Solution:** We must combine faith with our profession. We must rely on Christ not just for the initial rescue, but for the daily power to walk in the light until the journey is done.

**[ILL]** A rescue swimmer pulls a man from a riptide (Egypt). The rescued man is safe on the beach. But if he decides to jump back into the treacherous water despite the warnings, he may drown. God’s grace is sufficient to keep us, but it does not force us to remain if we choose the path of rebellion. Let us therefore "walk in the light" while we have it.
