### Q1. Why was Abel's sacrifice more acceptable to God than Cain’s?

**Verse:** “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain." Heb. 11:4.

**Answer:**
The difference between Abel’s sacrifice and Cain’s was not merely in the items offered, but in the *faith* and *understanding* of the plan of salvation that prompted the offering.

*   **The Blood vs. The Fruit:** Cain brought the "fruit of the ground" (Genesis 4:3), representing human labor and works. It contained no blood, and therefore made no confession of sin and no acknowledgment of the need for a Savior. Abel brought the "firstlings of his flock" (Genesis 4:4), a slain lamb. This involved the shedding of blood, acknowledging that "without shedding of blood is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22).
*   **Faith in the Substitute:** Abel’s offering was "by faith." Faith in what? Faith in the promised Seed (Genesis 3:15) who would bruise the serpent’s head. Abel understood that his own life was forfeited by sin and that he could only be accepted through the death of a Substitute.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** This is the earliest biblical illustration of righteousness by faith versus righteousness by works. Cain sought to approach God through his own culture and effort (works); Abel approached God through the merit of the innocent victim (faith in Christ).

**[ILL]**
Imagine two men owing a debt they cannot pay. One man brings his own handmade crafts to the bank, saying, "Look how hard I worked on these; surely this settles my debt." The banker refuses, for crafts are not legal tender. The second man brings a check signed by a wealthy benefactor. He has done no work for it, but he trusts the signature. The bank accepts it immediately. Cain brought his own "crafts"; Abel brought the "check" signed in the blood of the Lamb.

***

### Q2. To what did his sacrifice point forward?

**Verse:** "Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,... but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world." 1 Peter 1:18-20.

**Answer:**
Abel's sacrifice was a "type" or a shadow pointing forward to the great "antitype"—Jesus Christ.

*   **The Lamb of God:** Every sacrifice offered by the patriarchs was a prophecy in action. The lamb represented Jesus, "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).
*   **Foreordained:** The plan of salvation was not an afterthought devised when Adam sinned. Christ was "foreordained before the foundation of the world." This is the "everlasting covenant" (Hebrews 13:20)—the agreement between the Father and the Son to save humanity at the cost of the Son's life.
*   **Redemption:** The text says we are redeemed "with the precious blood of Christ." *Redemption* means "buying back." We sold ourselves into the slavery of sin; Christ’s blood is the price paid to release us from the condemnation of the law (Galatians 3:13).

***

### Q3. By his sacrifice, what did Abel obtain?

**Verse:** “He obtained witness that he was righteous." Heb. 11:4.

**Answer:**
Through his offering, Abel received a divine testimony that he was righteous. This is the heart of **Justification**.

*   **Definition of Justification:** It is the legal declaration by God that a sinner is righteous, not because of their own deeds, but because the righteousness of Christ is imputed (credited) to them (Romans 4:3–5).
*   **Imputed Righteousness:** Abel was not righteous because he was personally perfect or sinless in himself; he was a sinner in need of a Savior. He was accounted righteous because he laid hold of Christ.
*   **The Witness:** God "testifying of his gifts" (Hebrews 11:4) showed that God accepts the sinner who comes covered in the merit of Jesus.

### Q4. With what sacrifice did God command Abraham to worship Him?

**Verse:** “And He said unto him, Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old... And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another." Gen. 15:1, 10.

**Answer:**
God commanded Abraham to prepare a specific covenant sacrifice involving a heifer, a she-goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

*   **Ratifying the Covenant:** In ancient times, cutting animals in two and passing between the pieces was a solemn way of sealing a covenant (Jeremiah 34:18). By this ritual, God was confirming His promise to give Abraham the land and a Seed (Christ).
*   **Total Surrender:** Abraham obeyed precisely. This shows that faith is not merely an abstract belief; true faith acts. "Faith, if it hath not works, is dead" (James 2:17). Abraham’s obedience was the fruit of his faith.

***

### Q5. How did Jacob manifest his faith in the promised Redeemer?

**Verse:** “And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac." Gen. 46:1.

**Answer:**
Jacob (Israel), near the end of his life, continued the practice of offering blood sacrifices.

*   **Continuity of Faith:** The religion of the patriarchs was the religion of the cross. From Abel to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, the faithful line was preserved through the sacrificial system which taught that God provides a substitute.
*   **Seeking Guidance:** Jacob offered these sacrifices before going down into Egypt. He sought God’s covering and guidance through the appointed means of worship—the blood of the covenant.

### Q6. What did the lord command Moses to have made?

**Verse:** “And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering; ..and let them make Me a sanctuary: that I may dwell among them." Ex. 25:1, 8 (Acts 7:44) (Heb. 8:5). "Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shalt thou make them." "And thou shalt make curtains goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: even curtains shalt thou make." "And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins." Ex. 26:1, 7, 14.

**Answer:**
God commanded the construction of a **Sanctuary** (a holy place).

*   **The Purpose:** "That I may dwell among them." God’s desire has always been to be close to His people. Sin separated man from God (Isaiah 59:2); the sanctuary provided a way for a holy God to dwell in the midst of a sinful people through the mediation of blood.
*   **The Pattern:** Moses was not left to design this himself. He was shown a "pattern" in the mount (Exodus 25:40; Hebrews 8:5). This earthly sanctuary was a miniature model of the true tabernacle in heaven, which the Lord pitched, and not man (Hebrews 8:2).
*   **Antitype—The Human Heart:** Ultimately, God wants to dwell not in a tent of skin, but in the human heart. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God?" (1 Corinthians 3:16). The earthly sanctuary illustrates how God cleanses the soul temple from sin so He can reign there supreme.

***

### Q7. How many apartments had the sanctuary?

**Verse:** ” And the veil shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy." Ex. 26:33.

**Answer:**
The sanctuary had two apartments (rooms):
1.  The **Holy Place** (the first apartment).
2.  The **Most Holy Place** (or Holy of Holies, the second apartment).

They were separated by a heavy veil. This structure outlines the two phases of Christ’s ministry: His daily intercession (Holy Place) and His final work of judgment and cleansing (Most Holy Place).

***

### Q8. What was in the first apartment?

**Verse:** “For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is called the sanctuary." Heb 9:2.

**Answer:**
The first apartment contained:
*   **The Golden Candlestick (Menorah):** It had seven lamps and burned continually. It represents Jesus as the "Light of the world" (John 8:12) and the power of the Holy Spirit illuminating the church (Revelation 4:5).
*   **The Table of Shewbread:** This held twelve loaves of bread, representing Jesus as the "Bread of Life" (John 6:35). We must daily feed upon His Word to sustain our spiritual life.

**[ILL]**
Just as our physical bodies will die without daily food and light, our spiritual life withers without the daily intake of God’s Word (Bread) and the illuminating presence of the Holy Spirit (Oil/Light).

***

### Q9. What other article was in the first apartment?

**Verse:** “And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the veil." Ex. 40:26 (Ex. 30:1-6).

**Answer:**
The **Altar of Incense**.

*   **Location:** It stood directly before the veil that separated the Holy from the Most Holy place.
*   **Significance:** The incense represents the "prayers of saints" (Revelation 8:3–4) mingled with the merit and intercession of Christ. As we pray, our petitions ascend, sweetened by the perfect righteousness of Jesus, making them acceptable to the Father. This teaches us that prayer is our connection to heaven, but it is effective only through Jesus' name.

***

### Q10. What was contained in the second apartment, or the most holy place?

**Verse:** “And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant." Heb. 9:3-4 (Ex. 40:20, 21).

**Answer:**
The central feature of the Most Holy Place was the **Ark of the Covenant**. Inside this chest were:
1.  **The Golden Pot of Manna:** Reminding Israel of God's providence.
2.  **Aaron's Rod that Budded:** Showing God's choice of the priesthood.
3.  **The Tables of the Covenant:** The Ten Commandments written by God's finger.

***

### Q11. By what name was the cover of the ark known?

**Verse:** “And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee." Ex.25:21.

**Answer:**
The cover was called the **Mercy Seat**.

*   **Mercy and Truth:** The Mercy Seat (solid gold) covered the Law (the Ten Commandments) inside the box. The Law cries out for the death of the sinner ("The wages of sin is death"), but the Mercy Seat, sprinkled with blood, interposes to save the sinner.
*   **The Gospel:** Here "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other" (Psalm 85:10). It shows that God does not abolish His law to save men; rather, He satisfies the law's demands through Christ's blood so that mercy can be extended.

***

### Q12. Where was God, by the symbol of His presence, to meet with Israel's high priest?

**Verse:** “And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony." Ex. 25:22.

**Answer:**
God’s presence (the Shekinah glory) dwelt **above the Mercy Seat**, between the two golden cherubim.

*   **The Center of Government:** This spot represented the throne of God. It teaches us that God's government is based on two pillars: Justice (the Law inside the ark) and Mercy (the blood on the Mercy Seat).
*   **Access:** God meets with man only over the blood of atonement.

***

### Q13. What was in the ark, under the mercy seat?

**Verse:** “And He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments... And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made." Deut. 10:4, 5.

**Answer:**
The **Ten Commandments**.

*   **The Standard:** The moral law is the foundation of God’s government. It is the standard of righteousness.
*   **Relation to the Gospel:** The law reveals sin (Romans 3:20) and points us to our need for the Mercy Seat (Christ). Under the New Covenant, God does not change this law; instead, He promises, "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).

***

### Q14. When this building was completed, for what purpose was it used, and who daily officiated in the first apartment?

**Verse:** “Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God." Heb. 9:6.

**Answer:**
The first apartment (Holy Place) was used for the **daily service**.
*   **Continual Ministry:** The priests entered "always" (daily) to trim the lamps, offer incense, and present the blood of individual sin offerings.
*   **Application:** This represents Christ’s continual ministry for us right now. He "ever liveth to make intercession" for us (Hebrews 7:25). We have daily access to the Father through Him.

***

### Q15. Who only was allowed in the second apartment? How often? And for what purpose?

**Verse:** “But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people." Heb. 9:7.

**Answer:**
*   **Who:** Only the **High Priest**.
*   **When:** Only **once a year**, on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).
*   **Why:** To cleanse the sanctuary and the people from the accumulated record of sin.

This service pointed to the final work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary (the Investigative Judgment) before His second coming.

***

### Q16. How does one commit sin?

**Verse:** “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law." 1 John 3:4.

**Answer:**
Sin is defined as the **transgression of the law** (the Ten Commandments).

*   **The Standard of Judgment:** You cannot know what sin is without the law. "I had not known sin, but by the law" (Romans 7:7).
*   **The Remedy:** Because sin is breaking God’s law, and the law cannot change, the only way to save the sinner was for Jesus to pay the penalty demanded by that law.

***

### Q17. And what is the wages of sin?

**Verse:** “The wages of sin is death." Rom. 6:23.

**Answer:**
The penalty for sin is **death**. This is not merely physical death, which comes to all, but the "second death"—eternal separation from God. Because the law demands the life of the transgressor, either the sinner must die, or a sinless Substitute must die in their place.

***

### Q18. When one of the common people thus sinned, what must he then do, to save his life?

**Verse:** “And if anyone of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord,... then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin-offering in the place of the burnt offering." Lev. 4:27-29.

**Answer:**
The sinner had to follow a specific process of **substitution**:
1.  **Bring a Victim:** An innocent animal (representing Jesus) without blemish.
2.  **Lay on Hands:** The sinner placed his hands on the animal's head and confessed his specific sin. This symbolized the *transfer* of guilt from the sinner to the innocent victim.
3.  **Slay the Victim:** The sinner (not the priest) had to kill the animal. This impressed upon him the solemn truth that *his* sin caused the death of the Innocent One.

***

### Q19. What was done with the blood?

**Verse:** “And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar." Lev. 4:30.

**Answer:**
The priest took the blood—which now bore the guilt of the sin ceremonially—and placed it on the horns of the altar.

*   **Transfer of Record:** By this act, the sin was transferred from the sinner to the victim, and through the blood, to the sanctuary. The sinner was forgiven, but the record of the sin remained in the sanctuary until the Day of Atonement.
*   **Forgiveness vs. Cleansing:** The daily service provided *forgiveness* (Justification); the yearly service provided *cleansing* (the blotting out of sin).

***

### Q20. How was the body of the sin offering to be disposed of?

**Verse:** “This is the law of the sin-offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the Lord; it is most holy. The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in the holy place shall it be eaten." Lev. 6:25, 26. See verse 16.

**Answer:**
In many cases, the priest was commanded to **eat a portion of the flesh** of the sin offering.

*   **Bearing Iniquity:** Leviticus 10:17 explains why: "God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation." When the priest ate the flesh, he ceremonially took the sin upon himself.
*   **Type of Christ:** This illustrates how Christ became sin for us (2 Corinthians 5:21). He absorbs our sin into Himself to make atonement for us.

***

### Q21. After the accumulation of the sins of the year in this way, what took place on the tenth day of the seventh month?

**Verse:** “And this shall be a statue forever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls;... For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord." Lev. 16:29, 30.

**Answer:**
The **Day of Atonement** (Yom Kippur).

*   **The Cleansing:** On this day, the sanctuary itself was cleansed. The accumulated record of sins (transferred in daily by the blood) was finally removed.
*   **Afflicting the Soul:** This was a day of judgment. The people were to search their hearts, repent, and humble themselves. Anyone not "afflicted" (repentant) was cut off (Leviticus 23:29).
*   **Sanctification:** This points to the work of **Sanctification** and the preparation for the final seal of God. We must not only be forgiven but cleansed "from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).

**[ILL]**
Think of the daily service as dirtying the dishes (transferring sin to the sanctuary) and the Day of Atonement as the washing of the dishes (cleansing the sanctuary). The house is not truly clean until the record of sin is blotted out.

***

### Q22. After making an offering for himself, what did the high priest next do?

**Verse:** “And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat." Lev.16:7, 8.

**Answer:**
He took two goats and cast lots.
1.  **The Lord's Goat:** Representing Christ.
2.  **The Scapegoat (Azazel):** Representing Satan, the adversary and instigator of sin.

***

### Q23. What was done with the goat upon which the Lord's lot fell?

**Verse:** “Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat." Lev.16:15.

**Answer:**
The Lord's goat was **slain**.

*   **The Atonement:** This goat made the atonement for the people. Its blood was brought into the Most Holy Place and sprinkled on the Mercy Seat.
*   **Justice Satisfied:** This represented Christ’s death satisfying the claims of the law. The blood covered the broken commandments inside the ark.

***

### Q24. Was it necessary to make this atonement?

**Verse:** “And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins; and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness." Lev. 16:16.

**Answer:**
Yes, it was necessary to make an atonement **for the Holy Place itself**.
Because the sanctuary had "absorbed" the record of Israel's sins throughout the year via the blood of the daily sacrifices, the building itself was ceremonially unclean. It needed to be purified to remove those sins forever.

***

### Q25. After the high priest came out of the sanctuary with the sins still on him, having atoned for them in the most holy place, what did he next do?

**Verse:** ” And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat: and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness." Lev. 16:20, 21.

**Answer:**
He placed the sins upon the head of the **Scapegoat**.

*   **Sequence is Vital:** Notice that the high priest had "made an end of reconciling" *before* he touched the scapegoat. The atonement for the people was complete. The people were safe.
*   **Transfer to the Author:** Now, the High Priest (Christ) takes the sins that He has carried for His people and places the responsibility back onto the original instigator, Satan (Azazel).
*   **Not a Savior:** The scapegoat is *not* slain. It makes no atonement. Satan does not die for our sins; he pays the penalty for his part in tempting us to sin.

***

### Q26. Then who bore the sins of the people, after the high priest had put them off, and the camp was cleansed from them?

**Verse:** “And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness." Lev. 16:22.

**Answer:**
The **Scapegoat (Azazel/Satan)** bore the iniquities into a "land not inhabited" (the wilderness).

*   **The Banishing of Sin:** This represents the final removal of sin from the universe. At the end of time, after the judgment is finished, Satan will be bound in the "bottomless pit" (Revelation 20:1–3) bearing the weight of the sins he caused.
*   **The Final Victory:** God’s people are clean, the sanctuary is cleansed, and the author of sin is banished. The universe is restored to harmony.

**[ILL]**
If a criminal breaks into a home and coerces a child to help him steal, the law may forgive the child if they are repentant and return the goods, but the mastermind (the criminal) must bear the full weight of the punishment for the crime. Christ pays our debt, but Satan bears the punishment for instigating the rebellion.
