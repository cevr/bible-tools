## Slide 1 – Q1: The Condition of Humanity
- **Question:** By nature, what is the condition of all men?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:23 – “For all men have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:10-12 – “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Nature of Sin)
- **Total Bankruptcy:**
  - Paul emphasizes that naturally, "there is none righteous, no, not one" (Romans 3:10).
- **The Definition of Sin:**
  - Sin is defined as the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”).
  - Because all have broken the moral law, all stand guilty before God.
- **Falling Short of Glory:**
  - God's glory represents His character: goodness, mercy, and truth (Exodus 34:6).
  - To "come short" means failing to reflect the image of God in which we were created.
- **The Need for a Physician:**
  - A person must realize they are sick before they seek a doctor (Matthew 9:12). We must acknowledge our lost condition to appreciate the Savior.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Broken Mirror:**
  - Imagine a mirror designed to reflect the sun perfectly.
  - If the mirror is shattered, it can only reflect broken, distorted fragments.
  - Humanity was made to reflect God’s character, but sin shattered that image.
  - No matter how much we polish the broken shards (human effort), we cannot restore the reflection.
  - **Lesson:** We do not need improvement; we need a new nature.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Changing the Nature
- **Question:** How may one's nature be changed?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (New Birth)
- **A New Creation:**
  - The change is not merely an improvement of the old life.
  - It is the creation of a completely new life—the "new birth" (John 3:3 – “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”).
- **Union with Christ:**
  - Being "in Christ" signifies a vital spiritual union, like a branch grafted into a vine (John 15:5).
- **Regeneration:**
  - God speaks spiritual life into the dead soul, just as He spoke light into existence at creation (Ephesians 2:1).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Transformation)
- **Old Things Pass Away:**
  - The love of sin, worldly ambition, and selfishness are displaced.
- **All Things Become New:**
  - New motives, new tastes, and a new love for God’s law take their place.
- **The Definition:**
  - *Regeneration is the spiritual work of God by which a new nature is implanted in the believer.*
  - This is the beginning of the path to character perfection.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Meaning of "In Christ"
- **Question:** What is it to be in Christ?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:1 – “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Justification & Sanctification)
- **No Condemnation (Justification):**
  - *Justification:* The legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous based solely on Christ's merits.
  - Because Jesus paid the penalty (Isaiah 53:5), the law no longer condemns the one who hides in Christ.
- **Walking after the Spirit (Sanctification):**
  - *Sanctification:* The ongoing process of being made holy by the Spirit’s power.
  - The evidence of being "in Christ" is no longer following the fallen nature ("the flesh") but following the Holy Spirit.
- **Pardon and Power:**
  - God never justifies a soul without also beginning the work of sanctifying them.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Lifeboat:**
  - A drowning sailor is "condemned" to death by the water.
  - If pulled into a lifeboat, he is "in the boat" and no longer condemned to drown (change of status).
  - However, he must remain in the boat and live by the captain's rules (change of walk).
  - **Lesson:** To jump back into the water is to leave the place of safety.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Works of the Flesh
- **Question:** What are the works of the flesh?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:19-21 – “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Sin Categories)
- **Manifest Sins:**
  - These are open violations of the Ten Commandments.
- **Categories of Sin:**
  - *Sensual:* Adultery, uncleanness (7th Commandment).
  - *Religious:* Idolatry, witchcraft (1st & 2nd Commandments).
  - *Interpersonal:* Hatred, wrath, envy (6th & 9th Commandments).
  - *Intemperance:* Drunkenness, revelings (Health & Sobriety).
- **The Warning:**
  - "They which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
  - One cannot willfully cherish these sins and remain a Christian.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Fruit of the Spirit
- **Question:** And what is the fruit of the Spirit?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:22-23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (The Fruit Cluster)
- **Fruit vs. Works:**
  - "Works" implies manufactured effort; "Fruit" implies organic growth.
- **Unity of the Fruit:**
  - The singular word "fruit" suggests these virtues are one cluster, all manifestations of **Love**.
  - *Joy* is love exulting.
  - *Peace* is love resting.
  - *Longsuffering* is love enduring.
  - *Temperance* is love overcoming.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Fulfilling the Law:**
  - "Against such there is no law." The Spirit-filled person naturally fulfills the law (Romans 8:4).
- **The Source of Growth:**
  - We cannot manufacture this fruit by trying harder.
  - Fruit grows only when the branch stays connected to the vine.
  - As we abide in Christ, His life flows through us and produces character naturally (John 15:4-5 – “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.”).

## Slide 15 – Q6: Led by the Spirit
- **Question:** How are those denominated who are led by the Spirit?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:14 – “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Sonship)
- **Active Leading:**
  - The Spirit leads us away from sin and into truth (John 16:13).
  - He leads us to the foot of the Cross and to obedience.
- **Sons, Not Slaves:**
  - We are adopted into the heavenly family with full privileges.
  - We become heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17).
- **The Evidence:**
  - We cannot claim to be sons of God if we are led by the spirit of the world (1 John 2:15).

## Slide 17 – Q7: Assurance of the Sons of God
- **Question:** What assurance is given to the sons of God?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:2 – “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Hope and Holiness)
- **Present Reality:**
  - "Now are we the sons of God." Our standing is secure in Christ today, even amidst weakness.
- **Future Transformation:**
  - When Jesus returns, the work of restoration will be completed.
  - Our vile bodies will be changed to be like His glorious body (Philippians 3:21).
- **The Goal:**
  - To be "like Him" is the goal of salvation.
  - "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord" (Hebrews 12:14).

## Slide 19 – Q8: Hope and Purification
- **Question:** If one has this hope, what will he surely do?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:3 – “And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He [Christ] is pure.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Sanctuary Application)
- **Active Purification:**
  - "Purifieth himself" means cooperating with God's grace.
  - We cleanse ourselves from filthiness of flesh and spirit (2 Corinthians 7:1).
- **The Standard:**
  - The standard is not society or other church members.
  - The standard is "even as He [Christ] is pure."
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the typical sanctuary service (Day of Atonement), people had to afflict their souls (Leviticus 16:29-30).
  - We live in the anti-typical Day of Atonement; it is time to put away every known sin.

## Slide 21 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Bride's Dress:**
  - A bride preparing for her wedding does not roll in the mud.
  - Because she has the "hope" of the ceremony, she keeps her garment spotless.
  - The church is the Bride of Christ, preparing for the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-8).

## Slide 22 – Q9: Doctrine of Perfection
- **Question:** Is the doctrine of perfection taught in the Bible?
- **Key Text:** James 1:4 – “But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Maturity)
- **Definition:**
  - Biblical "perfection" often means *maturity* or *completeness*.
  - It signifies wholehearted love and complete surrender, not necessarily freedom from mistakes in knowledge.
- **The Role of Trials:**
  - "Patience" (endurance) refines character.
  - Enduring trials without murmuring develops spiritual maturity.
- **Wanting Nothing:**
  - God seeks a balanced character—not strong in one area and weak in another.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Perfection vs. First Principles
- **Question:** Is one perfected when he receives the principles of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 6:1 – “Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God...”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Moving Forward)
- **Leaving the Principles:**
  - We do not abandon the basics (repentance, faith), but we build upon them as a foundation.
- **Go On:**
  - The Christian life is a march, not a resting place.
  - There is no neutral ground; we are either advancing or sliding back.
- **The Goal:**
  - We press toward spiritual maturity—the full measure of the stature of Christ (Ephesians 4:13).

## Slide 26 – Q11: Accomplishing Perfection
- **Question:** In order to accomplish this, what must be done?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:18 – “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points (Growth)
- **Grow in Grace:**
  - Grace is both unmerited favor (pardon) and divine power (enablement).
  - To grow is to become increasingly dependent on Christ's power to overcome.
- **Grow in Knowledge:**
  - This is relational knowledge: "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God" (John 17:3).
- **No Stagnation:**
  - A plant that stops growing begins to die.
  - A Christian who stops seeking Jesus begins to wither spiritually.

## Slide 28 – Q12: How to Grow
- **Question:** How may one grow in grace?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:5-7 – “And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (Ladder of Sanctification)
- **Diligence:** Salvation is free, but requires our full attention.
- **The Steps:**
  - *Faith:* The foundation.
  - *Virtue:* Moral courage.
  - *Knowledge:* Understanding God's will.
  - *Temperance:* Self-control.
  - *Patience:* Endurance.
  - *Godliness:* Reverence.
  - *Brotherly Kindness:* Love for the church.
  - *Charity (Agape):* The crowning virtue—unselfish love.
- **Result:** Being neither barren nor unfruitful (2 Peter 1:8).

## Slide 30 – Q13: Christ’s Design for the Church
- **Question:** In requiring so much of His followers, what is the design of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 5:27 – “That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points (Sanctuary & Cleansing)
- **Without Spot or Wrinkle:**
  - *Spot:* Defilement of sin.
  - *Wrinkle:* Signs of age or decay. The church is to have eternal spiritual vigor.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest cleansed the sanctuary of the record of sin once a year (Leviticus 16).
  - Christ, our High Priest, is performing a work of judgment and cleansing in heaven to prepare a people who reflect His image.
  - He accomplishes this by the "washing of water by the word" (Ephesians 5:26).

## Slide 32 – Q14: What Causes Growth
- **Question:** What will cause the Christian to grow?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 2:2 – “As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points (The Word)
- **Sincere Milk:**
  - This represents pure, unadulterated truth. We must accept the Bible as it reads.
- **Desire:**
  - A healthy baby craves milk.
  - Lack of appetite for the Bible is a sign of spiritual sickness.
- **Grow Thereby:**
  - Growth comes from feeding on the promises, warnings, and instructions of Scripture, not just emotional experiences.

## Slide 34 – Q15: Usage of the Word
- **Question:** In order to grow by the word of God, what must one do with it?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 119:11 – “Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.”

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points (Internalizing Scripture)
- **Hid in the Heart:**
  - Implies memorization and meditation.
  - The "heart" is the seat of the will and affections.
- **The Purpose:**
  - "...that I might not sin against Thee."
- **The Weapon:**
  - Jesus met every temptation in the wilderness with "It is written" (Matthew 4:4).
  - The Holy Spirit can only bring to remembrance what we have stored in our minds.

## Slide 36 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Reservoir:**
  - If a besieged city has its water supply cut off, it must surrender.
  - But if there is a hidden reservoir inside the walls, the people can stand firm.
  - **Lesson:** Hiding God's Word in the heart creates a reservoir of strength for times of temptation when no Bible is physically at hand.

## Slide 37 – Q16: The Word and the Heart
- **Question:** And what must that word become to the heart?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 15:16 – “Thy words were found, and I did eat them: and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O Lord God of hosts.”

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points (Assimilation)
- **Eating the Word:**
  - Physical food is digested and becomes flesh and blood.
  - The Word must be assimilated by faith until it shapes our character (John 6:63).
- **Joy and Rejoicing:**
  - Obedience is not a burden to the converted heart; it is a delight.
  - "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart" (Psalm 40:8).

## Slide 39 – Q17: Prayer and Character Building
- **Question:** In building up the character, what else is necessary?
- **Key Text:** Jude 20 – “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost.”

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points (Prayer)
- **Building Up:**
  - Character is built brick by brick through daily decisions.
  - **Most Holy Faith:** The foundation is the truth of God's Word.
- **Praying in the Holy Ghost:**
  - Prayer inspired and guided by the Spirit.
  - The Spirit helps our infirmities and teaches us how to pray (Romans 8:26).
  - Prayer keeps the channel open between the human soul and God's power.

## Slide 41 – Q18: Advantage of Prayer
- **Question:** What advantage will prayer be to one engaged in such work?
- **Key Text:** James 1:5 – “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.”

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points (Wisdom)
- **We Lack Wisdom:**
  - We often do not know how to handle specific temptations or difficulties.
  - We cannot trust our own understanding (Proverbs 3:5).
- **God Gives Liberally:**
  - God does not scold ("upbraid") us for asking.
- **The Promise:**
  - "It *shall* be given him." We can claim this promise by faith during our struggles.

## Slide 43 – Q19: When to Ask for Help
- **Question:** On what occasions is it proper to ask God for help?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 4:6 – “Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.”

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points (Anxiety vs. Prayer)
- **Be Careful for Nothing:**
  - "Careful" here means anxious or worried.
- **In Everything:**
  - No problem is too small for God to notice, and none too big for Him to solve.
- **With Thanksgiving:**
  - Gratitude opens the heart. We thank God for what He has done and what He has promised to do.

## Slide 45 – Q20: God’s Perfect Care
- **Question:** If we fulfill the conditions of the Bible, how perfect may we expect God's care for us to be?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 46 – Q20: Key Points (Total Sanctification)
- **Sanctify You Wholly:**
  - *Spirit:* The higher powers of the mind.
  - *Soul:* The life, emotions, and personality.
  - *Body:* The physical vessel (implies the importance of health habits).
- **Preserved Blameless:**
  - This is the condition of the saints waiting for the Second Coming.
- **God's Faithfulness:**
  - God is the one who sanctifies.
  - "Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it" (1 Thessalonians 5:24).

## Slide 47 – Q20: Illustration
- **The Refiner's Fire:**
  - A silversmith keeps silver in the fire until the dross is burned away and he can see his own reflection in the metal.
  - God allows us to go through the fires of life, not to destroy us, but to purify us.
  - **Lesson:** He works until He sees the perfect reflection of Jesus in our characters.
