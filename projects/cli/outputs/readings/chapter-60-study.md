### Q1. What did Jesus say would be the condition of the world just prior to His coming?

**Scripture:**
> "As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man." Luke 17:26.
>
> "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually... And the earth was filled with violence." Genesis 6:5, 11.

**Answer:**
Christ’s prophecy regarding the last days strikes a heavy blow against the popular theory that the world will gradually improve until it enters a "golden age" of universal peace. Instead, Jesus explicitly parallels the time of His Second Coming with the **days of Noah**.

1.  **The Prevalence of Sin:** Just as in Noah's day, the last days are marked by the removal of God’s law from the conscience of society. The description in Genesis is chilling: "every imagination... was only evil continually." This indicates a total surrender to the lower nature (Romans 8:7).
2.  **Violence and Anarchy:** The result of casting aside God's law is always violence. When men reject the authority of heaven, they eventually lose respect for human life.
3.  **Preoccupation with the Temporal:** In Luke 17:27-28, Jesus notes that they were eating, drinking, marrying, and building. These things are not sinful in themselves, but they became sinful because they were the *only* focus of life. The people lived entirely for the present world, utterly neglecting the solemn preparation necessary for the coming judgment.

**Key Doctrinal Point:** This condition highlights the necessity of **Righteousness by Faith**. Man, left to his own devices, naturally slides toward evil (Jeremiah 17:9). We cannot improve ourselves or the world by mere social reform or education. We need a power from outside of ourselves—the indwelling life of Christ—to swim against the current of this age.

> **Definition - Grace:** The unmerited favor of God, but also the enabling power of God given to the believer to overcome sin. "Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord" (Genesis 6:8).

**[ILL]** Imagine a boat drifting on a mighty river that leads to a waterfall. The current represents the natural course of this world—wickedness and indifference. To drift is to be lost. To be saved, one must get into the Ark (Christ). Inside the Ark, one is safe from the coming storm, not because of their own swimming ability, but because of the strength of the vessel.

### Q2. According to the parable of the wheat and tares, how long do the good and bad remain together?

**Scripture:**
> "The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the devil. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them." Matthew 13:38, 39, 30.
>
> "The harvest is the end of the world." Matthew 13:39.

**Answer:**
This parable teaches that there will never be a time before the Second Coming when the entire world is converted.

1.  **Co-existence until the End:** The wheat (the righteous) and the tares (the wicked) grow together in the field (the world) until the "harvest."
2.  **The Harvest is the End:** The separation does not happen gradually through political legislation or social evolution. It happens decisively at "the end of the world" (probation’s close and the Second Advent).
3.  **Character Development:** Both groups are "growing."
    *   The wicked are ripening in iniquity (Revelation 22:11).
    *   The righteous are ripening in holiness. This is the work of **Sanctification**—the daily growth in grace where the believer reflects more and more of Jesus’ character (2 Peter 3:18).

**Sanctuary Connection:** This "growing together" corresponds to the time of Christ’s ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary. While the door of mercy is open, anyone may turn from being a tare to becoming wheat through the miracle of the new birth (John 3:3). But once the judgment is finished and Christ stands up (Daniel 12:1), the harvest is ready, and the separation is final.

> **Definition - Probation:** The period of time God grants to humanity to be tested and to choose between life and death. It ends just before Christ returns.

**[ILL]** A gardener often sees weeds intertwining with the roots of precious flowers. To rip the weeds out prematurely might destroy the flowers. God, in His mercy, allows the wicked to remain for a time, giving them every opportunity to repent, and allowing the righteous to develop patience and endurance in the midst of a contrary environment.

### Q3. Did Christ tell us that worldwide preaching of the gospel would result in world conversion?

**Scripture:**
> "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." Matthew 24:14.

**Answer:**
Jesus carefully chose His words. He did not say the gospel would be preached for the *conversion* of all nations, but for a **witness** unto them.

1.  **The Purpose of the Message:** The proclamation of the Gospel—and specifically the Three Angels' Messages of Revelation 14—is to offer salvation to all and to vindicate God's character. God will not end the world until everyone has had a fair opportunity to choose their side.
2.  **Many Called, Few Chosen:** Scripture consistently teaches that while the invitation is universal, the acceptance is limited. "Broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction... and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" (Matthew 7:13-14).
3.  **The Power of the Gospel:** While the world *en masse* will not be converted, the gospel is still "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth" (Romans 1:16). For the individual who accepts it, it brings complete victory over sin and a new life in Christ.

**[ILL]** When a court summons is issued or a royal decree is read in the town square, it is a "witness" to the people. The herald’s job is to ensure everyone hears it. Whether the people obey the decree or rebel against it is their own choice. The proclamation clears the King of any charge of unfairness.

### Q4. How did Paul describe the last days?

**Scripture:**
> "In the last days perilous times shall come." 2 Timothy 3:1.
>
> "Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived." 2 Timothy 3:13.

**Answer:**
Far from predicting a spiritual utopia, the Apostle Paul warns of "perilous" (dangerous/hard) times.

1.  **Moral Decline:** The text says men will wax "worse and worse." This contradicts the evolutionary idea that humanity is naturally improving. Without God, the human heart degenerates (Jeremiah 13:23).
2.  **Deception:** The danger is not just open wickedness, but spiritual deception ("deceiving and being deceived"). This suggests counterfeit forms of christianity that have a "form of godliness" but deny the power thereof—the power to cleanse the heart from sin (2 Timothy 3:5).
3.  **The Necessity of Power:** To stand in such times, a believer must have more than a theory of truth; they must have an experimental knowledge of Christ. **Justification** clears our record, but the indwelling Spirit must impel us to **obedience** or we will be swept away by the prevailing current of evil.

> **Definition - Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in the believer, imparting Christ's life so that we die to sin and live to righteousness (Galatians 2:20).

**[ILL]** Think of a man rowing a boat upstream. If he stops rowing, he doesn't stay in the same place; he immediately begins to drift backward. In the last days, the current of sin is fierce. We cannot rest on yesterday's experience. We must press forward in faith every day, or we will "wax worse and worse" along with the world.

### Q5. How does Scripture describe the state of international affairs?

**Scripture:**
> "Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war, stir up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong." Joel 3:9, 10.

**Answer:**
While diplomats and politicians speak of disarmament and global unity, the Bible predicts an escalation of military tension as the end approaches.

1.  **Preparation for Conflict:** The nations are depicted as preparing for war, converting the tools of agriculture (plowshares) into weapons of destruction (swords).
2.  **The Spirit of War:** This reflects the anger of the nations (Revelation 11:18). As the Spirit of God is gradually withdrawn from the earth due to the rejection of His law, the restraining power that holds back human passion is removed.
3.  **The Weak Say "I am Strong":** Even smaller nations assert themselves, contributing to a global volatility. This leads ultimately to the gathering of nations to the battle of the great day of God Almighty (Revelation 16:14).

**Christian Duty:** In this climate, the follower of Christ is called to be a peacemaker, but not to put their trust in earthly confederacies. Our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20).

**[ILL]** The world situation is like a pressure cooker with the heat turned up. The lid may be clamped down tight (treaties and alliances), but the pressure inside is building. Eventually, without the "safety valve" of God's restraining grace, the vessel must explode.

### Q6. What statement by Jeremiah about conditions in his day equally applies to our own time?

**Scripture:**
> "They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace." Jeremiah 6:14.

**Answer:**
Jeremiah rebuked the religious leaders of his day for offering a superficial remedy for a fatal disease. This applies powerfully to modern spiritual conditions.

1.  **Slight Healing:** This represents a "cheap grace" gospel—telling people they are saved while they continue in known sin. It ignores the deep malignancy of the carnal heart.
2.  **False Peace:** Crying "peace" when the heart is still at war with God’s law (Romans 8:7) is a deception. True peace only comes through **Justification by Faith** which leads to peace *with* God (Romans 5:1), followed by the surrender of the will to His commandments.
3.  **The True Remedy:** God does not want to heal us "slightly." He wants to cleanse the conscience and restore the soul. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to *cleanse us from all unrighteousness*" (1 John 1:9).

> **Definition - Atonement:** The work of reconciliation. In the type (Old Testament), the blood of the victim was shed. In the antitype (New Testament), Christ's blood pays the penalty, and His high priestly ministry applies that blood to blot out sin from the believer’s life.

**[ILL]** If a patient has a deep, infected wound, a doctor who merely puts a band-aid over it and says, "You are fine," is guilty of malpractice. The wound must be cleaned out; the infection must be removed. God is the Great Physician who wants to perform the surgery of removing the "stony heart" (Ezekiel 36:26), not just cover it up.

### Q7. Will talking about world peace create a false security?

**Scripture:**
> "There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." 2 Peter 3:3, 4.
>
> "For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them... and they shall not escape." 1 Thessalonians 5:3.

**Answer:**
Yes. The Bible predicts a widespread lulling of the conscience just before the end.

1.  **Uniformitarianism:** The scoffers argue that nature acts in a closed loop—"all things continue as they were." They deny the catastrophic interventions of God in the past (the Flood) and thus deny the future judgment by fire.
2.  **Peace and Safety:** This is the siren song of the last days. It suggests that humanity has solved its own problems and that God is not needed. It is a spiritual anaesthetic.
3.  **The Thief in the Night:** For those lulled by this message, the day of the Lord comes as a thief—unexpected and destructive. But Paul says to the believers, "Ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief" (1 Thessalonians 5:4).
4.  **Watching and Waiting:** The remedy against false security is spiritual vigilance. We must be "sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love" (1 Thessalonians 5:8). This means living every day in the consciousness of the heavenly judgment.

**[ILL]** The residents of Pompeii were going about their daily business, perhaps discussing the future prosperity of their city, even as Mount Vesuvius began to smoke. They ignored the signs until the destruction was upon them. The "Peace and Safety" cry is the smoke before the eruption.

### Q8. What warning to Isaiah to the faithful in his day should also be the Christian's reaction to last-day conditions?

**Scripture:**
> "Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid." Isaiah 8:12. (See 1 Peter 3:14.)
>
> "When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh." Luke 21:28.

**Answer:**
While the world trembles with fear and apprehension, the child of God is called to a different reaction: Hope and Confidence.

1.  **Sanctify the Lord of Hosts:** Isaiah 8:13 continues, "Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear." If we have a reverent awe of God and a trusting relationship with Christ, we need not fear the chaos of the nations.
2.  **Separation from Worldly Fear:** We are not to join in the panic or the political frenzies ("confederacies") of the wicked. Our anchor holds within the veil (Hebrews 6:19), in the Most Holy Place where Jesus ministers for us.
3.  **Look Up:** When the world looks around in terror, the Christian looks up in expectation. The signs that terrify the wicked are the very signals that our Deliverer is at the door.
4.  **The Assurance of Victory:** The "redemption" spoken of here is the final glorification of the saints. It is the culmination of the plan of salvation. Because we have accepted Christ as our Righteousness now, we can stand before Him then without fear.

> **Promise:** "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee" (Isaiah 26:3).

**[ILL]** When a violent thunderstorm strikes, a stranger might be terrified of the thunder. But a child in that same house, who knows the voice of their father, feels safe. The thunder of the last days is simply the approaching footsteps of our Father and Savior. We know Him, so we do not fear the storm.
