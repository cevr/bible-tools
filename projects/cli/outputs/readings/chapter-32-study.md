### Q1. What was the mission of Christ to the earth?

“For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost." Luke 19:10.

**Answer:**
The mission of Jesus was not merely to teach morality or to set a good example, but to rescue a race that had completely separated itself from God. The language used here implies two great truths about the plan of salvation:

1.  **The Condition of Man:** Humanity is described as "lost." A lost sheep cannot find its own way back to the fold; it is disoriented and helpless. Likewise, without Christ, humanity is alienated from the life of God (Ephesians 4:18) and dead in trespasses and sins.
2.  **The Initiative of God:** It is the Shepherd who goes out to find the sheep. Salvation does not begin with man seeking God, but with God seeking man. The Incarnation was the Son of God crossing the infinite gulf to find us where we are.

**[ILL]** Imagine a child wandering deep into a dark, dense forest until the path is gone and night falls. The child cannot "will" himself home. He needs a rescuer with a light to enter the forest, find him, and carry him out. Christ entered the "forest" of this fallen world to carry us home.

### Q2. From what does Christ redeem us?

“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us." Gal. 3:13.

**Answer:**
To understand redemption, we must understand what we are saved *from*.
*   **The Curse of the Law:** The law of God is holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12), but to the transgressor, it speaks only condemnation. The "curse" is the penalty for breaking God's law, which is eternal death (Romans 6:23).
*   **Redemption:** This term means "to buy back" or "to release by payment of a ransom."
*   **The Exchange:** Christ did not abolish the law; rather, He bore its penalty. By hanging on the cross, He took the condemnation that belonged to us. This is the heart of the atonement: He took our curse that we might have His blessing.

**Definitions:**
*   **Atonement:** The work by which God and man are reconciled (at-one-ment) through the sacrifice and priestly ministry of Jesus.
*   **Substitution:** Christ taking the sinner's place, receiving the punishment the sinner deserved.

**[ILL]** A man is found guilty of a capital crime and sentenced to death. The judge, stepping down from the bench, offers to take the prisoner's place in the execution chamber so the prisoner can go free. The law is upheld (the penalty is paid), but the sinner is saved. This is what Christ did at Calvary.

### Q3. Who shall see God?

“Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." Matt. 5:8.

**Answer:**
Salvation is more than a legal clearance from guilt; it is a transformation of nature.
*   **Internal Purity:** The Pharisees were concerned with external washing and ceremonial cleanness, but Jesus points to the heart. A "pure heart" is one that has been cleansed from the love of sin and deceit.
*   **The Beatific Vision:** To "see God" implies standing in His presence without being consumed. Since God is a consuming fire to sin (Hebrews 12:29), only those whose characters reflect His own righteousness can dwell in His presence (Isaiah 33:14–17).

This purity is not achieved by human scrubbing, but by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, applying the blood of Christ to the conscience (Hebrews 9:14).

**[ILL]** If you look through a window covered in mud, you cannot see the sun clearly, and the light cannot enter the room. Christ cleans the "window" of the soul so that the light of God’s countenance can shine in and through us.

---

### Q4. What relation must those who see God, sustain to Him in this life?

“Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is." 1 John 3:2.

**Answer:**
This verse establishes two vital points about the believer's standing:
1.  **Present Reality:** We do not wait until heaven to become God's children. "Now are we the sons of God." By receiving Christ, we are adopted into the royal family immediately.
2.  **Future Glory:** While our status is settled, our physical glorification waits for the Second Coming. We are currently princes and princesses in enemy territory, waiting for the King to return and restore our full inheritance.

**Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the High Priest bore the names of the tribes of Israel on his breastplate into the Holy Place, Christ bears our names before the Father *now*. We are accepted in the Beloved today.

---

### Q5. How does one become a child of God?

“For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:26.

**Answer:**
Sonship is not hereditary (passed from parents), nor is it national (being born in a certain country), nor is it achieved by merit. It is solely "by faith in Christ Jesus."
*   **Faith:** This is not merely an intellectual assent to historical facts. It is a transaction of the heart where the sinner lays hold of the merits of Christ, trusting wholly in His righteousness for acceptance.
*   **The Exchange:** When we exercise faith, we exchange our poverty for His wealth, our sin for His righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21).

**[ILL]** A beggar has no right to enter a palace. But if the King’s son takes the beggar by the hand and says, "He is with me," the beggar enters on the merits of the son. We enter the family of God holding the hand of Jesus by faith.

---

### Q6. What is said of him who has faith in Christ?

“Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God." 1 John 5:1.

**Answer:**
Here the apostle connects *faith* with the *new birth*.
*   **Regeneration (The New Birth):** A supernatural work of the Holy Spirit where the human heart is given a new spiritual life (John 3:3–5).
*   **The Connection:** True faith is the conduit through which this new life flows. You cannot truly believe in Jesus as the Messiah without the Spirit of God performing this miracle of birth in your soul.

**Definition:**
*   **Born of God:** The impartation of a new nature; a change from being self-centered to being God-centered.

---

### Q7. But what does living faith in Christ include?

“For as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." James 2: 26.

**Answer:**
This is a crucial balance in the doctrine of Righteousness by Faith.
1.  **Faith is the Root, Works are the Fruit:** We are not saved *by* our works, but we are not saved *without* works that follow faith.
2.  **Dead Faith:** A profession of religion that produces no change in behavior, no obedience, and no love, is lifeless. It is a "body without the spirit"—a corpse.
3.  **Living Faith:** Real faith inevitably works by love and purifies the soul (Galatians 5:6). If the life of Christ is truly in the heart, the works of Christ will appear in the life.

**[ILL]** Consider a fruit tree. It does not produce apples to *become* an apple tree; it produces apples because it *is* an apple tree. If a tree never produces leaves or fruit, we know it is dead at the roots. Works are the visible proof of the life flowing through the roots of faith.

---

### Q8. When is faith effectual?

“And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight." 1 John 3:22.

**Answer:**
Faith is not a magic word; it is a relationship.
*   **The Condition of Answered Prayer:** There is a direct link between our obedience and our confidence in prayer. If we willfully cherish sin (breaking His commandments), we cut ourselves off from the channel of blessing (Psalm 66:18; Isaiah 59:2).
*   **Pleasing Him:** The believer who has been justified by grace delights to do God’s will. The law, which was once an enemy, is now written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).

**Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the incense (representing the prayers of saints) was offered on the Golden Altar. This altar was situated directly before the veil of the Most Holy Place, where the Law of God was kept in the Ark. Prayer and the Law are close companions.

---

### Q9. Is it necessary to do the things that we know are pleasing to God in order to maintain living faith?

“For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God." 1 John 3:20, 21.

**Answer:**
Yes. A guilty conscience paralyzes faith.
*   **The Condemning Heart:** When we knowingly walk contrary to God's will, our confidence evaporates. We cannot come "boldly to the throne of grace" (Hebrews 4:16) while holding hands with sin.
*   **God's Greatness:** The text also offers comfort. "God is greater than our heart." Sometimes we feel condemned even when we have repented. God knows the difference between a weak, struggling heart that desires Him and a rebellious, defiant heart.
*   **Victory:** To maintain living faith, we must claim the power of Christ to overcome every known sin.

**[ILL]** A child who has broken a vase and hidden the pieces feels fearful and shy around his father. The relationship is strained by the secret. Once the child confesses and is forgiven, he runs to his father with confidence again. Obedience and a clear conscience restore boldness.

---

### Q10. But still, will keeping the law justify anyone? If not, why not?

“Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin." Rom. 3:20.

**Answer:**
This is the cornerstone of the Gospel: **Legalism cannot save.**
*   **The Function of the Law:** The law is a standard of righteousness. Like a mirror, its purpose is to reveal defects, not to remove them. A mirror can show you that your face is dirty, but you cannot wash your face with the mirror.
*   **Why it cannot justify:**
    1.  We have already sinned. Future obedience cannot pay for past crimes.
    2.  Our nature is fallen. Without Christ, even our "best" works are tainted with selfishness (Isaiah 64:6).

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** The legal declaration by God that a sinner is righteous. This standing is granted solely based on the merits of Jesus, not the behavior of the sinner.

---

### Q11. How are we justified?

“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Rom. 5:1.

**Answer:**
*   **The Instrument:** Justification is by *faith*. Faith is the hand that accepts the gift.
*   **The Result:** Peace with God. The war is over. The sinner is no longer an enemy but a reconciled friend.
*   **The Source:** "Through our Lord Jesus Christ." It is His perfect life (which satisfied the law's precept) and His sacrificial death (which satisfied the law's penalty) that constitute our righteousness.

**RBF (Righteousness by Faith):** We do not have peace because we have conquered all our sins; we have peace because Christ has conquered. From this platform of peace, we then go on to conquer sin in His power.

---

### Q12. In what condition were we before being justified?

“For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died." Rom. 7:9.

**Answer:**
Paul describes the experience of conviction:
1.  **Alive without the law:** Before he understood the spiritual depth of the law (especially the 10th commandment against coveting), Paul felt self-righteous and spiritually "alive."
2.  **The Commandment came:** When the Holy Spirit applied the law to his conscience, he saw the true nature of his heart.
3.  **I died:** His self-confidence was shattered. He realized he was spiritually dead. This "death" to self-righteousness is a necessary step before true regeneration can occur. You cannot be saved until you realize you are lost.

---

### Q13. How does God take away condemnation?

“Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ." Eph. 2:5.

**Answer:**
When we are lying "dead" in our guilt and helplessness, God intervenes.
*   **Quickened:** This old English word means "made alive."
*   **Together with Christ:** Just as God raised Jesus from the physical dead, He raises the believer from spiritual death. This is the resurrection power of God working in the soul. Grace meets us in the grave of our sin and brings us out.

**[ILL]** Lazarus was dead in the tomb. He could not help himself. Jesus came and spoke the word of life, "Lazarus, come forth!" Regeneration is a miracle of resurrection power in the human spirit.

---

### Q14. What does the apostle, in another place call this quickening?

“According to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost." Titus 3:5.

**Answer:**
Here the process is given its theological name: **Regeneration.**
*   **Washing:** This refers to the cleansing from the guilt of past sins (symbolized by baptism and the Laver in the sanctuary).
*   **Renewing of the Holy Ghost:** This is the daily impartation of power to live a new life. It is not enough to be forgiven (washed); we must be refilled (renewed) so that we do not return to the mire of sin.

**Definition:**
*   **Regeneration:** From the Greek *palingenesia* (palin = again, genesis = birth/creation). It literally means to be created again.

---

### Q15. What is one evidence of regeneration?

“We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death." 1 John 3:14.

**Answer:**
The surest test of the new birth is not a feeling or a vision, but a change in relationship with others.
*   **From Selfishness to Love:** The natural heart is selfish. It seeks its own way. The regenerated heart possesses the love of Christ.
*   **The Test:** If we harbor hatred, grudge-holding, or indifference toward fellow believers, we "abide in death." The fruit of the Spirit is love (Galatians 5:22).

**[ILL]** Take a piece of cold iron; it has no attraction to other iron. But coil a wire around it and run electricity through it—it becomes a magnet and draws other iron to itself. When the "electricity" of the Holy Spirit enters a man, he naturally draws near to and loves the brethren.

---

### Q16. Before man's fall, to what did he especially have access?

“And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden." Gen. 2:9.

**Answer:**
*   **The Tree of Life:** This tree was the medium through which God sustained the immortality of the human race. Adam and Eve were not inherently immortal (only God is, 1 Timothy 6:16); their life was conditional upon obedience and access to this tree.

---

### Q17. After Adam transgressed, what was done to him?

“So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life." Gen. 3:24.

**Answer:**
*   **Access Denied:** Because man sinned, he was cut off from the source of endless life.
*   **Mercy in Judgment:** This was an act of mercy. To allow a sinner to eat of the tree of life would be to immortalize sin. God would not permit an eternal sinner to exist in misery. Therefore, man became subject to death.

---

### Q18. What was cursed because of the fall?

“Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life." Gen. 3:17.

**Answer:**
The effects of sin were not limited to man's nature; they infected the physical creation.
*   **Cosmic Regeneration:** The "regeneration" spoken of in the Bible involves not just the saving of souls, but the healing of the earth itself. The thorns, thistles, and decay we see in nature are the result of the curse man brought upon his dominion.

---

### Q19. In the sin of our first parents, to whom did they yield their inheritance?

“While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage." 2 Peter 2:19.

**Answer:**
This is a principle of spiritual law: You are the slave of the one you choose to obey (Romans 6:16).
*   **The Lost Dominion:** God gave Adam dominion over the earth (Genesis 1:26). When Adam obeyed Satan, he surrendered that dominion. He became a captive, and Satan became the "god of this world" (2 Corinthians 4:4).

---

### Q20. After the fall of man, did the earth pass into the hands of Satan?

“And the Devil, taking Him [Jesus] up into a high mountain, showed unto Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, And the Devil said unto Him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, I give it." Luke 4:5, 6.

**Answer:**
Yes. Jesus did not dispute Satan's claim that the kingdoms had been "delivered unto him." Satan is the usurper who currently holds sway over the planet through the agency of sin. Christ came as the "Second Adam" to win back the territory the first Adam lost.

---

### Q21. Will the possession purchased by the blood of Christ, be restored again to man?

“In whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest [pledge] of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory." Eph. 1:13, 14.

**Answer:**
*   **The Purchased Possession:** This refers to the earth itself, originally given to man.
*   **The Earnest:** The Holy Spirit in our hearts is the "down payment" or guarantee that the full restoration is coming.
*   **Future Hope:** Redemption includes the resurrection of the body (Romans 8:23) and the restoration of the earth. The plan of salvation is not complete until the physical world is reclaimed from the enemy.

**Sanctuary Connection:** The Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16) involved not only cleansing the people but cleansing the physical sanctuary itself. God will cleanse the universe.

---

### Q22. But in redeeming the possession, the earth, as well as man, must be cleansed from the curse. How will this be done? and what will be the result?

“Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:12, 13.

**Answer:**
*   **The Cleansing Fire:** Just as the old world was cleansed by water (the Flood), the present world will be cleansed by fire. This fire will eradicate every trace of sin, Satan, death, and the curse (Malachi 4:1–3).
*   **The Result:** From the ashes of the purified earth, God will re-create a "New Earth." It will be the home of the righteous, free from the stain of sin.

---

### Q23. When will the regeneration of the earth take place?

“And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Matt. 19:28.

**Answer:**
Jesus explicitly refers to the making new of all things as "the regeneration."
*   **Timing:** This occurs when the "Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory," which points to the establishment of His eternal kingdom after the eradication of sin.
*   **Parallel:** Just as the individual must be born again (regenerated) by the Spirit to see the kingdom, the earth must be born again (regenerated) by fire to become the kingdom.

---

### Q24. What will be the condition of the earth when redeemed?

“For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." Hab. 2:14; (Num.14:21).

**Answer:**
The Great Controversy ends with the complete vindication of God's character.
*   **Glory Restored:** The "glory" of the Lord is His character of love (Exodus 33:18–19; 34:6–7). The entire earth, once marred by the selfishness of sin, will pulse with the love of God. Creation will perfectly reflect the Creator once again.

---

### Q25. Will the earth ever be cursed again, when once redeemed?

“And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him." Rev. 22:3.

**Answer:**
*   **Security:** The security of the redeemed is eternal. "Affliction shall not rise up the second time" (Nahum 1:9).
*   **Why?** The redeemed have seen the terrible cost of sin (the death of Christ) and the terrible result of sin (the history of this world). They are immune to sin not because God forces their will, but because they love Him supremely and have the law written on their hearts.

---

### Q26. Will man regain the right to the tree of life which was forfeited through sin?

“Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." Rev. 22:14.

**Answer:**
The story of the Bible ends where it began: with man and the Tree of Life.
*   **Restoration:** What Adam lost, Christ regained.
*   **The Character of the Redeemed:** They "do His commandments." This is not legalism; it is the description of those who have been washed, regenerated, and sanctified by the blood of the Lamb. Because they are restored to harmony with God's law (His character), they can safely live forever.
*   **The Grand Finale:** The regeneration is complete. The soul is restored to God's image, and the earth is restored to Edenic beauty.

**[ILL]** The Bible is like a circle. It begins in Eden with no sin, a tree of life, and God walking with man. The circle is broken by sin. But through the cross of Christ, the line curves back until the circle is closed in Revelation: Eden restored, no sin, the tree of life accessible, and "God himself shall be with them" (Revelation 21:3).
