### Q1. What power makes war upon the remnant church, prior to the second advent?

**“And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the
remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony
of Jesus Christ." Revelation 12:17.**

**Answer:**

The power identified here is the dragon, which Scripture identifies as Satan
working through earthly powers (Revelation 12:9). This text outlines the final
conflict in the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan.

- **The Target:** The "remnant" refers to the last remaining portion of God's
  faithful people on earth. Just as a remnant of fabric is the exact same
  material as the original roll, the end-time church must hold the same doctrine
  and faith as the apostolic church.
- **The Characteristics:** This group is identified by two specific marks:
  1.  **They keep the commandments of God:** This implies a restoration of all
      ten precepts, including the fourth commandment Sabbath, which has been
      trampled down (Daniel 7:25). This obedience is not a method of earning
      salvation, but the fruit of a heart in which God has written His law
      (Hebrews 8:10).
  2.  **They have the testimony of Jesus:** Revelation 19:10 defines this as
      "the spirit of prophecy." God guides His final people through the
      prophetic gift.
- **The Warfare:** Satan is "wroth" (enraged) because this group proves that
  God’s law can be kept through faith in Jesus. Their lives refute Satan's claim
  that God's requirements are unjust or impossible.

**[ILL]** Imagine a general who has conquered almost an entire country, but one
small fortress refuses to surrender. That fortress flies the true king's flag
and follows his laws perfectly. The general will focus all his artillery on that
one spot. Similarly, Satan focuses his final wrath on the remnant who uphold the
Law of God and the Faith of Jesus.

### Q2. What reward is promised to the overcomer?

**"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in
the midst of the Paradise of God." Revelation 2:7, 17, 26 (Rev. 3:5, 21).**

**Answer:**

The reward is the restoration of what was lost in Eden—eternal life and
face-to-face communion with God.

- **Definition of "Overcomer":** An overcomer is not someone who never has
  struggles, but one who gains the victory over sin, self, and Satan through the
  merits of Christ.
- **The Rewards Listed:**
  - **The Tree of Life (Rev 2:7):** Access to immortality, barred since Adam's
    fall (Genesis 3:22–24).
  - **Hidden Manna (Rev 2:17):** Spiritual sustenance and intimate communion
    with Christ.
  - **Power over nations (Rev 2:26):** Reigning with Christ.
  - **White Raiment (Rev 3:5):** The character of Christ acknowledged publicly
    before the Father.
  - **Sitting on the Throne (Rev 3:21):** Sharing in Christ’s glory.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We must note that the promise is to "him that
  overcometh." This victory is not achieved by human willpower alone, but by the
  "faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12). Christ overcame the world (John 16:33),
  and by faith, His victory becomes ours.

**[ILL]** A sick patient cannot cure themselves by trying hard to be healthy.
They must accept the medicine from the physician. The medicine destroys the
disease and restores health. Christ is the physician; His grace is the medicine.
The "overcomer" is the patient who trusts the physician enough to take the
medicine until the cure is complete.

### Q3. Through whom are we able to conquer?

**“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that loved
us." Romans 8:37.**

**Answer:**

Our victory is entirely dependent on our union with Christ. The text says we are
"more than conquerors," or "super-victors."

- **Source of Power:** The victory comes "through Him that loved us." It is His
  love, demonstrated at the Cross (Justification), that motivates us, and His
  life, imparted to us by the Spirit (Sanctification), that empowers us.
- **More than Conquerors:** An earthly conqueror may win a battle but lose many
  men or be wounded. A Christian conquers without losing anything of eternal
  value, for even death cannot separate them from God's love (Romans 8:38–39).
  Furthermore, an earthly conqueror fights to _gain_ victory; a Christian fights
  _from_ a position of victory already won by Christ.
- **The Practical Reality:** When a sinner claims the power of Christ to
  overcome a specific habit—be it temper, appetite, or pride—they are using a
  power that has never lost a battle.

**[ILL]** A small child walking through a dark, dangerous forest is safe not
because of their own muscles, but because they are holding the hand of their
strong father. The child is "more than a conqueror" over the wolves because the
father's strength is counted as the child's safety.

### Q4. Who was the invisible leader of the army of Israel?

**"Behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand;
and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our
adversaries? And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now
come." Joshua 5:13, 14 (1 Cor. 10:1-4).**

**Answer:**

The invisible leader was none other than Christ in His pre-incarnate form. 1
Corinthians 10:4 identifies the spiritual Rock that followed Israel as Christ.

- **Captain of the Host:** This title indicates supreme command. Joshua, the
  earthly leader, immediately fell on his face and worshipped (Joshua 5:14),
  showing he recognized this Being as Divine.
- **The Lord's Battle:** The response "Nay" (neither for you nor your
  adversaries in a partisan sense, but representing God's standard) teaches us
  that we must be on God's side; we cannot assume He is merely backing our
  agendas.
- **Connection to Us:** Just as Christ led literal Israel into Canaan, He is
  leading spiritual Israel (the Church) into the heavenly Canaan. He is our High
  Priest in the heavenly sanctuary and our King in the battle against sin. We do
  not fight alone; we follow the Commander.

**[ILL]** In an orchestra, every musician watches the conductor. If they play
their own tune, there is chaos. If they follow the conductor, there is harmony.
Christ is the Conductor of the universe; our victory comes from keeping our eyes
fixed on Him (Hebrews 12:2).

---

### Q5. With what weapons is the Christian warfare conducted?

**“For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the
pulling down of strongholds." 2 Corinthians 10:4.**

**Answer:**

The Christian does not use the methods of the world to advance God's kingdom or
to overcome sin.

- **Definitions:**
  - **Carnal:** Fleshly, human, worldly. Examples include force, political
    manipulation, anger, debate, or mere human willpower (zeal without
    knowledge).
  - **Mighty through God:** Spiritual weapons such as prayer, the Word of God,
    faith, and love.
- **Pulling Down Strongholds:** A "stronghold" in ancient times was a fortified
  castle. In the spiritual life, this represents deep-seated habits of sin,
  prejudices, or false doctrines that have entrenched themselves in the mind.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot overcome a spiritual enemy (Satan) with
  carnal weapons (our own promises or resolutions). We need the divine power of
  the Holy Spirit to blast away the citadels of self-love in our hearts.

**[ILL]** You cannot fight a tank with a slingshot, nor can you fight the
darkness with a sword. To defeat darkness, you simply turn on the light. To
defeat spiritual darkness, we must turn on the light of God's Word and Spirit.

---

### Q6. What are these weapons able to conquer?

**“Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against
the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
of Christ." 2 Corinthians 10:5.**

**Answer:**

The warfare is primarily internal—it is a battle for the mind.

- **Imaginations:** Human reasoning, philosophies, and justifications that
  contradict God's Word.
- **Every High Thing:** This refers to pride and self-sufficiency that refuses
  to bow to God's law.
- **Captivity of Thought:** True sanctification extends beyond outward actions
  to the very thoughts and motives. This is the standard of the Ten Commandments
  as explained by Jesus (Matthew 5:21–28).
- **How is this possible?** By the "expulsive power of a new affection." When we
  love Christ supremely, our thoughts are drawn to Him. When a temptation
  arises, we immediately submit it to Christ, asking Him to take it captive.

**[ILL]** A gardener does not just cut the tops off the weeds; he must pull them
out by the roots. "Bringing into captivity every thought" is God's method of
pulling up the roots of sin so that the garden of the heart can bear the fruit
of the Spirit.

---

### Q7. What are we to put on?

**“Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles
of the Devil." Ephesians 6:11.**

**Answer:**

We are to put on the _whole_ armor, not just a part of it. This armor represents
the character of Christ given to the believer.

- **Definition of "Wiles":** The Greek word implies trickery, scheming, or
  strategic deception. Satan rarely attacks openly; he usually attacks through
  deception, disguising sin as something desirable or harmless.
- **The Whole Armor:** To leave off one piece is to leave a fatal opening. We
  cannot have faith without truth, or the gospel without obedience
  (righteousness).
- **God's Armor:** It is not _our_ armor. We do not fabricate it; we "put it
  on." This is the essence of Righteousness by Faith—we put on the Lord Jesus
  Christ (Romans 13:14).

**[ILL]** A deep-sea diver must wear a complete pressurized suit to survive the
crushing weight of the ocean. If there is even a small hole in the helmet or the
boot, the water rushes in and the diver is lost. We live in an atmosphere of
sin; only the complete covering of Christ can protect us.

---

### Q8. What is included in the "wiles of the Devil" that one has to meet?

**“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in high places." Ephesians 6:12.**

**Answer:**

The "wiles" include an organized assault by invisible, supernatural forces.

- **Not Flesh and Blood:** Our true enemy is never a human being (a bad
  neighbor, a boss, a political leader). The enemy is the spiritual force
  working _behind_ the scenes. This changes how we fight: we love the person but
  resist the spirit.
- **Principalities and Powers:** These terms refer to the organized ranks of
  fallen angels. Satan has a military structure.
- **The Need for Divine Aid:** Because our enemy is supernatural and invisible,
  human strength is useless. We must rely on the High Priest in the heavenly
  sanctuary to send the Holy Spirit to aid us.

**[ILL]** If a house is being attacked by termites, fighting them with a shotgun
is useless. The enemy is hidden within the walls. You need a professional who
understands the nature of the pest. In spiritual warfare, we need Christ, who
knows how to defeat the invisible enemy.

---

### Q9. What are the first essentials of the needed armor?

**“Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the
breastplate of righteousness." Ephesians 6:14.**

**Answer:**

The first two pieces are the Belt of Truth and the Breastplate of Righteousness.

1.  **Loins Girt with Truth:** In ancient dress, the belt gathered up loose
    robes so a soldier could run or fight without tripping. Truth (God's Word
    and honesty of heart) holds everything else together. Without a sincere love
    for truth, our religion is loose and ineffective.
2.  **Breastplate of Righteousness:** The breastplate protects the vital
    organs—the heart and lungs.
    - _Imputed Righteousness (Justification):_ This is Christ's record covering
      us, protecting us from the accusation of the law (Romans 8:1, 33).
    - _Imparted Righteousness (Sanctification):_ This is the life of obedience
      lived out by the power of the Spirit, protecting the conscience from the
      defilement of sin.

**[ILL]** A weightlifter wears a strong belt to support his core. Without it, he
risks injury under heavy loads. The Christian wears the belt of Truth to support
their character under the heavy pressures of life.

---

### Q10. What is the truth with which one's loins are to be girded?

**“Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." John 17:17.**

**Answer:**

The "truth" is the Word of God—the Scriptures.

- **Sanctify:** To make holy or set apart. The Bible is not just a history book;
  it is the agent of transformation. Reading and obeying the Bible changes the
  human character.
- **Objective Truth:** In a world of relative truth ("my truth" vs. "your
  truth"), the Christian stands on the absolute authority of God's Word.
- **Doctrinal Purity:** The "remnant" must hold the pure doctrines of the Bible,
  for error is one of Satan's wiles. We must know what the Bible says about the
  law, the Sabbath, the state of the dead, and the sanctuary.

**[ILL]** A compass points north regardless of how the hiker feels. The Word of
God is the compass. If we rely on our feelings (which change constantly), we are
lost. We must be girded with the unchanging map of Scripture.

---

### Q11. What is meant by having the loins girded?

**“Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for
the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." 1
Peter 1:13.**

**Answer:**

To "gird up the loins" means to be ready for action, specifically in the mind.

- **Mental Discipline:** It means gathering up loose thoughts, daydreams, and
  skepticism, and focusing the mind on Christ. A "loose" mind is easily
  distracted by temptation.
- **Sobriety:** Being serious and vigilant, not intoxicated with the cares or
  pleasures of this world.
- **Application:** We cannot afford to be mentally lazy. We must study the
  Scriptures and guard the avenues of the soul (eyes and ears) so that we are
  ready to meet the enemy.

**[ILL]** Before a race, a runner ties their shoelaces and tucks in their shirt.
They remove anything that might drag or trip them. "Girding the mind" means
tucking away doubts and distractions so we can run the race of faith (Hebrews
12:1).

---

### Q12. What is the "righteousness" of which the breastplate is composed?

**“My tongue shall speak of thy word; for all thy commandments are
righteousness." Psalm 119:172.**

**Answer:**

The Bible defines righteousness as conformity to God's commandments. Therefore,
the breastplate is a character in harmony with God's law.

- **The Standard:** God's law is the transcript of His character. To be
  righteous is to do what is right according to that standard.
- **The Source:** While the law _defines_ righteousness, it cannot _produce_ it
  in a sinner (Romans 3:20). We have all sinned. Therefore, we need:
  1.  **Christ's Righteousness for us:** His perfect obedience is credited to us
      when we repent (Justification).
  2.  **Christ's Righteousness in us:** He writes the law on our hearts,
      enabling us to keep the commandments (Sanctification).
- **Protection:** When the law is written in the heart, sin becomes hateful to
  us. This protects us from temptation. A man who loves his wife (has the law of
  adultery-prevention in his heart) is protected from the temptation of
  infidelity.

**[ILL]** A mirror can show you that your face is dirty, but it cannot wash your
face. The Law is the mirror showing us our duty; Christ is the water that
cleanses us and the light that fills us.

---

### Q13. With what are the feet to be shod?

**“And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace." Ephesians
6:15 (James 3:18).**

**Answer:**

The Christian soldier wears the shoes of the "gospel of peace."

- **Stability:** Roman soldier sandals had hobnails (cleats) to grip the ground
  so they wouldn't slip in battle. The Gospel gives us sure footing. When we
  know we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1), we can
  stand firm even when the world shakes.
- **Readiness to Move:** Shoes also imply readiness to travel. The Christian is
  always ready to share the good news of salvation with others.
- **Peace:** In the midst of spiritual warfare, the warrior possesses an
  internal peace that the world cannot give (John 14:27). This peace guards the
  believer from anxiety and fear.

**[ILL]** Walking barefoot on sharp rocks or thorns causes hesitation and pain.
But wearing heavy-duty boots allows a person to walk confidently over rough
terrain. The Gospel allows us to walk through the "rough terrain" of trials and
persecution without slipping.

---

### Q14. What piece of armor is next mentioned as necessary?

**“Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench
all the fiery darts of the wicked." Ephesians 6:16 (1 John 5:4) (Heb. 11:6).**

**Answer:**

The Shield of Faith is the mobile defense that covers the whole body.

- **Definition of Faith:** Faith is not merely believing God exists; it is
  taking God at His word. It is the substance of things hoped for (Hebrews
  11:1). It is trusting that God loves us and His power is sufficient for us.
- **Fiery Darts:** These are specific temptations—doubts, lusts, fears, or
  discouragement—shot by Satan to inflame the passions.
- **Quenching the Darts:** When a temptation comes (e.g., "God doesn't care
  about you"), faith replies with Scripture ("He cares for me," 1 Peter 5:7).
  This extinguishes the temptation before it can take root in the heart.
- **Victory:** 1 John 5:4 says, "This is the victory that overcometh the world,
  even our faith." We do not fight to get victory; we use faith to grasp the
  victory Christ has already won.

**[ILL]** Ancient shields were often covered in wet leather to extinguish
flaming arrows. Faith acts like that wet leather. When the spark of temptation
hits, it hisses and dies because the heart trusts in a better promise from God.

---

### Q15. What is the last and crowning piece of armor to be put on?

**“And take the helmet of salvation." Ephesians 6:17.**

**Answer:**

The helmet protects the head—the seat of the intellect and the will.

- **Assurance:** The helmet is the hope of salvation (1 Thessalonians 5:8). It
  is the assurance that we belong to God. This protects the mind from despair
  and the accusations of Satan.
- **Protecting the Mind:** The brain is the "capital city" of the body. It is
  where the Holy Spirit communicates with man. Satan attacks the mind with false
  doctrines and worldly distractions. The assurance of God's saving grace guards
  our decision-making capability.
- **High Priestly Ministry:** We look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our
  faith. Knowing He is interceding for us in the Heavenly Sanctuary gives us the
  confidence to "hold fast the profession of our faith" (Hebrews 10:23).

**[ILL]** A construction worker wears a hard hat not because he expects a brick
to fall every minute, but because the risk is always there. The Christian wears
the assurance of salvation constantly, so when the blow of discouragement falls,
the head remains safe.

---

### Q16. What sword is to be used by the soldier of Christ?

**“The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God." Ephesians 6:17.**

**Answer:**

This is the only offensive weapon in the armor. It is used to cut down the lies
of the enemy and to defend the truth.

- **The Example of Jesus:** In the wilderness of temptation (Matthew 4), Jesus
  met every attack of Satan with "It is written." He did not use His divine
  power or philosophical arguments; He used the Word of God.
- **Sword of the Spirit:** The Bible was inspired by the Holy Spirit (2 Peter
  1:21). Only the Spirit can wield it effectively. We must pray for the Spirit
  to bring the right verses to our remembrance when we are tested.
- **Sharpness:** Hebrews 4:12 says the Word is sharper than any two-edged sword,
  piercing to the division of soul and spirit. It exposes the secret motives of
  the heart and cuts out the disease of sin.

**[ILL]** A surgeon uses a scalpel to cut out a tumor. It is sharp and
dangerous, but it saves life. The Word of God cuts our pride and exposes our
sin, not to hurt us, but to save us from the "cancer" of iniquity.

---

### Q17. Will there be those in the remnant church who will risk their lives in the contest against the enemy?

**“And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death." Revelation 12:11.**

**Answer:**

Yes. The final conflict will involve a test of loyalty that may require the
ultimate sacrifice, just as it did for the martyrs of the past.

- **The Basis of Victory:** They overcome by the "blood of the Lamb." Their
  confidence is not in their own martyrdom or works, but in Christ's atonement.
- **The Witness:** "The word of their testimony" is their public declaration of
  God's truth and their personal experience of His power. They cannot be
  silenced.
- **Total Surrender:** "They loved not their lives unto the death." This
  indicates a death to self (Galatians 2:20) that is so complete they are
  willing to die physically rather than disobey God. This is the faith of
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—"our God is able to deliver us... but if not,
  we will not serve thy gods" (Daniel 3:17–18).

**[ILL]** A soldier who is afraid to die is easily manipulated by the enemy. But
a soldier who has already considered himself "dead" to the world and alive only
to his King cannot be threatened. The martyrs broke Satan's power because they
feared God more than man.

---

### Q18. Will this commandment keeping company be victorious under Christ, their leader?

**“And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that had
gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and
over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of
God." Revelation 15:2.**

**Answer:**

Yes, the victory is certain. The scene depicts the redeemed standing on the sea
of glass before God's throne.

- **Total Victory:** They have victory over the "beast, his image, and his
  mark." This refers to the final test regarding false worship and the law of
  God (specifically the Sabbath/Sunday issue in the last days). They refused to
  compromise God's law for human tradition.
- **The Song of Moses and the Lamb:** The next verse (v.3) says they sing a song
  of deliverance. Just as Israel stood on the shore of the Red Sea seeing their
  enemies defeated, the saints stand on the sea of glass.
- **Harps of God:** This symbolizes their joy and harmony with heaven. Their
  warfare is ended; their armor is laid down; their rest is won.
- **The Promise:** This scene is written to encourage us _now_. The battle may
  be fierce, and the enemy strong, but the outcome has already been decided for
  those who remain in Christ.

**[ILL]** When a runner sees the finish line, they find a burst of energy.
Revelation 15:2 gives us a glimpse of the finish line. We see the victors
standing there. This encourages us to press on, knowing that the "sufferings of
this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us" (Romans 8:18).
