## Slide 1 – Q1: The Event at Christ’s Coming
- **Question:** What great event will take place at the coming of Christ?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17 – “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Return)
- **A Personal Return:**
  - It is “The Lord Himself,” not a representative (Acts 1:11 – “...this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”).
- **The First Resurrection:**
  - The “dead in Christ” rise first. This is the “resurrection of life” (John 5:29 – “And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life...”).
- **Translation of the Living:**
  - Faithful believers alive at that moment are caught up without seeing death.
- **Meeting in the Air:**
  - Christ does not touch the earth yet; He calls His people *up* to the clouds.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Union with Christ:**
  - To be “in Christ” then, we must be in Him *now*.
- **Justification (Title to Heaven):**
  - We need the imputed righteousness of Christ to cover past sins (Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”).
- **Sanctification (Fitness for Heaven):**
  - We need the imparted righteousness of Christ, allowing His Spirit to reproduce His character in us (Colossians 1:27 – “...Christ in you, the hope of glory.”).
- **The Result:** Only those who let Jesus reign in their hearts today will rejoice to see Him reign in the clouds.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Magnet and the Mixture:**
  - Imagine a table covered with wood shavings and iron filings mixed together.
  - If a powerful magnet passes over, only the iron filings leap up to meet it; the wood remains below.
  - The magnet does not change wood into iron; it attracts what is already sensitive to it.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - Christ’s coming draws those who partake of His nature.
  - We must possess the “iron” of faith and the Holy Spirit now to respond to His call then.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Destination of the Saints
- **Question:** Where will the saints then be taken?
- **Key Text:** John 14:2, 3 – “In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points & Sanctuary Insight
- **The Destination:**
  - Jesus went to heaven (“Father’s house”) to prepare a place, and He takes us *there*.
  - This contradicts the view that the Millennium is a time of peace *on* the earth.
- **The Reunion:**
  - The true joy is being received “unto Myself”—uninterrupted fellowship with Jesus.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly service, the High Priest entered the Most Holy Place while people waited outside.
  - When his work was done, he came out to bless the people.
  - Jesus, our High Priest, will finish His work in the heavenly sanctuary and come out to lead His people home (Hebrews 9:28 – “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Bridegroom:**
  - Ancient custom: A bridegroom left his betrothed to build a room at his father’s house.
  - The bride waited and kept herself pure.
  - When ready, he returned to fetch her and take her *to his father’s home* for the marriage feast.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - Christ is the Bridegroom coming to take His bride (the church) to the marriage supper in heaven (Revelation 19:7–9).

## Slide 8 – Q3: Condition of the Earth
- **Question:** In what condition will the earth be after the coming of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 4:23, 26 – “I beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens and they had no light. ... I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by His fierce anger.”
- **Additional Text:** Isaiah 24:1 – “Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (The Millennium)
- **Total Ruin:**
  - The earth returns to a pre-creation state of darkness and disorder (*tohu va bohu* – "without form and void").
- **Causes of Destruction:**
  - The seven last plagues and the great earthquake at Christ's coming level the cities (Revelation 16:18-20).
- **No Golden Age:**
  - The Millennium (the 1,000 years) is not a time of earthly prosperity, but of silence and desolation.
- **Definition:**
  - The Millennium is the period between the first resurrection (righteous) and the second resurrection (wicked).

## Slide 10 – Q4: Inhabitants of Earth
- **Question:** Will any man be living on the earth at that time?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 4:25 – “I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.”
- **Additional Text:** Zephaniah 1:3 – “I will consume man and beast... and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points & Illustration
- **Total Depopulation:**
  - **The Righteous:** Are in heaven (1 Thessalonians 4:17).
  - **The Wicked:** Are slain by the brightness of His coming.
  - The planet becomes a dark, cosmic prison house.
- **Illustration: The Abandoned House:**
  - Imagine a house where the family has moved out, taking everything of value.
  - A storm destroys the windows and roof; the house stands empty and ruined.
  - During the Millennium, the “family” (saints) is in heaven; the “house” (earth) is a wreck.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Fate of the Wicked
- **Question:** What is to become of those who are not caught up to heaven with the Lord?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 25:31 – “The Lord hath a controversy with the nations; He will plead with all flesh; He will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points & Application
- **Slain by Glory:**
  - Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God.
  - 2 Thessalonians 2:8 – “And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.”
- **A Sad Necessity:**
  - God does not delight in death, but those who refused the “wedding garment” of righteousness are defenseless against His purity.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - We need **Imputed Righteousness** (Christ's merit) as a covering.
  - Like a shield protecting a soldier from fire, Christ covers the believer so they can stand in God's presence and live (Isaiah 33:14–16).

## Slide 14 – Q6: Reign of the Saints
- **Question:** How long will these resurrected saints reign with Christ in heaven?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:4 – “And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: ... and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Judgment)
- **The Duration:**
  - The saints reign in heaven for one thousand years.
- **The Work of Judgment:**
  - The saints participate in the judgment (1 Corinthians 6:2 – “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?”).
- **Vindication of God:**
  - The redeemed examine the records to understand why some (neighbors, family, leaders) are lost.
  - They see that God did everything possible to save them.
  - This vindicates God’s character against Satan’s accusations.

## Slide 16 – Q7: Timing of Life
- **Question:** When were these made to live?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:6 – “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points (First Resurrection)
- **Timing:**
  - They are raised at the **First Resurrection** (at Christ's return), beginning the 1,000 years.
- **Character:**
  - They are “Blessed and holy”—a result of submitting to the Holy Spirit’s sanctification.
- **Priesthood:**
  - They offered themselves as living sacrifices on earth (Romans 12:1); now they serve God directly.
- **Exemption:**
  - They are immune to the “Second Death” (eternal destruction) because they are born again in Christ.

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Wicked Dead
- **Question:** How long will the wicked remain in their graves?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:5 – “But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.”
- **Key Point:**
  - The wicked dead remain in their graves for the entire Millennium.
  - There is no “second chance” during this time; probation has closed.

## Slide 19 – Q9: Satan Bound
- **Question:** What will be Satan's condition during the thousand years?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:2 – “And He laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.”
- **Key Point:**
  - Satan is bound and his power checked.
  - This fulfills the scapegoat typology (Leviticus 16), where sins were symbolically placed on Azazel and he was led into the wilderness.

## Slide 20 – Q10 & Q11: The Prison
- **Question (Q10):** Where will he be kept?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:3 – “And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him.”
- **Question (Q11):** Where is the bottomless pit?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 9:2 – “And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit... and the sun and the air were darkened...”

## Slide 21 – Q11: Explaining the Abyss
- **The Bottomless Pit (*Abussos*):**
  - Not a subterranean cavern, but the earth itself in its ruined state.
  - The Greek word *abussos* matches the Septuagint's use in Genesis 1:2 for the “deep.”
- **Confinement:**
  - Satan is chained to this broken, depopulated planet.
  - He cannot tempt unfallen worlds.
  - He is forced to look upon the ruin his rebellion caused for 1,000 years.

## Slide 22 – Q12: Satan’s Current Work
- **Question:** What is Satan's occupation up to the time of his binding?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 5:8 – “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”
- **Key Point:**
  - Until the end, he is frantically busy deceiving, tempting, and destroying.
  - He works through disobedience (Ephesians 2:2) and accuses the brethren (Revelation 12:10).

## Slide 23 – Q13: The Nature of the Binding
- **Question:** In what sense are we to understand the binding of Satan?
- **Key Points:**
  - **Bound by Circumstances:**
    - The saints are in heaven.
    - The wicked are dead.
    - There is no one left to tempt.
  - **Solitary Confinement:**
    - He is left alone to contemplate his failure.
- **Illustration: The Chained General:**
  - A general who thrives on war is captured and put on a deserted island.
  - Even if not physically in chains, he is “bound” because he has no soldiers to command and no enemies to fight. His power is gone.

## Slide 24 – Q14: Satan’s Release
- **Question:** What will release Satan from this condition?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:5, 7 – “But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” “And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.”
- **Key Point:**
  - The **resurrection of the wicked** releases Satan.
  - Suddenly, the earth is filled with the unrepentant from all ages, giving him subjects to deceive again.

## Slide 25 – Q15: Duration of Release
- **Question:** For how long a period will he be loosed?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:3 – “That he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.”
- **Key Point:**
  - A “little season”—just enough time to organize the wicked for one last desperate attempt against God.

## Slide 26 – Q16: Satan’s Final Strategy
- **Question:** In what work will he immediately engage?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:8 – “And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Deception:** He convinces the wicked he raised them and they can capture the Holy City (which descends to earth – Revelation 21:2).
  - **Fixed Character:** Even after 1,000 years of death, the wicked rise with the same rebellious spirit they died with.

## Slide 27 – Q17: The Final Battle
- **Question:** What will be the result of their effort to take the city?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:9 – “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.”
- **Key Point:**
  - This is the execution of the judgment.
  - They are stopped by God’s executive fire, not by the saints.

## Slide 28 – Q18: Fulfillment of Promise
- **Question:** What statement will thus be fulfilled?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 37:34 – “Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.”
- **Application:**
  - The wicked are “cut off” (removed from existence) to clean the universe.
  - We are called to “Wait on the Lord”—patience now leads to vindication then.

## Slide 29 – Q19: Escaping the Second Death
- **Question:** How many will escape this second death?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:6 – “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power.”
- **Key Point:**
  - Only those born again who remained faithful escape.
  - 1 John 5:4 – “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”

## Slide 30 – Q20: Effect of the Fire
- **Question:** What will be the effect of the fire?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 4:1 – “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.”

## Slide 31 – Q20: Key Points (God’s Justice & Love)
- **Total Destruction:**
  - The wicked are “stubble”—burnt to ash, not tormented eternally.
  - “Root and branch” means complete end: Satan (root) and his followers (branches).
- **God’s Love:**
  - It is a “strange act” (Isaiah 28:21), but one of mercy.
  - To keep rebellious sinners alive in a holy universe would be torture to them.

## Slide 32 – Q21: Purification of Earth
- **Question:** What, besides the wicked, will feel the effect of this fire?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:7 – “But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.”
- **Key Point:**
  - The atmosphere and earth, polluted by sin, are purified.
  - Every trace of the curse (disease, death, sin) is cleansed.

## Slide 33 – Q22: The End of the Old
- **Question:** What will be the result?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:10 – “And the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also; and the works that are therein shall be burned up.”
- **Key Point:**
  - All monuments of human pride and selfishness—weapons, prisons, casinos—are “burned up.” The old regime is gone.

## Slide 34 – Q23: The New Creation
- **Question:** Then what will come?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:13 – “Never the less we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”

## Slide 35 – Q23: Key Points & Illustration
- **Wherein Dwelleth Righteousness:**
  - The defining mark of the New Earth is not just gold, but *Righteousness*.
  - God’s law is written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
- **Illustration: The Artist:**
  - If an enemy throws ink over a masterpiece, the artist doesn't just clean it.
  - He burns the ruined canvas and paints a new, indestructible version.
  - God restores creation to its original, perfect design.

## Slide 36 – Q24: The Inheritors
- **Question:** Who will inherit the new earth?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 37:9 – “For evil doers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth.”
- **Key Point:**
  - It is the home of the saved—those who trusted Christ and allowed Him to transform their lives.

## Slide 37 – Q25: Condition of the Redeemed
- **Question:** What will be their condition there?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 37:11 – “But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.”
- **Key Point:**
  - **Meekness:** Inherited by the gentle and submissive to God, not the aggressive.
  - **Peace:** Permanent peace; no more war or anxiety.

## Slide 38 – Q26: The Universal Anthem
- **Question:** How will every intelligent creature in the universe then show his appreciation of the gift of eternal life?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 5:13 – “And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.”

## Slide 39 – Q26: Conclusion (The Great Controversy Ended)
- **Harmony Restored:**
  - Every voice unites to declare that God is Love.
- **Focus on the Lamb:**
  - The scars of Jesus remind us forever that our home was purchased by His sacrifice.
- **Final Thought:**
  - “The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the vast creation.” — *The Great Controversy*, p. 678.
