## Slide 1 – Title: The “Sign” of Loyalty

- **Study Topic:** The Seal of God vs. The Mark of the Beast
- **Theme:** A choice between two authorities: The Creator God and the Beast
  power.
- **Key Insight:** The Sabbath is not a legalistic burden, but a “sign” that the
  Lord makes us holy (Ezekiel 20:12).
- **Focus:** True Sabbath-keeping is the outward evidence of an inward rest in
  the finished work of Christ—Righteousness by Faith.

---

## Slide 2 – Introduction: The Final Crisis

- In the closing scenes of the Great Controversy, the world is brought to a
  decision.
- The choice is not merely between two days, but between two authorities.
- God’s law is a transcript of His character.
- The opposing power seeks to change times and laws.
- This study explores the “Seal of God” as the mark of ownership and
  sanctification.

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Third Angel’s Warning

- **Question:** Against what does the third angel warn men?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:9, 10 – “And the third angel followed them, saying
  with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his
  mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the
  wrath of God.”

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Key Points

- The third angel’s message is the most solemn warning in the Bible.
- It warns against three specific things:
  - **Worshiping the beast:** Spiritual allegiance to the apostate power (Rev
    13).
  - **Worshiping his image:** Aligning with the coalition of religious and civil
    powers.
  - **Receiving his mark:** Accepting the sign of the beast’s authority in the
    forehead (belief) or hand (compliance).
- **The Core Issue:** Sovereignty. To whom do we belong?

---

## Slide 5 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **God is Love:** He does not allow His children to be deceived without clear
  warning.
- **The Counterfeit:** The “mark” is a counterfeit sign of loyalty opposed to
  God’s sign.
- **Spiritual Discernment:**
  - We cannot resist this deception by our own wisdom.
  - Only those “in Christ,” covered by His righteousness, have the discernment
    to distinguish the true Gospel from the counterfeit.

---

## Slide 6 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Counterfeit Bill**
- If a man wishes to deceive you with counterfeit money, he does not print a
  bill that looks nothing like the original.
- He makes it look as close to the authentic currency as possible.
- **Lesson:** Satan’s master deception is not atheism, but a false
  Christianity—a system that looks like the truth but lacks the power of God’s
  law and the Spirit’s transforming grace.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: The Scope of Deception

- **Question:** How many will worship the beast?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:8 – “And all that dwell upon the earth shall
  worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain
  from the foundation of the world.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q2: Key Points

- **Universal Deception:** The verse implies “all that dwell upon the earth”
  will be involved.
- **Two Classes:**
  1. Those who follow the popular current for safety, tradition, or economic
     security.
  2. Those whose names remain in the **Book of Life**.
- **The Majority:** Numbers are not a safe guide in spiritual matters (Matthew
  7:13–14).
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Security is found only in the “Lamb slain.”
  - Our names are kept in the book only by the merit of His shed blood and His
    intercession in the heavenly sanctuary.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Character of the Faithful

- **Question:** What will those be doing who are not worshipers of the beast?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are
  they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points

- This verse describes the character of God’s remnant people.
- **The Patience of the Saints:** Endurance and steadfast perseverance (James
  1:3–4). They hold to Christ when the world opposes them.
- **Keeping the Commandments:**
  - While the world claims the law is changed or abolished, this group upholds
    the Ten Commandments.
  - They obey not to _be_ saved, but because they _are_ saved (John 14:15).

---

## Slide 11 – Q3: Application (The Faith OF Jesus)

- **Faith OF Jesus:**
  - Deeper than just faith _in_ Jesus.
  - Possessing the same quality of trust and dependence on the Father that Jesus
    had.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot keep the commandments without the faith of Jesus.
  - It is His life, lived out in us by the Holy Spirit.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
    live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Anchor**
- A ship in a storm is not held safe by the captain’s anxiety or effort, but by
  the anchor gripping the solid rock.
- The “Faith of Jesus” is our anchor.
- When the storms of the last days blow, our feelings may fluctuate.
- If our faith is anchored within the veil (Hebrews 6:19), in the work of our
  High Priest, we shall not be moved.

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: The Final Reward

- **Question:** Where are the faithful ones finally found?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:2 – “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled
  with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his
  image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of
  glass, having the harps of God.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Sea of Glass:** Located before the throne of God (Revelation 4:6).
- **Victory:** They are not victims, but victors over the beast’s system.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - Just as the High Priest carried blood into the Most Holy Place, Christ
    brings His people into the Father’s presence.
  - “Mingled with fire” represents the purifying glory of God.
  - They are not consumed because they are clothed in Christ’s righteousness.

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: The Father’s Name

- **Question:** What do they have on their foreheads?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:1 – “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the
  mount Zion, and with Him a hundred forty and four thousand, having His
  Father's name written in their foreheads.”

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Father’s Name:**
  - In the Bible, a name represents **character** (Exodus 34:5–7).
  - God’s character is perfectly reproduced in their minds and lives.
- **The Forehead:** Represents the intellect, will, and conscience.
- **Sealing Definition:**
  - The settling of the believer into the truth, both intellectually and
    spiritually, so they cannot be moved.
  - God’s claim of ownership.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Number Sealed

- **Question:** How many were sealed?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 7:4 – “And I heard the number of them which were
  sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all
  the tribes of the children of Israel.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **The 144,000:**
  - A special company of believers who live through the final events.
  - Translated without seeing death (1 Corinthians 15:51–52).
- **Significance:**
  - Whether literal or symbolic of spiritual Israel, the key is their character.
  - They are “without fault” before the throne.
  - They are “firstfruits” (Rev 14:4)—evidence that the Gospel can produce a
    holy people in a sinful world.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Seal of God

- **Question:** With what were they sealed?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 7:2 – “And I saw another angel ascending from the
  east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the
  four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea...”

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **A Seal:** A mark of authentication; in ancient times, it made a document
  law.
- **Contrast:**
  - The “Seal of the Living God” opposes the “Mark of the Beast.”
  - Beast’s mark = man-made authority (Sunday).
  - God’s seal = God’s authority.

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Wax Seal**
- When a king stamps hot wax with his signet ring, the wax takes the exact
  impression of the ring.
- Every curve and letter is transferred.
- **Lesson:** God is pressing His law and Spirit upon our hearts (the wax).
- The Holy Spirit warms the heart so it can receive the perfect impress of God’s
  character. A hard (stubborn) heart cannot receive the seal.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: Location of the Seal

- **Question:** Where were they sealed?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 7:3 – “Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea,
  nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their
  foreheads.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **In the Forehead:**
  - The mark of the beast can be in the hand (forced action).
  - God’s seal is _only_ in the forehead.
- **Voluntary Service:**
  - God does not value forced obedience.
  - He desires the “service of the mind” (Romans 7:25).
- **Timing:** This sealing happens right before the winds of strife blow in full
  fury.

---

## Slide 24 – Q9: Purpose of a Seal

- **Question:** What does the Bible present as the object of a sign, or seal?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:8 – “Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the
  writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and
  Persians, which altereth not.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points

- **Object of a Seal:** To render a document unchangeable and valid.
- **Authority:** A seal confirms the authority of the lawgiver. Without it, a
  law is just paper.
- **God’s Law:** The Ten Commandments are the constitution of His government.
  They must contain a seal identifying the Lawgiver and His right to command.

---

## Slide 26 – Q10: The Seal and the Law

- **Question:** With what is God's seal connected?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 8:16 – “Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my
  disciples.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points

- **Connection:** The seal is directly connected to the Law.
- **Restoration:**
  - If the law is binding, the seal must be found within it.
  - Man has attempted to remove the seal by changing the law.
  - The work of the final generation is to “seal the law” among the
    disciples—restoring it to the heart.
- **New Covenant:** Writing the law upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10).

---

## Slide 28 – Q11 & Q12: Examining the Commandments

- **Question:** Does the first commandment show who is its author?
  - _Text:_ Exodus 20:3 – “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.”
  - _Answer:_ No. A heathen deity could claim this text. It does not define who
    “Me” is universally.
- **Question:** Does the third commandment show who is the author of the law?
  - _Text:_ Exodus 20:7 – “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
    vain...”
  - _Answer:_ No. There are “gods many and lords many” (1 Cor 8:5). This does
    not distinguish the Creator.

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Identifying the Author

- **Question:** Which commandment does point out unmistakably the Author of the
  law, and show His right to command?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:11 – “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
  the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
  Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

---

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Fourth Commandment:** Only this commandment contains the essential
  elements of an official seal:
  1. **Name:** “The LORD thy God” (Jehovah).
  2. **Title:** Creator (“Made”).
  3. **Territory:** Heaven, earth, sea, and all therein.
- **The Signature:** The Sabbath is the signature of the Lawgiver.
- **The Change:** By changing the Sabbath to Sunday, the Roman church removed
  the Creator’s seal and substituted a mark of ecclesiastical authority.

---

## Slide 31 – Q14: The Sabbath as a Sign

- **Question:** For what purpose is the Sabbath a sign?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 20:12 – “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a
  sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that
  sanctify them.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q14: Application (Sanctification & Faith)

- **Sign of Sanctification:**
  - The Sabbath signifies that God is the One who makes us holy.
  - This is the heart of **Righteousness by Faith**.
- **Creation and Re-creation:**
  - God rested after Creation; we rest in the finished work of Christ for
    redemption.
  - We cannot make ourselves holy.
  - True Sabbath-keeping is ceasing from our own works (legalism) and trusting
    God’s work (Hebrews 4:10).

---

## Slide 33 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Wedding Ring**
- A wedding ring is a sign of loyalty and belonging.
- It tells the world, “I belong to another.”
- The ring doesn’t _make_ the person married (the vows do), but it is the
  visible sign of the relationship.
- The Sabbath is the “wedding ring” of the bride of Christ, signifying loyalty
  to the Creator who sanctifies her.

---

## Slide 34 – Q15: The Remnant

- **Question:** How is this remnant church distinguished, while waiting for the
  Lord to appear on the white cloud?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are
  they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points

- **Distinction:** A return to primitive godliness.
- **Law:** While the world dismisses God’s law, the Remnant upholds the binding
  nature of the Ten Commandments.
- **Faith:** They do not trust human strength but possess the **Faith of
  Jesus**.
- **Contrast:** They hold the “seal of God” (Sabbath/Character) in contrast to
  the “mark of the beast.”

---

## Slide 36 – Q16: The Dragon’s Wrath

- **Question:** What will be the feeling toward them?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and
  went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
  God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points

- **Wrath and Warfare:**
  - The dragon (Satan) hates the law because it detects sin.
  - He hates the Sabbath because it points to the Creator.
- **Persecution:**
  - Those who refuse to compromise will face economic sanctions and death
    decrees (Rev 13:15).
  - “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution” (2
    Timothy 3:12).

---

## Slide 38 – Q17: Standing Before God

- **Question:** After enduring the struggle, how will they appear before God?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:5 – “And in their mouth was found no guile: for
  they are without fault before the throne of God.”

---

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points

- **No Guile:** No deceit or hypocrisy; they are sincere like Nathanael (John
  1:47).
- **Without Fault:**
  - Their sins have been blotted out in the judgment.
  - They are covered by Christ’s righteousness.
- **Promise:** Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling,
  and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
  joy.”

---

## Slide 40 – Q18: The New Song

- **Question:** What will be the nature of the song they sing?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:3 – “And they sung as it were a new song before
  the throne... and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and
  four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q18: Key Points

- **A New Song:** Represents a specific experience of deliverance.
- **Unique Experience:**
  - No one else can learn it because no one else has passed through the same
    trial.
  - They lived without an intercessor during the time of trouble, standing firm
    by faith in God’s promise alone.
- **Theme:** Absolute victory through Grace.

---

## Slide 42 – Q19: The Final Victory

- **Question:** Over what had these gotten the victory?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:2 – “And them that had gotten the victory over the
  beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his
  name... stand on the sea of glass...”

---

## Slide 43 – Q19: Key Points

- **Four-Fold Victory:**
  1. Over the **Beast** (religious-political system).
  2. Over his **Image** (intolerance).
  3. Over his **Mark** (false sabbath).
  4. Over the **Number of his Name** (worldly commerce/identity).
- **The Song of Moses and the Lamb:**
  - **Moses:** Deliverance from enemies (Exodus 15).
  - **Lamb:** Deliverance from sin and death through Christ’s blood.

---

## Slide 44 – Conclusion

- The **“Sign of Loyalty”** is the Sabbath, kept by faith in the Creator.
- It is the outward evidence of a heart that has chosen God above tradition.
- Victory is not achieved by human willpower, but by “the faith of Jesus”
  working in the surrendered heart.
- May we be found on that sea of glass!
