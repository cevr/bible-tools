### Q1. How earnestly should we seek for salvation?
"Wherefore... brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure." 2 Peter 1:10.

**Answer:**
The apostle Peter here emphasizes the cooperative nature of the plan of salvation. While salvation is entirely by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8), it is not a passive experience where the believer goes to sleep spiritually. We are called to "give diligence," implying an earnest, persistent effort to walk in the light God has given.

*   **Making it Sure:** God’s calling is always sure on His part; He is faithful (1 Thessalonians 5:24). The uncertainty lies with us. To make our election "sure" means to anchor our wavering will in the immovable rock of Christ Jesus.
*   **Cooperation, Not Earnings:** This diligence does not "buy" salvation. Rather, it is the active reception of the gift. Just as a drowning man must diligently grasp the life preserver thrown to him, we must lay hold of Christ’s strength.
*   **Sanctification:** This verse connects with the growth described in previous verses (2 Peter 1:5–7)—adding to faith virtue, knowledge, temperance, and charity. This is the work of **sanctification**—the daily process of becoming more like Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit.

**Definition:**
*   **Election:** God’s gracious choice to save those who believe in Jesus. It is not an arbitrary selection of individuals for heaven or hell, but a selection of a *class of people*—those who are "in Christ."

**[ILL]**
Imagine a wealthy philanthropist offers a full scholarship to a university for anyone who enrolls and attends classes. The offer is the "calling." However, for the student to graduate, they must actually attend the classes and study. Their study does not "earn" the money—the money was a gift—but their diligence makes the scholarship effective in their life. So it is with salvation: freely given, but we must diligently walk in it.

### Q2. How important is it that we persevere to the end?
"Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown." Revelation 3:11.

**Answer:**
In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the enemy constantly seeks to cause us to let go of our hold on God. The warning to "hold fast" implies that what we possess—faith, truth, and the presence of the Holy Spirit—can be lost if cherished sin or indifference is allowed to enter the heart.

*   **The Danger of Falling Away:** The Bible does not teach "once saved, always saved" regardless of our choices. A believer can cast away their confidence (Hebrews 10:35).
*   **Protecting the Crown:** The "crown" represents the victory and eternal life promised to the overcomer (2 Timothy 4:8). We are to guard this spiritual treasure as a soldier guards a fortress.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We hold fast not by our own muscular tension, but by the continuous exercise of faith. As we keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, He sustains us. "He is able to keep you from falling" (Jude 24), provided we do not choose to walk away.

**[ILL]**
A mountain climber is secured by a strong safety rope held by a master guide (Christ). The rope is strong enough to hold any weight. However, the climber is told, "Hold fast to the rope; do not unclip your harness." If the climber deliberately unclips the carabiner to chase a flower on a ledge, they fall. The rope didn't fail; the connection was severed by the climber.

### Q3. On what condition is the crown of life promised to us?
"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." Revelation. 2:10.

**Answer:**
The crown is promised not merely to those who start the race, but to those who finish it. Faithfulness is the condition of the new covenant.

*   **Faithful unto Death:** This implies two things:
    1.  Faithfulness throughout the entire span of one's natural life.
    2.  Faithfulness even to the point of martyrdom, if necessary.
*   **The Quality of Faith:** True faith is not a fleeting emotion; it is a principle of the life. It is a "faith that works by love" (Galatians 5:6) and produces obedience to God’s commandments.
*   **God's Promise:** The Giver of the crown is Christ Himself. Our faithfulness is a response to His faithfulness. We love Him because He first loved us (1 John 4:19).

**Definition:**
*   **Covenant:** A binding agreement. In the Covenant of Grace, God promises to write His law in our hearts and forgive our sins, and we pledge our loyalty and trust to Him (Hebrews 8:10–12).

***

### Q4. How long ago did God and Christ determine that they would seek to save us?
"According as He hath chosen us in Him [Christ] before the foundation of the world." Ephesians 1:4.

**Answer:**
The plan of salvation was not an afterthought developed when Adam and Eve sinned. It was laid in the councils of heaven from eternity past.

*   **The Eternal Purpose:** God foresaw the entrance of sin, though He did not cause it. He prepared the remedy—Christ, the "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 13:8).
*   **Chosen "In Him":** This is the key to biblical election. God did not choose specific individuals to be saved apart from their choice; He chose *Christ* as the Elect One. Therefore, anyone who chooses to be "in Christ" becomes part of that elect group.
*   **Security:** This gives the believer immense security. Our salvation is rooted in the eternal, unchangeable purpose of God, not in the shifting sands of time.

**[ILL]**
Before a ship sets sail, the captain determines the destination (the port). He does not force people onto the ship, but he declares, "Anyone who boards this ship is elected to reach that destination." The destination is predetermined for the ship (Christ). We choose whether to get on board and stay on board.

***

### Q5. Who are those that will thus be saved?
"That we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love." Verse 4, R.V.

**Answer:**
This verse clarifies the *object* of election. God has not merely chosen us to escape hell; He has chosen us to be restored to His image.

*   **Holy and Without Blemish:** This language is drawn from the Sanctuary service. The sacrificial lamb had to be without blemish (Leviticus 22:20–21). Christ was the perfect Lamb (1 Peter 1:19). Now, through His grace, He proposes to make *us* holy.
*   **Imparted Righteousness:** The Gospel does more than forgive the past (justification); it transforms the character (sanctification). God’s plan is to have a people who, through the power of the Spirit, have victory over every known sin.
*   **Before Him in Love:** Holiness is not cold legalism. It is a life rooted in love—love for God and love for neighbor. This is the fulfillment of the law (Romans 13:10).

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The work of the Holy Spirit in the believer, separating them from sin and making them holy in character and conduct (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

***

### Q6. To what has God foreordained those who attain to this character?
"Having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto Himself." Verse 5, R .V.

**Answer:**
God’s plan is to bring us into the closest possible relationship with Himself—that of family.

*   **Adoption:** In the Roman world, adoption was a legal process where a person was given all the rights, privileges, and debts of a natural-born son. Spiritually, we are "born again" into God’s family.
*   **Restoration:** Adam was called the "son of God" (Luke 3:38). Sin broke that relationship, making us children of wrath (Ephesians 2:3). Christ, the only begotten Son, took our place so that we might regain the status of sons and daughters.
*   **Heirs:** Because we are children, we are heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17).

**Definition:**
*   **Foreordained (Predestinated):** God’s pre-determined plan that all who accept Christ shall be adopted as His children. The plan is fixed; our participation in it is voluntary.

***

### Q7. According to what does God call us?
"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose." Romans 8:28.

**Answer:**
The "call" is not random; it is according to a specific design—God's purpose to restore man to holiness and happiness.

*   **All Things Work Together:** This is the providence of God. Even our trials, temptations, and difficulties are overruled by God to refine our characters.
*   **The Condition:** The promise is for "them that love God." To the rebellious, trials often harden the heart; to the humble believer, they purify the soul like gold in the fire (1 Peter 1:7).
*   **Conformity to Christ:** The very next verse (Romans 8:29) explains the purpose: "to be conformed to the image of His Son." God uses the circumstances of life to chisel away our selfishness and shape us into the likeness of Jesus.

**[ILL]**
A sculptor looks at a rough block of marble and sees a beautiful statue inside. He strikes it with a hammer and chisel. To the marble, it feels like destruction and pain. But the sculptor strikes "according to his purpose"—to remove everything that isn't the statue. God chisels our characters through life's trials to reveal the image of Jesus.

***

### Q8. In fulfillment of whose plan have we been predestined?
"Being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel of His own will." Ephesians 1:11.

**Answer:**
Our salvation originates in the "counsel of His own will." It is God's will, not man's ambition, that drives the plan of redemption.

*   **The Sovereignty of God:** God is the Architect of salvation. No human invented the idea of grace or atonement.
*   **Confidence:** Because the plan is based on God’s will, it cannot fail. If we submit to His will, we are joining the winning side. "If God be for us, who can be against us?" (Romans 8:31).
*   **Harmony:** True religion is bringing the human will into harmony with the Divine will. When we pray "Thy will be done," we are aligning ourselves with the most powerful force in the universe.

***

### Q9. Upon what condition is salvation offered to us?
"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Acts 16:31.

**Answer:**
While God provides the plan, the power, and the sacrifice, man must provide the consent. That consent is called faith.

*   **Belief is More than Knowledge:** The devils also believe and tremble (James 2:19). Saving faith is a transaction—it is trusting fully in Christ as one's personal Sin-bearer and King.
*   **Justification by Faith:** When we believe, God counts Christ's righteousness as ours. We are declared righteous (justified) not because of what we have done, but because of who He is.
*   **The Simplicity of the Gospel:** The Philippian jailer asked, "What must I do?" He expected a list of difficult tasks. The answer was simple: "Believe." This faith, however, naturally leads to a changed life (as seen when the jailer washed the apostles' stripes that same night).

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** The legal act of God declaring a repentant sinner righteous. It is the pardon of sin and the imputation of Christ’s perfect life to the believer (Romans 5:1).

***

### Q10. For how long must we maintain our faith in and connection with God-in order to achieve this final salvation?
"He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." Matthew 24:13. (See James 1:12; Revelation 2:10.)

**Answer:**
The Christian life is a marathon, not a sprint. Initial conversion is essential, but final salvation depends on enduring faith.

*   **Daily Dependence:** We are not saved by a decision made twenty years ago, but by a relationship maintained today. "I die daily," said Paul (1 Corinthians 15:31).
*   **Abiding in the Vine:** Jesus taught that the branch must *abide* (remain) in the vine to bear fruit. If it does not abide, it withers and is cast into the fire (John 15:6).
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the ancient sanctuary, the priest kept the lamps burning continually (Leviticus 24:2). So must the oil of the Holy Spirit be constantly replenished in our hearts until the end of probation.

**[ILL]**
A marriage begins with a wedding (justification/covenant). But a happy marriage requires enduring love and faithfulness every day thereafter (sanctification/endurance). A person cannot say, "I was faithful on my wedding day," and then ignore their spouse for the next 40 years. Relationship requires endurance.

***

### Q11. Can our names be written right now in heaven?
"But rejoice that your names are written in heaven." Luke 10:20. R.V .

**Answer:**
Yes, we can have the assurance that we are currently registered as citizens of God’s kingdom.

*   **The Book of Life:** The Bible speaks of a book in heaven recording the names of those who have accepted God’s service (Philippians 4:3).
*   **Present Assurance:** We do not have to wait until we die to know if we are accepted. "He that hath the Son hath life" (1 John 5:12). If we are walking in the light, our names are in the book.
*   **The Heavenly Census:** Just as earthly governments keep a census of their citizens, Heaven keeps a record of the saints. This shows God's personal care for each individual believer.

***

### Q12. Whose names only will be retained in those books?
"He that overcometh,... I will not blot out his name out of the book of life." Revelations 3:5.

**Answer:**
This verse introduces the solemn reality of the Investigative Judgment. Having one's name written in the book is the first step; keeping it there requires overcoming.

*   **Blotting Out:** There are two possibilities for every entry in the Book of Life: either the *sin* is blotted out (Acts 3:19), or the *name* is blotted out.
*   **The Condition:** The name is retained for "he that overcometh." This implies victory over sin, the world, and self.
*   **How to Overcome:** We overcome "by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony" (Revelation 12:11). It is not human willpower alone, but Christ living in us. As we confess our sins and turn from them, Jesus acts as our Advocate, covering our lives with His righteousness.

**Definition:**
*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (Daniel 8:14) where He reviews the lives of professed believers to see who has remained faithful, before His Second Coming.

***

### Q13. What scripture is sometimes cited as evidence that God is arbitrary in His dealings with men?
"Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth." Romans 9:18.

**Answer:**
This verse is often misunderstood to mean that God forces some people to be lost by hardening their hearts against their will.

*   **The Case of Pharaoh:** The context often refers to Pharaoh. The Bible says Pharaoh hardened his own heart first (Exodus 8:15, 32). God "hardened" him not by forcing him to sin, but by sending light and evidence that Pharaoh rejected.
*   **The Effect of Rejected Light:** When truth is presented and rejected, the heart naturally becomes harder. The same sun that melts the wax hardens the clay. The difference is in the material, not the sun.
*   **God's Sovereignty:** Paul is arguing that God has the right to bypass national Israel if they reject Him, and show mercy to Gentiles who accept Him. He is not speaking of arbitrary individual predestination to hell.

***

### Q14. But what other scripture explains those toward whom God "wills" to be merciful, or otherwise?
"With the merciful Thou wilt shew Thyself merciful; with an upright man Thou wilt shew Thyself upright; with the pure Thou wilt shew Thyself pure; and with the froward Thou wilt shew Thyself froward." Psalm 18:25, 26. (See also Isaiah 55:7.)

**Answer:**
Scripture interprets Scripture. Here we see that God's reaction to man is determined by man's attitude toward God.

*   **Reciprocity:** God reflects our choices back to us. If we choose mercy and purity, God pours out His mercy and purity upon us. If we are "froward" (crooked/stubborn), God appears to be an adversary because He must oppose our sin.
*   **Divine Justice:** God is not arbitrary. He operates by the law of love and liberty. He respects human choice so deeply that He allows men to set their own destiny.
*   **Isaiah 55:7:** "Let the wicked forsake his way... and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him." The condition for receiving mercy is turning from sin. God wills to be merciful to *all* who return.

**[ILL]**
A mirror reflects exactly what stands before it. If you smile, it smiles back. If you frown, it frowns back. God’s law is a mirror (James 1:23–25). To the righteous, God’s face is full of approval; to the rebellious, His face is "against them that do evil" (1 Peter 3:12). The change is in us, not in God.

***

### Q15. How many people does God desire to be saved?
"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth." 1 Timothy 2:4.

**Answer:**
This text destroys the doctrine that God has predestined some to be damned. His will—His desire and provision—is for *all* humanity to be saved.

*   **Universal Atonement:** Christ died for "the whole world" (1 John 2:2), not just an elect few.
*   **The Tragedy of the Lost:** Since God wants all to be saved, and Christ paid for all, those who are lost are lost only because they "frustrate the grace of God" (Galatians 2:21) and refuse the gift.
*   **God's Character:** God is love (1 John 4:8). He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 33:11).

***

### Q16. What is our part in the work of salvation?
"Choose you this day whom ye will serve." Joshua 24:15. "If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching." John 7:17, R .V. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Acts 16:31. "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Revelation 22:17.

**Answer:**
Our part is the exercise of the will. We cannot cleanse our own hearts, we cannot atone for our own sins, but we can *choose* to serve God.

*   **The Power of Choice:** "Everything depends on the right action of the will." God has given us the power of decision. We must choose to surrender to Him.
*   **Continuous Choice:** Notice the present tense: "Choose you *this day*." "Whosoever *will*." It is a daily, moment-by-moment decision to place our will on the side of God's will.
*   **The Result:** When we choose to submit to God and believe in Christ, God provides the power (Philippians 2:13). He supplies the repentance, the forgiveness, and the strength to obey. Our job is to open the door; His job is to come in and clean the house (Revelation 3:20).

**[ILL]**
A man is sick with a deadly disease. The doctor brings the cure. The man cannot cure himself; he cannot synthesize the medicine. But he *can* choose to open his mouth and swallow the medicine. If he refuses, he dies—not because the medicine wasn't available, but because he refused to take it. Faith is the hand that takes the medicine of the Gospel.
