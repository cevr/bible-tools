### Q1. With what words does the Apostle Peter close his second epistle?

**2 Peter 3:18**  
> “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.”

**Answer:**
The Christian life is never static; it is a life of constant progress. Peter’s closing admonition reminds us that salvation is not merely a single past event, but a daily living experience.

*   **The Definition of Grace:**
    *   *Grace* is often defined as "unmerited favor," which is true, but in the context of Christian growth, it is much more. It is the enabling power of God working in the heart of the believer.
    *   **Definition—Grace:** The divine power and favor of God that not only forgives sin (justification) but transforms the nature (sanctification) to enable obedience (Titus 2:11–12; 2 Corinthians 12:9).
*   **The Necessity of Growth:**
    *   Just as a physical child must grow to attain maturity, the "babe in Christ" (1 Peter 2:2) must grow up into the full stature of Christ (Ephesians 4:15).
    *   If a plant stops growing, it begins to die. Similarly, there is no neutral ground in the spiritual life; we are either advancing toward holiness or retreating into the world.
*   **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
    *   Growth in grace is the work of **Sanctification**.
    *   **Definition—Sanctification:** The lifelong process by which the Holy Spirit imparts the righteousness of Christ to the believer, changing their character to reflect God’s law of love (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
    *   We do not grow *in order* to be loved by God; we grow *because* we are loved and justified by Him.

**[ILL]**
Consider a newborn baby. The parents love the child perfectly the moment it is born; the child does not need to earn that love. However, the parents’ great desire is that the child will grow, learn to walk, speak, and mature into an adult. If the child remained an infant for twenty years, it would be a tragedy. So it is with God: He accepts us as we are (Justification), but He loves us too much to leave us as we are (Sanctification).

### Q2. How may grace and peace be multiplied in believers?

**2 Peter 1:2**  
> “Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.”

**Answer:**
Grace and peace are not stagnant quantities; they can be "multiplied" or increased in the believer's experience. The channel for this increase is the "knowledge of God."

*   **Experiential Knowledge:**
    *   The Greek word used here for "knowledge" (*epignosis*) implies full, precise, and experiential knowledge. It is not merely knowing facts *about* God, but knowing Him personally through relationship and communion (John 17:3).
*   **The Source of Peace:**
    *   Peace is the result of being justified by faith (Romans 5:1). As we know Jesus better—His character, His sacrifice, and His priestly ministry—our trust in Him deepens, and our peace increases.
*   **Sanctuary Application:**
    *   In the earthly sanctuary, the priest ministered daily in the Holy Place. This represents our daily communion with Christ through:
        1.  **The Shewbread:** Feeding on the Word of God.
        2.  **The Altar of Incense:** Daily prayer.
        3.  **The Candlestick:** Witnessing and living by the Spirit’s light.
    *   It is in this "Holy Place" experience that we come to know Jesus as our Intercessor, and grace is multiplied to us (Hebrews 4:16).

**[ILL]**
You may know *of* the ruler of a foreign country by reading about him in the newspaper, but that knowledge gives you no special access to his resources. However, if that ruler is your father, and you live in his house and speak with him daily, you have a relational knowledge that grants you access to his help and protection. Knowing Jesus intimately opens the storehouse of heaven's grace.

### Q3. What has our heavenly Father given to us, to enable us to become partakers of the divine nature?

**2 Peter 1:4**  
> “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”

**Answer:**
This verse contains one of the most powerful secrets of victory in the Bible. God has provided His "promises" as the vehicle to convey His nature to us.

*   **The Power of the Promise:**
    *   In every command of God, there is an underlying promise of power to obey it. When we claim a promise (like "Sin shall not have dominion over you" - Romans 6:14), we are not just reciting words; we are laying hold of the creative power of God.
*   **Partaking of the Divine Nature:**
    *   Man’s nature is fallen and inclined toward sin (Jeremiah 17:9). God’s nature is holy, loving, and obedient.
    *   Through the New Birth, God implants a new principle of life in us. As we believe His promises, the Holy Spirit empowers us to live out the life of Christ. This is **Imparted Righteousness**.
    *   **Definition—Imparted Righteousness:** The life of Christ lived out in the believer by the power of the Holy Spirit, enabling them to overcome sin (Galatians 2:20).
*   **Escaping Corruption:**
    *   The "corruption that is in the world" stems from "lust" (sinful desire). The only way to escape the *power* of sin is to receive a higher power—the Divine Nature.
    *   We cannot empty ourselves of sin; we must be filled with Christ.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a man who owes a million dollars and has no money. If a wealthy king gives him a signed check for the amount, that piece of paper is essentially "money" because of the promise written on it and the integrity of the signer. The Christian has "checks" signed in the blood of Jesus—promises of forgiveness, strength, and victory. When we present these promises to God in faith, He honors them, and we receive the spiritual capital we need.

### Q4. What graces, or qualities of character, are we to add in our character building?

**2 Peter 1:5–7**  
> “Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.”

**Answer:**
Peter presents a ladder of Christian progress. We are not to remain idle, but to "give all diligence" to add these graces. This is the work of character building in cooperation with the Holy Spirit.

1.  **Faith:** The foundation. Without faith, it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6). This is the trusting grasp on Christ’s merits.
2.  **Virtue:** Moral courage and excellence. Faith must not be passive; it must produce a courageous stand for right.
3.  **Knowledge:** An understanding of God’s will and Word, so that our zeal is not ignorant (Romans 10:2).
4.  **Temperance:** Self-control.
    *   **Definition—Temperance:** The control of all faculties (appetite, passion, speech) by the Holy Spirit.
    *   This connects to the **Health Message**: A clear mind, unaffected by harmful diet or stimulants, is necessary to discern spiritual things (1 Corinthians 9:25–27).
5.  **Patience:** Endurance or perseverance. The ability to stand firm under trial. "Here is the patience of the saints" (Revelation 14:12).
6.  **Godliness:** Piety and reverence toward God; a life centered on His glory.
7.  **Brotherly Kindness:** A spirit of affection toward the family of God (Romans 12:10).
8.  **Charity (Love):** The crowning grace. The very nature of God Himself (1 John 4:8).

*   **Cooperation with God:**
    *   God gives the power (Verse 3), but we must do the "adding" (Verse 5). We work out what God works in (Philippians 2:12–13).

**[ILL]**
Building a character is like building a house. You start with the foundation (Faith). You frame the walls (Virtue, Knowledge). You add the roof (Temperance, Patience) to protect against the storm. Finally, you furnish it with warmth and hospitality (Brotherly Kindness, Charity). A house without a foundation collapses; a foundation without a house is useless.

### Q5. What does the Bible tell us about charity?

**1 Corinthians 13:4–7**  
> “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.”  
**1 Peter 4:8**  
> “And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.”

**Answer:**
Charity (from the Greek *agape*) is not merely sentimental emotion; it is a principle of self-sacrificing love that originates in God. It is the highest rung on Peter's ladder and the fulfilling of the law (Romans 13:10).

*   **The Attributes of Love:**
    *   **Longsuffering:** It bears with the faults of others, just as God bears with ours.
    *   **Seeketh not her own:** It is unselfish. Sin is essentially selfishness; love is essentially self-sacrifice.
    *   **Thinketh no evil:** It does not keep a record of wrongs or attribute bad motives to others.
*   **Covering Sins:**
    *   This does not mean covering sin to hide it from confession, but rather "covering" the faults of others with forgiveness and refusing to expose them to gossip or public shame (Proverbs 10:12).
*   **The Law and Love:**
    *   The Ten Commandments are a transcript of God's character. Since God is Love, the Law is a law of love.
    *   Righteousness by Faith means having this law of love written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10), so that it becomes our nature to love God and our neighbor.

**[ILL]**
Light passing through a prism is broken into the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Similarly, "Charity" (Love) is the pure white light of Jesus' character. When passed through the prism of daily life, it breaks into these beautiful components: patience, kindness, humility, unselfishness, and endurance.

### Q6. What is another name for charity?

**Colossians 3:14**  
> “And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.”

**Answer:**
Paul calls charity the "bond of perfectness."

*   **The Bond (Ligament):**
    *   In the physical body, ligaments hold the bones and muscles together. Without them, the body would fall apart.
    *   In the church, doctrine and organization are important, but *love* is the bond that holds the members together in unity.
*   **Christian Perfection:**
    *   The Bible speaks of "perfection" not as an impossibility, but as a goal for the believer.
    *   **Definition—Perfection:** In the biblical sense, this often refers to spiritual maturity and a heart undivided in its loyalty to God (Matthew 5:48). It is a character completely controlled by love.
    *   A "perfect" Christian is one who, by the grace of God, reflects the image of Jesus—who is Love incarnate.

**[ILL]**
When a mason builds a stone wall, he uses mortar (cement) to bind the stones together. Without the mortar, the stones are just a loose pile that can be easily knocked over. Charity is the spiritual mortar that binds all other virtues together and unites the church into a strong temple for the Lord.

### Q7. What is the result of cultivating these eight precious attributes?

**2 Peter 1:8**  
> “For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

**Answer:**
The result of genuine sanctification is fruitfulness.

*   **Not Barren (Idle) nor Unfruitful:**
    *   A true knowledge of Christ always leads to service. We are saved *by* faith alone, but the faith that saves is never *alone*—it works by love (Galatians 5:6).
    *   If we have the "Divine Nature" (v. 4), we will have the spirit of service and soul-winning, because that is Christ's nature.
*   **Abounding:**
    *   It is not enough to have a small measure of these graces; they must "abound."
    *   God’s plan is for us to have life "more abundantly" (John 10:10).
*   **The Judgment Test:**
    *   In the final judgment, the tree is known by its fruit (Matthew 7:16–20). While our title to heaven is Jesus' righteousness, our fitness for heaven is demonstrated by the fruit of the Spirit in our lives.

**[ILL]**
A fruit tree is not planted just to have green leaves and look pretty; it is planted to bear fruit. If an apple tree produces no apples year after year, it is failing in its purpose. A Christian who claims to know Jesus but shows no patience, no kindness, and no love is like a barren tree. (See the Parable of the Barren Fig Tree, Luke 13:6–9).

***

### Q8. What is the condition of one who lacks these graces?

**2 Peter 1:9**  
> “But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.”

**Answer:**
Peter uses strong language to describe the professed believer who is not growing in grace.

*   **Spiritual Blindness:**
    *   The one who stops growing becomes nearsighted ("cannot see afar off"). They see only the temporal things of this earth and lose sight of eternity, the judgment, and the heavenly city.
    *   This condition is similar to the Laodicean church, which is "blind" but thinks it sees (Revelation 3:17).
*   **Forgetting the Purging (Atonement):**
    *   The verse says he has forgotten he was "purged" (cleansed). This refers to **Justification**.
    *   When a person ceases to grow in sanctification, they lose the appreciation of their justification. They forget the immense cost of the cross and the value of the pardon they received.
    *   **The Lesson:** We cannot rely on a past experience. If we are not moving forward, we are drifting backward.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a man rescued from a shipwreck in the freezing ocean. He is pulled into a warm boat, dried off, and fed. If he then immediately jumps back into the freezing water, it shows he has "forgotten" or does not value the rescue he just received. To go back to the old life of sin is to despise the cleansing blood of Christ that purged us.

### Q9. What promise is given to those who will patiently add grace to grace?

**2 Peter 1:10**  
> “Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.”

**Answer:**
Here is the blessed assurance of the believer. It is a conditional promise that offers total security in Christ.

*   **Making Election Sure:**
    *   God does not arbitrarily elect some to be saved and some to be lost. He "would have all men to be saved" (1 Timothy 2:4).
    *   However, we must "make our election sure" by accepting Christ and cooperating with Him in the work of character building ("if ye do these things").
*   **"Ye Shall Never Fall":**
    *   This is the promise of victory. It does not say we will never be tempted or never make a mistake, but that we will not fall away from the faith or fall into ruin.
    *   Through the power of the indwelling Christ, we are "kept by the power of God through faith" (1 Peter 1:5).
    *   **Jude 24:** "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy."

*   **Conclusion:**
    The path of the just is as a shining light, shining more and more unto the perfect day (Proverbs 4:18). By constantly looking to Jesus and adding grace to grace, we are prepared for the final seal of God and an entrance into His everlasting kingdom.

**[ILL]**
A mountain climber is safe as long as he stays connected to the safety rope and keeps moving toward the summit. If he cuts the rope or decides to let go and sit on a slippery slope, he is in danger. Our "safety rope" is faith in Christ's promises. As long as we hold fast to Him and keep climbing (adding grace to grace), we "shall never fall."
