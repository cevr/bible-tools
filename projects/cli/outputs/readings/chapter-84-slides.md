## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Name and Memorial
- **Question:** What is to endure throughout all generations?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 135:13 – “Thy name, O Lord, endureth forever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Name and Character)
- The Psalmist declares two things to be permanent: God’s **Name** and God’s **Memorial**.
- **God’s Name:** In Scripture, a name signifies character.
- God proclaimed His character to Moses:
  - Exodus 34:5–7 – “And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin...”
- This character of love and justice is the foundation of His government.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (The Memorial)
- **God’s Memorial:** A reminder of who God is and what He has done.
- **Why a Memorial?** Because God is the Creator and Sustainer.
- He established a specific institution so His people would never forget their source of life.
- **Endurance:** Trends and empires change, but God’s character and His memorial endure “throughout all generations.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The King’s Monument:**
  - Imagine a king conquers a land and sets up a monument in the capital.
  - As long as it stands, people remember their king and his authority.
  - If it is destroyed, the memory fades, and rebellion becomes easy.
  - **Lesson:** God set up a memorial in time so the human race might never forget their true King.

## Slide 5 – Q2: A Biblical Illustration
- **Question:** Does the Bible give any illustration of this definition?
- **Key Text:** Joshua 4:7 – “And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (The Purpose of Memorials)
- **The Context:** Joshua set up stones after the miraculous crossing of the Jordan River.
- **Function:** Humans are prone to forget. Visible stones served as a “sign” or “witness” to a fact.
- **The Danger of Forgetting:** Forgetting God’s past leading is the first step to apostasy.
  - Deuteronomy 6:12 – “Then beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.”
- **God’s Design:** Memorials are for our benefit, not God’s. Without a reminder, we lose sight of His claim on our lives.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Wedding Ring:**
  - A wedding ring is a memorial of a marriage covenant.
  - The ring is not the marriage itself, but a constant visible reminder of the vows.
  - Refusing to wear it suggests a disregard for the relationship.
  - **Lesson:** God’s memorials are like that ring—a sign of the covenant between Him and His people.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Meaning of the Stones
- **Question:** What were these stones to commemorate?
- **Key Text:** Joshua 4:21, 22 – “And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Witness to Power)
- The stones commemorated a specific act of **supernatural power** and **deliverance**.
- **Dominion over Nature:** They testified God had power over the elements (the river).
- **Faithfulness:** They testified God kept His promise to bring them to the land.
- **Education:** A tool for future generations prompting the question, “What mean these stones?”
- **Principle:** A biblical memorial points back to a mighty act of God establishing His authority.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Passover Memorial
- **Question:** What was another memorial instituted to commemorate another signal providence in behalf of the Israelites?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 12:14 – “And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Type and Antitype)
- The Passover commemorated deliverance from Egyptian bondage.
- **The Shadow:** The lamb was a type of Christ; the blood saved the firstborn.
- **The Reality:** It pointed to Christ, the true sacrifice.
  - 1 Corinthians 5:7 – “Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.”
- **New Covenant Memorial:** The Lord’s Supper now commemorates Christ’s death.
  - 1 Corinthians 11:26 – “For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Sanctuary Application (Justification)
- **Sanctuary Connection:** The Passover corresponds to the **Outer Court** of the sanctuary (the Altar of Sacrifice).
- **Justification:** It represents being saved from the penalty of sin by the blood of the Lamb.
- **Transient vs. Permanent:** The shadow (ceremony) met fulfillment at the cross, but the event it commemorates (Redemption) is eternal.
  - Colossians 2:14 – “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration
- **Independence Day:**
  - Independence Day is a national memorial. It doesn’t make a nation free; it commemorates the day freedom was declared.
  - Passover was Israel’s “Independence Day.”
  - **Lesson:** God wants us to celebrate freedom, but also to remember the *Creator* of that freedom.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Remembering Creation
- **Question:** Does God design that His power in creating the world shall be remembered, as well?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 111:2–4 – “The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. His work is honorable and glorious; and His righteousness endureth forever. He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Creator and King)
- Redemption is glorious, but **Creation** gives God the right to be our Redeemer.
- **Foundation of Worship:** We worship God because He made us.
  - Psalm 100:3 – “Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.”
- **God’s Design:** He “made His wonderful works to be remembered.” He did not leave this to chance.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Creation and Righteousness)
- The text links His works with His righteousness.
- The God who creates the world is the God who creates a clean heart.
  - Psalm 51:10 – “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.”
- **Illustration:** An artist signs their painting to claim credit. God placed a “signature” in time to identify Himself as Maker.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Sabbath Memorial
- **Question:** What memorial has He given by which to remember it?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:8–11 – “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy... for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (The Command)
- **"Remember":** Implies humans are prone to forget; the institution existed before Sinai.
- **The Reason:** "For in six days the Lord made..."
- The Sabbath is not arbitrary; it is a memorial of a fact (Creation).
- **The Blessing:** God blessed the *day* itself, placing a spiritual presence there not found in the other six.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Sanctuary Connection (Most Holy Place)
- **Location in Sanctuary:** This command sits in the heart of the Ten Commandments.
- **The Ark:** The law was placed inside the Ark of the Covenant in the **Most Holy Place**.
  - Hebrews 9:4 – “...the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant.”
- This indicates the immutability and holiness of the law.

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: A Sign of Sanctification
- **Question:** For what reason does He say again that He gave the Sabbath to the children of Israel?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 20:12 – “Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **The Sign:** The Sabbath is a sign that God sanctifies us (makes us holy).
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”
- **Faith, Not Works:**
  - Just as we did not create ourselves, we cannot re-create our hearts.
  - Resting on Sabbath acknowledges we cannot work our way to heaven.
  - Hebrews 4:10 – “For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.”
- **Double Memorial:** It commemorates **Creation** (God's power to make the world) and **Redemption** (God's power to make men holy).

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration
- **Lifting Yourself:**
  - If a man tries to lift himself by his own bootstraps, he fails. He needs outside power.
  - **Lesson:** The Sabbath rest teaches us weekly that we cannot save ourselves by our own labor. We must rest in the Creator’s power to change our hearts.

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: An Eternal Sign
- **Question:** How long was the Sabbath to be a sign, or memorial, of the true God?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 31:17 – “It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points (Perpetuity)
- **Forever:** The basis (Creation) never changes, so the sign never expires.
- **Unchanging Character:** The moral law reflects God’s unchanging character.
  - Malachi 3:6 – “For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.”
- **Universal Scope:** The Sabbath was made for "man" at Creation, before any Jewish nation existed.
  - Mark 2:27 – “And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: Identity of Israel
- **Question:** Who are the children of Israel?
- **Key Text:** Romans 9:7, 8 – “Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children:... but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points (Spiritual Israel)
- **Not Just Genetics:** Paul argues that being a "child of God" is a matter of the heart.
- **Children of the Promise:** Those born again by the Spirit, trusting God's promises.
- **Implication:** If the Sabbath is a sign for Israel forever, and believers in Christ are the true Israel, then the Sabbath is the sign for the Christian believer.

---

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Promise to Abraham
- **Question:** What did the promises to Abraham embrace?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:16 – “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points (Christ the Center)
- **The Seed is Christ:** The central promise to Abraham was the Messiah.
- **Global Blessing:**
  - Genesis 12:3 – “And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”
- **Conclusion:** The "Old Testament" promises are actually Christian promises centering on Jesus.

---

## Slide 29 – Q11: Our Relation to Abraham
- **Question:** When we receive Christ, what relation do we sustain to Abraham and the promises?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:29 – “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.”

## Slide 30 – Q11: Key Points (Heirs of the Covenant)
- **Union with Christ:** Accepting Jesus makes us part of His body.
- **Heirs:** Since Christ is "the Seed," being in Him makes us "Abraham's seed."
- **Inheritors of the Sign:** All covenant blessings—and signs, including the Sabbath—belong to the believer in Jesus.
- The Sabbath is not merely "Jewish"; it is "Abrahamic" and "Christian."

## Slide 31 – Q11: Illustration
- **Adoption:**
  - If you are adopted into a family, you take the family name and inherit the estate.
  - You follow family rules and enjoy family privileges.
  - **Lesson:** By faith in Christ, we are adopted into God's family (Israel), and the family "Memorial" (the Sabbath) becomes ours to keep.

---

## Slide 32 – Q12: The Christian Church
- **Question:** What does James denominate the Christian church?
- **Key Text:** James 1:1 – “James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.”

## Slide 33 – Q12: Key Points (Continuity)
- **The Audience:** James writes to believers in Jesus Christ.
- **The Title:** He addresses them as "the twelve tribes."
- **One People:** God has only ever had one people—those who trust the Lamb and obey His voice.
- The Church is the continuation and flowering of true Israel.

---

## Slide 34 – Q13: Remembering in Heaven
- **Question:** When redeemed, will the saints remember God's creative power?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 4:11 – “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created.”

## Slide 35 – Q13: Key Points (Eternal Theme)
- **Heavenly Worship:** The song of the redeemed focuses on **Creation**.
- **Basis of Glory:** God is worthy specifically *because* He created all things.
- **Enduring Relevance:** If Creation is the theme of heaven, the Memorial of Creation (Sabbath) is relevant to heaven. We never outgrow our status as creatures.

---

## Slide 36 – Q14: Worship in the New Earth
- **Question:** How often will they congregate to worship the Lord?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 66:23 – “And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 37 – Q14: Key Points (Restoration)
- **Universal Worship:** "All flesh" will come. The Sabbath is for all humanity, not just Jews.
- **Eden Restored:** God restores what was lost in Eden (Revelation 22).
- Since the Sabbath was in Eden before sin (Genesis 2:1–3), it remains in the New Earth after sin is destroyed.
- **Eternal Rhythm:** The cycle of labor and rest continues throughout eternity.

---

## Slide 38 – Q15: Eternal Duration
- **Question:** How long will this state of things exist?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 66:22 – “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain.”

## Slide 39 – Q15: Key Points (Forever)
- **The Parallel:** Just as the New Earth remains, so the worshippers ("your seed") remain.
- **The Conclusion:** The Sabbath, as the memorial of the Creator, endures as long as creation itself endures.
- **Preparation:** If we are preparing for the New Earth, the spirit of the Sabbath must be in our hearts now. It is a day of joy and rest in Christ.

## Slide 40 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Musician's Practice:**
  - A musician preparing for a royal orchestra practices the music *before* the concert begins.
  - They do not wait until the performance to learn the tune.
  - **Lesson:** Sabbath-keeping on earth is our practice for eternal worship. It attunes our hearts to the rhythm of heaven.
