### Chapter 170: The Marriage Institution

**Introduction**
In the study of God’s plan for the human race, we must look back to Eden, the pattern of all that is pure and holy. As we approach the end of time and the Second Coming of Christ, the restoration of the "old waste places" (Isaiah 58:12) includes a proper understanding of the home. The home on earth is to be a symbol of the home in heaven, and the marriage relation is a sacred type of the union between Christ and His church.

---

### Q1. What was one of the first institutions founded for the benefit of the human race?

**“And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.” (Genesis 2:22)**

**Answer:**
The marriage institution is one of the two "twin institutions" that have come down to us from the gates of Eden before the fall of man—the other being the seventh-day Sabbath. Both were established by the Creator while man was yet holy, intended to secure his happiness and holiness.

1.  **Divine Origin:** Marriage is not a human invention or a social contract evolved over time; it is a divine ordinance. God Himself officiated at the first wedding.
2.  **Equality and Unity:** The method of Eve’s creation is significant. She was not taken from Adam’s head to rule over him, nor from his feet to be trampled upon, but from his side—his rib—to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be loved.
3.  **A Type of Christ:** This union was designed to illustrate the mystical union between Christ and His people. As Eve was taken from Adam’s side while he slept, so the Church was born from the wounded side of Christ as He slept in death on the cross (Ephesians 5:25–32).

**[ILL] The Two Gems of Eden:** Imagine a traveler leaving a beautiful, burning city (Eden lost) carrying only two precious gems to pass on to future generations. These two gems are the Sabbath and Marriage. If polished and kept according to God’s instruction, they reflect the light of heaven. If marred or dirtied by human tradition and sin, they lose their luster. We are called to restore the brilliance of these original gifts.

### Q2. Why did God establish the marriage institution?

**“(1). So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it.” (Genesis 1:27, 28); for “He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited.” (Isaiah 45:18).**

**“(2). And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.” (Genesis 2:18).**

**Answer:**
God’s purposes are always perfect. He established marriage for three primary reasons:

*   **The Preservation of the Race (Procreation):** God designed that the earth should be populated with holy beings who would reflect His character. A godly home is the appointed nursery for children to be trained in the "nurture and admonition of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4).
*   **Companionship and Happiness:** "It is not good that the man should be alone." God is a social being (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and man, made in God’s image, craves communion. True womanhood brings refinement to man, and true manhood brings strength and protection to woman.
*   **Mutual Help:** The term "help meet" means a helper suitable for him—one who corresponds to him. In the battle of life, and specifically in the Christian walk, husband and wife are to strengthen each other’s faith.

**Theological Insight:** The ultimate object of creation is the glory of God. A marriage that operates on the principles of self-sacrificing love (agape) reveals God's character to the universe.

### Q3. To accomplish this two fold purpose, how many companions did God in the beginning ordain that man should have?

**“Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.” (Genesis 2:24). “They two shall be one flesh.” (Ephesians 5:31). “The rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.” (Genesis 2:22).**

**Answer:**
The mathematics of God is precise: "They **two** shall be **one**."

1.  **Monogamy is the Standard:** God did not give Adam two wives to ensure faster population of the earth, nor to provide variety. He gave one wife for one man. This exclusivity is vital for the formation of "one flesh."
2.  **The Meaning of "Cleave":** The Hebrew word for "cleave" suggests being glued together. This bond is so strong that it supersedes even the parental bond. Such a bond is impossible to maintain equally between three or four people.
3.  **Spiritual Significance:** This points to **Righteousness by Faith**. We cannot have two masters; we cannot serve Christ and the world. Just as the church must have only one Husband (Christ), so the man is to have only one wife. Any deviation from this is a form of spiritual or physical adultery.

**[ILL] The River:** Two streams can merge to form one mighty river, flowing together toward the ocean. But if that river is constantly divided into smaller channels, it loses its power, depth, and direction, eventually turning into a swamp. God designed marriage to be a focused, deep channel of love between two, not a swamp of divided affections.

---

### Q4. With whom did polygamy originate?

**“Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth” (John 8:44).**

*Note: The user text references Lamech (Gen 4:19, 23) in the context of this question.*

**Answer:**
Polygamy is a counterfeit of God's original design. As with all counterfeits, it originated with the spirit of rebellion.

*   **Lamech the Rebel:** The first recorded polygamist was Lamech, a descendant of Cain. The line of Cain had turned away from God. Lamech is recorded as both a murderer and a polygamist (Genesis 4:19, 23).
*   **The Character of the Counterfeit:** Lamech was ruled by "lust" and violence. By taking two wives (Adah and Zillah), he defied the divine arithmetic of Eden.
*   **Satan's Strategy:** Satan hates the image of God in man. By corrupting marriage, he destroys the happiness of the home and confuses the symbol of Christ and the Church.

**Definition:**
*   **Counterfeit:** Something made to look like the original to deceive, but which lacks the true value and authority of the Maker. Satan cannot create; he can only distort what God has created.

---

### Q5. What effect did the polygamous example of Lamech's descendants have on the children of God?

**“And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.” (Genesis 6:1, 2).**

**Answer:**
The corruption of marriage was the primary vehicle for the corruption of the world before the Flood.

1.  **Unequal Yoking:** The "sons of God" (the faithful line of Seth) began to intermarry with the "daughters of men" (the rebellious line of Cain). They chose based on sight ("they were fair") rather than character.
2.  **Polygamy Spreads:** The phrase "took them wives of all which they chose" indicates a move toward plurality and unchecked desire.
3.  **Resulting Apostasy:** When the righteous mingle their seed with the unrighteous and adopt their customs, the result is almost always a decline in spirituality. The home life was destroyed, and the Spirit of God was grieved away (Genesis 6:3).

**[ILL] The Ink in Water:** If you have a glass of pure water (the righteous) and pour a drop of ink (the wicked) into it, the ink does not become clear; the water becomes dark. Compromise with the world’s standards of marriage always lowers the standard of holiness.

---

### Q6. Does this reference to wife plurality among those who were called "the sons of God," prove that the Lord had adopted Satan's plan?

**“And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted His way upon the earth.” (Genesis 6:12).**

**Answer:**
Absolutely not. The fact that God's professed people practiced a sin does not make it righteousness.

*   **God's "Way" vs. Man's Corruption:** The text says they corrupted *His way*. His way was monogamy; their corruption was polygamy and mixed marriages.
*   **The Consequence:** Far from approving this change, God sent the Flood to wipe it out. The destruction of the antediluvian world is a standing testimony of God’s hatred for the violation of His institutions.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Sin is offensive to God. It cannot exist in His presence. The Flood was a type of the final cleansing of the earth by fire. God cleanses the earth to remove the stain of sin.

### Q7. What was Noah's character? and considering the emergency, how many wives did he and his sons take with them into the ark?

**“Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.” (Genesis 6:9). “In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark.” (Genesis 7:13).**

**Answer:**
In the midst of universal apostasy, God preserved a remnant who kept His original commandments.

*   **Character of Noah:** He was "just" (justified by faith) and "perfect" (sanctified, wholehearted). He "walked with God," meaning his life was in harmony with God's will.
*   **The Ark Preserved Monogamy:** Out of the entire population of the earth, only eight people were saved. They entered as four monogamous couples.
*   **The Remnant:** This illustrates that in the final judgment, God will save a people who have returned to the original platform of truth—keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12), which includes honoring the purity of the home.

---

### Q8. Who knows but what they had other wives not good enough to be permitted to enter the ark?

**“And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before this generation.” (Genesis 7:1).**

**Answer:**
The Scriptural record is clear: God invited Noah's "house."
1.  **Total Preservation:** If there had been other wives, they were part of the world that was condemned. The fact that only one wife per man entered shows that God recognized only the first wife as the true part of the "house."
2.  **Divine Selection:** God saved the family unit that reflected His order. Any "other" attachments were washed away as corruption.

---

### Q9. After the flood, when Satan, in trying to overthrow God's plan, had again led men into idolatry and polygamy, why did the Lord choose as the progenitor of a spiritual race, a man who had but one wife?

**“Wherefore one? That He might seek a godly seed.” (Malachi 2:15). “Abram took Sarai his wife, ...and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan they came.” (Genesis 12:5).**

**Answer:**
When God called Abraham to be the father of the faithful, He called a monogamist.
*   **Godly Seed:** Malachi explains that God made them "one" (one man, one woman) to produce "godly seed." A divided home filled with jealousy and rivalry (which always accompanies polygamy) is a poor soil for raising righteous children.
*   **The Foundation:** The covenant of grace was established with Abraham and his lawful wife, Sarai. God started the new dispensation of the patriarchs on the Edenic plan.

---

### Q10. When, through lack of faith, it seemed that God's promise of a son could not be fulfilled because of Sarai's age, what prevalent evil custom of that day did she induce Abram to adopt, hoping thereby to secure the promised heir?

**“And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.” (Genesis 16:3).**

**Answer:**
This tragic event is a lesson in **Justification by Works** versus **Justification by Faith**.

1.  **The Failure of Faith:** God had promised a son. Sarai and Abram grew impatient. Instead of trusting God to perform the miracle, they resorted to human works—the custom of the nations around them.
2.  **The Hagar Covenant:** Paul tells us in Galatians 4:22–31 that Hagar represents the "Old Covenant"—trying to inherit the promise through the flesh (human effort). This deviation from God’s marriage plan was an attempt to help God out, which always leads to disaster.
3.  **No Divine Command:** Nowhere did God command this. It was the suggestion of Sarai, influenced by their time in Egypt (where Hagar was acquired).

**[ILL] The Mechanic:** If a master mechanic (God) promises to fix your broken engine, but you get impatient and start hitting it with a hammer (human effort) to make it go, you only cause damage. Abram tried to "force" the promise through Hagar, resulting in Ishmael and centuries of conflict.

---

### Q11. Did this shameful proceeding make Hagar the wife of Abram?

*See Genesis 16:1, 4, 8; 21:10; 25:1.*

**Answer:**
While the custom of the day called her a "secondary wife" or concubine, in the eyes of God’s original law, the relationship was not equal to the first.
*   **Terminology:** Scripture persistently identifies Hagar as the "bondwoman" or "maid," and Sarai as the "wife." Even the angel of the Lord addressed her as "Hagar, Sarai's maid" (Genesis 16:8).
*   **No Divine Recognition:** God never recognized Ishmael as the heir of the covenant. He told Abraham, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called" (Genesis 21:12). Isaac was the child of the true wife.
*   **Adultery, not Marriage:** From the standpoint of the New Testament (Matthew 19), taking another woman while the first is living is a violation of the seventh commandment. Abraham was not a polygamist by divine right; he was a sinner in need of grace, caught in the trap of his culture.

---

### Q12. What is the very next recorded experience of Abram's which shows that he was not perfect, like Enoch and Noah?

**“And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before Me, and be thou perfect.” (Genesis 17:1).**

**Answer:**
After the Hagar incident, there was a period of silence. Then God appeared with a reproof and a command.

*   **"Be Thou Perfect":** This command implies that Abraham was *not* currently perfect in his walk. He had deviated from trust in God.
*   **The Call to Sanctification:** God was calling him back to the standard of holiness. To be "perfect" in the Bible sense often means to be "whole" or "blameless" in heart. God wanted Abraham's whole heart, not a heart divided by human schemes.

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The process by which the believer turns away from sin and human inventions and grows up into the likeness of Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit.

---

### Q13. Did he follow the example of Cain, the progenitor of murderers and polygamists, and try to justify or excuse himself?

**“And Abram fell on his face.” (Genesis 17:3).**

**Answer:**
This is the mark of a true child of God.
*   **Humility:** Unlike Cain, who argued with God ("Am I my brother's keeper?"), Abraham fell on his face. He accepted the rebuke.
*   **Repentance:** This posture indicates submission and repentance. He did not defend his relationship with Hagar as "cultural right"; he bowed before the Almighty.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We are not saved because we have never sinned (like Abraham sinned in this matter), but because when God convicts us, we repent and believe. God then changed his name from Abram to Abraham, signifying a new character and a new covenant relationship.

---

### Q14. When Ishmael was about sixteen years old, and Sarah requested Abraham to "cast out this bondwoman and her son" (Gen. 21:10), what instruction did the Lord give which shows that He had not changed His original plan, one wife for one man?

**“In all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.” “And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away.” (Genesis 21:12, 14).**

**Answer:**
This was a painful but necessary surgery to restore the health of the home.
1.  **God Sustains the True Marriage:** By telling Abraham to listen to Sarah, God validated her position as the only rightful wife.
2.  **Removal of the Intruder:** The bondwoman and her son—representing the works of the flesh—had to be separated from the child of promise.
3.  **Spiritual Lesson:** In our lives, we cannot harbor "pet sins" or "compromises" alongside the life of Christ. The "bondwoman" (sin/legalism) must be cast out so the "freewoman" (grace/faith) can reign.

---

### Q15. Had Hagar really been the wife of Abraham during these sixteen years, would he ever have "sent her away" with the divine permission?

**“What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” (Matthew 19:6).**

**Answer:**
This is a crucial logical proof.
*   **God Hates Divorce:** God says, "I hate putting away" (Malachi 2:16). If Hagar had been a valid wife joined by God, God would never have commanded Abraham to send her away.
*   **Annulment of Sin:** God commanded the separation because the union was not a marriage in His eyes; it was a sinful arrangement that needed to be ended. This confirms that the polygamous act was a violation of God’s law, not a variation of it.

---

### Q16. After Abraham had profited by his bitter experience (Gen. 21:11), what did God say of him; and how was it in part fulfilled?

**“For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment.” (Genesis 18:19). “And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, ...Thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.” (Genesis 24:2–4).**

**Answer:**
Abraham learned his lesson. He returned to the "way of the Lord" (monogamy and faith).
*   **Guarding the Next Generation:** Because he had felt the pain of deviation, he was adamant that his son Isaac should not make the same mistake. He ensured Isaac took a wife from a godly lineage, not from the Canaanites, and Isaac is the only patriarch who remained monogamous his whole life.

---

### Q17. What was Isaac's last charge to Jacob, when the latter was about to leave home?

**“Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel, thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban, thy mother’s brother.” (Genesis 28:1, 2).**

**Answer:**
The instruction was singular: "Take thee **a** wife" (singular).
*   **Unequal Yoke:** The prohibition against the "daughters of Canaan" warns against marrying those who do not love God. (See 2 Corinthians 6:14).
*   **The Ideal:** Isaac pointed Jacob to the original plan—one wife from a faithful family.

---

### Q18. But did not Jacob have two wives?

*See Genesis 29.*

**Answer:**
Jacob did have two wives (Leah and Rachel), and later two concubines (Bilhah and Zilpah). However, this does not justify the practice.
1.  **The Deceiver Deceived:** Jacob had deceived his father Isaac to get the blessing. Now, his father-in-law Laban deceived him, giving him Leah instead of Rachel. Jacob reaped what he sowed (Galatians 6:7).
2.  **Lack of Trust:** Just like his grandfather Abraham, Jacob tried to secure his happiness through human maneuvering rather than trusting God to work out the mess Laban made.
3.  **God's Permissive Will:** God did not abandon Jacob, but He allowed Jacob to suffer the natural consequences of his actions. The domestic misery recorded in Genesis 29 and 30 is not an endorsement of polygamy but a warning against it.

---

### Q19. Did Jacob enjoy his polygamous life?

**“Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been.” (Genesis 47:9).**

**Answer:**
Jacob's life was filled with strife.
*   **Rivalry:** The sisters envied each other. There was bartering for the husband’s affection (Genesis 30:14–16).
*   **Sorrow:** The favoritism inevitable in polygamy led to the hatred of Joseph by his brothers, causing Jacob years of bitter grief.
*   **The Lesson:** Sin may be forgiven, but the scars often remain. Jacob was saved "so as by fire."

---

### Q20. Was David blessed of God because he was a polygamist?

**“Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in His sight? Thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife... Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house: because thou hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor.” (2 Samuel 12:9–11).**

**Answer:**
David is often cited by those wishing to excuse sin, but his life is actually a terrifying proof of the consequences of violating the seventh commandment.
*   **Violation of Law:** God explicitly told the king *not* to multiply wives (Deuteronomy 17:17). David ignored this.
*   **The Fruit:** David’s polygamy led to a dysfunctional family. Amnon (son of one wife) raped Tamar (daughter of another); Absalom (brother of Tamar) murdered Amnon and later rebelled against David.
*   **The Verdict:** God called David’s action "evil." He did not bless it; He judged it.

---

### Q21. Because of David's evil example, what occasion did the Lord say had been given polygamists and other evil doers?

**“Because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme.” (2 Samuel 12:14).**

**Answer:**
When a leader of God’s people sins, it gives ammunition to the enemies of truth.
*   **Blasphemy:** Skeptics today still point to David’s wives to mock the morality of the Bible.
*   **Responsibility:** We are our brother's keeper. Our lifestyle must demonstrate the power of the Gospel to keep us pure. If we claim to be Christians but live like the world, we bring shame upon the name of Christ.

---

### Q22. How, then, was David "a man after God's own heart," polygamy and murder being violations of "the commandment of the Lord?

**“I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.” (Psalm 32:5). “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, a God, thou wilt not despise.” (Psalm 51:17).**

**Answer:**
This is the heart of the **Gospel**.
*   **Not Perfection of Conduct, but Sincerity of Repentance:** David was not a man after God's heart *because* of his sins, but because of his deep, genuine repentance *for* his sins.
*   **Comparison with Saul:** King Saul excused his sins. King David, when confronted by the prophet Nathan, immediately said, "I have sinned."
*   **Justification:** David illustrates that a murderer and adulterer can be washed clean by the blood of the Lamb if they truly repent. However, while the *guilt* was removed, the *temporal consequences* (the sword in his house) remained.

**[ILL] The Broken Vase:** You may glue a broken vase back together so it holds water (forgiveness), but the cracks remain visible (consequences). David’s life was mended by grace, but the cracks of his polygamy caused leaks in the kingdom.

---

### Q23. Was Solomon blessed because he was a polygamist?

**“His wives turned away his heart after other gods.” “And the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel... Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee... I will surely rend the kingdom from thee.” (1 Kings 11:4, 9, 11).**

**Answer:**
Solomon had more wives than any other, and he ended up more corrupted than any other.
*   **Total Apostasy:** Polygamy led directly to idolatry. He built shrines to Chemosh and Molech to please his heathen wives.
*   **The Warning:** If the wisest man who ever lived could not handle polygamy without losing his soul (temporarily—he repented at the end), how can any man today think he can violate God’s law and survive spiritually?

---

### Q24. What are the principal texts used in attempting to justify polygamy by divine precept? and what may be said of them?

**(1). “And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.” (Exodus 21:9, 10).**

*   **Explanation:** This text is essentially a labor law protecting female servants. The word "wife" in verse 10 is inserted by translators; the context implies "another betrothed." It simply means: If a father betroths a servant girl to his son, but then changes his mind and betroths *another* girl to the son instead, he must still provide for the first girl. It regulates a social mess; it does not command polygamy.

**(2). “If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband’s brother shall... take her to him to wife.” (Deuteronomy 25:5).**

*   **Explanation:** This is the "Levirate Law." It was a specific provision to keep the family name and land inheritance alive in Israel. It applied only when the surviving brother was unmarried or capable of fulfilling the duty. It was a property/lineage law, not a license for lust. (Example: Boaz and Ruth).

**(3). “And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.” (Isaiah 4:1).**

*   **Explanation:** This is a prophecy of a curse, not a blessing. It describes the desperation caused by war (Isaiah 3:25 mentions men falling by the sword).
*   **Spiritual Application:** In the last days, many false churches (women) will want to take the name of Christ (the Man) to take away their reproach, but they want to eat their own bread (doctrine) and wear their own apparel (own righteousness/works). This is a picture of false Christianity, not a command for marriage.

---

### Q25. What further testimony is given by prophets, Christ, and the apostles relative to the enduring nature of God's original plan?

**“Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, ...beside the other in her lifetime.” (Leviticus 18:18).**

**“Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. For the Lord, the God of Israel, saith that He hateth putting away.” (Malachi 2:15, 16).**

**Christ said: “From the beginning of the creation God made them male and female... they twain shall be one flesh... What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.” (Mark 10:6-9).**

**Paul said: “Let everyone of you in particular so love his wife even as himself.” (Ephesians 5:33). “A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife.” (1 Timothy 3:2).**

**Answer:**
The testimony of Scripture is consistent from Eden to the New Jerusalem.
1.  **Christ Points Backward:** Jesus swept away the "traditions of the elders" and the permissions given "because of the hardness of your hearts" and pointed back to Genesis: "From the beginning it was not so."
2.  **Paul Points Forward:** Paul requires church leaders to be "the husband of one wife." This establishes the standard for the Christian church.
3.  **The Mystery:** Paul calls marriage a "great mystery" concerning Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:32). Since there is only one Christ and one Body, the earthly type must preserve that unity.

---

### Q26. What then, is the inevitable conclusion regarding polygamy?

**“Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.” (Ecclesiastes 7:29).**

**Answer:**
Polygamy is one of man’s "many inventions."
*   **God's Design:** One man, one woman, for life. This brings holiness, happiness, and a reflection of heaven.
*   **Man's Deviation:** Every step away from this plan—whether it be polygamy, divorce, or modern promiscuity—is a step downward.
*   **The Call:** God is calling a people in these last days to stand on the platform of eternal truth. Just as we restore the Sabbath, we must uphold the sanctity of the marriage institution, proving that God’s law is a law of love and liberty.
