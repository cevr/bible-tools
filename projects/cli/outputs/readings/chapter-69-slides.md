## Slide 1 – Q1: The One Lawgiver
- **Question:** How may lawgivers are there?
- **Key Text:** James 4:12 – “There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?”

## Slide 2 – Q1: God’s Sovereignty
- **Source of Authority**
  - Moral authority originates from God alone. As the Creator, He determines the rules of the universe.
  - Isaiah 33:22 – “For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.”
- **Power to Save and Destroy**
  - **To Destroy:** The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”).
  - **To Save:** Only the Lawgiver has the legal authority to pardon the lawbreaker without undermining the law.
- **Our Duty**
  - We are subjects, not legislators. We cannot modify God’s requirements to suit our convenience.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Architect**
  - A master architect designs the blueprints (laws) for a skyscraper.
  - A tenant cannot remove a load-bearing wall just because they dislike it; doing so would destroy the building.
  - Only the Architect knows the design that sustains the structure.
  - **Lesson:** God designs life; to ignore His law is to invite ruin.

## Slide 4 – Q2: God’s Unchanging Character
- **Question:** What is said of the stability of His character?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:6 – “For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Law as a Transcript
- **Reflecting God’s Nature**
  - God’s law is a transcript of His character. Because God does not change, His law cannot change.
  - **God is Love:** 1 John 4:8 – “He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”
  - **God is Holy:** 1 Peter 1:16 – “Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.”
- **Eternal Stability**
  - If God were to abolish His law, He would have to change His own nature.
  - We do not serve a capricious deity; His standards are as rock-solid as His existence.
  - James 1:17 – “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”

## Slide 6 – Q3: Character of His Works
- **Question:** What is the character of His works?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 111:7-8 – “The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points & Sanctuary
- **Sure and Eternal**
  - God’s commandments are "sure" (reliable) and "stand fast forever."
  - They are not temporary shadows like the ceremonial sacrifices, but eternal moral principles.
- **Sanctuary Connection**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the Ten Commandments were placed *inside* the Ark of the Covenant.
  - Exodus 25:21 – “And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.”
  - **Meaning:** God’s throne is founded on law and justice, yet covered by the Mercy Seat for the repentant sinner.

## Slide 8 – Q4: Character of the Law
- **Question:** What is the character of His law?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:14 – “For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.”

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Human Dilemma
- **Spiritual Law vs. Carnal Man**
  - The law deals with motives and requires a spiritual nature to keep it.
  - Hebrews 4:12 – “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit... and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”
- **Sold Under Sin**
  - "Carnal" refers to the fallen human nature, which is hostile to God.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
  - **The Solution:** Man cannot obey the spiritual law without the New Birth.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Bird and the Fish**
  - Expecting a carnal man to keep the spiritual law is like expecting a fish to fly like an eagle.
  - It is not in the fish’s nature to fly.
  - The fish does not need new instructions; it needs a new nature.
  - **Lesson:** We must be "born again" of the Spirit to truly walk in God’s law.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Knowledge Before Conversion
- **Question:** What is revealed in that law as necessary for the carnal man to know before he can be converted?
- **Key Text:** Romans 2:18 – “And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Law as a Diagnostic Tool
- **Revealing God’s Will**
  - The law instructs the conscience, defining right and wrong.
  - Romans 3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”
- **The Mirror**
  - The law acts as a mirror to show us the "dirt" on our character.
  - It cannot wash away sin, but it points out the need for a Savior.
- **Repentance**
  - Sorrow for sin comes when we see our violation of God's holy law.
  - 2 Corinthians 7:10 – “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.”

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Law’s Role in Change
- **Question:** Then, if there is a change in one's life, from the carnal to the spiritual, does the law act any part in that work?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 19:7 – “The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Conversion and Guidance
- **Converting the Soul**
  - The Spirit uses the law to convict and "revive" the soul, turning it back to God.
- **Schoolmaster to Christ**
  - The law shows our spiritual bankruptcy so we will accept Christ’s wealth.
  - Galatians 3:24 – “Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”
- **Guidance**
  - After conversion, the law marks the path of holiness for the believer.
  - Psalm 119:105 – “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”

## Slide 15 – Q7: The Rich Young Ruler
- **Question:** What did our Saviour say to the young man who wanted salvation?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 19:17 – “And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Righteousness by Faith Application
- **The Standard of Life**
  - Jesus upholds the Ten Commandments as the standard of righteousness.
  - He used the law to expose the young man's hidden covetousness (idolatry of wealth).
- **The Need for Christ**
  - The command to "keep the commandments" drives us to Christ, the only One who kept them perfectly.
  - Through faith, we receive:
    1.  **Justification:** Christ's past obedience credited to us.
    2.  **Sanctification:** Christ's life in us empowering obedience.
  - Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 17 – Q8: Did Christ Change the Law?
- **Question:** Was it the intention of Christ to abolish or change any part of God's law?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:18 – “For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Key Points
- **Heaven and Earth as Witnesses**
  - Jesus ties the durability of the law to the existence of the physical creation.
- **Jot and Tittle**
  - Not even the smallest letter or stroke of the moral law will be removed.
- **The New Covenant**
  - The New Covenant does not abolish the law; it writes the *same* law upon the heart.
  - Jeremiah 31:33 – “But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel... I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.”

## Slide 19 – Q9: Christ’s Mission Regarding Law
- **Question:** What did the Saviour say He came to do to the law?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:17 – “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”

## Slide 20 – Q9: Fulfilling the Law
- **Meaning of "Fulfill"**
  - To "magnify," "make full," or "complete."
  - Jesus filled the law with its true, spiritual meaning (Isaiah 42:21 – “The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.”).
  - He perfectly obeyed it, showing that a human relying on God can live a sinless life.
- **[ILL] The Builder**
  - A builder "fulfills" a contract by following the blueprints perfectly until the house is complete.
  - He does not tear up the blueprints (destroy the law); he honors them by building according to their design.

## Slide 21 – Q10: Prophetic Fulfillment
- **Question:** When used in prophecy, what does the word fulfill mean?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 4:14 – “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet...”
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:54 – “...then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.”

## Slide 22 – Q10: Meaning in Prophecy
- **To Bring to Pass**
  - In prophecy, "fulfill" means a prediction has become historical fact.
  - Example: The virgin birth (Matthew 1:22-23 – “Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child...”).

## Slide 23 – Q11: Obligation Fulfillment
- **Question:** But what does the word mean associated with an obligation?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:2 – “Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.”

## Slide 24 – Q11: Obedience and Establishment
- **To Perform or Obey**
  - When applied to a law, "fulfill" means to carry it out.
  - Does obeying a law (like stopping at a stop sign) abolish it? No, it establishes it.
  - Romans 3:31 – “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.”

## Slide 25 – Q12: Christ’s Work on Earth
- **Question:** What did Christ say He came into the world to do?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:7 – “Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.”

## Slide 26 – Q12: Foundation of Atonement
- **Obedience over Sacrifice**
  - Animal sacrifices could not take away sin. God desired a life of perfect obedience ("To do thy will").
  - Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”
- **Two Aspects of Atonement**
  1.  **Christ’s Death:** Pays the penalty for the broken law.
  2.  **Christ’s Life:** Weaves a robe of perfect righteousness (law-keeping) to cover the believer.
  - Jesus offers us His perfect obedience as a free gift.

## Slide 27 – Q13: Entry into the Kingdom
- **Question:** Who did the Saviour say should be saved in the kingdom of heaven?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:21 – “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.”

## Slide 28 – Q13: Faith and Works
- **Cheap Grace vs. Living Faith**
  - Calling Jesus "Lord" implies He is the Master whose commands we follow.
  - Luke 6:46 – “And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?”
- **Fruit of Salvation**
  - We are saved by grace, but saving faith always produces obedience.
  - James 2:17 – “Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.”

## Slide 29 – Q14: The Least Commandment
- **Question:** What did He say of those who should break one of God's commandments?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:19 – “Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”

## Slide 30 – Q14: Unity of the Law
- **Danger of Minimizing**
  - To pick and choose commandments is to place human judgment above Divine authority.
  - James 2:10 – “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.”
- **Application**
  - This often applies to the Sabbath (4th Commandment), which the world considers "least."
  - Jesus teaches that even the "least" are binding.

## Slide 31 – Q15: Exceeding Righteousness
- **Question:** What did He say of those whose righteousness (right-doing) did not exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:20 – “For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.”

## Slide 32 – Q15: Internal vs. External
- **Pharisaic Righteousness**
  - Based on outward works and rigorous detail, but often lacking love and humility.
- **True Righteousness**
  - We need the *imputed* righteousness of God by faith.
  - Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.”
  - We need *imparted* righteousness: a change of heart, not just action.

## Slide 33 – Q15: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Mannequin**
  - A mannequin is dressed perfectly but has no life; it is stiff and cold.
  - A living child may be messy, but has life, warmth, and love.
  - The Pharisees were like mannequins—outwardly structured but lifeless.
  - God wants living children who obey from a heart of love.

## Slide 34 – Q16: Tradition vs. Commandment
- **Question:** On what particular point did Christ reprove the Pharisees?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:3 – “But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?”

## Slide 35 – Q16: Key Points
- **The Conflict**
  - The Pharisees placed human tradition above divine revelation.
  - Whenever tradition conflicts with Scripture, tradition must yield.
- **Prophetic Warning**
  - Daniel warned of a power that would think to change God’s laws.
  - Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the most High... and think to change times and laws.”

## Slide 36 – Q17: The Loophole
- **Question:** How had they done this?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:4-6 – “For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother... But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift... And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.”

## Slide 37 – Q17: Making the Law of None Effect
- **The Corban Scheme**
  - They invented a religious rule ("It is a gift") to evade the moral duty of caring for parents.
  - They appeared religious while violating the law of love.
- **Lesson**
  - Beware of religious systems that create "work-arounds" to avoid the plain requirements of the Ten Commandments.

## Slide 38 – Q18: Vain Worship
- **Question:** What kind of worship did He say theirs was?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:9 – “But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”

## Slide 39 – Q18: True Worship
- **Criterion of Worship**
  - Sincerity is not enough; worship must be based on truth.
  - John 4:24 – “God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”
  - Worship based on human authority rather than God’s Word is "vain" (empty).

## Slide 40 – Q19: The Rule of Judgment
- **Question:** By what rule will men's actions be weighed in the judgment?
- **Key Text:** Romans 2:12, 16 – “For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law... In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.”

## Slide 41 – Q19: Judgment and Gospel
- **Investigative Judgment**
  - God will judge the secrets of men. The law is the standard of measurement.
- **According to the Gospel**
  - The Gospel provides the remedy (Christ’s righteousness) for the failure revealed by the Judgment (the Law).
  - Those "in Christ" pass the judgment because His perfect law-keeping covers them.

## Slide 42 – Q20: Universal Guilt
- **Question:** How many of those who are condemned will be proved guilty by the law at that time?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:19 – “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.”

## Slide 43 – Q20: Purpose of the Law
- **Stopping the Mouth**
  - No one can claim innocence. The law silences all excuses.
- **From Guilt to Grace**
  - God reveals guilt to strip us of self-righteousness.
  - The only escape from being "under the law" (condemned) is being "under grace."
  - Romans 6:14 – “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”

## Slide 44 – Q21: The Reward
- **Question:** By whom will the saved be blessed in the bestowal of the eternal reward?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:34 – “Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”

## Slide 45 – Q21: Inheritance
- **Prepared for You**
  - Salvation is God’s plan from the beginning.
- **Inheritance**
  - We receive the kingdom as an inheritance because we are adopted children of God through faith.

## Slide 46 – Q22: The Final Blessing
- **Question:** What blessing will God give to those who have kept His commandments?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 22:14 – “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.”

## Slide 47 – Q22: Evidence of Salvation
- **Restoration**
  - Sin barred Adam from the Tree of Life; obedience (restored by Christ) grants access again.
- **Faith and Works Combined**
  - These saints do not obey to *earn* heaven, but because they *have* the faith of Jesus.
  - Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”
  - Their obedience is the visible fruit of their relationship with Jesus.

## Slide 48 – Q22: Illustration
- **[ILL] The Passport**
  - A passport gives a traveler the right to enter a country.
  - The traveler didn't print it (Christ provides the righteousness).
  - But the traveler must carry it and not destroy it (Obedience cherishes the gift).
  - A life of rebellion throws the passport away; a life of obedience holds fast to the gift Christ has given.
