## Slide 1 – Q1: The Promise of His Coming

- **Question:** What special promise did the Saviour make concerning His second
  coming?
- **Key Text:** John 14:2, 3 – “In My Father's house are many mansions: if it
  were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I
  go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto
  Myself; that where I am there ye may be also.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Preparation and Reunion

- **A Purposeful Departure**
  - Jesus did not leave His disciples as orphans; He went to do a specific work.
  - **The Preparation:** Christ ascended to the heavenly sanctuary to prepare a
    place for us, but also to prepare _us_ for that place.
  - **High Priestly Ministry:** He intercedes to blot out sin and perfect
    character (Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the
    uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
    intercession for them.”).
- **The Reunion**
  - The Second Coming is the climax of the plan of salvation.
  - Without the return of Christ, the Cross and Resurrection would be
    incomplete, leaving death as the final victor.
  - The goal is restoration: God and humanity dwelling together (Revelation
    21:3).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Righteousness by Faith Application

- **Fitting for the Mansion**
  - We cannot enter a holy heaven with the defilement of sin.
  - **Justification:** A title to heaven (Christ’s righteousness imputed to us).
  - **Sanctification:** A fitness for heaven (Christ’s righteousness imparted to
    us, transforming our character).
- **The Wedding Garment**
  - By faith, we allow Him to clothe us so we may sit at His table.
  - Matthew 22:11–12 – “And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw
    there a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he saith unto him,
    Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was
    speechless.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Bridegroom’s Work**
  - Imagine a loving bridegroom building a beautiful home. He paints and
    furnishes it, thinking of his bride with every stroke of the hammer.
  - However, he does not stop at the house. He also sends his bride a beautiful
    dress and helps her prepare for the wedding day.
- **The Spiritual Lesson**
  - Christ is doing both works simultaneously:
    - He is preparing heaven for us.
    - Through His Spirit, He is preparing us for heaven.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Signs Before the Return

- **Question:** What was to take place before the lord should return?
- **Key Text:** Joel 2:31 – “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon
  into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Nature’s Warning

- **Mercy Before Judgment**
  - God rarely pours out judgment without sending a warning first (Amos 3:7 –
    “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his
    servants the prophets.”).
- **Signs in Nature**
  - The physical universe reacts to the approaching steps of its Creator.
  - Darkening of the sun and the bloody moon serve as alarm bells to a sleeping
    world.
- **The Day of the Lord**
  - “Terrible” (awesome/fearful) to the unrepentant because it marks the end of
    probation.
  - A day of deliverance for the righteous.
- **Definition of Probation:**
  - The time granting sinners opportunity to repent before the final judgment is
    set.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Disciples’ Question

- **Question:** Upon hearing Christ say that the time would come when the temple
  at Jerusalem should be entirely destroyed, what did the disciples ask Him?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:3 – “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what
  shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?”

## Slide 8 – Q3: A Dual Prophecy

- **Confusion of the Disciples**
  - They believed the destruction of the temple and the end of the world would
    happen simultaneously.
  - They could not conceive of the temple falling while the world continued.
- **Jesus’ Double Answer**
  - In Matthew 24, Jesus addresses both events together.
  - **Historical Application:** The destruction of Jerusalem by Rome in A.D. 70.
  - **Future Application:** The final destruction of the world at the Second
    Coming.
- **Type and Antitype**
  - The ruin of Jerusalem is a “type” (symbol) of the final ruin of the world.
  - The warnings for the first event are essential for surviving the second.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Deception and Delay

- **Question:** Did He intimate that the end was then close at hand?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:4-6 – “And Jesus answered and said unto them. Take
  heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am
  Christ; and shall deceive many. And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars;
  see that ye be not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the
  end is not yet.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points on Deception

- **The Greatest Danger**
  - The first sign was not a disaster, but a warning against spiritual
    deception: “Take heed that no man deceive you.”
- **False Messiahs**
  - Satan counterfeits the work of Christ.
  - If he cannot keep people in open sin, he traps them in false religion.
- **Political Turmoil**
  - Wars and rumors of wars are standard conditions of a sinful world.
  - Believers are to remain calm (“be not troubled”) trusting in God’s
    providence.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Application (Truth in the Heart)

- **Protection from Deception**
  - We are protected only by a personal knowledge of the Truth, who is Christ
    (John 14:6).
- **Internalized Law**
  - Theoretical knowledge is not enough; the truth must be written on the heart.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
    Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
    and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall
    be to me a people.”
- **Knowing the Voice**
  - We must distinguish the Shepherd from the stranger (John 10:4, 5).

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Beginning of Sorrows

- **Question:** After telling them there would be wars, famines, pestilences,
  and earthquakes in many places, what did He say these would be?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:8 – “All these are the beginning of sorrows.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Birth Pangs of a New World

- **Meaning of “Sorrows”**
  - The word literally translates to “birth pangs.”
- **Creation Groaning**
  - Romans 8:22 – “For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
    in pain together until now.”
- **Intensity and Frequency**
  - Just as birth pains increase as the birth draws near, natural disasters
    (famines, earthquakes) will become more frequent and severe.
- **Hope**
  - Birth pangs are painful but lead to life.
  - These signs indicate the new heaven and new earth are about to be born.

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Gospel Commission

- **Question:** To what extent is the gospel to be preached before the end?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:14 – “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be
  preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the
  end come.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: The Final Witness

- **The Gospel of the Kingdom**
  - This includes the specific end-time message: the “Three Angels’ Messages” of
    Revelation 14.
  - It is a call to worship the Creator and keep His commandments.
- **“For a Witness”**
  - God does not promise the whole world will be _converted_.
  - He promises the whole world will be _warned_.
  - Every person must have an intelligent opportunity to choose between Christ
    and Satan.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Power of the Gospel (Application)

- **More Than Theory**
  - The gospel is the power to live a holy life (Romans 1:16).
- **The Ultimate Witness**
  - The world needs to see a people who keep the commandments of God through the
    faith of Jesus.
  - Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
    keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Lighthouse**
  - A lighthouse does not force ships to come into the harbor.
  - Its job is simply to shine brightly enough that every captain in the storm
    can see the way.
  - Once the light is seen, the choice belongs to the captain.
- **The Church’s Role**
  - The church is that light; we provide the witness so the world can choose.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Gospel Progress

- **Question:** What has been already admitted concerning the progress of the
  gospel?
- **Key Text:** Quote from _Christian Union_, Nov. 13, 1878 – “Within a year,
  Central Africa... has been opened up... if the gospel is to be preached...
  'for a witness unto all nations,'... then it may well be that the end is
  nearer than most of us think.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Global Reach

- **Breaking Barriers**
  - Even in the 19th century, observers noted that barriers to the gospel were
    falling.
- **Modern Fulfillment**
  - Today, through radio, internet, satellite, and print, the gospel penetrates
    closed regions.
- **A Quick Work**
  - Technology allows the message to reach “all nations” rapidly.
  - Romans 9:28 – “For he will finish the work, and cut it short in
    righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Abomination of Desolation

- **Question:** After giving a general summary of matters, how did the Lord
  particularize the events of the future?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:15 – “When ye therefore shall see the abomination of
  desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso
  readeth, let him understand).”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Daniel’s Prophecy

- **Reference to Daniel**
  - Jesus points back to Daniel 9:26-27, 11:31, and 12:11.
- **Historical Fulfillment (Type)**
  - In A.D. 70, the “abomination” was the Roman armies with idolatrous standards
    standing on holy ground around the temple.
- **Spiritual Fulfillment (Antitype)**
  - Points to the work of the Papacy (the “Little Horn” of Daniel 8).
  - Sets up an earthly priesthood and human traditions in place of Christ’s
    ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - This system “desolates” the sanctuary by obscuring Christ’s mediation.

## Slide 22 – Q9: The Sign for Jerusalem

- **Question:** How is this same thought expressed elsewhere?
- **Key Text:** Luke 21:20 – “And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with
  armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Obedience Saves Life

- **The Practical Sign**
  - Luke gives the specific sign for the first-century disciples.
- **The Event**
  - Roman armies (under Cestius Gallus, A.D. 66) surrounded Jerusalem and then
    mysteriously withdrew.
- **The Escape**
  - Christians recognized this as Christ’s sign.
  - They fled to the mountains (Pella).
  - Not a single Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.
- **Lesson:** Obedience to prophetic warning is a matter of life and death.

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Great Tribulation

- **Question:** What did our Lord say was to follow this destruction of the
  city?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:21 – “For then shall be great tribulation, such as
  was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Persecution and Faith

- **The Dark Ages**
  - While applicable to A.D. 70, this prophecy extends to the “Great
    Tribulation” of the Dark Ages.
  - The true church was driven into the wilderness.
  - Millions were martyred for owning Bibles or refusing human authority in
    place of God’s Word.
- **The Faith of the Martyrs**
  - They did not have a “cheap grace.”
  - They possessed a faith that overcame the world (1 John 5:4 – “For whatsoever
    is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh
    the world, even our faith.”).
  - They loved not their lives unto the death (Revelation 12:11).

## Slide 26 – Q11: The Time of Papal Sway

- **Question:** How long was the papal power to hold sway over the saints?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the Most
  High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change
  times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times
  and the dividing of time.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Identifying the Power

- **Characteristics of the Little Horn**
  - Speaks pompous words against God.
  - Persecutes God’s people.
  - Attempts to change God’s law (specifically the Sabbath, the only commandment
    dealing with “time”).
- **Duration**
  - “Time” (1 year) + “Times” (2 years) + “Dividing of time” (half a year).
  - Total: 3.5 prophetic years.

## Slide 28 – Q12: Decoding the Time Prophecy

- **Question:** What is the meaning of the expression, "time and times and the
  dividing of time?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:6 – “And the woman fled into the wilderness, where
  she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand
  two hundred and threescore days.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Scripture Interprets Scripture

- **The Calculation**
  - Comparing Daniel 7:25 with Revelation 12:6 and 12:14.
  - “Time, times, and half a time” = **1,260 days**.
- **The Symbols**
  - **Woman:** Represents God’s true church (Jeremiah 6:2; 2 Corinthians 11:2).
  - **Wilderness:** A place of seclusion and hiding from persecution.

## Slide 30 – Q13: The Day-Year Principle

- **Question:** What does a symbolic day indicate?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 4:6 – “And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again
  on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah
  forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Prophetic Timeline (538–1798)

- **The Principle:** In symbolic prophecy, 1 day = 1 literal year (Numbers
  14:34; Ezekiel 4:6).
- **The Math:** 1,260 prophetic days = **1,260 literal years**.
- **Start Date: A.D. 538**
  - The decree of Justinian was fully effective; the Ostrogoths were uprooted,
    leaving the Papacy supreme.
- **End Date: A.D. 1798**
  - Adding 1,260 years to 538 brings us to 1798.
  - **Fulfillment:** Berthier, a general of Napoleon, entered Rome, took the
    Pope prisoner, and broke the political power of the Papacy.

## Slide 32 – Q14: Shortening the Days

- **Question:** What did the Lord say would be done in view of the rigor of that
  persecution?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:22 – “And except those days should be shortened,
  there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
  shortened.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: God’s Mercy

- **Persecution Checked**
  - Although the _dominion_ of the Little Horn lasted until 1798, the active,
    large-scale _persecution_ ceased earlier.
- **The Reformation**
  - The Protestant Reformation and movements for religious liberty checked the
    power of Rome.
- **Divine Intervention**
  - Had the intense persecution continued until 1798, the church might have been
    wiped out.
  - God intervened for “the elect’s sake.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: False Christs

- **Question:** Did the Lord say He would return immediately after the
  tribulation ceased?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:23, 24 – “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo,
  here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs,
  and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if
  it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.”

## Slide 35 – Q15: The Safeguard Against Deception

- **Counterfeits**
  - Before the true Christ returns, Satan works with “all power and signs and
    lying wonders” (2 Thessalonians 2:9).
  - Spiritualism and false revivals will simulate the presence of Christ.
- **The Test**
  - The elect are not preserved by their own cleverness.
  - They are preserved because they test everything by the Law and the Testimony
    (Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
    to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”).

## Slide 36 – Q16: The Signs in the Heavens

- **Question:** What did He say would immediately follow?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:29 – “Immediately... after the tribulation of those
  days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the
  stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: The Prophetic Sequence

- **Timeline of Events:**
  1.  The 1260-year period (538–1798).
  2.  The “tribulation” (persecution) is shortened (ends mid-18th century).
  3.  **Immediately after** the persecution eases (but before 1798), the signs
      begin.
  4.  Sun darkened, Moon darkened, Stars fall.

## Slide 38 – Q17: Mark’s Timeline

- **Question:** How is this expressed by Mark?
- **Key Text:** Mark 13:24 – “But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun
  shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: The Specific Window

- **“In Those Days”**
  - Within the 1260 years (before 1798).
- **“After That Tribulation”**
  - After the active persecution had ceased (roughly after 1773, suppression of
    Jesuits).
- **Conclusion**
  - We must look for the signs between ~1773 and 1798.

## Slide 40 – Q18: The Dark Day

- **Question:** Was there such a phenomenon? If so, when did it occur?
- **Key Text:** May 19, 1780.

## Slide 41 – Q18: Historical Fulfillment

- **The Event**
  - On May 19, 1780, a supernatural darkness covered New England and parts of
    Canada.
  - It was not an eclipse (the moon was full).
- **The Effect**
  - Animals went to roost; men trembled, believing the Day of Judgment had
    arrived.
- **Prophetic Accuracy**
  - It occurred exactly within the window marked out by Jesus (after the
    tribulation, but within the 1260 days).

## Slide 42 – Q19: The Moon to Blood

- **Question:** When did the moon refuse to shine?
- **Key Text:** Stone's History of Beverly (Mass.) – “The night succeeding that
  day (May 19, 1780) was of such pitchy darkness that in some instances horses
  could not be compelled to leave the stable when wanted for service.”

## Slide 43 – Q19: Night of Darkness

- **Fulfillment of Joel 2:31**
  - The prophecy stated the moon would be turned to “blood.”
- **The Appearance**
  - After the dense darkness of the day lifted slightly, the moon appeared the
    following night.
  - It had the distinct appearance of blood.

## Slide 44 – Q20: The Falling Stars

- **Question:** When did the stars fall, as predicted in the prophecy?
- **Key Text:** November 13, 1833.

## Slide 45 – Q20: The Leonid Meteor Shower

- **The Event**
  - The most spectacular meteor shower in recorded history occurred over North
    America.
  - Stars were described as falling like “flakes of snow.”
- **Biblical Link**
  - Revelation 6:13 – “And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a
    fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.”
- **Timing**
  - Occurred 53 years after the Dark Day, completing the series of signs
    predicted in Matthew 24:29.

## Slide 46 – Q21: The Parable of the Fig Tree

- **Question:** When the trees put forth their leaves, what does it indicate?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:32 – “Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When his
  branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh.”

## Slide 47 – Q21: Reading the Signs

- **Nature’s Lesson**
  - We do not need a calendar to know summer is coming when we see buds on the
    trees.
- **Spiritual Application**
  - When we see the signs Christ predicted (Sun, Moon, Stars), we do not need to
    guess.
  - We _know_ the season of His return is here.

## Slide 48 – Q21: Illustration

- **The Farmer’s Wisdom**
  - A farmer seeing dark clouds gathering, wind picking up, and temperature
    dropping knows a storm is coming.
  - He does not ignore the signs.
- **Prophetic Weather**
  - God has given us “prophetic weather signs” so we are not caught unprepared.

## Slide 49 – Q22: At the Doors

- **Question:** What just as surely indicates the Lord's speedy coming?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:33 – “So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these
  things, know that it is near, even at the doors.”

## Slide 50 – Q22: Sanctuary Imagery

- **Immediate Urgency**
  - “At the doors” implies the event is the very next thing to happen.
  - James 5:9 – “...behold, the judge standeth before the door.”
- **High Priestly Work**
  - In the earthly type, the High Priest came out to bless the people after
    finishing his work in the Most Holy Place.
  - Christ is currently finishing His work in the heavenly sanctuary and is
    ready to step out.

## Slide 51 – Q23: This Generation

- **Question:** How near is the Lord's coming when these signs have been
  fulfilled?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:34, 35 – “Verily I say unto you, This generation
  shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall
  pass away, but My words shall not pass away.”

## Slide 52 – Q23: Certainty of the Word

- **The Generation of Signs**
  - The “generation” refers to the era of history that witnesses the specific
    signs (Dark Day, Falling Stars).
  - This is the “time of the end.”
- **Faithfulness of God**
  - The visible heavens may dissolve, but the promises of Christ are more stable
    than the ground we walk on.

## Slide 53 – Q24: The Day and Hour

- **Question:** Can we know the day and hour of His coming?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:36 – “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no,
  not the angels of heaven, but My Father only.”

## Slide 54 – Q24: Watchfulness

- **No Time-Setting**
  - God reveals the _season_ (nearness) but not the _exact date_.
- **Purpose of Mystery**
  - This keeps the church in a state of constant watchfulness and dependence.
  - If we knew the date, we might delay preparation.
  - We must live every day in Christ, ready for His appearing.

## Slide 55 – Q25: As in the Days of Noah

- **Question:** What will be the moral condition of the world when the Lord
  comes?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:37-39 – “But as the days of Noe were, so shall also
  the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood
  they were eating and drinking... until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
  and knew not until the flood came and took them all away...”

## Slide 56 – Q25: Preoccupation and Probation

- **Total Absorption**
  - The sin was not just violence, but living as if this world was the only
    reality (eating, drinking, marrying).
- **Fatal Indifference**
  - They “knew not”—not because they weren't warned (Noah preached 120 years),
    but because they didn't care.
- **The Shut Door**
  - They waited until the door of the ark was shut.
  - **Sanctuary Connection:** There is a time when probation closes. We must
    enter the “Ark” (Christ) while the door is still open.

## Slide 57 – Q26: The Call to Readiness

- **Question:** If we have knowledge of the Lord's coming, what is our duty?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:44 – “Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour
  as ye think not the Son of man cometh.”

## Slide 58 – Q26: What is Readiness?

- **Steps to Readiness**
  1.  **Repentance:** Turning from sin.
  2.  **Faith:** Trusting in Christ’s atoning blood (Justification).
  3.  **Obedience:** Allowing His life to produce good works in us
      (Sanctification).
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - To be “ready” is to be found in Him.
  - Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness,
    which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
    righteousness which is of God by faith.”

## Slide 59 – Q27: The Evil Servant

- **Question:** What will be the doom of those who say in their hearts that the
  Lord is not soon coming?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:48-51 – “But and if that evil servant shall say in
  his heart, My lord delayeth his coming... the lord of that servant shall
  come... in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder... and
  appoint him his portion with the hypocrites...”

## Slide 60 – Q27: The Danger of Delay

- **A Professed Believer**
  - The evil servant is a “servant”—he claims to be a Christian.
  - His error is losing the sense of the _imminence_ of Christ’s return.
- **Consequences of “My Lord Delayeth”**
  - **Worldliness:** Eating and drinking with the drunken (joining the world’s
    spirit).
  - **Cruelty:** Smiting fellow servants (criticism, harshness, lack of love).
- **Final Appeal**
  - The signs are fulfilled; the Judge is at the door.
  - Let us be like the wise servants, watching with lamps trimmed and burning.
