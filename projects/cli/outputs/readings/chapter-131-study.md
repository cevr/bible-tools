### Q1. What class of persons will the Lord direct?
**“The meek will He guide in judgment; and the meek will He teach His way.” Ps. 25:9.**

**Answer:**
The Lord has promised special guidance to a specific class of people: the meek. To understand this promise, we must first understand the condition required to receive it.

*   **Defining Meekness:** As noted in the outline, meekness is not weakness. It is "mildness of temper; not easily provoked... yielding." In the biblical sense, **meekness** is the silence of self. It is a spirit that is teachable, willing to submit to God’s will without arguing, and willing to endure wrong without retaliating.
*   **The Condition for Guidance:** God cannot guide the proud because they are full of their own wisdom (Proverbs 3:5–7). The "judgment" mentioned here implies the ability to discern right from wrong and to make wise decisions in the fear of God. Only those who distrust their own hearts and lean entirely upon Christ can be "taught His way."
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the priest had to wash at the laver before entering the Holy Place, the believer must be cleansed of intellectual pride (meekness) to receive light from the Candlestick (the Holy Spirit’s guidance).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a horse that has not been broken in. It fights the bit and bridle, refusing to turn when the rider pulls the reins. This horse cannot be guided. Now imagine a horse that is "meek" or broken—it is strong, but its strength is under control. It turns at the slightest touch of the master’s hand. So it is with us; God can only direct the life that has ceased fighting against His will.

### Q2. Who could truly say he possessed this principle?
**“Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls.” Matt. 11:29.**

**Answer:**
Jesus Christ is the only One who possesses this principle by nature, and He is the source from whom we must receive it.

*   **Christ Our Righteousness:** Meekness is not a trait we manufacture; it is the very nature of Christ. When He invites us to "learn of Me," He is inviting us to partake of His character. He humbled Himself, leaving the courts of heaven to become a servant (Philippians 2:5–8).
*   **The Yoke of Union:** To "take His yoke" means to unite our lives with His in service and obedience. In the Bible, a yoke binds two animals together to pull a load. If we are yoked with Christ, we walk at His pace and go where He goes.
*   **Finding Rest:** The "rest" promised here is rest from the heavy burden of self-justification and the struggle of pride. When we stop trying to be "great" and instead accept the "lowly" position of a learner at the feet of Jesus, the soul finds peace.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Two oxen in a yoke must walk together. If one is much stronger, it bears the burden for the weaker one. Christ is the strong One. When we take His yoke, we are not carrying the heavy load of our salvation alone; we are simply walking beside Him, letting His strength and His meekness carry us through.

### Q3. Who was the meekest man on earth before Christ came?
**“Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.” Num. 12:3.**

**Answer:**
Moses is identified by Scripture as the meekest man of his time. This is remarkable considering that by nature, Moses was impulsive and hot-tempered (as seen when he killed the Egyptian in Exodus 2:11–12).

*   **Transformed by Grace:** Moses’ meekness was a fruit of forty years of shepherding in the desert, unlearning the pride of Egypt and learning dependence on God. This proves that **Sanctification** (the work of God making us holy) can transform a fiery temper into a spirit of patience and long-suffering.
*   **Strength Under Control:** In Numbers 12, Moses was attacked by his own brother and sister (Aaron and Miriam). He did not defend himself. True meekness allows God to be the Defender. Moses stood aside and let the Lord handle his reputation.

---

### Q4. Of whom was Moses a type?
**“I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put My words in His mouth; and He shall speak unto them all that I shall command Him.” Deut. 18:18. compare with Acts 3:22-26.**

**Answer:**
Moses was a "type" (a prophetic foreshadowing) of Jesus Christ.

*   **The Mediator:** Just as Moses stood between God and the people to plead for them when they sinned (Exodus 32:30–32), Christ stands in the heavenly sanctuary as our Mediator and High Priest (1 Timothy 2:5).
*   **The Deliverer:** Moses led physical Israel out of physical bondage in Egypt. Christ leads spiritual Israel out of the bondage of sin and the condemnation of the law (Romans 8:1–2).
*   **The Law-Giver:** Moses brought down the law written on stone; Christ writes that same law upon the fleshy tables of the heart through the New Covenant (Hebrews 8:10).

**Definition:**
**Type and Antitype:** A "type" is a symbol or shadow in the Old Testament (like Moses or the lamb). The "antitype" is the reality in the New Testament (Christ).

### Q5. Whom should we follow in this?
**“Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Matt. 11:28.**

**Answer:**
We are to follow Jesus Christ personally.

*   **The Invitation:** The call is to "Come." We cannot learn meekness from a book or a set of rules; we learn it by coming into the presence of a Person.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Notice that those called are "heavy laden." This often refers to those burdened by the weight of sin or the futile attempt to earn salvation by their own works. Jesus offers rest—a free gift. This rest is the peace of **Justification** (being declared righteous by faith).
*   **Cessation of Effort:** This does not mean we stop working for God, but we stop working *for* acceptance. We rest in His finished work, and from that rest, we serve Him (Hebrews 4:9–10).

### Q6. How is one to receive the instruction he needs on this point?
**“Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.” James 1:21.**

**Answer:**
This verse provides the practical "how-to" of the Christian life.

1.  **Lay Apart (Repentance):** Before we can receive, we must let go. "Filthiness" and "superfluity of naughtiness" (overflowing wickedness) must be discarded. This is the work of repentance—turning away from sin.
2.  **Receive with Meekness (Faith):** We do not create the word; we *receive* it. Meekness here is the lack of resistance to God's truth. It implies saying, "Lord, I accept what Your Word says about my condition, and I accept Your remedy."
3.  **The Engrafted Word (Union):** The Word (Christ and His gospel) must be "engrafted" or implanted into us.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** Just as a branch from a good tree is grafted into a wild tree to make it bear good fruit, so the life of Christ is grafted into our carnal nature. It is an outside life coming in (Galatians 2:20).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A gardener grafts a branch of a sweet apple tree into a sour crabapple tree. The sap flows through the new branch, and the tree produces sweet apples. The tree cannot change its own fruit; it must receive the graft. We are the sour tree; Christ is the "engrafted word." We receive Him by faith, and He produces the fruit of righteousness in us.

### Q7. When asked for a reason of our hope of heaven, how should we answer?
**“But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.” 1 Peter 3:15.**

**Answer:**
We must answer with "meekness and fear."

*   **Sanctifying the Lord:** This means setting Christ apart as King in the heart. If Christ reigns within, self is dethroned.
*   **The Manner of Witnessing:** Truth presented in a proud, argumentative, or superior manner often hardens hearts. The "fear" mentioned here is not terror, but a holy reverence for God and a carefulness not to misrepresent His character.
*   **Practical Application:** When sharing the Sabbath or the Second Coming, we must avoid a combative spirit. We are not winning a debate; we are winning a soul. The power of the argument lies as much in the spirit of the speaker as in the text of the Scripture.

### Q8. Of what is meekness a fruit?
**“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.” Gal. 5:22, 23.**

**Answer:**
Meekness is a **Fruit of the Spirit**.

*   **Not a Human Work:** Fruit is not something a plant tries to make by straining and grunting; it is the natural byproduct of life flowing from the vine. If we have the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, meekness will appear naturally.
*   **Against Such There is No Law:** The law of God condemns sin. But the law has no condemnation for the character of Christ. When the Spirit produces these traits in us, we are fulfilling the law (Romans 8:4). This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**—the law is kept not by human effort, but by the spiritual life indwelling the believer.

### Q9. If one really has the Spirit of God, what things will he look after?
**“For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.” Rom. 8:5.**

**Answer:**
A person with the Spirit will "mind" (set their attention and affection on) the things of the Spirit.

*   **The Two Natures:** Paul describes a conflict between the "flesh" (our fallen, selfish nature) and the "Spirit."
*   **The Test of True Religion:** We can tell which power controls us by what occupies our thoughts.
    *   The flesh seeks: self-promotion, revenge, appetite, worldly praise.
    *   The Spirit seeks: humility, prayer, the good of others, the glory of God.
*   **Sanctification:** This is a daily choice. To "mind" the Spirit is to consciously choose, moment by moment, to yield to God's influence rather than our natural impulses.

### Q10. What is the evidence that we are Christ’s?
**“But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” Rom. 8:9.**

**Answer:**
The indispensable evidence of belonging to Jesus is the indwelling of the **Spirit of Christ**.

*   **A Vital Truth:** Profession, church membership, and knowledge of doctrine are not enough. We must have the Spirit.
*   **What is the Spirit of Christ?** Based on the previous verses, it is a spirit of meekness, humility, and love. If we claim to be Christians but cherish pride, hatred, or an unforgiving spirit, we contradict our claim.
*   **Assurance:** The text also gives hope: "Ye are not in the flesh... if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you." If we have surrendered to Him, we are no longer defined by our old nature. God sees us in the Spirit (Romans 8:1).

### Q11. If a brother is overcome by a fault, who only should undertake his restoration, and in what way?
**“Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.” Gal. 6:1.**

**Answer:**
Only those who are "spiritual" should undertake restoration, and it must be done in a "spirit of meekness."

*   **"Ye Which are Spiritual":** This refers to those who are walking in the Spirit (as defined in Galatians 5:22-23). A person who is angry, judgmental, or gossiping is "carnal" and will only make the wound worse.
*   **The Goal is Restoration:** The word "restore" is used in Greek for setting a broken bone or mending a net. The goal is healing, not punishment.
*   **Self-Distrust:** "Considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted." The meek man knows his own weakness. He knows that but for the grace of God, he would have fallen into the same sin. This prevents a "holier-than-thou" attitude.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If a surgeon needs to operate on a delicate part of the body, he washes his hands thoroughly and uses a gentle touch. He doesn't hack away carelessly. When we deal with a brother’s sin, we are performing surgery on a soul. Only the clean hands of a spiritual person, moving with the gentleness of Christ, can heal the wound.

### Q12. How should Christian women adorn themselves?
**“Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.” 1 Peter 3:3, 4.**

**Answer:**
The Christian is to be adorned with the "hidden man of the heart"—specifically, a "meek and quiet spirit."

*   **True Value:** The world values gold, pearls, and fashion—things that perish. God values character. A meek spirit is "of great price" in God's sight. It is the currency of heaven.
*   **The Principle of Modesty:** While this text addresses women, the principle applies to all believers. The focus of life should not be outward display, which feeds pride (the flesh), but the development of the inward character (the Spirit).
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the earthly sanctuary, the glory was hidden behind the veil in the Most Holy Place. So in the believer, the true glory is the Shekinah of God's character dwelling in the inmost heart.

---

### Q13. What will the Lord finally do for those who cultivate the spirit of meekness?
**“For the Lord taketh pleasure in His people: He will beautify the meek with salvation.” Ps. 149:4.**

**Answer:**
God will "beautify" the meek with salvation.

*   **The Robe of Righteousness:** To be beautified with salvation means to be clothed in the character of Christ.
    *   **Imputed Righteousness:** We are covered by Christ's merit now (Justification).
    *   **Imparted Righteousness:** We are changed into His image internally (Sanctification).
    *   **Glorification:** Finally, we will be changed physically at His coming.
*   **God's Pleasure:** The Lord "takes pleasure" in His people not because they are naturally good, but because He sees the reflection of His own Son in them. The meek are beautiful to God because they look like Jesus.

---

### Q14. What will the meek inherit?
**“Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.” Matt. 5:5.**

**Answer:**
The meek will inherit the earth made new.

*   **The Great Reversal:** In the present world, the aggressive, the proud, and the powerful often seize the land and rule the nations. It seems the meek are trampled upon. But in God’s plan, this is temporary.
*   **The New Earth:** After the cleansing of the universe from sin (Revelation 21:1), the earth will be given to those who have learned the laws of the kingdom of heaven—the laws of love and humility.
*   **Security:** Those who have not learned meekness would destroy the peace of heaven. Only those who have allowed the Spirit to tame their hearts are safe to live eternally in God's universe.

### Q15. What graces are the meek of the earth exhorted to seek that they may be hid in the day of the Lord's fierce anger?
**“Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought His judgment: seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.” Zeph. 2:3.**

**Answer:**
We are exhorted to seek three things: **The Lord**, **Righteousness**, and **Meekness**.

*   **Progressive Sanctification:** Note the paradox: The verse addresses the "meek of the earth" and yet tells them to "seek meekness."
    *   This teaches that we never reach a point of "arriving." The Christian life is a constant growth. We need *more* of Christ's righteousness and *deeper* meekness every day.
*   **Preparation for Judgment:** The "day of the Lord's anger" refers to the final judgments and the close of probation. To be "hid" in that day corresponds to having the seal of God.
*   **The Covering:** In the time of trouble, our own character will not stand. We must be hidden in Christ. Only those who have ceased to trust in themselves (meekness) will hold fast to Christ when the tests come.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A diver seeking pearls must hold his breath and dive deep. He cannot stay on the surface. So the Christian must dive deeper into the ocean of God’s love. We cannot be content with the meekness we had yesterday; we must seek a fresh supply from Christ today.
