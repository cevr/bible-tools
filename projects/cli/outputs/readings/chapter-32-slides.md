## Slide 1 – Q1: The Mission of Christ

- Question: What was the mission of Christ to the earth?
- Key Text: Luke 19:10 – “For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Condition and The Initiative)

- **The Mission:** Jesus did not come merely to teach morality or set an example. He came to rescue a race separated from God.
- **The Condition of Man:**
  - Humanity is described as “lost.”
  - Like a lost sheep, man cannot find his own way back; he is alienated from the life of God (Ephesians 4:18 – “Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart”).
  - Man is dead in trespasses and sins.
- **The Initiative of God:**
  - Salvation begins with the Shepherd seeking the sheep, not the sheep seeking the Shepherd.
  - The Incarnation bridged the infinite gulf to find us where we are.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Child in the Forest:**
  - Imagine a child wandering deep into a dark, dense forest until night falls.
  - The child cannot “will” himself home; he is helpless and disoriented.
  - He needs a rescuer with a light to enter the forest, find him, and carry him out.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Christ entered the “forest” of this fallen world to carry us home.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Redemption from the Curse

- Question: From what does Christ redeem us?
- Key Text: Galatians 3:13 – “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Law and Exchange)

- **The Curse of the Law:**
  - The law is holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”).
  - To the transgressor, however, it brings the “curse,” which is the penalty of eternal death (Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”).
- **Redemption:**
  - Means “to buy back” or “release by ransom.”
- **The Great Exchange:**
  - Christ did not abolish the law; He bore its penalty.
  - He took our condemnation so that we might have His blessing.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Definitions and Illustration

- **Definitions:**
  - **Atonement:** Reconciliation (at-one-ment) through Jesus’ sacrifice and priestly ministry.
  - **Substitution:** Christ taking the sinner’s place and punishment.
- **Illustration:**
  - A judge finds a man guilty of a capital crime.
  - The judge steps down from the bench and takes the prisoner’s place in the execution chamber.
  - The law is upheld (penalty paid), but the sinner goes free. This is Calvary.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Seeing God

- Question: Who shall see God?
- Key Text: Matthew 5:8 – “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Purity and Presence)

- **Internal Purity:**
  - Salvation is a transformation of nature, not just external washing.
  - A “pure heart” is cleansed from the love of sin and deceit.
- **The Beatific Vision:**
  - God is a consuming fire to sin (Hebrews 12:29 – “For our God is a consuming fire.”).
  - Only those with characters reflecting His righteousness can dwell in His presence (Isaiah 33:14 – “The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?”).
- **The Method:**
  - Purity is achieved by the Holy Spirit applying Christ’s blood to the conscience (Hebrews 9:14).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Muddy Window:**
  - If a window is covered in mud, you cannot see the sun, and light cannot enter the room.
  - Human effort is like scrubbing the glass; Christ cleans the soul.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Christ cleans the “window” of the soul so the light of God’s countenance can shine in and through us.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Relation to God

- Question: What relation must those who see God, sustain to Him in this life?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:2 – “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Present and Future)

- **Present Reality:**
  - We do not wait for heaven to become God’s children.
  - “Now are we the sons of God.”
  - We are adopted into the royal family immediately upon receiving Christ.
- **Future Glory:**
  - Our physical glorification awaits the Second Coming.
  - We are currently princes and princesses in enemy territory, waiting for the King to restore our inheritance.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Application (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - The High Priest bore the names of the tribes of Israel on his breastplate into the Holy Place.
  - Similarly, Christ bears our names before the Father *now*.
- **Assurance:**
  - We are accepted in the Beloved today.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Becoming a Child of God

- Question: How does one become a child of God?
- Key Text: Galatians 3:26 – “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Faith and Exchange)

- **Not Hereditary:** Sonship is not passed from parents nor achieved by nationality.
- **By Faith:**
  - Not just intellectual assent to history.
  - A transaction of the heart, trusting wholly in Christ’s righteousness.
- **The Exchange:**
  - By faith, we exchange our poverty for His wealth and our sin for His righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”).

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Beggar and the Prince:**
  - A beggar has no right to enter a royal palace.
  - If the King’s son takes the beggar by the hand and says, “He is with me,” the beggar enters on the son's merits.
- **The Lesson:**
  - We enter the family of God holding the hand of Jesus by faith.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Faith and the New Birth

- Question: What is said of him who has faith in Christ?
- Key Text: 1 John 5:1 – “Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points (Regeneration)

- **Connecting Faith and Birth:**
  - True faith is the conduit for the new birth.
  - You cannot truly believe in Jesus as Messiah without the Spirit performing a miracle in the soul.
- **Regeneration (The New Birth):**
  - A supernatural work of the Holy Spirit (John 3:3 – “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”).
  - A change from being self-centered to being God-centered.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Living Faith Included

- Question: But what does living faith in Christ include?
- Key Text: James 2:26 – “For as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points (Faith and Works Balance)

- **Root and Fruit:**
  - We are not saved *by* works, but we are not saved *without* the works that follow faith.
- **Dead Faith:**
  - A profession of religion with no change in behavior or love.
  - It is like a corpse (“body without the spirit”).
- **Living Faith:**
  - Real faith works by love and purifies the soul (Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”).

## Slide 20 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Fruit Tree:**
  - A tree does not produce apples to *become* an apple tree.
  - It produces apples because it *is* an apple tree.
  - If a tree never produces leaves or fruit, it is dead at the roots.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Works are the visible proof of the life flowing through the roots of faith.

## Slide 21 – Q8: Effectual Faith

- Question: When is faith effectual?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:22 – “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points (Prayer and Obedience)

- **Faith is a Relationship:**
  - There is a direct link between obedience and confidence in prayer.
  - Cherishing sin cuts off the channel of blessing (Psalm 66:18 – “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.”).
- **Pleasing Him:**
  - The justified believer delights to do God’s will.
  - The law is written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”).

## Slide 23 – Q8: Application (Sanctuary Connection)

- **The Altar of Incense:**
  - Represents the prayers of the saints.
  - Situated directly before the veil of the Most Holy Place, where the Law of God was kept in the Ark.
- **Lesson:**
  - In the sanctuary service, Prayer and the Law are close companions.

## Slide 24 – Q9: Maintaining Living Faith

- Question: Is it necessary to do the things that we know are pleasing to God in order to maintain living faith?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:20, 21 – “For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points (Conscience and Confidence)

- **The Condemning Heart:**
  - Knowing violation of God's will paralyzes faith.
  - We cannot come “boldly to the throne of grace” (Hebrews 4:16) while holding onto sin.
- **God’s Greatness:**
  - God knows the difference between a struggling heart and a rebellious one.
- **Victory:**
  - To maintain living faith, we must claim Christ's power to overcome known sin.

## Slide 26 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Broken Vase:**
  - A child who breaks a vase and hides the pieces feels fearful and shy around his father.
  - The secret strains the relationship.
  - Once confessed and forgiven, the child runs to the father with confidence again.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Obedience and a clear conscience restore boldness in faith.

## Slide 27 – Q10: Justification and the Law

- Question: But still, will keeping the law justify anyone? If not, why not?
- Key Text: Romans 3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points (Legalism Cannot Save)

- **Function of the Law:**
  - It is a mirror to reveal defects, not to remove them.
  - A mirror shows a dirty face but cannot wash it.
- **Why the Law Cannot Justify:**
  1. **Past Sins:** Future obedience cannot pay for past crimes.
  2. **Fallen Nature:** Even our “best” works are tainted (Isaiah 64:6 – “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags...”).
- **Justification Definition:**
  - God’s legal declaration that a sinner is righteous based solely on Christ’s merits.

## Slide 29 – Q11: How We Are Justified

- Question: How are we justified?
- Key Text: Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 30 – Q11: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Instrument:** Faith is the hand that accepts the gift.
- **The Result:** Peace with God—reconciliation instead of enmity.
- **The Source:** “Through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
  - His perfect life satisfied the law’s precept.
  - His sacrificial death satisfied the law’s penalty.
- **Application:**
  - We have peace because Christ has conquered. From this platform of peace, we go on to conquer sin in His power.

## Slide 31 – Q12: Condition Before Justification

- Question: In what condition were we before being justified?
- Key Text: Romans 7:9 – “For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Key Points (Conviction of Sin)

- **Alive Without the Law:** Paul felt self-righteous before understanding the law’s spiritual depth (like the 10th commandment).
- **The Commandment Came:** The Holy Spirit applied the law to the conscience.
- **I Died:**
  - Self-confidence was shattered.
  - This “death” to self-righteousness is necessary before regeneration.
  - You cannot be saved until you realize you are lost.

## Slide 33 – Q13: Removing Condemnation

- Question: How does God take away condemnation?
- Key Text: Ephesians 2:5 – “Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ.”

## Slide 34 – Q13: Key Points (Quickened by Grace)

- **Quickened:** Means “made alive.”
- **Together with Christ:**
  - Just as God raised Jesus from the dead, He raises the believer from spiritual death.
  - Grace meets us in the grave of our sin.
- **Illustration:**
  - Lazarus in the tomb could not help himself.
  - Jesus spoke the word of life.
  - Regeneration is a miracle of resurrection power.

## Slide 35 – Q14: The Washing of Regeneration

- Question: What does the apostle, in another place call this quickening?
- Key Text: Titus 3:5 – “According to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points (Cleansing and Power)

- **Regeneration:** From Greek *palingenesia* (created again).
- **Washing:**
  - Cleansing from the guilt of past sins (symbolized by baptism/sanctuary laver).
- **Renewing of the Holy Ghost:**
  - Daily impartation of power to live a new life.
  - We must be refilled so we do not return to the mire of sin.

## Slide 37 – Q15: Evidence of Regeneration

- Question: What is one evidence of regeneration?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:14 – “We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.”

## Slide 38 – Q15: Key Points (Love vs. Selfishness)

- **The Shift:**
  - The natural heart is selfish.
  - The regenerated heart possesses the love of Christ.
- **The Test:**
  - Harboring hatred or indifference means we “abide in death.”
  - The fruit of the Spirit is love (Galatians 5:22).

## Slide 39 – Q15: Illustration

- **Magnetized Iron:**
  - Cold iron has no attraction to other iron.
  - If you run electricity through it, it becomes a magnet and draws others.
- **The Lesson:**
  - When the “electricity” of the Holy Spirit enters a man, he naturally draws near to and loves the brethren.

## Slide 40 – Q16: Before the Fall

- Question: Before man's fall, to what did he especially have access?
- Key Text: Genesis 2:9 – “And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden.”

## Slide 41 – Q16: Key Points (Conditional Immortality)

- **The Tree of Life:**
  - The medium through which God sustained human immortality.
- **Conditional Life:**
  - Humans are not inherently immortal; only God is (1 Timothy 6:16 – “Who only hath immortality...”).
  - Adam’s life depended on obedience and access to this tree.

## Slide 42 – Q17: After Transgression

- Question: After Adam transgressed, what was done to him?
- Key Text: Genesis 3:24 – “So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.”

## Slide 43 – Q17: Key Points (Mercy in Judgment)

- **Access Denied:** Man was cut off from the source of endless life.
- **An Act of Mercy:**
  - To allow a sinner to eat would be to immortalize sin.
  - God would not permit an eternal sinner to exist in misery.
  - Therefore, man became subject to death.

## Slide 44 – Q18: The Cursed Ground

- Question: What was cursed because of the fall?
- Key Text: Genesis 3:17 – “Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.”

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points (Cosmic Regeneration Needed)

- **Effect of Sin:**
  - Not limited to human nature; it infected physical creation.
  - Thorns, thistles, and decay are results of the curse.
- **Scope of Salvation:**
  - Biblical regeneration involves the healing of the earth itself, not just the saving of souls.

## Slide 46 – Q19: The Lost Inheritance

- Question: In the sin of our first parents, to whom did they yield their inheritance?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 2:19 – “While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.”

## Slide 47 – Q19: Key Points (Spiritual Law of Bondage)

- **The Principle:** You are the slave of the one you choose to obey (Romans 6:16).
- **The Lost Dominion:**
  - Adam originally had dominion (Genesis 1:26).
  - By obeying Satan, Adam surrendered that dominion.
  - Satan became the “god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4:4).

## Slide 48 – Q20: Satan’s Claim

- Question: After the fall of man, did the earth pass into the hands of Satan?
- Key Text: Luke 4:5, 6 – “And the Devil, taking Him [Jesus] up into a high mountain, showed unto Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, And the Devil said unto Him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will, I give it.”

## Slide 49 – Q20: Key Points (The Usurper)

- **Satan’s Claim:** Jesus did not dispute that the kingdoms had been “delivered” to Satan.
- **The Usurper:** Satan currently holds sway through the agency of sin.
- **Christ’s Role:** He came as the “Second Adam” to win back the territory the first Adam lost.

## Slide 50 – Q21: Restoration of the Possession

- Question: Will the possession purchased by the blood of Christ, be restored again to man?
- Key Text: Ephesians 1:13, 14 – “In whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest [pledge] of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory.”

## Slide 51 – Q21: Key Points (The Purchased Possession)

- **The Possession:** The earth itself, originally given to man.
- **The Earnest:** The Holy Spirit is the “down payment” guaranteeing full restoration.
- **Future Hope:**
  - Redemption includes the resurrection of the body (Romans 8:23).
  - It includes the restoration of the physical world.

## Slide 52 – Q21: Application (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Sanctuary Cleansing:**
  - On the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), the physical sanctuary itself was cleansed.
  - This points to God cleansing the entire universe from the record and effects of sin.

## Slide 53 – Q22: Cleansing by Fire

- Question: But in redeeming the possession, the earth, as well as man, must be cleansed from the curse. How will this be done? and what will be the result?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 3:12, 13 – “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”

## Slide 54 – Q22: Key Points (The Final Cleansing)

- **The Cleansing Fire:**
  - As water cleansed the old world (Flood), fire will cleanse the present world.
  - This fire eradicates sin, Satan, death, and the curse (Malachi 4:1–3).
- **The Result:**
  - God re-creates a “New Earth” from the purified ashes.
  - It will be the home of righteousness.

## Slide 55 – Q23: Timing of Regeneration

- Question: When will the regeneration of the earth take place?
- Key Text: Matthew 19:28 – “And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”

- Question: Will the earth ever be cursed again, when once redeemed?
- Key Text: Revelation 22:3 – “And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him.”

## Slide 60 – Q25: Key Points (Eternal Security)

- **Security:** “Affliction shall not rise up the second time” (Nahum 1:9).
- **Why?**
  - The redeemed have seen the cost of sin (the Cross) and the result of sin (history).
  - They are immune to sin because they love God supremely.

- **Character of the Redeemed:**
  - They “do His commandments.”
  - This describes those washed, regenerated, and sanctified by the Lamb.
  - Because they are restored to harmony with God’s law, they can safely live forever.

## Slide 63 – Q26: Illustration

- **The Circle of Scripture:**
  - The Bible begins in Eden: No sin, Tree of Life accessible, God with man.
  - The circle is broken by sin.
  - Through the Cross, the line curves back to close the circle in Revelation.
  - **The End:** Eden restored, no sin, Tree of Life accessible, and “God himself shall be with them” (Revelation 21:3).
