## Slide 1 – Q1: The Nature of Man

- Question: When man had been created from the dust, what did he become?
- Key Text: Genesis 2:7 – “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the
  ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
  living soul.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Divine Equation

- The Bible does not say man _was given_ a soul as a separate entity.
- The Bible says man **became** a living soul.
- **The Equation:**
  - Dust of the Ground (Body/Lifeless matter)
  - **+** Breath of Life (Life-giving spirit/spark from God)
  - **=** A Living Soul (A living person)
- **Defining Terms:**
  - **Soul (_Nephesh_):** A living being, creature, or person; the whole
    individual.
  - **Breath of Life (_Neshamah_):** The power of God that animates the clay;
    not a conscious ghost.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Sanctuary & Grace)

- Just as Adam was lifeless dust without God’s breath, we are spiritually dead
  in sin without the Holy Spirit.
- **Justification:** Puts us in right standing, like the formed body ready for
  life.
  - Ephesians 2:1 – “And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
    sins.”
- **Sanctification:** The daily in-breathing of the life of Christ, enabling
  obedience.
  - Acts 17:28 – “For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
    also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Light Bulb Analogy:**
  - **The Bulb:** Represents the body (dust).
  - **The Electricity:** Represents the breath of life.
  - **The Light:** Represents the soul.
- **The Result:**
  - The light is not a separate object hiding inside the glass.
  - It is the result of the union between bulb and power.
  - If power is cut, the light does not "go" somewhere; it ceases to exist until
    power is restored.
  - So it is with the soul: Dust + Breath = Living Soul.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Soul in the Animal Kingdom

- Question: To what other order of beings is the term soul applied?
- Key Text: Numbers 31:28 – “And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war
  which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and
  of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Mortality & Value)

- **Universal Terminology:**
  - Scripture applies the word "soul" to cattle, donkeys, and sheep.
  - This confirms a "soul" is simply a living, breathing creature.
- **No Natural Immortality:**
  - If "soul" meant immortal essence, then animals would be immortal.
  - Both man and beast are subject to death.
  - Ecclesiastes 3:19 – “For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth
    beasts... as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one
    breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.”
- **The Value of a Human Soul:**
  - Unlike animals, man was created in the **image of God** (Genesis 1:27).
  - Value is realized at the Cross: Galatians 3:13 – “Christ hath redeemed us
    from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written,
    Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Death of the Soul

- Question: Is the term "living souls" applied to anything besides man and
  beast?
- Key Text: Revelation 16:3 – “And the second angel poured out his vial upon the
  sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in
  the sea.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Mortality)

- **Consistency of Scripture:**
  - Even sea creatures are "living souls."
  - When the breath of life leaves the body, the soul dies.
- **Explicit Statement:**
  - The text says, "every living soul **died**."
  - This contradicts the theory that the soul is naturally immortal.
- **Immortality Belongs to God:**
  - 1 Timothy 6:16 – “Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no
    man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour
    and power everlasting. Amen.”
- **Immortality is a Gift:**
  - It is sought for and received at the resurrection.
  - Romans 2:7 – “To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for
    glory and honour and immortality, eternal life.”

## Slide 9 – Q4: Physical & Spiritual Thirst

- Question: Can a soul suffer thirst?
- Key Text: Proverbs 25:25 – “As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news
  from a far country.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points (Needs of the Soul)

- **Physical Reality:**
  - An immaterial spirit does not need water.
  - A "soul" (a living person) has physical longings.
- **Spiritual Application:**
  - The awakened conscience thirsts for righteousness.
  - We are dry ground; we cannot generate righteousness ourselves.
  - John 7:37 – “In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and
    cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.”
- **The Good News:**
  - The Gospel is the "good news from a far country" (heaven).
  - It quenches the thirst of the guilty conscience with forgiveness.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Hunger & Diligence

- Question: May it also suffer hunger?
- Key Text: Proverbs 19:15 – “Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an
  idle soul shall suffer hunger.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points (Work & Faith)

- **The Whole Person:**
  - Attributes of the body (hunger) are attributed to the soul because the soul
    _is_ the person.
  - 2 Thessalonians 3:10 – “For even when we were with you, this we commanded
    you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.”
- **Spiritual Slothfulness:**
  - Holiness is not achieved in "deep sleep."
  - While saved by grace, faith must work.
  - Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
    thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”
  - An "idle soul" who neglects the Word suffers spiritual famine.

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Soul and the Sanctuary

- Question: Is it capable of eating?
- Key Text: Leviticus 7:20 – “But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the
  sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having his
  uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points (Cleansing)

- **Sanctuary Context:**
  - The "soul" here is the worshiper.
  - Partaking of holy things while defiled leads to being "cut off."
- **The Necessity of Cleansing:**
  - We cannot cleanse ourselves; we must be washed by God.
  - Zechariah 13:1 – “In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house
    of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - True faith involves a cleansing of the heart, not just a legal fiction.
  - Acts 15:9 – “And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
    hearts by faith.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Muddy Guest:**
  - Imagine a guest arriving at a royal banquet covered in mud.
  - He sits and eats without washing, insulting the host and the purity of the
    meal.
- **Lesson:**
  - We cannot partake of Christ’s blessings while clinging to cherished sin.
  - We must submit to His cleansing power.

## Slide 16 – Q7: Physical Vulnerability

- Question: Can it be injured?
- Key Text: Joshua 11:11 – “And they smote all the souls that were therein with
  the edge of the sword.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points

- **Tangible Nature:**
  - An immaterial spirit cannot be cut with a sword.
  - Souls were "smitten," proving a soul is a flesh-and-blood person.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - In a world of sin, souls are subject to violence and death.
  - We look forward to the New Earth where violence ceases.
  - Isaiah 60:18 – “Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
    destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and
    thy gates Praise.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Wages of Sin

- Question: Can the soul die?
- Key Text: Ezekiel 18:4 – “Behold, all souls are Mine, as the soul of the
  father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall
  die.”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points (Mortality & Gospel)

- **Definitive Truth:**
  - The soul is not immortal. "The soul that sinneth, it **shall die**."
  - Satan’s first lie was "Ye shall not surely die" (Genesis 3:4); God says the
    opposite.
- **The Need for Atonement:**
  - The penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23).
  - Every human is under this sentence.
- **Substitution:**
  - We need a Substitute to die in our place.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
    live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

## Slide 20 – Q9: The Soul of Christ

- Question: What is said of the soul of Christ?
- Key Text: Isaiah 53:12 – “Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the
  great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong; because He hath poured
  out His soul unto death.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points (Atonement)

- **The Nature of the Sacrifice:**
  - Jesus did not just lend His body; He **poured out His soul unto death**.
  - He experienced the full wages of sin for us.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no
    sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”
- **Sanctuary Fulfillment:**
  - The Lamb’s life (soul) was in the blood and had to be poured out (Leviticus
    17:11).
  - Christ fulfilled this, conquering the grave to "divide the spoil."

## Slide 22 – Q10: Destiny at Death

- Question: What becomes of the soul at death?
- Key Text: Psalm 89:48 – “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?
  Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points (State of the Dead)

- **The Destination:**
  - The soul goes to the grave (_Sheol_), not heaven or a place of torment.
- **Reverse Creation:**
  - Creation: Dust + Breath = Living Soul.
  - Death: Dust returns to earth; Breath returns to God; Soul ceases.
  - Psalm 146:4 – “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
    very day his thoughts perish.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Phone Image:**
  - When a phone screen is on, an image exists.
  - If the phone is smashed, the image is gone.
  - The image doesn't float away; it depends on the hardware to exist.
- **Lesson:**
  - The resurrection is God "restoring the file" in a new, glorified body.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Christ in the Grave

- Question: Where did Christ's soul go at His death?
- Key Text: Acts 2:31 – “He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of
  Christ, that His soul was not left in hell, neither His flesh did see
  corruption.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (Resurrection Hope)

- **Christ in _Hades_:**
  - "Hell" here means _Hades_ (the grave).
  - Christ rested in the tomb; He did not go to a place of fire.
- **Victory Over Death:**
  - His soul was not **left** there.
  - 1 Corinthians 15:20 – “But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
    firstfruits of them that slept.”
  - Because He rose, we have assurance that we will not be left in the grave.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Conclusion

- **Mortal to Immortal:**
  - We are mortal souls, made of dust.
  - By faith in Christ, we pass from death to life.
  - We await the resurrection for immortality.
  - 1 Corinthians 15:53 – “For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and
    this mortal must put on immortality.”
