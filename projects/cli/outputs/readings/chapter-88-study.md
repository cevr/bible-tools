Here is a Bible study regarding the subject of Sunday Sacredness and the Sabbath in the New Testament, written from the perspective of the historic Seventh-day Adventist pioneers.

# Sunday Sacredness and the New Testament

**Theme:** An examination of every reference to the "first day of the week" in the New Testament to determine if the Sabbath was ever changed or abrogated.

**Theological Focus:** The immutability of God’s Law, the consistency of the Apostles’ practice, and the nature of true obedience through faith.

### Q1. In what part of the New Testament is found the first day of the week?
**“In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.” (Matthew 28:1)**

**Answer:**
This text is the first of eight instances in the New Testament where the "first day of the week" (Sunday) is mentioned. It provides a crucial foundation for understanding the relationship between the Sabbath and Sunday after the Cross.

1.  **The Distinction of Days:** Matthew, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit several years after the resurrection, makes a clear distinction. He refers to the seventh day as "the Sabbath" and the following day simply as "the first day of the week."
2.  **No Change Recorded:** If the sanctity of the Sabbath had been transferred to the first day at the resurrection, Matthew would have been the ideal witness to record it. Instead, he preserves the title "Sabbath" for the day preceding Sunday.
3.  **God's Law Remains:** The death of Christ did not abolish the moral law. **Righteousness by Faith** does not void the law but establishes it (Romans 3:31). The believer, justified by Christ's blood, looks to the law not as a method of salvation, but as the standard of God's character. The Sabbath remains the "sign" of the God who sanctifies us (Exodus 31:13).

*   **Definition—Sabbath:** The seventh day of the week, set apart by God at Creation as a day of rest and holy worship (Genesis 2:2–3; Exodus 20:8–11).
*   **Definition—First Day:** The day following the Sabbath, now known as Sunday; biblically treated as a working day.

**[ILL]** Imagine a man dies and leaves a Last Will and Testament. Once the testator dies, no one can add to or subtract from that Will (Galatians 3:15). Jesus sealed the new covenant with His blood on Friday. If He had intended to change the Sabbath to Sunday, He must have done so *before* He died. Since He did not, the command remains unchanged in the New Covenant.

### Q2. Where is the first day next mentioned?
**“And when the Sabbath was past,... very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun.” (Mark 16:1, 2)**

**Answer:**
Mark, writing perhaps thirty years after the resurrection, maintains the exact same distinction as Matthew.

1.  **"When the Sabbath was Past":** This phrase proves that the Sabbath and the first day are two distinct days. The holy time of the Sabbath ended before the first day began.
2.  **A Common Day:** The women came to do work—anointing the body—which they would not do on the Sabbath. This indicates that the disciples and the gospel writers regarded Sunday as a day appropriate for labor, not as a new Sabbath.
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the law was placed inside the Ark of the Covenant. In the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ now ministers, that same law resides (Revelation 11:19). Just as the earthly type could not be altered by man, the heavenly reality—including the fourth commandment—remains strictly intact.

### Q3. On what day was Jesus raised from the dead?
**“Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.” (Mark 16:9)**

**Answer:**
It is an undisputed historical fact that Christ rose on the first day of the week. However, the study is not about which day He rose, but about which day He commanded us to keep holy.

1.  **The Event vs. The Command:** The Bible records the crucifixion on Friday, the rest in the tomb on Sabbath, and the resurrection on Sunday. While the resurrection is the crowning act of redemption, nowhere does Scripture command that the day of the event should be observed as a sabbath.
2.  **Memorial of Resurrection:** The Bible gives us a specific memorial for the resurrection, but it is not a day of the week. It is **Baptism** and the walk in "newness of life" (Romans 6:4).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We honor the resurrection not by resting on Sunday, but by dying to sin and rising to live a holy life through the power of the indwelling Christ (Galatians 2:20). The power that raised Jesus from the dead is the same power that raises us from the death of sin to the life of obedience.

### Q4. On what day was Christ laid in the tomb?
**“This man [Joseph] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.” (Luke 23:52–54)**

**Answer:**
This text establishes the sequence of days in the passion week:
1.  **The Preparation Day:** This is Friday, the day Christ died.
2.  **The Sabbath:** The day Christ rested in the tomb (Saturday).
3.  **The First Day:** The day Christ rose (Sunday).

This sequence confirms that the Sabbath is the day *between* Friday and Sunday.

---

### Q5. What did the holy women do, after seeing where He was laid?
**“And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.” (Luke 23:56)**

**Answer:**
This is one of the most significant texts regarding the Sabbath in the New Testament.

1.  **"According to the Commandment":** These women, who loved Jesus intimately, would not violate the Law of God even to embalm the Lord's body. Their obedience was not a burden; it was the result of a heart in tune with God.
2.  **Written After the Cross:** Luke wrote this gospel decades after the cross. He does not say they rested according to the "old Jewish custom," but "according to the commandment." This implies the commandment was still in force for the Christian church at the time of his writing.
3.  **The Nature of True Obedience:** This illustrates **Righteousness by Faith**. These women did not rest to *earn* salvation; they had already found the Savior. They rested because grace leads to obedience (Romans 1:5). The law written in the heart (Hebrews 8:10) causes the believer to delight in God's law (Romans 7:22), keeping the Sabbath not as a legalistic duty, but as a love-response to the Creator.

*   **Definition—Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit imparts the righteousness of Christ to the believer, resulting in obedience to God’s commandments (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 1 Peter 1:15–16).

---

### Q6. What work did they postpone till the first day because they would not do it on the Sabbath?
**“Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.” (Luke 24:1)**

**Answer:**
1.  **Secular Work on Sunday:** The "work" of carrying spices and embalming a body was considered inappropriate for the Sabbath, but perfectly acceptable for the first day of the week.
2.  **Inspiration’s Testimony:** The Holy Spirit, speaking through Luke, categorizes the first day of the week as a day for labor and travel, in direct contrast to the holy stillness of the Sabbath.

**[ILL]** If a governor declares a "Public Holiday," all government offices close. If you go to the office the next day, it is a "business day." The women treated the Sabbath as the King’s Holiday, and Sunday as a regular business day to resume their work.

### Q7. How does John speak of these events?
**“The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher.” (John 20:1)**

**Answer:**
John wrote his gospel very late, likely around 97 A.D., at the close of the first century.
1.  **No Sacred Title:** If the church had been keeping Sunday holy for 60 years, John would surely have called it "The Lord's Day" or "The Christian Sabbath." Instead, he uses the plain, secular title: "the first day of the week."
2.  **Consistency:** All four Gospel writers (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) agree. There is no hint of a change.

---

### Q8. What took place in the evening of that same first day?
**“Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.” (John 20:19)**

**Answer:**
This text is often cited as evidence of the first Sunday worship service. However, the context refutes this.
1.  **The Reason for Assembly:** The text explicitly says they were assembled "for fear of the Jews," not to celebrate the resurrection. At this point, they did not even believe He had risen (Mark 16:11-14).
2.  **Common Setting:** They were hiding behind locked doors in a private dwelling.
3.  **Christ’s Ministry:** Jesus comes to them to dispel their fear and offer peace. In the Christian walk, Jesus often meets us in our confusion and fear. This meeting was to prove His identity, not to inaugurate a new holy day.

---

### Q9. Had Jesus previously appeared to some of His disciples?
**“He appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.” (Mark 16:12)**

**Answer:**
This refers to the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13–32).
1.  **Sunday Travel:** These disciples walked roughly seven miles from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the first day of the week. Jesus walked with them.
2.  **No Rebuke:** Jesus explained the Scriptures to them but did not rebuke them for traveling on a holy day (as would have been appropriate if Sunday were the new Sabbath).
3.  **Sanctuary Truth:** Jesus showed them from Moses and the prophets (the Word) the necessity of His sacrifice—the antitype of the sanctuary sacrifices.

---

### Q10. When they went and told the others who were assembled, how did they receive the news?
**“And they went and told it unto the residue; neither believed they them.” (Mark 16:13)**

**Answer:**
This confirms that the assembly in the upper room was not a gathering of faith to celebrate the resurrection. It was a gathering of grieving, frightened men who refused to believe the testimony that Jesus was alive. One cannot celebrate a resurrection one does not believe in.

---

### Q11. When Jesus afterward met the eleven, what did He say to them?
**“Afterward He appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen.” (Mark 16:14)**

**Answer:**
1.  **The Rebuke:** Jesus "upbraided" (scolded or reproached) them. Why? Not for failing to keep Sunday holy, but for "unbelief."
2.  **The Lesson:** Salvation and righteousness are accessed only by **faith**. Their "hardness of heart" prevented them from grasping the glorious truth of the gospel.
3.  **No Inauguration:** A meeting characterized by fear, unbelief, and a rebuke from the Lord cannot be twisted into the inauguration of a new Sabbath day.

---

### Q12. Did Christ appear to the eleven while the two who had seen Him at Emmaus were relating their experience?
**“And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon... And as they thus spake, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.” (Luke 24:33–36)**

**Answer:**
This provides the timeline. The appearance in the upper room happened immediately after the two disciples returned from Emmaus. It was late Sunday night.

---

### Q13. Were the disciples here assembled to partake of the communion?
**“And while they believed not for joy, and wondered, He said unto them, Have ye here any meat? And they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. And He took it, and did eat before them.” (Luke 24:41–43)**

**Answer:**
1.  **Not the Lord's Supper:** They were eating a common evening meal (fish and honeycomb). There is no mention of bread and wine, or the symbols of the new covenant.
2.  **Physical Proof:** Jesus ate to prove He was not a spirit or ghost, but a resurrected physical being.
3.  **Secular Time:** By Bible reckoning (sunset to sunset), Sunday night is actually the beginning of the *second* day of the week (Monday). However, even by Roman reckoning, this was a common meal, not a religious liturgy.

---

### Q14. Where did the disciples live when in Jerusalem?
**“And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.” (Acts 1:13)**

**Answer:**
1.  **Domestic Residence:** The "upper room" was their living quarters ("where abode Peter...").
2.  **Context:** Jesus met them in their home. He came to them where they lived.
3.  **Application:** Jesus desires to enter our homes and our common lives, not just meet us in a sanctuary. However, His presence in a home does not make that day a Sabbath, any more than His presence in a boat or on a mountain made those places or times legal sabbaths.

---

### Q15. When did the Saviour next meet with His disciples?
**“And after eight days, again His disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.” (John 20:26)**

**Answer:**
1.  **"After Eight Days":** In Jewish inclusive reckoning, "after three days" can mean the third day. However, "after eight days" from a Sunday would logically place this meeting on the following Monday or perhaps the next Sunday. The text is indefinite.
2.  **No Pattern Established:** Even if this were the next Sunday, the text notes that the doors were still shut (implying continued fear, not public worship).
3.  **Missing Sundays:** Between the resurrection and the ascension (40 days), Jesus appeared only occasionally. He did not meet with them every Sunday to establish a pattern.

**[ILL]** If a CEO holds a meeting on Monday the 1st, and another meeting on Monday the 8th, does that make Monday a corporate holiday? No. It just means they had two meetings. Without a corporate decree (a commandment), the status of the day remains unchanged.

### Q16. On what day did Paul once meet with the brethren at Troas?
**“And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.” (Acts 20:7)**

**Answer:**
This is the only instance in the New Testament of a religious meeting held on the first day of the week.
1.  **Jewish Reckoning:** The biblical day begins at sunset. A meeting on the "first day" that continues until "midnight" must be held on what we call **Saturday night**.
2.  **Farewell Meeting:** The context shows Paul was "ready to depart on the morrow." He was leaving for a long journey. This was a special farewell gathering, not a regular weekly service.
3.  **Breaking Bread:** This phrase was used for common meals (Acts 2:46) as well as the Lord's Supper. Even if it were the Lord's Supper, the New Testament says we show the Lord's death "as often as ye eat this bread" (1 Cor 11:26), without limiting it to a specific day.

---

### Q17. At what time of day was this meeting held?
**“And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.” (Acts 20:8)**

**Answer:**
The mention of "many lights" confirms this was a night meeting. According to the biblical calendar, the dark part of the first day of the week is Saturday night. Sunday morning and afternoon are the *light* part of the first day.
Therefore, this meeting occurred after the Sabbath had closed at sunset on Saturday.

### Q18. How many accompanied Paul on his journey into Asia on this occasion?
**“And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.” (Acts 20:4)**

**Answer:**
Paul had a large retinue of companions. This detail is important because their actions (recorded in the next verses) reflect the practice of the apostolic church.

---

### Q19. While Paul was walking across the peninsula (nineteen and one half miles) to Assos, what were his companions doing?
**“And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.” (Acts 20:13)**

**Answer:**
1.  **Sunday Travel:** On Sunday morning (the light part of the first day), while Paul walked 19 miles overland, his companions sailed a ship to Assos.
2.  **Common Labor:** Sailing a ship and hiking 19 miles is hard physical labor.
3.  **Paul's Example:** The great apostle to the Gentiles did not consider Sunday sacred. He used it as a travel day. If Paul believed Sunday was the new Sabbath, he would have spent it in rest and worship, not hiking across a peninsula.

*   **Note:** This conclusively shows that Acts 20:7 cannot be used to support Sunday sacredness. The meeting was Saturday night; the travel was Sunday morning.

### Q20. What did Paul tell the Corinthian church to do on Sunday?
**“Upon the first day of the week let everyone of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.” (1 Corinthians 16:2)**

**Answer:**
This text is often used to suggest a Sunday collection plate, but the Greek text suggests otherwise.
1.  **"Lay by him in store":** The Greek phrase is *par' heauto* ("by himself" or "at home").
2.  **Private Accounting:** Paul is instructing the believers to set aside money *at home* on Sunday morning, after they have calculated their earnings from the previous week.
3.  **Reason:** He wanted the funds ready so there would be "no gatherings" (collections) when he arrived. He wanted the fundraising done beforehand.
4.  **No Public Meeting:** There is no mention of a church service here. It is an instruction for private, individual bookkeeping.

---

### Q21. What was the collection for?
**“Now concerning the collection of the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.” (1 Corinthians 16:1)**

**Answer:**
The collection was for the poor believers in Jerusalem (Romans 15:26). It was a specific project, not a tithe or a regular weekly church offering. This reinforces that the instruction was a practical logistical arrangement, not the institution of a new day of worship.

---

### Q22. When was John in the Spirit?
**“I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.” (Revelation 1:10)**

**Answer:**
John mentions "the Lord's day," but he does not say which day of the week it is in this verse. To define it, we must look to other scriptures. We cannot assume it means Sunday simply because modern culture calls it that.

*   **Definition—Biblical Interpretation:** We must compare Scripture with Scripture (Isaiah 28:10). We must let the Bible define its own terms.

---

### Q23. What day has God called His?
**“If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day...” (Isaiah 58:13)**

**Answer:**
1.  **"My Holy Day":** God explicitly calls the Sabbath "My holy day." He never applies this title to any other day of the week.
2.  **Commandment:** The Fourth Commandment says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the **Lord thy God**" (Exodus 20:10).
3.  **Deduction:** If the Sabbath is the Lord's holy day, then the "Lord's Day" of Revelation 1:10 must be the Sabbath.

---

### Q24. Of what day has Christ claimed to be Lord?
**“Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28)**

**Answer:**
Here is the final conclusion of the matter:
1.  **Christ is Lord:** Jesus made the worlds (John 1:1–3). He is the Creator.
2.  **Lord of the Sabbath:** As Creator, He instituted the Sabbath. As Redeemer, He kept it. He claims Lordship over it.
3.  **The True Lord's Day:** Since Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath, the Sabbath is the Lord's Day.

**Conclusion:**
Throughout the New Testament—from Matthew to Revelation—there is not a single command to keep Sunday holy. There is not a single instance of the title "holy" being applied to Sunday. The disciples worked on it (Luke 24:1), traveled on it (Acts 20:13), and kept their accounts on it (1 Cor 16:2).

God's plan for **Righteousness by Faith** involves writing His law—not a changed law, but His original eternal law—upon our hearts. The Sabbath remains the sign of allegiance to the Creator and the seal of His sanctifying power. By keeping the Sabbath, we rest in His finished work of Creation and Redemption, trusting not in our own works, but in the God who makes us holy.

**[ILL]** A mirror (the Law) shows us dirt on our face (sin). If we don't like the dirt, we don't smash the mirror or get a different one. We go to the water (Jesus) to be washed. Sunday sacredness attempts to change the mirror. The Sabbath keeper looks into God's unchanging law, sees his need, and flees to Christ for cleansing and power to obey.
