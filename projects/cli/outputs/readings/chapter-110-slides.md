## Slide 1 – Q1: The Promise to the Thief

- **Question:** In answering the petition of the thief on the cross, what promise did the Saviour make him?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:43 – “And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Assurance and Justification

- **The Assurance of Acceptance:**
  - The thief had no time for good works, baptism, or sacrifices; he was helpless.
  - His salvation proves the doctrine of **Justification by Faith**.
  - **Justification:** God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous solely because of Christ’s merits.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”
  - Romans 3:28 – “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Certainty and Righteousness by Faith

- **The Certainty of the Promise:**
  - Jesus used the word “Verily” (truly/assuredly).
  - The promise relied on Christ’s power to save, not the thief’s past.
  - Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The thief looked to the Lamb of God, just as Israel looked to the serpent.
  - John 3:14–15 – “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.”
  - By faith, he laid hold of Christ's righteousness and was fitted for heaven.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Helpless Debtor:**
  - Imagine a man with a debt of millions thrown into prison, unable to pay.
  - A wealthy King pays the full debt and opens the door.
  - The prisoner did not “earn” his release; he simply accepted the payment.
  - The thief was that debtor: he brought nothing but his need, and Christ supplied everything.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Tree of Life

- **Question:** What noted tree is in Paradise?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 2:7 – “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Restoration and Victory

- **Restoration of What Was Lost:**
  - Adam and Eve lost access to the tree of life due to sin (Genesis 3:24 – “So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.”).
  - Paradise is the restoration of the lost Eden.
- **The Condition of Overcoming:**
  - The right to the tree is for “him that overcometh.”
  - Victory comes through the “faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”).
  - It is victory over sin through Christ’s indwelling power (1 John 5:4).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Sanctuary Connection

- **The Heavenly Sanctuary:**
  - Just as the budding rod of Aaron was kept in the earthly sanctuary (Numbers 17:8), the true Tree of Life is preserved in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - This places Paradise in the direct dwelling place of God.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Location of the Tree

- **Question:** By what river is the tree of life?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 22:1 – “And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.”
- **Key Text:** Revelation 22:2 – “In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life...”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Locating Paradise

- **Scripture Interprets Scripture:**
  1. The Tree of Life is in Paradise (Revelation 2:7).
  2. The Tree of Life is by the river coming from the **Throne of God** (Revelation 22:1–2).
  3. Therefore, **Paradise is where God’s Throne is** (the third heaven).
- **2 Corinthians 12:2, 4** – “I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago... caught up to the third heaven... How that he was caught up into paradise...”
- **Implication:**
  - Paradise is not a separate “waiting room” or “Abraham’s bosom.”
  - If Jesus went to Paradise on Friday, He must have gone to the Father’s Throne that very day.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Map:**
  - If one page of a map says the “Royal Oak Tree” is in the “King’s Garden”...
  - And another page says the “Royal Oak Tree” is directly in front of the “Palace”...
  - You know for a fact that the Garden and the Palace are in the same place.
  - Scripture maps Paradise directly to God’s Throne.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Resurrection Timeline

- **Question:** How long after Christ's crucifixion, did His resurrection take place?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:3 – “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;”
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:4 – “And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points & Sanctuary

- **The Timeline of Facts:**
  - **Friday:** Christ died and was buried.
  - **Sabbath:** He rested in the tomb.
  - **Sunday (Third Day):** He rose from the dead.
- **Significance of Burial:**
  - His body did not go to heaven on Friday; it was laid in Joseph’s tomb.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Christ died on the cross (the altar in the outer court/earth).
  - His ministry *within* the heavenly sanctuary began only after His resurrection, just as the High Priest took blood into the sanctuary *after* the sacrifice was slain.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Sunday Morning Statement

- **Question:** What did He say to Mary on the day of His resurrection?
- **Key Text:** John 20:17 – “Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Resolving the Conflict

- **The Conflict:**
  - If the promise meant “This Friday you will be in heaven,” Jesus must have gone there Friday.
  - But on Sunday morning, Jesus stated: **“I am not yet ascended to My Father.”**
- **The Harmony:**
  - Christ is the Truth and cannot lie (Titus 1:2 – “In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began”).
  - Therefore, Jesus was not in Paradise (God’s Throne) on Friday.
  - The promise must refer to *when* the assurance was given, not *when* they would arrive.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Locked House:**
  - If a father tells his son, “I promise you today, we will go to Disneyland,” but they stay home for three more days to finish work, did the father lie?
  - No. The promise was made *on that day*, but the trip happens later.
  - If Jesus had gone to heaven Friday, He would have contradicted His own words to Mary on Sunday.

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Thief’s Request

- **Question:** What was really the thief's request?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:42 – “And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Faith and The Kingdom

- **The Thief’s Theology:**
  - He did not ask to go to heaven immediately at death.
  - He looked forward to the time when Christ would come into His **Kingdom**.
- **Sanctification (The Mind of Christ):**
  - To the natural eye, Jesus was a dying criminal.
  - To the eye of faith, He was the Lord of Glory.
  - The thief saw through the shame and believed in the future reign of Christ.

## Slide 18 – Q7: The Time of Reunion

- **Question:** When had Christ said that He would take His followers to Himself?
- **Key Text:** John 14:3 – “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Preparation and Judgment

- **The Timing:**
  - Christ receives His people **“when I will come again,”** not at the moment of death.
- **Current Sanctuary Work:**
  - Christ is currently “preparing a place” in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1–2).
  - This involves the **Investigative Judgment** and final Atonement—blotting out sins so His people may stand faultless.
  - The reunion happens after this work is complete.

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Resurrection Hope

- **Question:** When and how will all the righteous, both living and dead, be with Christ?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first:”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Events and State of the Dead

- **Key Text Continued:**
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:17 – “Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”
- **The Order of Events:**
  1. Second Coming (Lord descends).
  2. Resurrection (Dead in Christ rise).
  3. Translation (Living caught up).
- **The Thief’s State:**
  - He is currently sleeping in the grave (Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing...”).
  - He waits for the trumpet call.
  - Immortality is given only at the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:53).

## Slide 22 – Q8: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Deep Sleep:**
  - When a patient undergoes surgery with anesthesia, they close their eyes.
  - Hours pass, but to their consciousness, the next instant is waking up in recovery.
  - Death for the believer is a sleep.
  - The thief closed his eyes on the cross; his very next conscious thought will be the joy of Resurrection morning.

## Slide 23 – Q9: Understanding "Today"

- **Question:** Why did Christ use the word "today" in His answer to the thief?
- **The Punctuation Problem:**
  - Original Greek had no punctuation (commas). Translators added them later.
  - **Option A:** “Verily I say unto thee, [comma] today shalt thou be...” (Implies immediate entry).
  - **Option B:** “Verily I say unto thee today, [comma] shalt thou be...” (Emphasizes the time of the promise).

## Slide 24 – Q9: The Power of the Promise

- **Why Emphasize “Today”?**
  - It was the darkest day in history. Jesus appeared defeated, rejected, and dying.
  - By saying “I say to thee *today*,” Jesus declared:
    - “Even now, while I hang on this cross...”
    - “Even now, when the world rejects Me...”
    - **“I assure you right now: You will be with Me in Paradise.”**
- **Biblical Consistency:**
  - Placing the comma after “today” harmonizes with John 20:17 (Resurrection) and 1 Thessalonians 4:16 (Second Coming).

## Slide 25 – Q9: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Courtroom Verdict:**
  - Imagine a judge sentencing a criminal.
  - If the governor calls and says, “I tell you today, you will be pardoned,” he means the pardon is certified *today*.
  - The prisoner may not walk out until next week, but the guarantee is secure.
  - Jesus certified the thief’s pardon on that dark Friday, guaranteeing a future glory.
