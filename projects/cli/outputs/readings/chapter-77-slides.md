## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Purpose for His Law

- **Question:** State the Lord's purpose concerning the law.
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 42:21 – “The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Magnifying the Law

- **The Character of God**
  - The law is a transcript of God’s character.
  - Malachi 3:6 – “For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.”
  - Since God is unchanging, His law—which defines righteousness—must also be unchanging (Psalm 119:172).
- **The Meaning of "Magnify"**
  - To magnify does not mean to make something larger than it is (distortion).
  - It means to reveal hidden detail, breadth, and glory.
  - Psalm 119:96 – “I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.”
- **Restoring Honor**
  - Christ came to strip away human burdens and traditions.
  - He revealed the law as a “law of liberty” (James 2:12).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Microscope**
  - If you look at a diamond with the naked eye, it looks beautiful.
  - If you place it under a microscope (magnify it), you do not create a new stone.
  - You simply reveal the depth, precision, and flawlessness that was already there but unseen.
  - **Application:** Christ’s life was the microscope that revealed the spiritual depth and beauty of God's law.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Necessity of Intervention

- **Question:** Why was it necessary to magnify the law?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 119:126 – “It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Making the Law Void

- **Rebellion and Neglect**
  - To make “void” means to treat as empty, null, or non-binding.
  - The carnal mind seeks to set aside God’s requirements (Romans 8:7).
- **The Result of Voiding the Law**
  - When the standard is removed, sin abounds.
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **The Great Controversy**
  - Satan’s primary attack is against the law of God.
  - He claims it cannot be kept or that it restricts freedom.
  - Christ came to refute this lie by living the law perfectly.

## Slide 6 – Q3: Traditions of Men

- **Question:** How was the law "made void" when Christ was on the earth?
- **Key Text:** Mark 7:9 – “And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Replacing God with Self

- **Evading Duty**
  - Christ did not find leaders keeping the law too strictly; He found them evading it.
  - Example: They used the “Corban” tradition to avoid caring for elderly parents, violating the command to honor father and mother.
- **Vain Worship**
  - Matthew 15:9 – “But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”
- **The Danger of Tradition**
  - Whenever culture or tradition is elevated above “Thus saith the Lord,” the law is effectively made void.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Painted Window**
  - Imagine a window meant to let in sunlight (God's Truth).
  - If men paint over the glass with their own pictures (Traditions), the window may look colorful, but it no longer lets in light.
  - The room remains dark.
  - **Application:** Christ came to scrape away the paint of tradition so the clear light of the Law could shine again.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Christ’s Attitude

- **Question:** What was Christ's attitude toward the law?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:17 – “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points on Fulfillment

- **Destroy vs. Fulfill**
  - “Fulfill” (*pleroo*) means to "fill to the full" or "fill up with meaning."
  - It is the opposite of "empty" or "destroy."
- **Living Example**
  - A baptismal vow is “fulfilled” when it is kept, not when it is deleted.
  - Christ fulfilled the moral law by obeying it perfectly.
- **Prophetic Fulfillment**
  - Colossians 2:17 – “Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.”
  - Ceremonial laws (sacrifices) met their end at the cross; the moral law was established forever.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Architect's Blueprint**
  - When a builder constructs a house according to a blueprint, he “fulfills” the plan.
  - He does not tear up the blueprint and say, "I have destroyed it."
  - By following it perfectly, he makes the plan a reality.
  - **Application:** Jesus came to make the blueprint of righteousness a reality in human life.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Magnifying the Law (Murder)

- **Question:** How did He then proceed to magnify the law before His hearers?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:21-22 – “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill... But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment...”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Spirituality of the Law

- **The Inward Motive**
  - Romans 7:14 – “For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.”
  - The law is not satisfied by merely refraining from the outward act of violence.
- **The Root of Murder**
  - Unjust anger, hatred, and contempt are the seeds of murder.
  - God looks on the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).
- **The New Covenant Promise**
  - Because the standard is internal, we need a new heart.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “...I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Magnifying the Law (Adultery)

- **Question:** What did He say of the seventh commandment?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:27-28 – “...Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points on Purity

- **Sin Begins in the Mind**
  - James 1:15 – “Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.”
  - The commandment is broken the moment the will consents to the sin.
- **The Standard of Judgment**
  - Ecclesiastes 12:14 – “For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”
- **Sanctification**
  - True sanctification is not just outward behavior modification.
  - It is the cleansing of the soul temple by the indwelling Spirit.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Weed**
  - If you only cut the top off a weed (outward sin), it will grow back because the root remains.
  - To have a perfect lawn, you must pull the weed up by the root (inward lust).
  - **Application:** Christ’s magnification of the law targets the root of sin in the heart.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Christ’s Obedience

- **Question:** Did Christ Himself keep the commandments?
- **Key Text:** John 15:10 – “I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Christ Our Righteousness

- **The Sinless One**
  - Hebrews 4:15 – “...but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.”
  - He never had a rebellious thought or an impure motive.
- **The Lord Our Righteousness**
  - Jeremiah 23:6 – “...and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.”
  - **Imputed Righteousness:** His perfect life is credited to our account (Justification).
  - **Imparted Righteousness:** His victorious life is given to us to live *through* us (Sanctification).

## Slide 19 – Q8: Duration of the Law

- **Question:** How long did He say the law would last?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:18 – “For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points on Permanence

- **Jot and Tittle**
  - Jesus emphasized that not even the smallest stroke of the moral law would be altered.
- **Immutable Nature**
  - The law is the foundation of God's government.
  - If the law changed to accommodate fallen man, it would imply God’s law was imperfect.
- **"Till All Be Fulfilled"**
  - As long as heaven and earth remain, the definition of sin remains.
  - The law stands as the eternal standard of righteousness.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Purpose of the Incarnation

- **Question:** Why did Christ come to earth?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:3-4 – “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us...”

## Slide 22 – Q9: What the Law Could Not Do

- **The Mirror Function**
  - The law points out sin but cannot remove it.
  - James 1:23-24 compares the law to a mirror.
  - It was "weak through the flesh" because our fallen nature has no power to obey.
- **Condemning Sin**
  - Christ took “the likeness of sinful flesh” yet did not sin.
  - By conquering temptation in a human body, He broke the power of sin.

## Slide 23 – Q9: Application – Righteousness by Faith

- **Fulfilled IN Us**
  - The goal is not just legal justification (fulfilled *for* us).
  - The goal is spiritual restoration (fulfilled *in* us).
- **Walk After the Spirit**
  - Romans 8:4 – “...who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”
  - God’s plan is to restore us to obedience where the law is a delight written on the heart.

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Necessity of Death

- **Question:** In order to accomplish this, what was it necessary for Christ to do?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:6 – “For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: The Sanctuary Connection

- **Without Strength**
  - We were powerless to pay the penalty for our past sins.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- **The Substitute**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner transferred guilt to the lamb, which was then slain.
  - John 1:29 – “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”
  - Christ paid the debt the broken law demanded so that we might live.

## Slide 26 – Q11: The Argument for the Law

- **Question:** But if the law could have been abolished, would not that have released men from condemnation?
- **Key Text:** Romans 4:15 – “Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: The Cross Proves the Law

- **No Law = No Sin**
  - If the law could be abolished, there would be no transgression (1 John 3:4).
  - If there is no sin, there is no need for a Savior.
- **The Cost of the Cross**
  - Galatians 3:13 – “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us...”
  - The fact that Christ *did* die proves the law could not be changed.
  - The Cross is the greatest evidence that the Law is immutable, holy, and just.

## Slide 28 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Governor and the Criminal**
  - A Governor cannot save a condemned criminal by burning the law book; that would be anarchy.
  - The law must be upheld.
  - If the Governor takes the penalty himself, the law is magnified as just, and the criminal is saved by grace.
  - **Conclusion:** At Calvary, the Law was upheld, and the Sinner was saved.
