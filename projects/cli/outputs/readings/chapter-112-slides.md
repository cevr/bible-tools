## Slide 1 – Q1: Hope for the Future

-   **Question:** Upon what subject does Paul treat in 2 Cor. 5:1-8?
-   **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:1 – “For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Two Dwellings

-   **The Subject:** Paul contrasts our present, temporary condition with the future, eternal reward.
-   **The Earthly House (Tabernacle):**
    -   Represents our present mortal body.
    -   Like a tent: temporary, movable, fragile, and subject to "dissolution" (death).
-   **The Building of God:**
    -   Represents the glorified, immortal body believers will receive.
    -   "Not made with hands" – a direct creation of God, free from the degradation of sin.
-   **The Goal of Salvation:** God plans to restore the whole person, not just a spirit.
    -   1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

-   **The Family in the Tent:**
    -   Imagine a family living in a flimsy tent while building a solid stone mansion nearby.
    -   The tent is cramped, leaks rain, and shakes in the wind.
    -   The family does not want to be homeless (naked), but they long to move out of the tent and into the mansion.
-   **The Application:**
    -   The Christian life is like living in that tent.
    -   We do not love the frailty of our mortality, but we eagerly await the permanent home God has prepared.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Our Present Condition

-   **Question:** While we are here "in our earthly house," in "this tabernacle," that is in this present mortal state, what is our condition?
-   **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:2 – “For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven...”
-   **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:4 – “For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Burden and The Hope

-   **The Twofold Burden:**
    -   **Physical Frailty:** We are subject to sickness, pain, and aging.
    -   **The Conflict with Sin:** We groan because we long for deliverance from the presence of sin.
-   **Righteousness by Faith:**
    -   While the body is weak, the character is being renewed.
    -   **Justification:** We have peace with God now.
        -   Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
    -   **The Groaning of the Spirit:** Struggling against sin is a sign of spiritual life.
        -   Romans 7:24 – “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”

## Slide 6 – Q3: The Universal Groan

-   **Question:** Where else does the apostle express the same fact?
-   **Key Text:** Romans 8:22 – “For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Scope of Suffering

-   **A Creation-Wide Problem:**
    -   It is not just the believer who suffers; the entire earth is under the curse of sin.
    -   Genesis 3:17 – “...cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life...”
-   **The Meaning:**
    -   This "groaning" is not a desire to die and become a disembodied spirit.
    -   It is a universal cry for the **Resurrection** and the restoration of all things.
    -   Revelation 22:3 – “And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him...”

## Slide 8 – Q4: Three Conditions of Being

-   **Question:** How many conditions, or states of being, does the apostle bring to view?
-   **Key Text:** (See 2 Corinthians 5:1-4)
-   **The Three Conditions:**
    1.  **Clothed (Mortal):** Alive in the "tabernacle," subject to death and sin.
    2.  **Unclothed (Naked):** The state of death/sleep. Personality is preserved in God’s memory, but the person has no conscious agency.
    3.  **Clothed Upon (Immortal):** The future state; receiving the "house from heaven" (glorified body).

## Slide 9 – Q4: Theological Insight

-   **Death is Not the Goal:**
    -   Paul calls the state of death being "unclothed" or "naked."
    -   If death were the entrance to glory, he would not use these terms.
    -   The middle state (death) is a disruption caused by sin.
    -   The true goal is the third state: being "clothed upon" with immortality.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Illustration

-   **The Seed:**
    -   Consider a seed planted in the ground.
    -   The seed decomposes (death/nakedness).
    -   The farmer does not plant it for the sake of decomposition, but for the new plant that springs up (resurrection).
    -   The "naked" state in the ground is necessary but temporary; the harvest is the goal.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Paul’s Desire

-   **Question:** Which one of these conditions did the apostle wait for and desire?
-   **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:2 – “For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Blessed Hope

-   **Paul Desired the Third Condition:**
    -   His hope was not fixed on the grave (being unclothed).
    -   His hope was not fixed on remaining in this world of suffering (the earthly house).
    -   He desired to be "clothed upon" with immortality.
-   **Sanctuary Connection:**
    -   Like the High Priest coming out to bless the people, Christ will appear to bring salvation.
    -   Titus 2:13 – “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Middle State

-   **Question:** What disclaimer does he utter concerning the second or middle state?
-   **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:4 – “...not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Not Seeking Death

-   **Paul Shrinks from Death:**
    -   He explicitly states he does *not* desire to be "unclothed."
    -   If death instantly liberated the soul to glory, Paul would have desired it.
    -   Instead, he views death as an enemy to be defeated.
    -   1 Corinthians 15:26 – “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”
-   **Desire for Life:**
    -   Paul’s desire is for *life*—specifically the life that comes through the resurrection.

## Slide 15 – Q7: Proof of Resurrection Hope

-   **Question:** How is it proved that Paul looked forward to the resurrection, when he expressed a desire to be clothed upon with the house from heaven?
-   **Key Text:** Romans 8:23 – “And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Redemption of the Body

-   **The Parallel:**
    -   In 2 Cor 5, Paul desires to be "clothed upon."
    -   In Rom 8, he defines this as waiting for "the redemption of our body."
-   **Adoption:**
    -   This refers to the public declaration of sonship when the sons of God are revealed to the universe.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Application (Firstfruits)

-   **Righteousness by Faith:**
    -   We have the "firstfruits of the Spirit" now.
    -   **The Earnest:** The Holy Spirit is the down payment of our future inheritance (2 Corinthians 5:5).
    -   **Present Power:** The Spirit that will raise our bodies (Rom 8:11) is the same Spirit that enables us to overcome sin today.
    -   Romans 8:11 – “But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Timing of Redemption

-   **Question:** When is the body to be redeemed?
-   **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”

## Slide 19 – Q8: At His Coming

-   **Not at Death:**
    -   The body is redeemed at the Second Coming of Christ.
    -   Philippians 3:20-21 – “...the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body...”
    -   John 14:3 – “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”
-   **Sanctuary Cycle:**
    -   Jesus completes His work of judgment in the heavenly sanctuary *before* returning to gather His people.

## Slide 20 – Q9: Mortality Swallowed Up

-   **Question:** When is mortality to be swallowed up of life?
-   **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:51-53 – “Behold, I shew you a mystery... we shall all be changed... at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible... For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Putting on Immortality

-   **We Are Not Naturally Immortal:**
    -   Scripture teaches the soul that sins shall die (Ezekiel 18:4).
    -   Only God has inherent immortality.
        -   1 Timothy 6:16 – “Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto...”
-   **The Gift:**
    -   We "put on" immortality as a gift from Christ at the resurrection.

## Slide 22 – Q9: Illustration

-   **The Diver:**
    -   A diver puts on an oxygen tank and a wetsuit to survive underwater.
    -   He is not naturally amphibious; he needs the equipment to survive in that element.
    -   Similarly, humans are not naturally immortal.
    -   To live in eternity, we must "put on" the nature of Christ—His righteousness now (character) and His immortality then (body).

## Slide 23 – Q10: Possession by Faith

-   **Question:** If the house from heaven is the future redeemed immortal body, how can it be said that, "we have" it?
-   **Key Text:** 1 John 5:11 – “And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”
-   **Key Text:** 1 John 5:12 – “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Secure in Christ

-   **The Title Deed:**
    -   Faith is the substance of things hoped for (Hebrews 11:1).
    -   Having the Son means having the guarantee of the future body.
-   **Hid in Christ:**
    -   Our life is currently safe-guarded in the person of Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary.
    -   Colossians 3:3 – “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”
-   **Application:**
    -   Just as we accept Christ's righteousness as our own by faith, we accept His promise of the resurrection as a present reality.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Fitted for His Presence

-   **Question:** When, only, is a person fitted to be present with the Lord?
-   **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:50 – “Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Full Redemption

-   **Corruption Cannot Inherit Incorruption:**
    -   Our current bodies, degraded by sin, cannot stand in the consuming fire of God's presence.
-   **Double Preparation:**
    -   **Spiritual:** Character must be fitted now (Sanctification).
        -   Hebrews 8:10 – “...I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”
    -   **Physical:** Body must be fitted at the resurrection (Glorification).
-   We are only fitted for His physical presence when redeemed from all that is mortal.

## Slide 27 – Q12: At Home in the Body

-   **Question:** To what condition, then, does the apostle refer by the words (2 Cor. 5:6), "At home in the body?
-   **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:6 – “Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Walking by Faith

-   **The First Condition:**
    -   Paul refers to our present, mortal life on earth.
    -   It implies a state where we are physically separated from the visible presence of Jesus.
-   **Faith vs. Sight:**
    -   2 Corinthians 5:7 – “(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)”
    -   While in this body, we serve God by faith while He ministers in the Heavenly Sanctuary.

## Slide 29 – Q13: Present with the Lord

-   **Question:** To what condition does he refer by the expression, "To be present with the Lord?
-   **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:8 – “We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: The Believer’s Confidence

-   **The Third Condition:**
    -   This refers to the resurrection state—clothed with the house from heaven.
-   **The Logic of "Absent from the Body":**
    -   Paul contrasts the two *positive* states: serving God here (faith) vs. serving God there (sight).
    -   He omits the middle state (death) because there is no conscious interval for the believer.
    -   The moment a believer closes their eyes in death, the very next conscious moment is the face of Jesus.
-   **Assurance:**
    -   Romans 8:38-39 – “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life... shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
