## Slide 1 – Q1: Idolatry in the Old Dispensation

- **Question:** In the old dispensation, how was an idolater punished?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 13:10 (verses 6–10) – “And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Theocracy and Treason

- **The Nature of the Government:**
  - Ancient Israel was a **Theocracy**: a government where God was the supreme civil Ruler.
  - Idolatry was considered high treason against the King of kings.
- **The Severity of the Sin:**
  - It was not just a difference of opinion; it was sedition designed to “thrust” people away from the Source of life.
  - Like a traitor in wartime, the idolater endangered the spiritual existence of the entire camp.
- **The Lesson for Us:**
  - Civil penalties for religious crimes have ceased because we are not under a theocracy.
  - However, the spiritual reality remains: Idolatry separates the soul from God.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application and Righteousness by Faith

- **The Source of Life:**
  - God is the only source of life. To choose an idol is to choose a broken cistern.
  - Jeremiah 2:13 – “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The natural heart is an idol factory. We cannot cleanse ourselves.
  - We need the Spirit to write God’s law on our hearts.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Deep-Sea Diver:**
  - Imagine a diver completely dependent on an air line for survival.
  - If someone tries to cut that line, it is an attempt at murder, not just a nuisance.
- **The Application:**
  - In the wilderness, God was the “air line” for Israel.
  - The idolater was attempting to sever the connection that kept the nation alive.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Punishment for Blasphemy

- **Question:** What was done to a blasphemer?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 24:16 – “And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him, as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points and Sanctification

- **Open Defiance:**
  - Blasphemy represents contempt for the Creator’s authority and threatens covenant peace.
  - The Third Commandment forbids treating God’s character as common.
  - Exodus 20:7 – “Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.”
- **The Heart Condition:**
  - Blasphemy reveals a heart at war with God.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **Sanctification:**
  - A true Christian learns to reverence God through the indwelling Christ.
  - Colossians 4:6 – “Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Royal Insult:**
  - If a citizen walked into a throne room and spat upon the royal seal or the king’s crown, it would be an act of open insurrection.
- **The Application:**
  - Blasphemy is the verbal act of spitting upon the character of the King of the Universe.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Rebellious Son

- **Question:** How was a perverse son punished?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 21:18, 21 – “If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, ... all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Authority and Rebellion

- **Context of the Law:**
  - This was not for young children, but for a son old enough to be responsible ("a glutton and a drunkard") who persistently rejected correction.
- **Authority and Order:**
  - Rejection of home authority leads to rejection of God’s authority.
  - Ephesians 6:2 – “Honor thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)”
- **The Spirit of Rebellion:**
  - Stubbornness is akin to witchcraft; it mirrors Satan’s rebellion.
  - 1 Samuel 15:23 – “For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Application (The Gospel)

- **The Father's Heart:**
  - By nature, we are all rebellious children.
  - In the Gospel, the Father runs to meet the prodigal rather than stoning him.
  - Luke 15:20 – “And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.”
- **The Warning:**
  - While grace is available, persistent refusal to obey His voice eventually cuts us off from His protection.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Gangrene:**
  - A gangrene in a limb will poison the whole body if left unchecked.
  - Sometimes a limb must be removed to save the life of the patient.
- **The Application:**
  - In the theocracy, persistent, hardening rebellion was removed to save the "body" of the nation from moral infection.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Punishment for Adultery

- **Question:** What punishment was inflicted upon an adulterer?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 20:10 – “The adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Marriage and Faithfulness

- **Sacredness of Marriage:**
  - Marriage symbolizes the union between Christ and the church.
  - Ephesians 5:31–32 – “For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.”
- **Christ’s Application:**
  - When Jesus met the woman caught in adultery, He did not deny the law but turned the searchlight on the accusers.
  - John 8:7 – “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Righteousness by Faith

- **Power to Overcome:**
  - Jesus said, "Go, and sin no more." He provides the power to live a pure life.
  - His grace is not a license to sin, but power over lust.
  - Titus 2:11–12 – “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.”

## Slide 15 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Pillars of the House:**
  - If you remove the supporting pillars of a house, the roof collapses and destroys everyone inside.
- **The Application:**
  - Marriage vows are the supporting pillars of society.
  - Adultery removes these pillars; God’s law was designed to protect the structure of the home.

## Slide 16 – Q5: The Death Penalty for Sin

- **Question:** Has the death penalty for sin really been abolished?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 17 – Q5: The Unchangeable Penalty

- **The Moral Penalty Remains:**
  - The civil administration (stoning) passed with the theocracy, but the moral penalty is unchanged.
  - Sin is the transgression of the law.
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **The Second Death:**
  - This penalty is not just the first death (sleep), but eternal separation from God.
  - Revelation 20:14 – “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: The Gospel Solution (Justification & Sanctification)

- **Substitution:**
  - Christ took the "wages" (death) so we could have the "gift" (life).
  - 2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”
- **Sanctification:**
  - If we accept the gift, we must stop working for the wages of sin (Satan).
  - Romans 6:16 – “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”

## Slide 19 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Paycheck:**
  - If a man works all week, he expects his wages. It is what he has earned.
  - Sin pays a salary: death. We have all earned this check.
- **The Application:**
  - The only way to avoid "cashing the check" of death is to resign from the job of sinning and accept the free gift of life from Christ.

## Slide 20 – Q6: Why Ministers Do Not Execute

- **Question:** Why is not the old penalty executed in this dispensation by gospel ministers?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:20 – “Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.”

## Slide 21 – Q6: Ambassadors of Grace

- **The Church's Role:**
  - We are an embassy of grace, not a court of civil justice.
  - Jesus taught the separation of His kingdom from earthly force.
  - John 18:36 – “Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight... but now is my kingdom not from hence.”
- **Our Weapons:**
  - We do not use a sword of steel, but the "sword of the Spirit."
  - Ephesians 6:17 – “And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.”

## Slide 22 – Q6: The Time of Probation

- **Why We Wait:**
  - We are in a time of probation where God is "beseeching" men to repent.
  - Executing judgment now would cut short the opportunity for salvation.
  - 2 Peter 3:9 – “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise... but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”

## Slide 23 – Q6: Illustration

- **The King's Envoys:**
  - When a country is in rebellion, the King sends envoys to offer amnesty.
  - The envoys do not shoot the rebels; they plead with them to accept the pardon.
- **The Application:**
  - We are those envoys, offering peace before the King returns in judgment.

## Slide 24 – Q7: Vengeance Belongs to God

- **Question:** To whom does vengeance belong?
- **Key Text:** Romans 12:19 – “Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 25 – Q7: Human Limitation vs. God’s Justice

- **We Cannot Read Hearts:**
  - Humans see the outward appearance; God sees the motives.
  - 1 Samuel 16:7 – “...for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.”
- **Our Practical Duty:**
  - Because God is the Judge, we are called to forgive.
  - Romans 12:21 – “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.”

## Slide 26 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Surgeon:**
  - A small child lacks the skill to perform complex surgery; trying to do so causes harm.
- **The Application:**
  - We lack the wisdom to perform the "surgery" of divine judgment.
  - We must leave the scalpel in the hands of the Great Physician.

## Slide 27 – Q8: The Executor of Judgment

- **Question:** To whom has the execution of the death penalty for sin been committed?
- **Key Text:** John 5:26, 27 – “For as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.”

## Slide 28 – Q8: The Son of Man as Judge

- **A Compassionate Judge:**
  - It is a comfort that our Judge is the "Son of man."
  - He has lived our life and been tempted as we are.
  - Hebrews 4:15 – “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.”
- **The Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Christ is currently our High Priest and Advocate.
  - At the end of time, He will stand up as King and Judge (Daniel 12:1).

## Slide 29 – Q8: Assurance in the Judgment

- **No Condemnation:**
  - If we are "in Christ," we do not fear the judgment.
  - Romans 8:1 – “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”
- **The Blotting Out of Sins:**
  - He desires to blot out our sins, not our names.
  - Revelation 3:5 – “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life...”

## Slide 30 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Courtroom:**
  - Imagine entering a courtroom in fear, only to realize the Judge is the same person who paid your bail and defended you.
- **The Application:**
  - For the believer, the Judge is also the Saviour.

## Slide 31 – Q9: The Timing of Execution

- **Question:** And when will He execute it?
- **Key Text:** Jude 14–15 – “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, To execute judgment upon all...”

## Slide 32 – Q9: Phases of Judgment

- **Investigative vs. Executive:**
  - **Investigative:** Before He comes, Christ examines the records (Daniel 7:9–10). This is happening now.
  - **Executive:** When He returns, He brings His reward.
  - Revelation 22:12 – “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”
- **The Strange Act:**
  - Judgment is God’s “strange act” (Isaiah 28:21), but necessary to cleanse the universe of sin.

## Slide 33 – Q9: Preparation for the End

- **Holiness of Life:**
  - Since judgment is certain, we must live godly lives.
  - 2 Peter 3:11 – “Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness.”
- **The Call:**
  - Now is the time to seek the Lord and allow the Atonement to reconcile us to God.

## Slide 34 – Q9: Illustration

- **Wheat and Tares:**
  - A farmer lets weeds and wheat grow together until harvest to protect the wheat.
  - The harvest is the final separation.
- **The Application:**
  - We are currently in the growing season.
  - The executive judgment is the harvest, where the separation becomes final.
