### Q1. In the days of Jesus, what was the name for the Bible?

**"Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which
the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?" Matthew
21:42.**

**Answer:** In the time of Christ, the collection of sacred writings was known
simply as "the Scriptures." This term comes from a root meaning "writings."
However, these were not ordinary writings; they were recognized as the
authoritative voice of God.

- **The Standard of Truth:** Jesus constantly appealed to "the Scriptures" as
  the final court of appeal. When tempted by Satan in the wilderness, His
  defense was "It is written" (Matthew 4:4). By asking the religious leaders,
  "Did ye never read?", He was pointing them back to the written Word as the
  test of all truth.
- **The Foundation:** The verse quoted refers to the "stone which the builders
  rejected." This is Christ Himself. The Scriptures are the written foundation
  that reveals the Living Foundation (Christ). We cannot separate the written
  Word from the Living Word.

**[ILL]** Imagine a country with a supreme constitution. No matter what a judge,
a lawyer, or a politician says, the final question is always, "What does the
constitution say?" In the Kingdom of Heaven, the Scriptures act as that
constitution. Traditions and opinions must bow before the authority of what is
written.

### Q2. What other Biblical name is given to this important book?

**"And He answered and said unto them, My mother and My brethren are these which
hear the word of God, and do it." Luke 8:21.**

**Answer:** The Bible is frequently called "the word of God." This title
signifies its origin and its power.

- **Divine Origin:** It is not merely the word of Moses, Isaiah, or Paul; it is
  the message of the Infinite God communicated through human channels (1
  Thessalonians 2:13).
- **Creative Power:** The same "word" that spoke the worlds into existence
  (Psalm 33:6, 9) is the word recorded in the Bible. Therefore, it possesses the
  power to create a new heart in the believer.
- **Hearing and Doing:** Jesus emphasizes that true relationship with Him comes
  not just from hearing the Word, but _doing_ it. In the message of
  Righteousness by Faith, "doing" is the natural fruit of believing. When we
  truly receive the Word of God into the heart by faith, it works in us to
  produce obedience (Hebrews 4:2).

**Definition:**

- **The Word of God:** The expression of God's mind and will. It is the vehicle
  through which God communicates life and power to the soul.

**[ILL]** A seed contains the life of the plant within itself. If you leave a
seed on a shelf, it does nothing. But if you plant it in good soil, the life
inside bursts forth. The Word of God is the "incorruptible seed" (1 Peter 1:23).
When received into the "soil" of a believing heart, it naturally springs up into
a life of righteousness.

---

### Q3. How were the Scriptures given to mankind?

**"All scripture is given by inspiration of God." 2 Timothy 3:16.**

**Answer:** The Bible testifies that it is given by "inspiration of God." The
Greek word used here is _theopneustos_, literally meaning "God-breathed."

- **Not of Human Origin:** While human hands held the pen, the breath—the Spirit
  and thought—came from God. The Bible is not a collection of human discoveries
  about God, but God’s revelation of Himself to man.
- **The Breath of Life:** Just as God breathed into Adam the breath of life and
  he became a living soul (Genesis 2:7), God breathes into the Scriptures,
  making them "quick [living], and powerful" (Hebrews 4:12).
- **Plenary Inspiration:** We believe this inspiration extends to "all"
  scripture—not just the parts we like, but the history, the prophecy, the laws,
  and the gospels.

**Definition:**

- **Inspiration:** The supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on the writers
  of the Bible, rendering their writings an accurate record of the revelation of
  God.

**[ILL]** Consider a flute player. The flute (the human writer) has its own
unique shape and tone, but the music is produced entirely by the breath of the
musician (God). The melody comes from the player, not the instrument, though the
instrument gives it form.

### Q4. By whom were the prophets of old guided as they thus spake for God?

**"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21.**

**Answer:** The active agent in inspiration is the Holy Ghost (Holy Spirit).

- **Moved by the Spirit:** The phrase "moved by" implies being borne along, much
  like a ship is driven by the wind. The prophets did not decide "I will write a
  Bible book today." rather, the Spirit came upon them.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the seven-branched
  candlestick (Menorah) gave light to the Holy Place (Exodus 25:31–37). This
  represents the Holy Spirit illuminating the truth. Without the Holy Spirit,
  the Bible remains a sealed book to the reader; the same Spirit who inspired
  the writing must inspire our understanding (1 Corinthians 2:10–14).
- **Human Instrumentality:** God used "holy men." They were men with distinct
  personalities (David the shepherd, Daniel the statesman, Peter the fisherman),
  but they were set apart (holy) for God's use.

---

### Q5. What specific example of this is mentioned by Peter?

**"Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the
Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide
to them that took Jesus." Acts 1:16.**

**Answer:** Peter cites the Psalms of David as a specific example of the Holy
Ghost speaking.

- **Predictive Prophecy:** David lived 1,000 years before Christ, yet the Holy
  Ghost spoke through him regarding the betrayal of Judas (referencing Psalm
  41:9). This proves the Bible is not limited by time; the Author sees the end
  from the beginning (Isaiah 46:9–10).
- **The Unity of Scripture:** Though written centuries apart, the message is one
  because the Mind behind it is one.
- **Comfort in Sovereignty:** If the Holy Ghost could accurately predict the
  betrayal of Jesus, He can also accurately predict the final victory of His
  church. We can trust the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation because the same
  Spirit inspired them.

**[ILL]** If you look through a telescope, you can see objects that are far away
as if they were near. The Holy Spirit acted as a telescope for David, allowing
him to see and describe the events of the Messiah's life across the vast
distance of time.

---

### Q6. Who was it, then, who spoke through these men?

**"God, who at sundry times and divers manners spake in past unto the fathers by
the prophets." Hebrews 1:1.**

**Answer:** Ultimately, it is **God** Himself speaking.

- **Divers Manners:** God adapted His communication to the needs of the people.
  Sometimes He spoke through visions, sometimes dreams, sometimes direct audible
  voice, and sometimes through angels.
- **Progressive Revelation:** "Sundry times" indicates that God revealed His
  truth gradually, as men could bear it, culminating in the full revelation of
  Jesus Christ (Hebrews 1:2).
- **God's Desire to Communicate:** The God of the Bible is not a distant, silent
  deity. He is a Father who longs to speak to His children. His word is an act
  of love, designed to bridge the gap caused by sin.

---

### Q7. For what purpose were the Holy Scriptures written?

**"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning,
that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope." Romans
15:4.**

**Answer:** The Scriptures were written for our practical spiritual benefit: to
give us patience, comfort, and hope.

- **For Our Learning:** The history of Israel, the lives of the patriarchs, and
  the record of the early church are not just facts; they are object lessons. We
  see the results of sin and the fruits of obedience.
- **Patience and Comfort:** The Christian walk involves trials. The Scriptures
  show us that God sustained Joseph in prison, Daniel in the lions' den, and
  Paul in shipwreck. This comforts us that He will sustain us too.
- **The "Blessed Hope":** The ultimate goal is "hope." This is not vague
  optimism, but the solid assurance of salvation and the Second Coming.
- **RBF Connection:** This hope is anchored in Christ's work, not our own. When
  we read of God's faithfulness to sinners in the past, we gain hope that His
  righteousness is sufficient to cover and restore us today.

**Definition:**

- **Hope:** In the Bible, a confident expectation of future good based on the
  promises of God (Titus 2:13).

---

### Q8. What are the four ways in which Scripture can help us?

**"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. " 2 Timothy
3:16.**

**Answer:** Paul outlines four specific functions of the Bible, covering the
entire process of salvation and Christian living:

1.  **Doctrine (Teaching):** It reveals the truth about God, the nature of man,
    the law, and the plan of salvation. It establishes the foundation of our
    faith.
2.  **Reproof (Conviction):** Like a mirror, the law of God reveals our defects
    and convinces us of our need for a Savior (Romans 3:20; James 1:23–24). It
    shows us where we have gone wrong.
3.  **Correction (Restoration):** The Bible doesn't just point out sin; it
    points to the remedy. It reveals Christ as the one who forgives and
    justifies. It corrects our course from death to life.
4.  **Instruction in Righteousness (Sanctification):** After we are corrected
    (justified), the Word teaches us how to walk in holiness. It guides the
    believer in the path of obedience.

**Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God's grace by which the believer,
  through the power of the Holy Spirit and the Word, is cleansed from sin and
  transformed into the likeness of Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:3; John 17:17).

**[ILL]** Think of a doctor's work:

1.  **Doctrine:** He studies the medical textbook to know the human body.
2.  **Reproof:** He diagnoses the illness (reveals the problem).
3.  **Correction:** He performs surgery or gives medicine to cure the disease.
4.  **Instruction:** He prescribes a healthy lifestyle to keep the patient well.
    The Bible does all this for the soul.

### Q9. What was God's plan in thus giving the Bible to us?

**"That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
works." 2 Timothy 3:17.**

**Answer:** God’s purpose is to bring the believer to maturity ("perfection")
and to equip them for service.

- **Perfect:** This word signifies maturity, completeness, and fitness. It means
  reaching the full stature of a Christian in character.
- **Thoroughly Furnished:** The Word contains everything necessary for the
  Christian life. We do not need human philosophy or tradition to supplement the
  Bible.
- **Unto All Good Works:** True faith works by love (Galatians 5:6). The purpose
  of the Bible is not just to fill our heads with knowledge, but to transform
  our lives so that we naturally do the works of Christ.
- **RBF Connection:** We are not saved _by_ these good works, but we are created
  in Christ Jesus _unto_ good works (Ephesians 2:10). The indwelling Word
  provides the power to obey God's law—not as a burden, but as a delight.

---

### Q10. How does God intend that His Word shall help us in this dark world of sin and death?

**"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path." Psalm 119: 105.**

**Answer:** The world is darkened by the ignorance and deception of sin
(Ephesians 4:18). The Word acts as a lamp to guide our steps safely.

- **Personal Application:** It is a lamp to _my_ feet. It gives specific
  guidance for daily choices—business dealings, family relations, and moral
  conduct.
- **Prophetic Light:** Peter calls prophecy a "light that shineth in a dark
  place" (2 Peter 1:19). It illuminates the future so we are not overtaken by
  surprise.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:** Just as the Golden Candlestick was the only light in
  the Holy Place of the sanctuary, the Word of God is the only reliable light in
  this world. Without it, we stumble.

**[ILL]** Walking through a dense forest at night is terrifying and dangerous.
You might trip over a root or fall into a pit. But if you have a lantern, you
can see just enough to take the next step safely. The Bible doesn't always show
us the whole future, but it always gives light for the next step of obedience.

### Q11. What were the three divisions of Scripture in the days of Christ?

**"And He said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I
was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the
law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning Me." Luke
24:44.**

**Answer:** Jesus recognized the standard Jewish division of the Old Testament
(the Tanakh):

1.  **The Law of Moses (Torah):** The first five books (Genesis to Deuteronomy).
2.  **The Prophets (Nevi'im):** Including the major and minor prophets, plus
    historical books like Kings and Samuel.
3.  **The Psalms (Ketuvim/Writings):** The poetic and wisdom literature.

- **Confirmation of the Old Testament:** By citing these divisions, Jesus placed
  His seal of approval on the Old Testament canon. He taught that _all_ these
  sections pointed to Him.

---

### Q12. Upon what evidence did Jesus base the fact of His Messiahship?

**"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all
the scriptures the things concerning Himself." Luke 24:27.**

**Answer:** Jesus based His identity on the written Word of God. He did not
simply perform a miracle to dazzle them; He performed a Bible study to ground
them.

- **Christ Centered:** The entire Bible is a revelation of Jesus Christ.
  - In Moses (The Law), He is the Lamb of God and the High Priest foreshadowed
    in the sanctuary service.
  - In the Prophets, He is the Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53) and the Coming
    King.
- **The Solid Foundation:** Jesus wanted the disciples' faith to rest on the
  "sure word of prophecy" rather than just their emotional experience of seeing
  Him.
- **RBF Connection:** To understand the Scriptures is to find Christ. And to
  find Christ is to find Righteousness. We search the Scriptures because they
  testify of Him (John 5:39), and in Him alone do we have life and victory over
  sin.

**[ILL]** If you have a puzzle with thousands of pieces, it can look chaotic.
But once you see the picture on the box, every piece makes sense. Jesus is the
picture on the box of the Bible. When you see Him, every law, sacrifice, and
prophecy fits into place.

### Q13. What is one of the names of God in the Bible?

**"He is the Rock, His work is perfect: for all His ways are judgment: a God of
truth and without iniquity, just and right is He." Deuteronomy 32:4.**

**Answer:** God is called a **"God of truth."**

- **The Rock:** This implies stability and unchangeableness. In a shifting
  world, God's character remains the same (Malachi 3:6).
- **Without Iniquity:** God is perfectly holy. He cannot lie (Titus 1:2).
- **Implication for the Word:** Because God is Truth, His spoken and written
  Word must also be Truth. He cannot author confusion or error.

---

### Q14. What, therefore, must be the character of His Holy Word?

**"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." John 17:17.**

**Answer:** Since God is truth, His Word **is** truth. It is not merely _true_
(an adjective); it is _Truth_ (the substance/noun). It is the standard by which
all other claims are measured.

- **Sanctifying Power:** Jesus prays that we be "sanctified" (made holy) through
  the truth. Error cannot make men holy; only truth can.
- **The Mechanism of Holiness:** As we read and believe the Truth, the Holy
  Spirit applies it to our lives, cleansing our minds from worldly thinking and
  writing God's law upon our hearts.

**Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** To be set apart for holy use; the process of becoming like
  Christ in character through the power of the Holy Spirit.

---

### Q15. To what extent has God magnified His Word?

**"Thou has magnified Thy word above all Thy name." Psalm 138:2.**

**Answer:** This is a staggering statement. God places His Word even above His
name.

- **Character and Promise:** A person's "name" represents their character,
  authority, and reputation. God is saying that His very character stands or
  falls on the fulfillment of His Word.
- **Absolute Assurance:** If God has spoken a promise (e.g., "If we confess our
  sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us," 1 John 1:9), He has staked His
  entire reputation as God upon fulfilling that promise.
- **RBF Connection:** This is the bedrock of Righteousness by Faith. We do not
  look to our own feelings or our own works for assurance. We look to God's
  Word. If He says we are accepted in the Beloved (Ephesians 1:6), we must
  believe it, because He has magnified that Word above His name.

**[ILL]** If a businessman signs a contract, his name is at the bottom. The
value of that contract depends on the integrity of the name. If he values his
word above his name, he will lose everything he owns rather than break that
contract. God pledges His eternal throne on the truthfulness of His Word to you.

---

### Q16. What value did Job place upon the words of God?

**"Neither have I gone back from the command of his lips; I have esteemed the
words of his mouth more than my necessary food." Job 23:12.**

**Answer:** Job valued God's Word more than physical nourishment.

- **Spiritual Hunger:** Physical food sustains the body for a few hours, but the
  Word of God sustains the soul for eternity. Jesus reiterated this when He
  said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
  out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).
- **Priority:** Many Christians feed their bodies three times a day but starve
  their souls. Job teaches us that time with God's Word is more essential than
  breakfast.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the Holy Place, the Table of Showbread
  represented Christ the Living Bread. The priests ate this bread. We must "eat"
  the Word to have spiritual strength.

---

### Q17. How firm was the prophet Isaiah's faith in God's Word?

**"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand
for ever. " Isaiah 40:8.**

**Answer:** Isaiah saw that everything earthly is temporary and fading, but
God's Word is eternal and immutable.

- **The Contrast:** Human opinions, scientific theories, and political empires
  rise and fall like grass. They look impressive for a season, but they wither.
- **The Rock:** The Word of God stands forever. It is the only thing in this
  world we can hold onto that will carry us through death and into the judgment.
- **Final Appeal:** Since His Word stands forever, those who build their lives
  upon it will also stand forever (Matthew 7:24–25).

**[ILL]** Walk through an ancient cemetery. You see monuments to great men, but
they are crumbling, and the men are gone. The "flowers" of their lives have
faded. But the Bible verse carved on the tombstone—"I am the resurrection and
the life"—is just as powerful and alive today as when it was first spoken. The
man fades; the Word stands.
