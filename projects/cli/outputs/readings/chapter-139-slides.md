## Slide 1 – Bible Study: The Privilege of Prayer

- **Topic:** Righteousness and Life – Part 1
- **Focus:** The Power of Prayer, The Sanctuary, and Righteousness by Faith
- **Source:** Adventist Pioneer Q&A Format

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Promise of Prayer

- **Question:** What is the promise to those who ask and seek for the things they need?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:8 – “Everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Progression)

- **Certainty of the Promise:**
  - The text says "receiveth," not "might receive."
  - God is more willing to give than we are to receive.
- **Threefold Progression of Faith:**
  - **Asking:** Like a child to a father; acknowledges dependence.
  - **Seeking:** A deeper pursuit; searching Scriptures and the heart.
  - **Knocking:** Perseverance; overcoming obstacles to enter the King's presence.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Greatest Need:**
  - We often ask for temporal blessings, but our greatest need is the righteousness of Christ.
  - We do not need to *feel* the answer; we have God's word.
- **Justification:**
  - God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ’s merits (Romans 3:24; 5:1).
- **Sanctification:**
  - The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to purify the character and make the believer holy in daily life (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

---

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Beggar at the Gate:**
  - A beggar knocking at a king's gate does not break down the door.
  - He knocks and waits, confident in the king's generosity.
- **Application:**
  - Our knocking is not to persuade God to be good.
  - It is to open our own hearts to receive the abundance He is already waiting to pour out.

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Willingness of Heaven

- **Question:** How does the Saviour illustrate the willingness of Heaven to grant favors to those who ask?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:11 – “If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?”

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points

- **Human vs. Divine Nature:**
  - Fallen humanity ("being evil") still loves its children.
  - God, whose very nature is love (1 John 4:8), delights much more to bless His children.
- **The "Good Things":**
  - Luke 11:13 defines these "good things" as the Holy Spirit.
  - The Spirit brings the life of Christ into the soul (New Covenant promise).
- **Fatherhood:**
  - We do not pray to a distant tyrant.
  - We pray to a Father who pities His children (Psalm 103:13).

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: In Whose Name?

- **Question:** In whose name should we present our prayers to God?
- **Key Text:** John 14:13, 14 – “And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Sanctuary & Mediation)

- **Mediatorial Authority:**
  - We have no merit of our own; our best prayers are stained with selfishness.
  - We approach through the merit of our High Priest.
- **Sanctuary Meaning:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, incense was offered on the golden altar.
  - This represents Christ’s merits mingled with the prayers of the saints (Revelation 8:3–4).
- **Praying in His Character:**
  - "In His name" is not just a formula.
  - It means praying in His Spirit, submitting our will to the Divine will.

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Signed Check:**
  - If a poor man goes to a bank with a check signed by a wealthy man, the bank honors the signature, not the poor man's clothes.
- **Application:**
  - When we pray, we present the "signature" of Jesus Christ.
  - God honors the request for the sake of His Son.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Necessity of Asking

- **Question:** Why is it necessary to ask God for all these things?
- **Key Text:** James 1:17 – “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **Total Dependence:**
  - Independent living is the essence of sin. Prayer restores the creature’s dependence on the Creator.
- **Source of Righteousness:**
  - We cannot generate righteousness from within (Romans 7:18).
  - Every good gift must be "imparted" from above.
- **God’s Unchangeable Nature:**
  - Prayer does not change God; it changes us.
  - It prepares our hearts to safely receive blessings we might otherwise misuse.

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Means of Reception

- **Question:** Through what means are these gifts received?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Matthew 7:8 – “Everyone that asketh receiveth.”
  - John 16:24 – “Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.”
  - John 16:23 – “Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Law of Reception:**
  - God respects free will; He does not force character transformation on those who do not ask.
  - We must ask in faith.
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - Israelites brought sacrifices to the tabernacle door to receive atonement.
  - We bring petitions to the throne of grace to receive mercy (Hebrews 4:16).
- **Result:**
  - "Fullness of joy" comes from a cleansed conscience and restored relationship.

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: How to Pray

- **Question:** How should we pray to God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 14:15 – “I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.”

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Balance)

- **With the Spirit:**
  - Prayer must be energized by the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:26), not cold logic.
- **With the Understanding:**
  - Prayer should be intelligent, based on God's revealed Word.
- **True Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Avoids formal legalism (understanding without spirit).
  - Avoids fanaticism (emotion without truth).
  - The intellect grasps the promise; the heart trusts the Promiser.

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Thanksgiving

- **Question:** With what should the prayers of a suppliant be mingled?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 4:6 – “Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **Cure for Anxiety:**
  - "Be careful for nothing" means be anxious for nothing.
  - Thankful prayer is the antidote to worry.
- **Gratitude as Faith:**
  - Thanking God *before* seeing the answer is high faith.
  - It acknowledges His past faithfulness guarantees future care.
- **Supplication:**
  - Earnest, humble entreaty; coming not to demand rights, but to beg for grace.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Ungrateful Child:**
  - If a child constantly asks for gifts but never says "thank you," the relationship becomes cold and transactional.
- **Application:**
  - Thanksgiving warms the heart and opens it to receive more from God.

---

## Slide 20 – Q8: Vain Repetitions

- **Question:** Should certain forms be repeated in public for the purpose of being heard by men?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 6:7 – “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points

- **Vain Repetitions:**
  - God is not impressed by length or mechanical repetition.
  - We do not need to wear God down (contrast with heathen worship, 1 Kings 18:26).
- **Public vs. Private:**
  - Prayer meant to be "heard by men" is hypocrisy.
  - It becomes a display of self-righteousness rather than worship.
- **Simplicity:**
  - The publican’s short prayer ("God be merciful to me a sinner") was heard because it was humble (Luke 18:13).

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: The Essential Element

- **Question:** What must necessarily prompt our petitions, in order to please God?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:6 – “But without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Faith)

- **Defining Faith:**
  - Not just believing God exists ("that He is").
  - Believing in His character as a "rewarder" (trusting His love).
- **Root of Righteousness:**
  - Obedience springs from faith.
  - Faith accepts that favor is given in Christ, rather than earned by works.
- **Diligence:**
  - Faith is active; it pursues God because it values Him above all else.

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: Strength of Faith

- **Question:** How strong must this faith be?
- **Key Text:** Mark 11:24 – “Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points

- **Present Tense:**
  - "Believe that ye *receive* them."
  - In redemption, God's promise is as good as the finished act.
- **Practical Application:**
  - When asking for victory over sin, believe Christ *has* given the power.
  - Do not wait to feel it; act upon the faith, and the power comes.

---

## Slide 26 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Online Purchase:**
  - When you buy something online, you receive a confirmation receipt.
  - You do not hold the item yet, but you "own" it because you trust the merchant.
- **Application:**
  - God's promise in the Bible is the confirmation receipt.

---

## Slide 27 – Q11: Forgiveness in Prayer

- **Question:** When praying for forgiveness, how should we feel toward those who have in any way injured us?
- **Key Text:** Mark 11:25 – “And when ye stand praying, forgive if ye have aught against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.”

---

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Condition:**
  - A hard, unforgiving heart is closed to the Spirit of God.
  - We cannot receive God's mercy if we block the flow of mercy to others.
- **Reflecting Character:**
  - To be a Christian is to possess the character of Christ, who forgave His murderers.
  - Refusing to forgive declares we do not belong to Him.

---

## Slide 29 – Q12: Consequences of Unforgiveness

- **Question:** What will result if this injunction is not carried out?
- **Key Text:** Mark 11:26 – “But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.”

---

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points

- **Retention of Guilt:**
  - An unforgiving spirit is a cherished sin.
  - While we cherish sin, we cannot be justified.
- **Atonement Blocked:**
  - In the sanctuary, blood was applied to cleanse sin.
  - Holding bitterness refuses the cleansing process (1 John 4:20).

---

## Slide 31 – Q13: Prayer in Affliction

- **Question:** What should we do when in affliction?
- **Key Text:** James 5:13 – “Is any among you afflicted? let him pray.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points

- **Response to Trials:**
  - Affliction should drive us to prayer, not despair or complaint.
  - Trials often refine character (Hebrews 12:6).
- **Victory:**
  - Prayer may not remove the affliction.
  - Victory is receiving the grace to bear it (2 Corinthians 12:9).

---

## Slide 33 – Q14: Secret Prayer

- **Question:** Should we pray in secret?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 6:6 – “But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points

- **The "Closet":**
  - Any place of privacy where the soul is alone with God.
- **Authenticity:**
  - In secret, the masks come off.
  - We confess secret sins we would never speak in public.
- **Sanctuary Type:**
  - The High Priest entered the Most Holy Place alone.
  - In secret prayer, we enter the audience chamber of the Most High.

---

## Slide 35 – Q15: Jesus' Example

- **Question:** To what places did our Saviour retire for secret devotion?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 14:23 – “And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, He was there alone.”

---

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points

- **The Divine Pattern:**
  - If the spotless Son of God needed to recharge through solitary prayer, how much more do we?
- **Communion with Nature:**
  - Quiet places (mountains, gardens) help the soul hear God's voice away from human noise.

---

## Slide 37 – Q16: Prayer Under Persecution

- **Question:** But if it should happen that we were thrown into the presence of those who ridicule prayer, or were forbidden to pray, should we give up our customary devotion?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:10 – “...he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.”

---

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points

- **Consistency:**
  - Daniel did not hide nor parade his faith; he did "as he did aforetime."
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - The law of the land conflicted with the Law of God.
  - Daniel chose obedience to God over life itself (Acts 5:29).
- **Sanctuary Focus:**
  - Daniel looked toward the earthly sanctuary's restoration.
  - We look by faith to the Heavenly Sanctuary where Jesus ministers.

---

## Slide 39 – Q17: Cornelius

- **Question:** What is said of Cornelius and his family?

  - He "prayed alway" and "gave much alms."
  - True prayer leads to benevolence and practical godliness.

---

## Slide 41 – Q18: Corporate Prayer

- **Question:** Did the apostolic believers have gatherings for prayer?
- **Key Text:** Acts 12:12 – “And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.”

---

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points

- **United Intercession:**
  - The church gathered to pray specifically for Peter's release from prison.
- **Power of Unity:**
  - United prayer moves the arm of Omnipotence (Matthew 18:19–20).

- **Key Text:** Ephesians 6:18 – “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.”

---

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points

---

## Slide 47 – Q20: Illustration

- **The Deep-Sea Diver:**
  - A diver relies on an air hose connected to the surface.
  - He cannot take a breath only once an hour; the connection must be constant.
- **Application:**
  - Prayer is our connection to the atmosphere of heaven while we walk on earth.

---

## Slide 48 – Q21: The Unjust Judge

- **Question:** In the parable of the importunate widow, what reason did the judge give for finally heeding her petition?
- **Key Text:** Luke 18:4, 5 – “Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.”

---

## Slide 49 – Q21: Key Points

- **Persistence:**
  - The judge acted solely to stop the annoyance of her "continual coming."
- **The Contrast:**
  - God is *not* like the unjust judge.
  - If a wicked man yields to persistence, how much more will a loving Father answer His children?

---

## Slide 50 – Q22: Application to the Last Days

- **Question:** How does the Saviour apply the parable?
- **Key Text:** Luke 18:6, 7 – “And the lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them?”

---

## Slide 51 – Q22: Key Points

- **"His Own Elect":**
  - Applies to God's people in the last days crying "day and night."
- **Bearing Long:**
  - God's delay is not indifference.
  - It allows character to be developed and patience to ripen (James 1:3–4).

---

## Slide 52 – Q23: God’s Timing

- **Question:** What does the Saviour conclude in answer to His own question on this point?
- **Key Text:** Luke 18:8 – “I tell you that He will avenge them speedily.”

---

  - He will not wait one moment longer than necessary for salvation and His glory.

---

## Slide 54 – Q24: Faith on Earth

- **Question:** What question does the Saviour immediately ask?
- **Key Text:** Luke 18:8 – “Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shalt He find faith on the earth?”

---

## Slide 55 – Q24: Key Points

- **The Great Apostasy:**
  - Suggests that true, persistent faith will be rare near the Second Coming.
- **End-Time Faith:**
