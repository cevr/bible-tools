## Slide 1 – Q1: The Four Beasts

- Question: What do the four beasts of Daniel 7 represent in the stream of
  history?
- Key Text: Daniel 7:2–3 – “Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night,
  and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four
  great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Prophetic Identity)

- **Prophecy Defined:**
  - History written in advance by God.
  - Isaiah 46:9–10 – “Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there
    is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, Declaring the end from
    the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done,
    saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.”
- **The Four Empires:**
  - **The Lion:** Babylon (605–538 B.C.).
  - **The Bear:** Medo-Persia (538–334 B.C.). It raised itself on one side,
    showing Persian dominance.
  - **The Leopard:** Grecia (334–168 B.C.). Four wings symbolize the speed of
    Alexander’s conquests.
  - **The Terrible Beast:** Pagan Rome (168 B.C. to 5th Century A.D.). The iron
    monarchy that crushed the nations.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Relay Race:**
  - Imagine a relay race where a torch is passed from one runner to another.
  - In Daniel 7, the "torch" of world dominance passes from Babylon to
    Medo-Persia, to Greece, and finally to Rome.
  - God gave this preview to show He knows the end from the beginning.
  - All earthly power is temporary; only God's Kingdom is eternal.
  - Daniel 2:44 – “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up
    a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left
    to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these
    kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Little Horn

- Question: Who is the "little horn" power described in Daniel 7, and what did
  it do?
- Key Text: Daniel 7:8 – “I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up
  among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first
  horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the
  eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Identity & Characteristics)

- **Identity:**
  - The "Little Horn" identifies **Papal Rome**, arising out of the fourth beast
    (Rome) among the ten horns (divided Europe).
  - It gained supremacy by **538 A.D.** after uprooting three opposing tribes
    (Heruli, Vandals, Ostrogoths).
- **Biblical Characteristics (Daniel 7:25):**
  - Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the most High, and
    shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and
    laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the
    dividing of time.”
  - **Blasphemy:** Speaking against the Most High.
  - **Persecution:** Wearing out the saints.
  - **Changing God’s Law:** Attempting to change "times and laws."

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (Christ vs. Anti-Christ)

- **The Spirit of Anti-Christ:**
  - This power represents a system that substitutes human works and earthly
    priesthood for Christ’s work.
  - True salvation is by faith alone in Christ’s merits.
  - Romans 3:28 – “Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith
    without the deeds of the law.”
- **One Mediator:**
  - Our standing before God relies solely on the High Priest in heaven, Jesus.
  - 1 Timothy 2:5 – “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
    the man Christ Jesus.”
  - Any system placing a human in Christ's place attacks the Gospel.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Symbols of Daniel 8

- Question: What symbols are introduced in Daniel 8, and how do they parallel
  Daniel 7?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:20–21 – “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the
  kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the
  great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Parallel Prophecies)

- **The Ram:**
  - Parallels the Bear of Daniel 7.
  - Represents **Medo-Persia** (538–334 B.C.).
- **The He-Goat:**
  - Parallels the Leopard of Daniel 7.
  - Represents **Grecia** (334–168 B.C.).
  - The "notable horn" is **Alexander the Great**.
- **The Little Horn (Daniel 8):**
  - Represents both **Pagan Rome** (political conquest) and **Papal Rome**
    (spiritual conquest).
  - While Daniel 7 focuses on politics, Daniel 8 focuses on the attack against
    the Sanctuary.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Camera Zoom:**
  - Think of a camera lens zooming in for a closer look.
  - **Daniel 2:** Showed a statue (the broad view of history).
  - **Daniel 7:** Showed beasts (the political nature of nations).
  - **Daniel 8:** Zooms in specifically on the conflict between these powers and
    the **Sanctuary of God**.
  - The focus shifts from "who rules the earth" to "who is attacking God's plan
    of salvation."

## Slide 10 – Q4: Attack on the Sanctuary

- Question: How does the Little Horn of Daniel 8 attack the Sanctuary and the
  Law?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:11 – “Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the
  host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his
  sanctuary was cast down.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Three-Fold Attack)

- **Against the People:**
  - Persecuting the saints (Daniel 8:24).
- **Against the Truth:**
  - Attempting to change the Law of God (Daniel 7:25), specifically the Sabbath.
- **Against the Sanctuary:**
  - The earthly temple was destroyed in A.D. 70, so this attack is against the
    **Heavenly Sanctuary**.
  - By establishing an earthly priesthood and the mass, the system obscured
    Christ's work in heaven.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (The "Daily")

- **The "Daily" (Tamid):**
  - Refers to the continual ministry of Christ as our High Priest in the Holy
    Place.
  - Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
    come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”
- **The Counterfeit:**
  - The Papacy set up an earthly counterfeit, directing eyes to man rather than
    to Christ.
  - It "cast down" the truth by hiding the direct access believers have to
    Jesus.

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Time Prophecy

- Question: What specific time prophecy is introduced in Daniel 8:14?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three
  hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (The Day-Year Principle)

- **The Longest Prophecy:**
  - 2300 prophetic days.
  - Daniel fainted before understanding the time element (Daniel 8:27); the
    explanation comes in Daniel 9.
- **The Scale of Prophecy:**
  - In Bible prophecy, one symbolic day equals one literal year.
  - Numbers 14:34 – “After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
    even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even
    forty years...”
  - Ezekiel 4:6 – “...I have appointed thee each day for a year.”
- **Conclusion:**
  - 2300 prophetic days = **2300 literal years**.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Map Scale:**
  - If a map says "1 inch = 100 miles," you cannot measure the distance with a
    ruler and say, "It is only 3 inches."
  - You must apply the scale to understand the reality.
  - Prophecy has a divine scale: 1 prophetic day = 1 solar year.
  - Without this key, the prophecy is a mystery; with it, it becomes a precise
    clock of history.

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Seventy Weeks

- Question: What is the "Seventy Weeks" prophecy, and when does the timeline
  begin?
- Key Text: Daniel 9:24 – “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon
  thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to
  make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
  righteousness...”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points (Start Date)

- **"Determined" means "Cut Off":**
  - The 70 weeks (490 years) were cut off from the longer 2300-year prophecy.
  - This time was allotted to the Jewish nation for their probation.
- **The Starting Point:**
  - The decree to restore and build Jerusalem (Daniel 9:25).
  - Historical Date: **457 B.C.** (Autumn), under Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:6-8).

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (The Math)

- **Calculating the Period:**
  - 70 weeks x 7 days = 490 prophetic days (490 literal years).
  - Start: **457 B.C.**
  - End: **A.D. 34**.
- **Probation:**
  - God gave the Jewish nation 490 years to accept the Messiah and fulfill their
    mission.
  - This period establishes the timeline for the coming of Jesus.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Pinpointing the Messiah

- Question: How does the Seventy-Week prophecy pinpoint the Messiah?
- Key Text: Daniel 9:26 – “And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be
  cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come
  shall destroy the city and the sanctuary...”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (The Chronology of Christ)

- **7 Weeks + 62 Weeks (483 Years):**
  - 457 B.C. + 483 years = **A.D. 27**.
  - **A.D. 27:** Jesus baptized and anointed (Luke 3:21-22). "Messiah" means
    "Anointed One."
- **The Final Week (A.D. 27 – A.D. 34):**
  - **A.D. 31 (Mid-week):** Messiah "cut off" (Crucified). The veil tore;
    earthly sacrifices lost meaning.
  - **A.D. 34 (End of week):** Stoning of Stephen; gospel goes to the Gentiles
    (Acts 7:59; 8:4).

## Slide 21 – Q7: Application (Substitution)

- **"Not for Himself":**
  - The prophecy states Messiah was cut off, "but not for himself."
  - This is the heart of the Gospel: **Substitution**.
  - He took our death so that we might have His life.
  - Our justification is grounded in this historical event predicted centuries
    in advance.

## Slide 22 – Q8: End of the 2300 Days

- Question: When does the 2300-year prophecy end, and what is the "Cleansing of
  the Sanctuary"?
- Key Text: Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three
  hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (1844 Calculation)

- **The Calculation:**
  - Total Period: 2300 years.
  - First Part (70 weeks): 490 years (Ended A.D. 34).
  - Remaining Time: 2300 - 490 = 1810 years.
  - A.D. 34 + 1810 years = **A.D. 1844**.
- **The Event:**
  - Jesus entered the **Most Holy Place** of the heavenly sanctuary.
  - He began the work of **Investigative Judgment** (Cleansing the Sanctuary).

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points (Cleansing & Experience)

- **Meaning of Cleansing:**
  - Like the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), this is the removal of the record
    of sin.
  - Christ reviews the lives of believers to blot out sins before His return.
- **Practical Application:**
  - A corresponding work must happen in our hearts.
  - We cooperate with Him to have every sin rooted out by faith.
  - “Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in
    His church.” (_Christ's Object Lessons_, p. 69).

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Courtroom:**
  - Imagine a courtroom scene.
  - Before the Judge delivers the verdict, evidence is examined (the opening of
    the books).
  - Since 1844, Jesus stands as High Priest to plead His blood.
  - The question is not "Are you good enough?" but "Are you covered by the
    Blood?"
  - Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
    keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”
