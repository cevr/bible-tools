### Q1. According to God's standard of judgment, how many can be justified?
"And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified." Ps. 143:2.

**Answer:**
The Psalmist here acknowledges a fundamental truth of the Great Controversy: humanity, in its fallen state, is utterly unable to meet the claims of God’s holy law.

*   **The Standard of Judgment:** God’s law is a transcript of His character—holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12). It requires perfect, perpetual obedience. Since the fall of Adam, human nature has been depraved; therefore, "all have sinned" (Romans 3:23).
*   **The Human Dilemma:** If God were to judge us solely on our own merits and record, no living soul could stand. Our best performances are stained with selfishness and imperfection (Isaiah 64:6).
*   **The Need for a Substitute:** Because we cannot justify ourselves, we are in desperate need of a righteousness that comes from outside of us—a righteousness that can stand the scrutiny of the judgment.

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** A legal term meaning to be declared righteous; to be acquitted of all guilt and treated as if one had never sinned. It is the opposite of condemnation (Romans 8:1; 5:16).

[ILL]
Imagine a man standing in a courtroom with a ledger of unpayable debts (sins). The judge asks, "Can you pay this?" The man checks his pockets and finds them empty. He cannot justify his financial standing by showing empty pockets. He needs a benefactor to deposit the full amount into his account before the court sits. So it is with the sinner; we have no currency of righteousness to pay our debt to the law.

***

### Q2. How may one become justified?
"By his knowledge shall My righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities." Isa. 53:11.

**Answer:**
Justification is not achieved by ignoring the law, but by satisfying its claims through a Substitute.

*   **The Righteous Servant:** This prophecy points directly to Jesus Christ. He is the only human who has ever lived a life of perfect obedience to the law of God (Hebrews 4:15).
*   **Bearing Iniquities:** In the sanctuary service, the innocent lamb bore the sins of the offerer. Similarly, Christ took upon Himself the guilt of the world. He paid the penalty the law demanded (death) so that the sinner could go free.
*   **Justification by Knowledge:** To "know" Him is not merely intellectual assent. In Scripture, to know God is to be in an intimate, covenant relationship with Him (John 17:3). Through this vital connection with Christ, His righteousness is accounted to us.

[ILL]
In the ancient sanctuary, when a sinner brought a lamb, he laid his hand on its head and confessed his sin. The sin was symbolically transferred from the man to the lamb. The man walked away clean, not because he was innocent, but because the lamb had "borne his iniquity." Christ is the Lamb of God (John 1:29).

### Q3. By whom and by what are men justified?
"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." Rom. 3:23, 24.

**Answer:**
Here we see the source and the method of our salvation.

*   **The Source: Grace.** We are justified "freely by His grace."
    *   **Definition:** **Grace** is unmerited favor—God’s love and power given to those who deserve exactly the opposite.
*   **The Method: Redemption.** This word implies a "buying back." We had sold ourselves into the slavery of sin, and the price of release was the blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18–19).
*   **The Agent: Christ Jesus.** There is no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12). The Father provides the plan, the Son provides the payment, and the Spirit applies the work to our hearts.

**Key Point:** Note the word "freely." It costs us nothing, but it cost Heaven everything.

***

### Q4. Why cannot men be justified by the deeds of the law?
"For by the law is the knowledge of sin." Rom. 3:20.

**Answer:**
Many struggle with the idea that they can earn heaven by being "good enough." The Bible rejects this emphatically.

*   **The Function of the Law:** The law acts as a diagnostic tool, not a cure. It reveals God's standard of righteousness. When a sinner looks into the law (the Ten Commandments), he sees his own moral deformity.
*   **No Power to Save:** The law condemns the transgressor; it has no power to forgive past sins or to empower future obedience. It says, "Do this and live," but the sinner cannot do it in his own strength (Romans 8:3).
*   **The Necessity of the Gospel:** Because the law only brings the "knowledge of sin," we must look away from the law to the Saviour for the remedy.

[ILL]
A mirror is excellent for showing you that your face is dirty. However, you cannot take the mirror off the wall and use it to scrub your face clean. The mirror (the Law) points you to the soap and water (Christ's blood and grace). Trying to be saved by keeping the law is like trying to wash your face with a mirror—it doesn't work, and was never designed to do so.

***

### Q5. Can the unrighteous be saved?
"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" 1 Cor. 6:9.

**Answer:**
This verse guards against the error of "cheap grace"—the idea that God saves men *in* their sins, rather than *from* them.

*   **The Nature of the Kingdom:** Heaven is a place of perfect purity. If an unrighteous person were admitted to heaven, they would be miserable in the presence of a holy God.
*   **The Transformation:** Justification is not a legal fiction where God pretends we are righteous while we remain wicked. It is the beginning of a real transformation. When God justifies, He also begins the work of sanctification (making us holy).
*   **The Warning:** Those who cherish sin and refuse to surrender it cannot inherit the kingdom, for they reject the very character of the King.

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit imparts Christ's nature to the believer, transforming their character to align with God's law (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

***

### Q6. Through whose righteousness is remission of sins obtained?
"Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God." Rom. 3:24, 25.

**Answer:**
*   **Propitiation:** This word refers to the "mercy seat" on the Ark of the Covenant in the earthly sanctuary. The law was inside the ark, condemning the sinner. The mercy seat was above it, sprinkled with atoning blood.
*   **Christ as Mercy Seat:** Christ stands between the condemned sinner and the broken law. His blood satisfies the claims of justice so that mercy can be extended.
*   **Remission of Past Sins:** When we come to Christ, the record of our past life is wiped clean. God "remits" or sends away the penalty. This is possible only because Christ's righteousness is perfect and His sacrifice is sufficient.

[ILL]
In the sanctuary service, the High Priest sprinkled blood upon the mercy seat to make atonement (Leviticus 16). This foreshadowed Christ presenting His own blood in the heavenly sanctuary, securing our pardon and cleansing.

***

### Q7. For what was Christ made sin?
"For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him." 2 Cor. 5:21.

**Answer:**
This is the "Great Exchange," the heart of the gospel.

1.  **Christ took what was ours:** He was "made to be sin." Though He never committed a sin, He felt the crushing weight, the darkness, and the separation from God that sin causes (Matthew 27:46). He died the death that belonged to us.
2.  **We receive what is His:** In exchange, we are "made the righteousness of God." We do not just receive a clean slate; we are credited with the positive, perfect life of Jesus.

**Key Doctrine:** This righteousness is "in Him." We possess it only as we remain connected to Christ by faith. It is not a commodity handed to us to use independently; it is a relationship.

***

### Q8. Then what may we call the Saviour?
"And this is His name whereby He shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness." Jer. 23:6.

**Answer:**
*   **A New Name:** In the Bible, a name signifies character. Jeremiah reveals that Christ’s very identity, relative to His people, is "Our Righteousness" (Yahweh Tsidkenu).
*   **Total Dependence:** We have no righteousness of our own to offer. As the prophet Isaiah says, our own righteousnesses are as "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6). Therefore, Christ Himself *is* our standing before God.
*   **Assurance:** When Satan accuses us, we do not point to our own good deeds. We point to Jesus and say, "He is my righteousness."

***

### Q9. On what condition may we obtain this righteousness and justification?
"To declare, I say, at this time His righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus." Rom. 3:26.

**Answer:**
*   **The Condition is Faith:** God does not sell this righteousness for money, penance, or pilgrimages. It is received solely by believing in Jesus.
*   **Just and Justifier:** This is the great problem of the ages—how can a just God forgive a guilty sinner without compromising His justice? The answer is the Cross. The penalty was paid by Christ.
    *   God is **Just** because He did not ignore the penalty of the law.
    *   He is the **Justifier** because He accepted Christ's payment on our behalf.

**Definition:**
*   **Faith:** The hand that reaches out to accept the gift of God. It is not a meritorious work; it is simply trusting God's word and accepting His provision.

***

### Q10. Who may obtain this imputed righteousness?
"Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference." Rom. 3:22.

**Answer:**
*   **Universal Offer:** The offer extends "unto all." No one is excluded because of race, class, or the depth of their past sins.
*   **Limited Receipt:** It comes "upon all them that believe." While the provision is universal, the application is limited to those who exercise faith.
*   **Imputed Righteousness:** This refers to the righteousness of Christ credited to our account for our justification (Title to Heaven).

**Definition:**
*   **Imputed Righteousness:** Christ’s character reckoned to us. It changes our standing before God (Justification).
*   **Imparted Righteousness:** Christ’s character lived out in us by the Holy Spirit. It changes our actual nature (Sanctification).

***

### Q11. Sin is the transgression of God's law (1 John 3:4), and by this law is the knowledge of sin. (Rom. 3:20). Can one, while persisting in sin, expect justification?
"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid." Gal. 2:17.

**Answer:**
*   **No License to Sin:** Paul strongly rejects the idea that grace gives us permission to continue sinning ("God forbid").
*   **Christ is not a Minister of Sin:** If Christ justified us while we willfully continued in rebellion, He would be sustaining sin. His mission is to "save His people *from* their sins" (Matthew 1:21), not *in* them.
*   **The Goal is Restoration:** Justification is the gateway to a new life of obedience. We are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone—it produces the fruit of obedience.

If a doctor cures a man of alcohol poisoning, does he do it so the man can go back to drinking? No. He cures him to give him a fresh start at a healthy life. To return to the poison is to despise the cure.

### Q12. In order to have one's sins forgiven, and his unrighteousness cleansed away, what is necessary?
"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9.

**Answer:**
*   **The Necessity of Confession:** Genuine justification requires genuine repentance. We must acknowledge our guilt without making excuses. "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy" (Proverbs 28:13).
*   **Faithful and Just:**
    *   **Faithful:** He has promised to forgive, and He keeps His word.
    *   **Just:** Because Christ has paid the price, Justice demands that the penitent sinner be released.
*   **Twofold Work:** Notice the verse promises two things:
    1.  **Forgiveness:** Judicial pardon (Justification).
    2.  **Cleansing:** Removal of unrighteousness from the heart (Sanctification).

***

### Q13. Can one be purified without obedience?
"And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith." Acts 15:9. "Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth,... see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently." 1 Pet. 1:22.

**Answer:**
*   **The Mechanism of Purification:** Acts 15:9 says hearts are purified "by faith." 1 Peter 1:22 says souls are purified "in obeying the truth." These are not contradictory.
*   **Obedience of Faith:** True faith inevitably leads to obedience (Romans 1:5). You cannot truly believe God is the King and refuse to obey His commands.
*   **The Result:** A heart purified from selfishness naturally results in fervent love for others. This is the fulfillment of the law (Romans 13:10).

**Key Point:** We do not obey *to get* purified; we obey because faith is laying hold of Christ's purifying power. Obedience is the visible evidence of invisible faith.

***

### Q14. Does the fact that we are justified, or made righteous, by faith, release us from obligation to keep God's law?
"Do we then make void the law through faith? God for- bid: yea, we establish the law." Rom. 3:31.

**Answer:**
This is a cornerstone of Adventist theology regarding the Covenants.

*   **Making Void the Law:** To claim that faith abolishes the Ten Commandments is to misunderstand the purpose of the Cross. If the law could have been changed or abolished, Christ need not have died.
*   **Establishing the Law:** Faith establishes the law in two ways:
    1.  **In the Atonement:** It affirms the law's justice by acknowledging that the penalty (death) had to be paid.
    2.  **In the Heart:** Under the New Covenant, God writes His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). The justified believer, empowered by the Spirit, begins to love and keep the law that he once hated and broke.

[ILL]
A man is thrown in prison for breaking the speed limit and causing damage. A benevolent friend pays his massive fine and sets him free. Does this act of grace mean the man is now free to speed and drive recklessly again? On the contrary, his gratitude to the friend establishes his obligation to drive carefully. The law is not destroyed by the payment of the fine; it is honored.

***

### Q15. What is faith?
"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Heb. 11:1.

**Answer:**
*   **Substance (Assurance):** Faith is not a wish or a feeling. It is the "title deed" (substance) of things we cannot yet see. It treats God's promises as present realities.
*   **Taking God at His Word:** Faith accepts that if God says we are forgiven, we are forgiven, even if we do not *feel* forgiven.
*   **The Root of Righteousness:** This faith is the connecting link between human weakness and Divine power. It is the victory that overcomes the world (1 John 5:4).

***

### Q16. When one does this, and is in perfect accord with all of God's commandments, what may he then have?
"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Rom. 5:1.

**Answer:**
*   **The End of Hostility:** Sin is rebellion; it is war against God's government. When we surrender and accept Christ's righteousness, the war is over.
*   **Peace with God:** This is not merely a subjective feeling of calmness, but an objective status of reconciliation. We are no longer enemies, but sons and daughters.
*   **Through our Lord Jesus:** This peace is always mediated through Christ. He is our "Prince of Peace."

***

### Q17. In what way may we hold our justification and fellowship with God?
"But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin." 1 John 1:7.

**Answer:**
*   **A Continual Walk:** Justification is not a one-time event that locks in salvation regardless of future choices. It initiates a "walk."
*   **Walking in the Light:** This means living in responsiveness to God's revealed will. As we study His Word, we gain more light (truth). To reject new light is to step back into darkness.
*   **Continuous Cleansing:** Notice the verb tense—"cleanseth" (present continuous). As we walk with Him, the blood of Christ continually applies to our lives, covering our mistakes and cleansing our character from the defilement of sin.

***

### Q18. How great will be the peace of mind enjoyed by those who have this experience?
"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." Phil. 4:7.

**Answer:**
*   **Beyond Understanding:** The world cannot understand how a Christian can be calm in the midst of trials, persecution, or the approach of judgment. This peace comes from the assurance that our life is hid with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3).
*   **A Garrison:** The word "keep" here means to guard like a military garrison. The peace of God stands guard over our emotions (hearts) and our thoughts (minds), protecting us from the assaults of doubt and fear.

***

### Q19. What will be a prominent characteristic of those who wait for the return of their Lord from heaven?
"For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him." Heb. 10:37, 38.

**Answer:**
*   **Living by Faith:** As we approach the Second Coming ("He that shall come"), we will face times of trouble where earthly support will fail. The righteous will live solely by their connection to Christ.
*   **Perseverance:** The danger is "drawing back"—returning to the world or giving up confidence in God's word.
*   **The Great Controversy Context:** God takes "no pleasure" in those who draw back because they prove that they do not trust Him. The final generation will vindicate God's character by trusting Him completely, even when they cannot buy or sell (Revelation 13:17).

***

### Q20. What will accompany the faith of Jesus?
"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Rev 14:12.

**Answer:**
This verse describes the final product of the plan of salvation—the "remnant" who stand just before Christ returns.

*   **The Fruit of Justification:** They are not legalists trying to earn heaven; they are "saints" (made holy by Christ).
*   **Keeping the Commandments:** Because they have the "faith of Jesus" (the same quality of trust and dependence that Jesus had in the Father), the law of God is written on their hearts. They keep the commandments—including the Sabbath—not to be saved, but because they are saved and love the Lawgiver.
*   **Harmony of Law and Gospel:** In the final conflict, these believers demonstrate that Justification by Faith leads to Sanctified Obedience. They prove that God's law can be kept by humanity through the indwelling power of Christ.

[ILL]
A train runs on two rails. If you try to run on only one, you crash. The Christian life runs on the two rails of the Law (God’s standard) and the Gospel (God’s power/grace). The Third Angel’s Message of Revelation 14 brings these two rails together perfectly: "Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
