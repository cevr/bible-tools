### Q1. What is the meaning of the word hospitality?
**“Reception and entertainment of strangers or guests, without reward, or with kind and generous liberality." Webster.**

**Answer:**
The term hospitality implies a spirit of openness and welcome that seeks no personal gain. In the biblical sense, it is the practical outworking of the gospel in social relationships. It is not merely the act of providing food or shelter, but the spirit in which it is done—"without reward."

*   **Selflessness:** True hospitality kills selfishness. The natural heart asks, "What is in it for me?" The converted heart asks, "What can I do for you?"
*   **Liberality:** This term refers to freedom from narrowness or stinginess. A liberal soul gives freely, trusting in God’s provision (Isaiah 32:8).
*   **A Type of the Gospel:** Just as Christ received us when we were "strangers and foreigners" (Ephesians 2:19) without asking for payment, we are to receive others.

**[ILL] The Open Door:** Imagine a home with the door always bolted, the curtains drawn, and the owner hoarding supplies inside. This represents the heart of the sinner turned inward. Hospitality is the unbolting of the door, allowing the light of God’s love to shine out and the weary traveler to come in. It is the evidence that the heart has been unlocked by the keys of the Kingdom.

### Q2. What, then, are the characteristics of true hospitality?
**Kindness, generosity, and love, or charity.**

**Answer:**
Hospitality is more than a social duty; it is a grace of the Spirit.
*   **Kindness:** This is the atmosphere of heaven. It is the "law of kindness" on the tongue and in the hands (Proverbs 31:26).
*   **Generosity:** A reflection of the Creator, who gives to all men liberally and upbraideth not (James 1:5).
*   **Charity (Agape Love):** In the King James Version, "charity" often translates the Greek word *agape*, which is self-sacrificing, divine love. Hospitality is this love in action. It is the "faith which worketh by love" (Galatians 5:6).

**Definition:**
*   **Charity:** The highest form of love; not merely almsgiving, but a disposition of the heart that seeks the eternal and temporal welfare of others, regardless of their merit (1 Corinthians 13).

---

### Q3. As genuine hospitality must flow from love for our fellow beings, what is fulfilled by its exercise?
**“Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is fulfilling of the law." Rom. 13:10. See also Gal. 5:13, 14.**

**Answer:**
Here we see the inseparable link between the Law and the Gospel.
*   **The Purpose of the Law:** The law of God is a transcript of His character, which is love (1 John 4:8). Therefore, to keep the law is to love.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot fulfill this law by mere outward compliance or human effort. "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be" (Romans 8:7). Only when Christ dwells in the heart by faith can we truly love our neighbor and thus truly fulfill the law.
*   **Active Obedience:** Fulfilling the law is not just *avoiding* harm (not killing, not stealing); it is *doing* good. Hospitality is the positive side of the commandment "Thou shalt not kill"—it preserves and nourishes life.

---

### Q4. What law is here referred to?
**“For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false wit- ness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Rom. 13:9.**

**Answer:**
The Apostle Paul refers specifically to the **Second Table of the Decalogue** (the Ten Commandments), which governs our relationship with our fellow man.
*   **The Unity of the Law:** You cannot break one commandment without violating the principle of love that underlies them all (James 2:10).
*   **Hospitality as Commandment-Keeping:** To turn away a needy stranger when we have the means to help is a violation of the spirit of the sixth commandment (life preservation) and the eighth commandment (stewardship of God's goods).
*   **Sanctification:** Sanctification is the writing of this law upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10). When the Holy Spirit writes the law within us, hospitality becomes our nature, not a burden.

**[ILL] The Fruit Tree:** A command to "bear apples" is burdensome to a thorn bush. But to an apple tree, bearing apples is natural—it is the result of the life within. When we are grafted into Christ (the Vine), keeping the law of love through hospitality becomes the natural fruit of our connection to Him.

### Q5. Is hospitality enjoined as a duty?
**“Be not forgetful to entertain strangers." Heb. 13:2. "Use hospitality one to another." 1 Peter 4:9. "The stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself." Lev. 19:34.**

**Answer:**
Yes, it is a divine imperative found in both the Old and New Testaments.
1.  **A Duty, Not an Option:** The Bible does not say, "Entertain strangers if you feel like it." It is a command, as binding as "Thou shalt not steal."
2.  **Continuity of Truth:** Note that Leviticus (OT) and Hebrews (NT) teach the same doctrine. God's standard of love has never changed.
3.  **The Stranger:** In the ancient world, a stranger had no legal protection. God stepped in as their Protector and commanded His people to be their refuge.

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctuary:** A holy place of refuge and worship. Our homes are to be "little sanctuaries" where the presence of God is felt, and where the weary can find physical and spiritual rest.

---

### Q6. Why ought we thus to exercise charity , or hospitality, to strangers?
**“For the Lord your God is God of gods, ...and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. Love ye therefore the stranger." Deut. 10:17-19.**

**Answer:**
The primary motivation for Christian ethics is the imitation of God.
*   **God’s Character:** God "loveth the stranger." He sends rain on the just and the unjust (Matthew 5:45). If we claim to be His children, we must share His character.
*   **Our Past Condition:** The Israelites were strangers in Egypt; they were to remember their deliverance. Likewise, every Christian was once a stranger to the covenant of promise, without God in the world (Ephesians 2:12). We practice hospitality because God first practiced hospitality toward us by bringing us into His family.

**[ILL] The Moon:** The moon has no light of its own; it merely reflects the sun. If the moon goes dark, it is because the earth has come between it and the sun. If we have no love for strangers, it is because the "world" has come between us and the Son of Righteousness.

---

### Q7. Prove that it enters into the foundation of Christian character.
**“Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction." James 1:27.**

**Answer:**
*   **Evidential Faith:** James teaches that faith without works is dead. True religion is not merely holding correct doctrines (orthodoxy) but living out the life of Christ (orthopraxy).
*   **The Test of Character:** It is easy to love those who can love us back. The foundation of Christian character is tested by how we treat the "widow and the fatherless"—those who cannot repay us.
*   **Defilement vs. Purity:** Selfishness defiles the soul. Self-sacrificing love purifies it. This is the essence of the "faith that works."

---

### Q8. Who are under the obligation to exercise hospitality?
**“I beseech you therefore, brethren, ...be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love, ...distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality." Rom. 12:1, 10, 13. "Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man, well reported of for good works; ...if she have lodged strangers, ...if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work." 1 Tim. 5:9, 10. "Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man." Eccl. 12:13.**

**Answer:**
The obligation rests upon **every believer**, regardless of status.
*   **The "Brethren":** Romans 12 addresses the whole church.
*   **The Widows:** Even those with little means (like the widows in 1 Timothy) were expected to have a reputation for lodging strangers.
*   **Universal Duty:** Solomon sums it up as the "whole duty of man." No one is exempt from the law of love.

**Practical Application:** You do not need a large house to be hospitable. A cup of cold water given in Jesus' name, a shared crust of bread, or a listening ear offered in a small room is as precious to God as a banquet in a palace.

---

### Q9. But are not those who are called to be ministers of the gospel exempt from this obligation?
**“A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality." 1 Tim. 3:2. " A bishop must be... a lover of hospitality." Titus 1:7, 8.**

**Answer:**
Far from being exempt, ministers and elders ("bishops") are called to be **examples** of hospitality.
*   **Leadership by Example:** The shepherd must lead the flock not just in doctrine, but in lifestyle. If a minister’s home is closed and cold, his preaching on God's love will lack power.
*   **Open Heart, Open Home:** A minister acts as an under-shepherd for Christ. Just as Christ is accessible to all who seek Him, the minister should be accessible and welcoming to the sheep.

---

### Q10. Upon whom should hospitality be bestowed?
**“Use hospitality one to another." 1 Peter 4:9. "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith." Gal. 6:10.**

**Answer:**
There is a balance in the distribution of hospitality:
1.  **"One to Another" (Fellow Believers):** The church is a family. We have a special responsibility to care for our brothers and sisters in Christ ("the household of faith"). If we neglect our own spiritual family, we deny the faith (1 Timothy 5:8 principle).
2.  **"All Men":** Our love must not stop at the church door. We are to do good to all as we have opportunity. This includes the unbeliever, the stranger, and the neighbor.

**[ILL] The Circles:** Think of a stone dropped in a pond. The ripples start at the center but expand outward to the very edge. Our love begins in the home, extends to the church, and then reaches out to the entire world.

---

### Q11. Should hospitality be exercised to those who are our enemies?
**“If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink." Rom. 12:20.**

**Answer:**
This is the pinnacle of Christian grace and the ultimate test of **Righteousness by Faith**.
*   **Supernatural Love:** It is human nature to hate an enemy. It is the *divine nature* imparted to the believer that allows them to feed an enemy.
*   **The Example of Jesus:** "While we were yet sinners [enemies], Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).
*   **Victory over Self:** To feed an enemy requires a death to self and a total reliance on the Spirit of Christ. This is sanctification in its most practical form.

---

### Q12. What is said of those who make a distinction between rich and poor?
**“My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment, and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool; are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?" "If ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin." James 2:1-4, 9.**

**Answer:**
*   **The Sin of Partiality:** Treating people differently based on wealth or status is defined here as "sin." It violates the royal law of love.
*   **Equality at the Cross:** In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ ministers for the beggar as earnestly as for the king. The church on earth must reflect the sanctuary in heaven.
*   **Judges of Evil Thoughts:** To value a person by their "gold ring" is to judge by carnal, worldly standards rather than God's standards. God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).

**Definition:**
*   **Respect of Persons:** Showing favoritism; giving honor based on external factors like money, race, or clothing rather than character.

---

### Q13. In what spirit should hospitality be exercised?
**“Use hospitality one to another without grudging." 1 Peter 4:9. "Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers." 3 John 1:5. "And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor... and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing." 1 Cor. 13:3.**

**Answer:**
The motive is everything.
*   **Without Grudging:** God loves a cheerful giver (2 Corinthians 9:7). If we serve guests while secretly complaining about the cost or the effort, the service is rejected by Heaven.
*   **Faithfully:** Hospitality is a stewardship. We are managing God's property.
*   **The Nothingness of Works alone:** 1 Corinthians 13 teaches that you can give away *everything* you own, but if the motive isn't *agape* love, it counts for zero in the book of heaven. This proves we are not saved by the works themselves, but the works are the visible fruit of a saving relationship with Love Himself.

---

### Q14. Whom do we honor when we exercise hospitality?
**“And the King shall answer and say unto them, ...In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me." Matt. 25:40.**

**Answer:**
We honor Jesus Christ Himself.
*   **The Incarnational Principle:** Jesus identifies so closely with His suffering children that He feels their hunger and their loneliness.
*   **The Privilege:** We often wish we could have lived in Galilee to invite Jesus to dinner like Mary and Martha did. We *can* do this today. When we welcome the outcast, we are hosting the King of Glory.

---

### Q15. What was the Saviour speaking about on this occasion?
**“For I was a hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me." Matt. 25:35, 36.**

**Answer:**
Christ was describing the **Final Judgment** (The separation of the sheep and goats).
*   **The Basis of Judgment:** The judgment reviews the life record. While we are justified by faith alone, our works provide the evidence of that faith.
*   **The Fruit of Salvation:** The "sheep" did not do these works to *earn* heaven (they were surprised by the reward, asking "When saw we thee?"). They did these works instinctively because they possessed the nature of Christ.
*   **RBF Application:** This passage proves that a "faith" that does not produce love and hospitality is a counterfeit. Genuine righteousness imparted by the Spirit always results in service to humanity.

---

### Q16. What effect has hospitality on those who exercise it?
**“It is more blessed to give than to receive." Acts 20:35. "The liberal soul shall be made fat; and he that watereth ...shall be watered also himself." Prov. 11:25. "He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor." Prov. 22:9.**

**Answer:**
*   **Spiritual Health:** Just as a stream must flow out to stay fresh, the soul must give to remain spiritually alive. Stagnant water becomes poisonous; a stagnant soul becomes selfish and miserable.
*   **Reciprocity of Grace:** When we "water" others, God ensures our own souls are refreshed. We cannot pour out blessings on others without getting a few drops on ourselves.
*   **"Made Fat":** A Hebraism meaning prosperous, healthy, and thriving in spirit.

**[ILL] The Dead Sea vs. Galilee:** The Sea of Galilee takes in water and gives it out; it is full of life and fish. The Dead Sea takes in water but gives nothing out; it is dead and salty. Hospitality makes us like Galilee; selfishness makes us like the Dead Sea.

---

### Q17. What is the effect of hospitality shown to an enemy?
**“In so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head." Rom. 12:20.**

**Answer:**
*   **Melting Hardness:** This metaphor refers to the ancient method of smelting metal. To melt hard ore, coals were piled around and on top of it.
*   **Redemptive Love:** Kindness shown to an enemy "burns" their conscience, not to destroy them, but to melt down their hatred and hardness of heart. It is the only weapon that can turn an enemy into a friend.

---

### Q18. Is there any reward promised to those who show hospitality?
**“He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward. And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward." Matt. 10:41, 42.**

**Answer:**
Yes, God notes every act of kindness.
*   **Participation in Ministry:** If you support a prophet or a righteous worker by sustaining them with hospitality, God views you as a partner in their work. You share in the souls they win.
*   **God's Memory:** Not even a "cup of cold water" escapes the notice of our High Priest. In the investigative judgment, these small acts of love are preserved as precious jewels in the character of the saint.

---

### Q19. Will a person lose anything in this life by being hospitable?
**“He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack." Prov. 28:27. "He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again." Prov. 19:17. "Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom." Luke 6:38.**

**Answer:**
According to divine economics, no.
*   **Lending to God:** When you give to the needy, God considers Himself the borrower. He always repays His debts, often with interest.
*   **Faith vs. Fear:** Fear says, "If I share, I won't have enough." Faith says, "My God shall supply all your need" (Philippians 4:19).
*   **Practical Providence:** Often, the hospitable person finds that when they are in need, God raises up others to help them, fulfilling the promise of "measure for measure."

---

### Q20. What will be the final reward for hospitality?
**“Come ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was a hungered, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me in." Matt. 25:34, 35.**

**Answer:**
*   **Inheritance:** The ultimate reward is the Kingdom of Glory.
*   **The Great Homecoming:** We who were once strangers on earth are welcomed into the mansions Christ has prepared (John 14:1-3). Because we showed the spirit of heaven (love) while on earth, we are fitted to live in heaven for eternity.
*   **Sanctuary Fulfilled:** The Tabernacle of God will finally be with men (Revelation 21:3). God will exercise eternal hospitality toward us, wiping away every tear and feeding us from the Tree of Life.

---

### Q21. What Bible characters were especially noted for hospitality?
**“And he [Abraham] lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground... And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat." Genesis 18:2-8.**

**Answer:**
Abraham is the father of the faithful and a model of hospitality.
*   **Eagerness:** Notice the action verbs: he *ran*, he *hastened*. He did not begrudgingly serve; he was eager to bless.
*   **Unaware of Dignity:** He thought he was serving three weary travelers. He did not know he was serving the Lord and two angels.
*   **The Lesson:** "Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares" (Hebrews 13:2). Like Abraham, we should treat every guest with the dignity we would afford a messenger from heaven.
