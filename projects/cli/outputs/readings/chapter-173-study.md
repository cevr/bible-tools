### Q1. What important wish (prayer, margin) is expressed by the apostle concerning Gaius?

"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." 3 John 1:2.

**Answer:**

The apostle John, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, establishes a vital link between our physical condition and our spiritual experience. This verse reveals that God takes pleasure in the physical well-being of His people, just as He desires their spiritual growth.

1.  **The Connection of Body and Mind:** The brain is the capital of the body. It is the only medium through which the Holy Spirit communicates with the human mind. If the body is sick or enfeebled due to poor habits, the nerves of the brain become weakened, making it difficult to think clearly about eternal realities or to exercise faith (Romans 10:17).
2.  **A Balanced Life:** God does not value the soul *at the expense* of the body. True religion does not ignore physical laws. Rather, as the soul prospers in the grace of Christ, the believer seeks to bring the body into harmony with God’s laws of health, creating a "prosperous" whole man.
3.  **Sanctification involves the Body:** We cannot separate our physical habits from our spiritual walk. A clear mind is essential for discerning the will of God and for the work of **Sanctification**—the process by which the Holy Spirit restores the image of God in the believer (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

*   **Definition—Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the believer is made holy, separated from sin, and conformed to the image of Christ (2 Thessalonians 2:13; Hebrews 10:14).

**[ILL]** A musician may have a masterpiece in his heart to play, but if the strings of his instrument are broken or out of tune, the music will be distorted. The Holy Spirit desires to play the melody of heaven through our lives. Our body is the instrument; if we neglect it, we hinder the Spirit's expression through us.

### Q2. Why is it necessary to preserve the body in health?

"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." Rom. 12:1.

**Answer:**

Here the apostle Paul uses the imagery of the ancient sanctuary service to describe the Christian life.

1.  **A Living Sacrifice:** In the earthly sanctuary, the animal brought for sacrifice had to be "without blemish" (Leviticus 22:21). Now, we do not offer dead animals; we offer *ourselves*. Because we are bought by the blood of Christ, we are to present our bodies to Him in the best possible condition.
2.  **Reasonable Service:** The phrase implies a logical, rational act of worship. Since God created the body and Christ redeemed it (1 Corinthians 6:20), it is only logical that we care for it to serve Him efficiently.
3.  **Response to Grace:** Notice the motivation: "by the mercies of God." We do not keep health laws to *earn* God's favor (Legalism), but because we have *already received* His mercy. It is the fruit of **Justification**—because we are saved, we desire to please our Savior.
4.  **The Vessel of Service:** God uses human agents to finish His work on earth. A sickly body, caused by willful violation of nature's laws, limits our usefulness in the Master's service.

*   **Definition—Justification:** God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous, pardoned, and accepted solely because of Christ’s merits, not human works (Romans 3:24–28).

**[ILL]** If you were given a priceless diamond by a King to carry to a distant land, you would not carry it in a torn, dirty sack, lest it be lost or devalued. The "diamond" is the Gospel message and the indwelling Spirit; the "sack" is our body. We must keep the vessel strong to carry the treasure (2 Corinthians 4:7).

### Q3. When one is truly sanctified, how much of him will be affected?

“And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Thess. 5:23.

**Answer:**

This text strikes a death blow to the idea that religion is only about the "spirit" while the body may be indulged in sin.

1.  **Wholly Sanctified:** True **Sanctification** is not partial. It extends to the *spirit* (the higher faculties of mind and conscience), the *soul* (the life, emotions, and personality), and the *body* (the physical flesh and structure).
2.  **Preparation for Translation:** The prayer is that we be preserved blameless *unto the coming of our Lord.* This indicates a special work of preparation for those who will live through the final days and see Jesus come.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith in the Body:** The God of peace does this work *in* us. We cooperate by surrendering our appetites to Him. As we yield, He writes His law—including the laws of health—upon our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). We cannot make ourselves holy, but we must stop poisoning the temple He intends to sanctify.

**[ILL]** A house cannot be called "clean" if the living room is tidy but the basement is full of rotting garbage. So a man cannot be "holy" if he claims to love Jesus with his spirit but pollutes his body—the basement of his being—with defiling habits. God wants the whole house clean.

### Q4. How did the apostle guard himself?

"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway." 1 Cor. 9:27.

**Answer:**

Paul recognized the fierce battle between the higher nature (guided by the Spirit) and the lower nature (passions and appetites).

1.  **The Struggle for Mastery:** The "body" here represents the fleshly appetites and carnal desires. Paul did not abuse his body (asceticism), but he strictly disciplined his appetites. He made his body a servant to his mind, rather than his mind a slave to his body.
2.  **The Danger of Falling:** Even the great apostle realized that if he allowed his physical appetites to rule him, he could become a "castaway" (disqualified or rejected). This teaches us that we are not "once saved, always saved" regardless of our conduct. We must "hold fast" till the end (Hebrews 3:14).
3.  **Victory through Christ:** This subjection is only possible through the indwelling power of Christ. As we exercise faith, God gives us the "fruit of the Spirit," which includes *temperance* or self-control (Galatians 5:22–23).

**[ILL]** A rider on a powerful horse must hold the reins tight. If he drops the reins, the horse (the appetite) will run wild and carry the rider (the mind) into a ditch. Self-control, empowered by the Spirit, is the rein that keeps the beast of appetite in check.

### Q5. Is it expedient to eat everything that it is lawful to eat?

"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not." 1 Cor. 10:23.

**Answer:**

In this context, Paul is discussing food offered to idols. While an idol is nothing, and the food itself might not be inherently unclean (like swine), the principle extends to all our choices.

1.  **Expedience (Benefit):** Just because a Christian *can* do something without violating a direct "Thou shalt not," does not mean it is wise or helpful. Many foods are not strictly forbidden in Scripture by name (like sugary pastries or highly processed junk food), but they are not "expedient"—they do not build up health.
2.  **Edification:** "Edify" means to build up. Our choices should build up our physical strength and our spiritual influence.
3.  **Influence on Others:** We are our brother's keeper. If our eating habits cause others to stumble or weaken our testimony for the truth, we are violating the law of love (Romans 14:21).

**[ILL]** A traveler carrying a heavy backpack can legally put rocks in his bag—there is no law against carrying rocks. But it is not *expedient* if he wants to reach the summit of the mountain. Unhealthful habits are "weights" that hinder us in the race set before us (Hebrews 12:1).

### Q6. Is God's glory to be considered even in one's eating?

"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God." 1 Cor. 10:31.

**Answer:**

This is the gold standard of Christian living. Religion is not just for the Sabbath; it belongs at the dinner table.

1.  **Glorifying God:** To glorify God means to reveal His character. When we eat simple, nourishing food that maintains clear minds and steady nerves, we reflect God's wisdom and order.
2.  **The Test of Appetite:** The first test for Adam and Eve was on appetite (Genesis 3). The first test for Christ in the wilderness was on appetite (Matthew 4:1–4). We, too, must overcome on this point to glorify God.
3.  **Practical Holiness:** We cannot glorify God while knowingly destroying the body He created. Gluttony and intemperance cloud the mind and dishonor our Maker.

**[ILL]** If a man repairs a king’s watch, he treats it with immense care to honor the king. Our bodies are God’s "watches," designed to keep time with His will. To fill the delicate machinery with grit and sand (harmful food) is to insult the Owner.

---

### Q7. What are our bodies said to be?

"What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?" 1 Cor. 6:19.

**Answer:**

This is one of the most profound doctrines in Scripture regarding the human body.

1.  **The Indwelling Spirit:** In the Old Testament, God’s presence dwelt in the Most Holy Place of the earthly sanctuary. In the New Covenant, *we* are the temple. The Holy Spirit desires to dwell in our hearts and minds (Ephesians 3:17).
2.  **Not Our Own:** We possess no title deed to ourselves. We are tenants; God is the Landlord. We have no right to abuse property that does not belong to us.
3.  **Sanctuary Hygiene:** Just as the earthly priests had to be physically clean and sober to serve in the sanctuary (Leviticus 10:8–11), believers must maintain physical purity to be a fitting habitation for the Holy Spirit.

**[ILL]** Imagine a guest of honor coming to stay in your home. You would scrub the floors, open the windows, and remove all trash. The Holy Spirit is the heavenly Guest. Shall we invite Him into a body filled with the debris of intemperate habits?

---

### Q8. What is the Christian's duty concerning his body in view of the fact that the Spirit of God has taken possession of it?

"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's." 1 Cor. 6:20.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Purchase Price:** The price paid for us was the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18–19). This is the doctrine of **Atonement**. Jesus gave His broken body so that our bodies might be made whole.
2.  **Double Ownership:** God owns us twice: first by Creation (Psalm 100:3), and second by Redemption (buying us back from the slavery of sin).
3.  **Duty of Love:** Because He paid such an infinite price, the only appropriate response is to care for what He has purchased. Health reform is not a burden; it is an act of gratitude. It is protecting God's investment.

*   **Definition—Atonement:** The work by which God and man are reconciled (at-one-ment) through the sacrifice and priestly ministry of Christ.

**[ILL]** If you saw a slave market where a kind master paid everything he had to buy a slave and set him free, that slave would serve his master out of love forever. Christ paid His life for us. We serve Him—and care for our bodies—because we love the One who bought us.

### Q9. What does the apostle say God will do to those who defile or mar this temple of His, the human body?

"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." 1 Cor. 3:17.

**Answer:**

This is a solemn warning that cannot be ignored.

1.  **The Consequence of Defilement:** To "defile" means to corrupt or pollute. If we knowingly persist in habits that destroy our health—whether through drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or gluttony—we are destroying God's property.
2.  **The End Result:** God is the author of life. Sin is the author of death. If we choose the path of physical self-destruction, we are choosing to be separated from the Source of life. God does not want to destroy, but those who insist on destroying His temple will eventually reap the harvest of their choices (Galatians 6:7).
3.  **Holiness is Essential:** The text says the temple is *holy*. God cannot dwell in a defiled temple. This emphasizes the need for **Sanctification** of the body as well as the spirit.

**[ILL]** If a vandal smashes the windows and burns the walls of the King's palace, he is arrested and punished. Our bodies are the King's palace. We must not vandalize them with harmful indulgences.

### Q10. Can the body be defiled with improper food or drink?

"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank." Dan. 1:8.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Example of Daniel:** Daniel and his friends were captives in Babylon. They understood that the rich, stimulating food of the king (likely unclean meats and food offered to idols) and alcoholic wine would cloud their minds and render them unfit for communion with God.
2.  **"Purposed in his Heart":** This is the key to victory. It begins with a decision of the will, surrendered to God. This is **Righteousness by Faith** in action—a fixed purpose to obey God, relying on His power to sustain that decision.
3.  **The Result:** Because they refused to defile themselves, God gave them knowledge, skill, and wisdom ten times better than the Babylonians (Daniel 1:17–20). A clean diet laid the foundation for understanding the deep prophecies of the book of Daniel.

**[ILL]** A car designed for high-octane fuel will sputter and fail if filled with sludge. Daniel knew his body was designed for God’s fuel, not Babylon’s sludge. Because he kept the machine clean, God could drive it to great heights of service.

---

### Q11. What sort of food did Daniel desire?

"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat." Gen. 1:29.

**Answer:**

Daniel requested "pulse" (vegetables/plant foods) and water (Daniel 1:12). This harkens back to the original diet given in Eden.

1.  **The Original Diet:** Before the entrance of sin, there was no death. Therefore, man's diet consisted entirely of fruits, grains, nuts, and vegetables. This is the diet best suited to the human constitution.
2.  **Restoration:** The gospel is a work of restoration (Acts 3:21). God is leading His people back to the original plan. As we approach the end of time, moving toward the Edenic diet helps prepare the body for translation and reduces the risk of disease.
3.  **Health and Holiness:** The diet God chose for man in his perfect state is the best diet to keep man in a holy state.

**[ILL]** When a manufacturer builds a machine, he provides an instruction manual specifying the fuel. Genesis 1:29 is the Manufacturer's instruction for the human engine. Following it ensures the best performance.

### Q12. What kind of flesh did the Lord afterward permit man to eat?

"Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat." Lev. 11:3.

**Answer:**

After the Flood, when vegetation was destroyed, God permitted Noah and his descendants to eat animal flesh. However, He placed immediate restrictions to preserve their health.

1.  **The Definition of "Clean":** For land animals, they must meet *two* conditions: (1) Part the hoof (cloven-footed), and (2) Chew the cud (ruminants like cows, sheep, deer).
2.  **Health, not Ritual:** These laws in Leviticus 11 are often confused with ceremonial laws (like sacrifices) which ended at the cross. However, the laws of clean and unclean meats are based on *biology*, not types and shadows. The nature of a pig or a vulture did not change when Jesus died on the cross. Unclean animals are still scavengers and unhealthful for the human body.
3.  **God's Care:** By restricting man to "clean" meats, God was minimizing the intake of toxins and parasites found in scavengers.

**[ILL]** A good father forbids his child from eating berries from a poisonous bush. He does this not to deprive the child of pleasure, but to protect the child’s life. God’s dietary laws are the boundaries set by a loving Father.

---

### Q13. By what term was this class of creatures distinguished from the other?

"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female." Gen. 7:2.

**Answer:**

1.  **Pre-Sinai Distinction:** This verse proves that the distinction between clean and unclean animals existed in the time of Noah—centuries before there was a Jew, and long before the ceremonial law was given at Sinai.
2.  **Universal Application:** Since Noah is the father of the entire post-flood human race, this distinction was intended for all mankind, not just the Israelites.
3.  **Preservation of Life:** God instructed Noah to take more of the clean animals (by sevens) so there would be some available for food and sacrifice after the flood, while the unclean (by twos) were preserved only to prevent extinction, not for food.

**[ILL]** Gravity existed before Newton wrote about it. The distinction between clean (healthful) and unclean (unhealthful) animals existed before Moses wrote Leviticus. It is a law of nature fixed by the Creator.

### Q14. Which one of these now commonly eaten was mentioned as being unfit even to touch?

"And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass." Deut. 14:8.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Swine (Pig):** God specifically singles out the pig. Although it has a split hoof, it does not chew the cud. It is a scavenger.
2.  **A Medical Warning:** The swine is a cleaner for the earth, eating garbage and filth. Its flesh is often infested with parasites (like trichina) and toxins.
3.  **Clear Prohibition:** The command is double: do not eat it, and do not touch the carcass. God wants His people to have no relationship with this article of diet.

**[ILL]** A city employs garbage trucks to haul away waste. The trucks perform a necessary service, but you would never eat a meal off the back of a garbage truck. The swine is nature’s "garbage truck." It is designed to clean the earth, not to feed the body.

---

### Q15. Why did the Lord thus restrict the Hebrews?

"For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth. Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing." Deut. 14:2, 3.

**Answer:**

1.  **Holiness and Separation:** The word "holy" means set apart. God’s people are to be distinct from the world. The world eats and drinks for pleasure and appetite; the Christian eats to sustain a temple for God.
2.  **A "Peculiar" People:** This does not mean strange or odd, but "special treasure" or "exclusive property." Because we are God's special treasure, He does not want us fueled by "abominable things."
3.  **The Call Today:** Spiritual Israel (the Church) is also called to be a chosen generation and a holy nation (1 Peter 2:9). If the physical health of the literal Jews was important to God, the health of His spiritual people, who are preparing for the return of Christ, is even more important.

**[ILL]** An athlete training for the Olympics eats differently than the spectator in the stands. He is "peculiar" in his diet because he has a high goal in view. Christians are running a race for eternal life (1 Corinthians 9:24–25); our diet must support our high calling.

### Q16. What does the Lord say of those who are found eating swine's flesh and the like, when Christ comes?

"For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with His chariots like a whirlwind, to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire... They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord." Isa. 16:15-17 [Isa 66:15-17].

**Answer:**

This is a startling prophecy regarding the Second Coming of Jesus.

1.  **End-Time Application:** The context is clearly the return of the Lord ("come with fire," "chariots like a whirlwind"). This proves that the prohibition against unclean meats (swine, mouse, etc.) was *not* abolished at the cross, for God is still judging it at the Second Coming.
2.  **False Sanctification:** The text speaks of those who "sanctify themselves" (make a show of religion) while secretly indulging in forbidden things. This is self-righteousness and hypocrisy. True **Sanctification** involves obedience to God's physical laws as well as moral laws.
3.  **The Consequence:** Those who cling to their appetites in defiance of God's command will be "consumed." This is not because God hates them, but because rebellious indulgence is incompatible with the purity of heaven.
4.  **Victory is Possible:** We need not fear this judgment if we are in Christ. He is able to "keep you from falling" (Jude 24). Through the **Spirit of Prophecy** and the Scriptures, God has given the Seventh-day Adventist church the message of health reform to prepare a people to stand blameless before Him. By faith in Jesus, we can overcome the clamor of appetite and live to the glory of God.

**[ILL]** If a ship is sinking, passengers must leave their heavy baggage behind to get into the lifeboat. Some refuse to let go of their "baggage" (sinful habits/appetites) and are pulled down with the ship. We must let go of every weight to be lifted up by Christ.
