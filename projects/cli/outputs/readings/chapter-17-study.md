### Q1. Is there a promise for those who confess their sins?

"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9.

**Answer:**
This verse contains the dual promise that lies at the heart of the plan of salvation: forgiveness for the past and cleansing for the present.

1.  **The Condition:** The promise is conditional upon "confession." Biblical confession is not merely admitting a fact that God already knows; it is the act of the soul agreeing with God concerning the guilt and malignity of sin (Psalm 51:3–4). It involves a laying aside of pride and a genuine turning of the heart to God.
2.  **Faithful and Just:** It is remarkable that the text says God is "just" to forgive. We might expect it to say "merciful." However, because Christ has paid the penalty for sin on the cross (Romans 3:24–26), justice no longer demands the sinner's death if they are in Christ. God is faithful to His covenant and just in applying Christ’s merits to the repentant believer.
3.  **Two-Fold Work:**
    *   **Forgiveness (Justification):** This is the legal release from the penalty of sin. The record of guilt is covered by Christ’s blood.
    *   **Cleansing (Sanctification):** God does not merely forgive the legal debt; He attacks the root of the problem. He promises to "cleanse us from all unrighteousness." This is the imparting of Christ's life to the believer, enabling them to overcome sin. The Gospel provides for a change of heart, not just a change of record (Ezekiel 36:25–27).

*   **Justification:** God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ’s merits (Romans 3:24; 5:1).
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God by which He makes the believer holy in character and life (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

[ILL] **Illustration:** If a workman falls into a pit of mud, he needs two things. First, he needs to be pulled out (rescue/forgiveness). But if he is pulled out and left covered in filth, he is not fit to enter the King's palace. He must also be washed (cleansing). The Gospel of Christ does both: it rescues us from the pit of condemnation and washes the character from the defilement of sin.

### Q2. To whom besides the Lord should one confess his sins?

"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much." James 5:16.

**Answer:**
The Bible distinguishes clearly between sins committed against God and offenses committed against our fellow men.

1.  **Confession to God:** Every sin is ultimately a sin against God and His law; therefore, every sin must be confessed to Him (Psalm 51:4). No human priest or leader can mediate between the soul and God for the forgiveness of sins; there is only one Mediator, the man Christ Jesus (1 Timothy 2:5).
2.  **Confession to Man:** When our actions have injured a neighbor, a brother, or a friend, confession must be made to the one harmed. Reconciliation with our brother is a prerequisite for acceptable worship (Matthew 5:23–24).
    *   If the sin is public, the confession should be public.
    *   If the sin is private, the confession should be private.
3.  **The Goal is Healing:** The text connects confession with "healing." Unresolved guilt and broken relationships hinder physical and spiritual health. By humbling ourselves to confess our faults to one another, we break down the barriers of pride that prevent the Holy Spirit from working in our midst.

[ILL] **Illustration:** If you accidentally break a neighbor's window, apologizing to your own father inside your house does not fix the neighbor's window. You must go to the neighbor, admit the fault, and make restitution. However, you must also ask your father for forgiveness for your carelessness. So it is with sin: we make right with man what affects man, and we make right with God what affects God.

### Q3. If one tries to cover up a sin, and will not properly confess it, what effect will such a course have on the delinquent?

"He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy." Prov. 28:13.

**Answer:**
This text strikes at the root of human nature—the desire to hide our shame (Genesis 3:8).

1.  **The Failure of Hiding:** To "cover" sin means to hide it, excuse it, or justify it. The Bible warns that spiritual prosperity is impossible while sin is cherished or concealed. The Holy Spirit cannot dwell in a heart that is deceitful (Psalm 32:2).
2.  **Confessing and Forsaking:** True Righteousness by Faith is not a cloak for cherished sin. The promise of mercy is for those who confess *and* forsake.
    *   **Confession** acknowledges the debt.
    *   **Forsaking** turns away from the cause of the debt.
    *   Many fail to find peace because they confess vaguely but have no intention of giving up the practice of sin. Power to forsake comes only through the indwelling Christ, but the will must consent to let the sin go (Philippians 2:13).
3.  **Christ's Covering:** There is only one covering that God accepts—the Robe of Christ's Righteousness (Isaiah 61:10). We cannot put on this robe over our own "fig leaves" of excuses. We must uncover the sin to Jesus so that He may cover it with His blood.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A man with a festering wound may bandage it up tight so no one can see it. He may look healthy on the outside, but underneath, the infection is spreading to his blood. "Covering" the wound does not cure it; it only guarantees death. He must expose the wound to the Physician to be cleaned and healed.

### Q4. Is it possible to hide a sin from God?

"Be sure your sin will find you out." Num. 32:23. "Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of Thy countenance." Ps. 90:8.

**Answer:**
The omniscience of God serves as both a warning to the stubborn and a comfort to the sincere.

1.  **The Record Books:** The Bible teaches that a record of every life is kept in heaven (Daniel 7:10; Revelation 20:12). Nothing is hidden from the eyes of Him with whom we have to do (Hebrews 4:13).
2.  **The Sanctuary Truth:** In the earthly sanctuary, when a sinner brought a sacrifice, the sin was transferred from the sinner to the sanctuary. In the heavenly reality, our sins are recorded. In the great Investigative Judgment, these records will be opened. Sins that have not been confessed and sent beforehand to judgment will stand against the sinner in that day (Ecclesiastes 12:14).
3.  **Sin Finds Us Out:** Sin has a natural consequence. It hardens the conscience and often leads to public exposure. But even if it remains hidden from men until death, it will meet the sinner at the judgment bar of God.

*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (starting in 1844) where He reviews the lives of professed believers to see who has remained in the faith, blotting out the sins of the overcoming saints (Daniel 8:14; Acts 3:19).

[ILL] **Illustration:** A man may commit a crime in the dark, thinking he is unseen. But if a recording camera was running the entire time, his secrecy is an illusion. God’s record is more accurate than any camera; it records not just the act, but the motive and the thought of the heart.

### Q5. How did David feel before he confessed his sins?

"When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer." Ps. 32:3, 4.

**Answer:**
David’s experience illustrates the crushing weight of a guilty conscience fighting against the Holy Spirit.

1.  **The Physical Toll of Guilt:** David describes physical symptoms—bones waxing old, moisture drying up. The burden of unconfessed sin destroys mental peace and physical health. It separates the soul from the Source of Life.
2.  **The Heavy Hand:** The "heavy hand" of God was actually His mercy in disguise. It was the conviction of the Holy Spirit pressing upon David, urging him to repent before he was lost.
3.  **The Silence:** "Keeping silence" refers to the refusal to admit guilt. As long as David tried to maintain his innocence or ignore his sin, he was in misery. There is no rest for the wicked (Isaiah 57:20–21).

[ILL] **Illustration:** Carrying a heavy backpack all day exhausts the traveler. If he refuses to take it off at night, he cannot sleep; his muscles ache, and he becomes weak. Unconfessed sin is a burden the soul was never designed to carry. Jesus invites us: "Come unto me... and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).

### Q6. What came to him after confession?

"I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin." Ps. 32:5.

**Answer:**
The transition from verse 4 to verse 5 is the transition from death to life.

1.  **Instant Forgiveness:** Notice the immediacy. "I said, I will confess... and Thou forgavest." David did not have to do a year of penance. He threw himself on the mercy of the covenant, and God responded instantly.
2.  **No Excuses:** David says, "I acknowledged my sin." He did not blame circumstances or others (as Adam did). True confession takes full responsibility.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** This is a perfect picture of justification. David had no merit to offer; he had murder and adultery on his record. He offered only a broken heart and faith in God's mercy. God imputed righteousness to him the moment he ceased defending his own unrighteousness (Romans 4:6–8).

[ILL] **Illustration:** Imagine a dam holding back a mighty river. The moment the sluice gate is opened, the water rushes through. God's mercy is like that river, pressing against the door of our hearts. Confession is simply unlocking the door; the moment it opens, the grace of God floods in.

### Q7. Who is the advocate of the sinner?

"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." 1 John 2:1.

**Answer:**
We are not left alone to face the broken law of God. We have a Representative in the courts of heaven.

1.  **The Advocate:** The Greek word is *Parakletos*, meaning one called alongside to help, an intercessor or defense attorney.
2.  **Jesus Christ the Righteous:** This is crucial. Christ does not plead *our* righteousness, for we have none (Isaiah 64:6). He pleads *His* righteousness. He shows the Father His wounded hands. His perfect obedience is credited to the sinner's account.
3.  **The High Priestly Ministry:** This points us to the Sanctuary. Jesus is our High Priest in the heavenly places (Hebrews 8:1). He appears in the presence of God for us. He does not excuse sin, but He points to His sacrifice as the payment for it.
4.  **"If Any Man Sin":** The text does not say "when any man sins," implying that sinning should not be the constant pattern of the Christian life (1 John 2:1, first part). But *if* we fall, the provision for restoration is immediate through Christ.

*   **Advocate:** One who pleads the cause of another. Christ pleads His blood and merits on behalf of the penitent sinner.

[ILL] **Illustration:** In a courtroom, a defendant who tries to represent himself against a skilled prosecutor will lose. But if he has the most powerful attorney in the land—one who has never lost a case and who has already paid the fine for the crime—he can stand with confidence. Jesus is that Attorney.

### Q8. How fully did Israel confess to Samuel when they wished him to intercede before God in their behalf?

"And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not; for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king." 1 Sam. 12:19.

**Answer:**
General confessions often mask a lack of genuine repentance. Israel's confession here teaches us the necessity of being specific.

1.  **Specific Confession:** They did not just say, "We are sinners." They pinpointed the exact sin that stood between them and God: "to ask us a king."
2.  **The Principle:** Repentance is not a vague feeling of sadness. It is the specific renunciation of specific wrongs. We must ask the Holy Spirit to search our hearts and reveal the specific things that grieve Him (Psalm 139:23–24).
3.  **Acknowledging the Evil:** They admitted that their action was "evil." They stopped calling it a political necessity or a cultural preference and called it what God called it: sin.

[ILL] **Illustration:** If a patient goes to a doctor and says, "I hurt," the doctor cannot help much. But if he says, "I have a sharp pain in my chest when I breathe," the doctor can diagnose and treat the problem. We must bring our specific spiritual symptoms to the Great Physician.

### Q9. What are we to expect when we confess our sins?

"Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions." Ps. 51:1.

**Answer:**
When we come to God with a contrite heart, we may expect not only forgiveness but the eventual complete removal of the record of sin.

1.  **Appeal to Character:** David appeals to God's "loving-kindness" and "tender mercies." Our confidence is not in the intensity of our repentance, but in the depth of God's love.
2.  **Blotting Out:** This is a sanctuary term. In the earthly service, the blood of the sin offering transferred the sin to the sanctuary record. On the Day of Atonement, the sanctuary was cleansed, and the sins were effectively blotted out.
3.  **The Final Atonement:** We look forward to the time when, having confessed and forsaken our sins, and having been settled into the truth so that we cannot be moved, our sins will be blotted from the books of heaven forever (Acts 3:19). This prepares a people to stand in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor after probation closes.

*   **Blotting Out of Sins:** The final removal of the record of sin from the heavenly books during the judgment, corresponding to the cleansing of the sanctuary on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16).

[ILL] **Illustration:** If a debt is written in a ledger, the merchant may write "Paid" across it. That is forgiveness. But "blotting out" is as if the page were wiped clean or burned, leaving no trace that the debt ever existed. God promises to cast our sins into the depths of the sea (Micah 7:19).

### Q10. Will there be a time when every one will confess to God?

"For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then everyone of us shall give account of himself to God." Rom. 14:11, 12.

**Answer:**
Universal confession is inevitable, but it will not be universally saving.

1.  **Two Kinds of Confession:**
    *   **Voluntary Confession:** Made now, in the day of grace, resulting in salvation and cleansing.
    *   **Involuntary Confession:** Made in the day of judgment, acknowledging God's justice but too late for salvation.
2.  **The Vindication of God:** The Great Controversy ends with every created being—righteous and wicked, and even Satan himself—acknowledging that God’s ways are just and His law is holy.
3.  **The Urgent Call:** Since we must all give an account then, wisdom dictates that we settle the account now. Today, while Jesus ministers in the heavenly sanctuary, the door of mercy is open. We may send our sins to judgment beforehand through confession, so that when we appear there, our record is clean.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A criminal can confess before the trial and often receive leniency or a plea deal. But after the gavel falls and the sentence is read, admitting guilt changes nothing regarding the punishment. We are currently in the time of the trial; the sentence has not yet been executed. Now is the accepted time (2 Corinthians 6:2).
