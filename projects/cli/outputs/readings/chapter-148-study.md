### Q1. What bearing did the regarding of God's commandments formerly have on the removal of sickness?

**"Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, ...and the Lord will take away from thee all sickness." Deut. 7:11-15.**

**Answer:**

This passage establishes a fundamental principle in the economy of God: the connection between obedience and life. God is the author of all life, and His laws—both moral (the Ten Commandments) and physical (the laws of health)—are designed to sustain that life.

1.  **The Unity of Law:** We often separate the spiritual law from the physical law, but in the Bible, they are one. The same God who said, "Thou shalt not steal" (Exodus 20:15), also gave instructions regarding diet, hygiene, and sanitation (Leviticus 11–15). To violate the laws of our physical being is a violation of the laws of God.
2.  **Cause and Effect:** Much sickness is the direct result of violating natural law. Intemperance in eating, drinking, or labor weakens the body and invites disease. God’s promise to "take away... all sickness" was conditional upon Israel’s adherence to His statutes. When we align our lives with God's design, we remove many of the *causes* of disease.
3.  **Sanctification of the Body:** The Bible teaches that our bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost (1 Corinthians 6:19). **Sanctification** (the work of God's grace making us holy) includes the preservation of our physical powers so that we may offer God perfect service (Romans 12:1).
4.  **Righteousness by Faith Application:** We cannot earn health by obeying rules any more than we can earn heaven by works. However, the faith that justifies (imputed righteousness) also produces obedience (imparted righteousness). A true believer, motivated by love for Christ, will seek to obey God's laws of health, not to be saved, but because they belong to Christ and wish to preserve His property.

**[ILL]** Think of a high-performance machine provided with a manufacturer's manual. If the owner pours sand into the engine instead of oil, the machine breaks. The manufacturer is not "punishing" the owner arbitrarily; rather, the owner has violated the law of the machine's design. So it is with our bodies; God's commandments are the "manual" for our happiness and longevity.

### Q2. When through disobedience King Jeroboam's hand withered, how was it restored to strength?

**"And the man of God besought the Lord, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before." 1 Kings 13:6.**

**Answer:**

Here we see the mercy of God extended even to a rebellious leader through the agency of intercession.

1.  **Judgment and Mercy:** Jeroboam had stretched out his hand against God’s messenger, an act of open rebellion. The withering of the hand was a judgment to show the king his powerlessness against Jehovah. Yet, the restoration shows God's willingness to heal even the undeserving when there is an intercessor.
2.  **The Role of the Intercessor:** The king could not heal himself, nor did he have the spiritual standing to command God's audience at that moment. He had to ask the "man of God" to pray. This points to the ministry of Christ. We, like Jeroboam, have rebelled; we are spiritually "withered" by sin. We require a Mediator to stand between the living God and our dying souls.
3.  **Grace, Not Merit:** The healing was not a reward for Jeroboam's righteousness—he had none. It was an act of pure grace. This illustrates **Justification**: God declares the sinner "restored" not because of the sinner's past good deeds, but because of the intercession of Jesus and the mercy of the Father (Titus 3:5).

**[ILL]** A rebellious child may break a window in anger, cutting his hand deeply. The parent, though grieved by the rebellion, immediately binds up the wound and seeks healing for the child. The healing is an act of parental love, not an endorsement of the rebellion. So God heals us that we might have a "space for repentance" (Revelation 2:21).

### Q3. When Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, what did Moses do in her behalf?

**"And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, Heal her now, a God, I beseech thee." Num. 12:13.**

**Answer:**

Miriam's experience highlights the terrible nature of sin and the power of intercessory prayer.

1.  **Leprosy as a Type of Sin:** In the Bible, leprosy is a fitting symbol of sin—it begins small, spreads, creates insensitivity (numbness), is loathsome, and leads to death. It rendered the victim ceremonially "unclean," separating them from the sanctuary and the congregation (Leviticus 13:45–46).
2.  **The Mediator:** Moses here acts as a type of Christ. Although Miriam had spoken against Moses, he did not hold a grudge. He immediately cried out to God for her restoration. This reflects the Spirit of Christ, who prayed for His persecutors, "Father, forgive them" (Luke 23:34).
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** Under the Levitical law, the leper could only be pronounced clean by the priest after a specific offering (Leviticus 14). Moses appeals to the High Court of Heaven. The healing of the body and the cleansing of the soul are tied together in the work of the High Priest.
4.  **Urgency in Prayer:** Moses prayed, "Heal her *now*." While we must submit to God's will, we are invited to bring our urgent petitions to the throne of grace with boldness (Hebrews 4:16).

**[ILL]** Imagine a garment stained with a dye that no amount of scrubbing can remove. It is ruined. But the chemist has a specific formula that can dissolve the stain instantly. Sin is the stain; Christ’s blood applied by faith is the formula. Moses applied for this "cleansing agent" on behalf of his sister.

### Q4. Are there cases when it is best not to apply to earthly physicians?

**"And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great; yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians." 2 Chron. 16:12.**

**Answer:**

This text is often misunderstood. It does not condemn the use of remedial agencies or the skills of physicians, but rather the *misplaced trust* and the specific type of "physicians" Asa likely consulted.

1.  **Trusting Man over God:** Asa's sin was that he "sought *not* to the Lord, *but* to the physicians." He replaced the Creator with the creature. He looked for a cure without seeking to address the spiritual cause or asking for God's blessing on the means used.
2.  **The Nature of Ancient Medicine:** In Asa's time, many "physicians" were essentially magicians who used incantations, superstitious rites, and poisonous drugs, attributing healing to pagan gods. To seek them was to deny the God of Israel.
3.  **The True Physician's Role:** God works through means. He used a "lump of figs" to heal Hezekiah (Isaiah 38:21) and clay to heal the blind man (John 9:6). We should use rational, physiological remedies (diet, water, rest, herbs, surgery where necessary), but our heart's trust must remain in the Lord who gives the physician wisdom and the body power to heal.
4.  **Definition - Faith vs. Presumption:**
    *   **Faith:** Trusting God while obeying His laws and using the blessings He has provided (healthy living, treatments).
    *   **Presumption:** Ignoring God's laws or His provided means and demanding a miracle.

**[ILL]** If a man breaks his leg, he goes to a surgeon to set the bone. But the surgeon cannot knit the bone back together; only the life-force God put in the body can do that. If the man thanks the surgeon but ignores God, he is like Asa. We must recognize the surgeon as merely an instrument in the Master Healer's hand.

### Q5. When Elijah prayed for the restoration of a child, what was the result?

**"And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord, and said, a Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived." 1 Kings 17:21, 22.**

**Answer:**

This powerful narrative demonstrates that God is the absolute Master of life and death.

1.  **The Source of Life:** The "soul" (Hebrew *nephesh*, meaning life or breath) returned. This confirms that life is a gift from God, and He can restore it even after it has ceased, according to His will.
2.  **Earnest, Specific Prayer:** Elijah did not pray a rote prayer. He "stretched himself upon the child" (identifying with the need) and "cried unto the Lord." The prayer of the righteous is fervent and effectual (James 5:16).
3.  **Faith in Resurrection:** This miracle points forward to the great resurrection at the last day. Just as Elijah’s prayer revived the child, the voice of the Archangel (Christ) will call forth the sleeping saints (1 Thessalonians 4:16).
4.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Elijah was a man "subject to like passions as we are" (James 5:17), yet he stood in the righteousness of God. His prayer was answered not because Elijah was perfect by nature, but because his faith grasped the power of God.

**[ILL]** Consider a lamp that has been unplugged. It is dark and "dead." When you plug it back into the wall socket, the light returns. The lamp does not generate the light; it receives it from the power source. Elijah’s prayer re-connected the child to God, the source of all vitality.

***

### Q6. When Hezekiah prayed for restoration from sickness, what answer was returned to him?

**"Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years." Isa. 38:5.**

**Answer:**

Hezekiah’s experience teaches us about God's personal care and the potential flexibility of His providence in response to prayer.

1.  **God Sees Tears:** God is not an indifferent force. He is a Father who sees our tears and hears our prayers. "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him" (Psalm 103:13).
2.  **Prayer Changes Things:** God had announced that Hezekiah would die (v. 1). Yet, upon Hezekiah’s repentance and pleading, God granted an extension. This shows that prayer can change circumstances because it changes *us*, bringing us into a condition where God can safely grant blessings He otherwise could not.
3.  **A Solemn Warning:** While God granted the request, the extra fifteen years proved spiritually disastrous for Hezekiah (he showed his treasures to Babylon, inciting future conquest) and for the nation (Manasseh was born during these years, the most wicked king of Judah).
    *   *Lesson:* Sometimes we press God for things that may not be for our ultimate best. We must always pray, "Thy will be done."

**[ILL]** A bank manager may grant a loan extension to a client who pleads for more time. The time is given, but how the client uses that time is their responsibility. God gave Hezekiah an "extension" on his life-lease; sadly, he did not use the borrowed time entirely for God's glory.

### Q7. What was a part of the work of Christ while He was here on earth?

**"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people." Matt. 4:23.**

**Answer:**

Christ's ministry was a balanced threefold work: Teaching, Preaching, and Healing.

1.  **The Whole Man:** Jesus did not care only for souls while ignoring suffering bodies. He recognized that physical pain often hinders spiritual growth. By healing the body, He opened the heart to receive the Gospel.
2.  **The "Right Arm" of the Message:** Just as the right arm prepares the way for the body to act, the medical missionary work (healing and health teaching) prepares the way for the Gospel message to reach the heart.
3.  **Type of the Kingdom:** Every healing Jesus performed was a "sign" of the future Kingdom of Glory, where "the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick" (Isaiah 33:24). He was rolling back the curse of sin temporarily to show what He will do eternally.
4.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Jesus healed "all manner" of disease—chronic, acute, physical, mental. Similarly, His grace is sufficient to heal "all manner" of spiritual disease (sins). There is no habit so deep, no sin so black, that Christ cannot cure it.

**[ILL]** A gardener does not just speak to the plant; he waters the soil, prunes the dead leaves, and ensures it has sunlight. Jesus is the Master Gardener. He tends to the physical soil of our lives (healing) so that the spiritual fruit (character) may grow.

### Q8. What impressive words does Matthew use to show further the burden that the Saviour took in this matter?

**"Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses." Matt. 8:17.**

**Answer:**

This verse quotes Isaiah 53:4, placing physical healing in the context of the Atonement.

1.  **Vicarious Atonement:**
    *   **Definition:** Christ taking the place of the sinner, receiving what we deserve so we can receive what He deserves.
    *   Christ did not just remove sickness with a wave of a wand; He "took" them. He entered into the fellowship of our suffering. He felt the weariness, the pain, and the burden of a fallen world, though He never sinned.
2.  **Sympathy of the High Priest:** Because He "bare our sicknesses," He is a High Priest who can be "touched with the feeling of our infirmities" (Hebrews 4:15). He knows exactly how you feel when you are in pain because He has borne the weight of the world's woe.
3.  **The Cost of Healing:** Healing cost Heaven the life of the Son of God. Every breath of air we breathe, every pulse of health we enjoy, was bought by the agony of the Cross.
4.  **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the sanctuary service, the sinner transferred his sin to the lamb. Here, the Lamb of God takes upon Himself the consequences of sin (sickness and death) so that we might have life.

**[ILL]** Imagine a strong swimmer seeing a drowning man dragged down by a heavy weight. The swimmer dives in, takes the heavy weight onto his own shoulders, and lifts the drowning man to shore. The swimmer feels the crushing weight so the other can be free. Christ took the weight of our curse.

### Q9. When the woman touched the hem of Jesus' garment and was healed of her infirmity, what gave effect to the touch?

**"And He said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole,. go in peace." Luke 8:48.**

**Answer:**

This incident perfectly illustrates the difference between intellectual assent and saving faith.

1.  **The Press vs. The Touch:** Multitudes "thronged" and "pressed" Jesus (Luke 8:45), making casual contact, yet they received no power. Only one woman touched Him with *faith*.
    *   *Lesson:* We may be in the church, surrounded by religious things, "rubbing shoulders" with doctrine, yet remain spiritually dead. Only the personal touch of faith draws power.
2.  **Faith as the Medium:** Faith is not the power itself; it is the hand that grasps the power. There was no magic in the garment. The power was in Jesus, but faith established the connection.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** This is a picture of Justification. The woman was helpless, having spent all she had (bankruptcy of human effort). She came to Christ as a last resort. Her touch was an act of total dependence. Immediately, she was made whole. So it is with the sinner who stops trying to save himself and touches Christ—he is instantly justified.
4.  **"Go in Peace":** The physical healing resulted in spiritual peace. She was restored to the community and to God.

**[ILL]** In a house wired for electricity, there may be many wires. A dead wire can touch the power source and nothing happens. But a live wire, when it touches the source, immediately conducts the current. Faith makes us "live wires," capable of receiving the current of Christ’s life.

### Q10. Is the gift of healing given to the church of Christ?

**"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues." 1 Cor. 12:28.**

**Answer:**

Yes, the gift of healing is one of the abiding spiritual gifts entrusted to the body of Christ.

1.  **Order of Gifts:** Note that healing is listed *after* apostles, prophets, and teachers. While miracles are important, the teaching of the Word and the prophetic guidance take precedence. Miracles confirm the Word; they do not replace it.
2.  **Sovereign Bestowal:** God "hath set" these members. The Holy Spirit divides to every man severally "as he will" (1 Corinthians 12:11). Not everyone has the gift of healing, just as not everyone is an apostle.
3.  **Permanence:** There is no scriptural evidence that these gifts were withdrawn. As we approach the end of time, we may expect a revival of genuine primitive godliness and power, including healing, though we must be wary of counterfeit miracles (Revelation 16:14).

***

### Q11. How is this gift exercised?

**"Is there any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord." James 5:14.**

**Answer:**

The Scripture outlines a specific order for the church to follow in cases of serious illness.

1.  **Initiative of the Sick:** "Let *him* call." The sick person (or their representative) must desire the prayers of the church. It implies a desire to be right with God.
2.  **The Elders:** It is an official act of the church leaders, ensuring order and solemnity, preventing fanaticism.
3.  **Anointing with Oil:**
    *   **Symbolism:** Oil represents the Holy Spirit.
    *   **Medicinal:** In biblical times, oil was also a remedy (Luke 10:34). This combines the spiritual (Spirit) and the practical (remedial agencies).
    *   **Dedication:** In the Old Testament, priests and kings were anointed (set apart). Anointing the sick signifies dedicating them to God—whether for life or for death, they belong to Him.
4.  **"In the Name of the Lord":** The power is not in the oil or the elders, but in the authority and character of Jesus.

**[ILL]** When a doctor writes a prescription, you must follow the instructions to get the benefit. God has given a "prescription" in James 5. We call the elders, we use the symbol of the Spirit (oil), and we pray in faith, leaving the result to the Great Physician.

***

### Q12. If the sick one is restored to health, by what power is it accomplished?

**"And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him." James 5:15.**

**Answer:**

The power is entirely of God, accessed through the "prayer of faith."

1.  **The Prayer of Faith:** This is not a command to God, but a trust that lays hold of God's promises while submitting to His will. It is a prayer that says, "Lord, you are able, and if it is for Your glory, do this."
2.  **Connection to Forgiveness:** "If he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven."
    *   **RBF Core:** Physical healing is secondary to the healing of the soul (justification). Often, sickness awakens the conscience. The service of anointing is an opportunity for the sick person to search their heart, confess specific sins, and find peace with God.
    *   **Sanctuary:** Just as the incense (prayer) in the Holy Place was connected to the blood on the altar (forgiveness), so our prayers for healing must be founded on the Atoning Sacrifice.
3.  **God Raises Him Up:** It is the Lord who does the work. Whether through instant miracle or the gradual process of nature assisted by medical care, God is the Healer.

**[ILL]** To remove a weed, you must pull out the root. Often, sin (guilt, anxiety, intemperance) is the root of the sickness. The prayer of faith allows God to pull the root (sin) so the plant (the person) can flourish again.

***

### Q13. Did Christ bestow the gift of healing upon His disciples?

**"Then He called His twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases... And Peter said... In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk." Luke 9:1, 2; Acts 3:1-8.**

**Answer:**

Yes, Christ delegated His authority to His followers.

1.  **Power and Authority:** Jesus gave them *dunamis* (power/ability) and *exousia* (authority/right). This was to authenticate their message that the Kingdom of God had come.
2.  **Peter’s Experience:** In Acts 3, Peter makes it clear: "Silver and gold have I none." The church may be poor in worldly wealth, but it should be rich in spiritual power. Peter did not claim the power as his own; he acted as an agent "In the name of Jesus."
3.  **Restoration:** The lame man didn't just walk; he "leaped" and praised God. The Gospel brings complete restoration—physical liberty and spiritual praise.

***

### Q14. Was this commission to cease with the twelve apostles?

**"And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world... And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name... they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." Mark 16:15-18.**

**Answer:**

The commission is co-extensive with the preaching of the Gospel "into all the world."

1.  **"Them that Believe":** The promise is not limited to the twelve apostles but to "them that believe." As long as there are believers and a Gospel to preach, the credentials of the Gospel (including healing) remain valid.
2.  **Why the Lack of Power?** If we see fewer miracles today, it is not because God has changed. It may be due to:
    *   **Unbelief:** The church has often relied on worldly methods rather than God's power.
    *   **Presumption:** Failing to obey the laws of health while asking God to heal the result of abuse.
    *   **The End-Time Context:** Satan also works miracles (2 Thessalonians 2:9). God may withhold spectacular signs to force His people to rely on the "more sure word of prophecy" (2 Peter 1:19) rather than sensory excitement.
3.  **The Assurance:** Nevertheless, where the Gospel is preached in purity and power, God still bears witness with signs following, according to His will.

***

### Q15. What special work is necessary for one who expects to be healed?

**"Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed." James 5:16.**

**Answer:**

Confession is the prerequisite to restoration.

1.  **Clearing the Channel:** Sin clogs the channel of blessing. "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me" (Psalm 66:18). Confession clears the obstruction.
2.  **"One to Another":**
    *   If the sin is private (between you and God), confess to God.
    *   If the sin has injured a brother or sister, confess to them.
    *   Public sins should be confessed publicly.
    *   This humility destroys pride and brings unity, creating an atmosphere where the Spirit can work.
3.  **Sanctuary - The Day of Atonement:** In the antitypical Day of Atonement (the time we live in now), the work is to "afflict our souls"—deep searching of heart and putting away of sin. We cannot expect God to heal our bodies if we are cherishing the very sins that kill our souls.

**[ILL]** If a water pipe is blocked by mud, opening the faucet does no good. You must first clear the mud. Unconfessed sin and grudges are "mud" in the spiritual pipe. Confession removes it, allowing the water of life to flow.

***

### Q16. Why is it that in some cases persons are not healed in answer to prayer?

**"Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts." James 4:3.**

**Answer:**

God looks at the motive of the heart.

1.  **Asking Amiss:** To ask for health merely to return to a life of self-indulgence, pleasure-seeking, or sin is to ask God to sustain us in rebellion. God values our eternal salvation too much to finance our destruction.
2.  **The Purpose of Health:** The true Christian asks for health *so that* they may serve God and bless humanity. If our motive is selfish, heaven cannot answer.
3.  **God's Higher View:** Sometimes, God sees that if a person were healed, they would lose their soul. In mercy, He may allow them to sleep in Jesus to save them for eternity. (Isaiah 57:1).

**[ILL]** A parent will not give a sharp knife back to a toddler who just cut himself with it. The child may cry for it, but the parent refuses out of love. God sometimes withholds health if He sees we would use that strength to hurt ourselves spiritually.

***

### Q17. Why could not the disciples, on a certain occasion, cast the demon out of a child?

**"Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief." Matt. 17:19, 20.**

**Answer:**

The failure was not in God's power, but in the disciples' reception of it.

1.  **Unbelief:** This is the great barrier. Unbelief insulates us from the power of heaven. The disciples had been arguing about who was the greatest (Mark 9:34) rather than praying and fasting. Their pride and self-sufficiency severed their connection with Christ.
2.  **Prayer and Fasting:** In the parallel passage (Mark 9:29), Jesus adds, "This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting."
    *   **Fasting:** Disconnecting from the world and fleshly appetite.
    *   **Prayer:** Connecting with heaven.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Victory over the enemy (Satan) requires total dependence on Christ. "Without me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5). The disciples failed because they tried to operate on past experience rather than present, living faith.

**[ILL]** A diver relies on an air hose connected to the surface. If that hose is kinked or cut, he suffocates. Unbelief and self-reliance "kink" our hose to heaven. Prayer and fasting straighten it out, allowing the power of the Spirit to flow freely again.

***

### Note on God's Will and Healing

*As noted in the lesson:*
We must remember that we live in the "Great Controversy." Sickness is the result of sin and Satan's work. While God is the Healer, He does not always heal everyone instantly in this life.
1.  **Conditions:** We must fulfill the conditions (obedience to health laws, confession of sin, faith).
2.  **Submission:** We must pray as Jesus did in Gethsemane, "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).
3.  **Trust:** If God does not remove the sickness, we trust that His grace is sufficient (2 Corinthians 12:9), and we look forward to the resurrection morning when "this corruptible must put on incorruption" (1 Corinthians 15:53).
