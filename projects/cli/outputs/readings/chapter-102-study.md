Here is an extended Bible study based on the outline provided. It reflects the
historic Seventh-day Adventist pioneer perspective, focusing on the Great
Controversy, the Sanctuary message, and the practical experience of
Righteousness by Faith.

# Origin, History, and Destiny of Satan

**Introduction:** To understand the problem of suffering and the plan of
salvation, we must understand the origin of evil. Sin is an intruder; it has no
reason for existence. The Bible reveals that evil did not originate with God,
but with a created being who chose rebellion. This study traces the history of
the adversary, not to glorify him, but to expose his devices and highlight the
glorious victory available in Christ.

### Q1. Have any others than the human family sinned?

**“God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and
delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment." 2 Peter
2:4.**

**Answer:** Yes, sin existed before the creation of Adam and Eve. The Bible
reveals that a portion of the angelic host rebelled against God’s government.

- **The Reality of Sin:** Sin is not merely a human flaw; it is a cosmic
  rebellion against the authority and law of God (1 John 3:4).
- **God’s Justice:** The text says God "spared not" the angels. This shows that
  God is no respecter of persons. High position does not grant immunity from the
  law. If God did not overlook sin in angels of light, He cannot overlook it in
  us.
- **Reserved for Judgment:** These fallen beings are currently restricted
  ("chains of darkness") awaiting a final day of accounting.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a mutiny on a royal ship. The rebellion starts
not with the passengers, but with the officers. The captain must eventually
suppress the mutiny to save the ship, even if it means imprisoning trusted
officers.

---

### Q2. What is the name of him who led them to sin?

**“Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and
his angels." Matt. 25:41.**

**Answer:** The leader of the rebellion is called the Devil.

- **A Personal Being:** Satan is not merely an abstract influence of evil or a
  "dark side" of human nature. Jesus refers to him as a specific entity with his
  own "angels" (followers).
- **The Origin of Hellfire:** It is crucial to note that the "everlasting fire"
  was _prepared_ for the Devil and his angels, not for humanity. God’s original
  plan for man was only life and happiness. Those who are lost share this fate
  only because they choose to ally themselves with the rebel leader rather than
  the Savior.

---

### Q3. Is he known by any other name?

**“And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil and
Satan, which deceiveth the whole world." Rev. 12:9.**

**Answer:** He has several titles, each describing a specific aspect of his
character and work:

- **The Dragon:** Represents his power to persecute and destroy.
- **The Serpent:** Refers to his cunning and deception, recalling the Garden of
  Eden (Genesis 3:1).
- **The Devil:** Means "The Slanderer." He slanders God to man (saying God is
  severe and arbitrary) and slanders man to God (accusing us of our sins).
- **Satan:** Means "The Adversary." He opposes everything that is good, holy,
  and true.

**Term Definition:**

> **The Great Controversy:** The cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan
> regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the
> universe.

---

### Q4. Where was his abode before he fell?

**“And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven." Luke
10:18.**

**Answer:** Before his fall, Satan dwelt in **heaven**. Evil did not originate
in a dark corner of the universe, but in the very presence of God. This
highlights the mystery of iniquity—that sin could arise in a perfect
environment.

---

### Q5. What was his position in heaven?

**“Thou are the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so; thou wast
upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the
stones of fire." Eze. 28:14.**

**Answer:** Satan, originally named Lucifer (Isaiah 14:12), held the highest
position of any created being.

- **Anointed Cherub that Covereth:** This is sanctuary language. In the
  sanctuary, the "covering cherubim" stood directly over the Ark of the
  Covenant, overshadowing the Mercy Seat (Exodus 25:20).
- **Proximity to the Law:** Lucifer stood in the immediate presence of God’s
  glory ("stones of fire"). He was the guardian of God's law. He knew better
  than any other creature that God’s law is holy, just, and good. His rebellion
  was, therefore, fully conscious and inexcusable.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If the Prime Minister, who stands next to the King and
knows the King's heart better than anyone, turns traitor, his betrayal is far
worse than that of a common citizen who does not know the King.

---

### Q6. What was his condition when created?

**“Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created, till
iniquity was found in thee." Eze. 28:15.**

**Answer:** God did not create a devil; He created a holy, beautiful angel.

- **Created Perfect:** God is the author of perfection (Deuteronomy 32:4).
  Lucifer was created with a perfect form, a perfect mind, and a perfect
  character.
- **Free Will:** The phrase "till iniquity was found in thee" implies that the
  change came from within Lucifer. God took the risk of creating beings with
  free will because only free beings can truly love. A robot cannot love; it
  only functions. Lucifer used his God-given freedom to choose self over God.

---

### Q7. Why was he cast from his high position?

**“By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with
violence, and thou hast sinned; therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the
mountain of God; and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of
the stones of fire." Eze. 28:16.**

**Answer:** The root of his fall was pride and self-seeking, which led to
"traffic" or "merchandise" (trading).

- **Spiritual "Merchandise":** This likely refers to Lucifer going among the
  angels, spreading dissatisfaction and trading in lies about God’s government.
  He sought to sell his own ideas to the heavenly host.
- **Violence:** Rebellion against God’s law inevitably leads to violence. The
  spirit of Satan is the spirit of murder (John 8:44).
- **The Definition of Sin:** The verse says, "thou hast sinned." The Bible
  defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). Lucifer rebelled
  against the principles of God’s government.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:** Lucifer fell because he focused on his
own beauty and sought to exalt _self_. We are saved when we do the opposite: we
look away from self to Christ (Hebrews 12:2) and seek to honor Him.

---

### Q8. Where were the cherubim placed in the earthly sanctuary erected by Moses?

**“And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all;
which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about
with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that
budded, and the tables of the covenant; and over it the cherubim of glory
shadowing [covering] the mercy seat." Heb. 9:3-5 (Ex. 25:16-22).**

**Answer:** In the earthly sanctuary, the golden cherubim were placed in the
**Most Holy Place**, stationed on either side of the Ark of the Covenant.

- **Guardians of the Law:** They looked reverently down upon the Mercy Seat,
  beneath which lay the Ten Commandments ("tables of the covenant").
- **The Post of Honor:** This confirms that the "covering cherub" (Lucifer's
  original role) was the position nearest to God's throne.

---

### Q9. Of what was this sanctuary a pattern?

**“It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should
be purified with these." Heb. 9:23; 8:1-5.**

**Answer:** The earthly sanctuary was a "pattern" or "shadow" of the **heavenly
sanctuary**.

- **Type and Antitype:** Just as a shadow points to a real object, the earthly
  tabernacle (the type) pointed to the true tabernacle in heaven (the antitype)
  where Christ now ministers.
- **Realities:** The structure of the earthly sanctuary teaches us about the
  reality of God’s dwelling place and the plan of salvation.

**Term Definition:**

> **Sanctuary:** The dwelling place of God. The earthly sanctuary was a scale
> model used to teach Israel how God deals with sin. The heavenly sanctuary is
> the command center of the universe where Christ mediates for us.

---

### Q10. Is there a temple in heaven, containing the ark of the testament, or covenant?

**“And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple
the ark of His testament." Rev. 11:19.**

**Answer:** Yes. The Bible clearly states that the Ark of the Testament
(Covenant) is in heaven.

- **The Original Law:** Since the earthly ark contained the Ten Commandments
  written on stone, the heavenly Ark contains the great original standard of
  God's righteousness—the Moral Law.
- **Immutable Standard:** This proves that the Ten Commandments were not
  abolished at the cross. They are the eternal foundation of God’s government,
  kept in the heavenly temple. Satan rebelled against this law in heaven; he
  continues to war against it on earth.

---

### Q11. In the earthly sanctuary, where did God dwell by the symbol of His presence?

**“I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two
cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will
give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel." Ex. 25:22.**

**Answer:** God’s presence (the Shekinah glory) dwelt **between the cherubim**,
above the Mercy Seat.

- **Law and Mercy:** God dwelt directly above the Law (justice) but He met the
  people at the Mercy Seat (grace). This illustrates the foundation of the
  Gospel: Justice and Mercy meet in Christ (Psalm 85:10).

---

### Q12. Where is God's throne in heaven?

**"'The Lord reigneth: let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubim;
let the earth be moved." Ps. 99:1.**

**Answer:** God’s throne in heaven is situated **between the cherubim**. This
confirms that Lucifer, as the "covering cherub," was stationed at the very
throne of Deity. His fall was a fall from the greatest height possible for a
creature.

---

### Q13. When cast out of the mountain of God, to what place was Satan banished, to be kept till the judgment?

**“For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and
delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.." 2 Peter
2:4.**

**Answer:** He was cast down to "hell" (the Greek word is _Tartarus_, indicating
a place of darkness or restraint, often understood here as the earth's
atmosphere or this dark world).

- **Limited Sphere:** Satan is no longer permitted to roam the universe freely.
  He is confined to this planet, which he has claimed as his kingdom.
- **Reserved unto Judgment:** He is a defeated foe awaiting his final
  sentencing.

---

### Q14. What has been the character of Satan ever since he has had access to this world?

**“He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the
beginning." 1 John 3:8.**

**Answer:** His character is one of continuous sin. "The Devil sinneth" (present
continuous tense). He is the originator and sustainer of all rebellion.

- **The Contrast:** Verse 8 continues: "For this purpose the Son of God was
  manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil." Satan builds sin;
  Christ destroys sin and builds righteousness.

---

### Q15. Was he ever in the truth?

**"Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do; he
was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth." John 8:44.**

**Answer:** The phrase "abode not in the truth" implies that he was _once_ in
the truth but did not remain there.

- **Truth is Moral:** In Scripture, truth is not just intellectual fact; it is
  moral connection with God. Satan abandoned his loyalty to God.
- **Father of Lies:** Having rejected the truth, he had to manufacture a
  substitute reality—lies. Every sin begins with a lie (e.g., "You shall not
  surely die").

---

### Q16. What is the only "beginning" of which we have any knowledge?

**“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Gen. 1:1.**

**Answer:** This refers to the beginning of our world’s history. When Jesus said
Satan was a murderer "from the beginning," He meant from the beginning of his
interaction with humanity. His first act toward man was to murder Adam and Eve
spiritually by leading them into sin, which brings death (Romans 6:23).

---

### Q17. What has been the result of Satan's bringing sin into the world through our first parents?

**“And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness." 1
John 5:19.**

**Answer:** The result is that the entire world system is under the influence of
the wicked one ("lieth in the wicked one").

- **Lost Dominion:** Adam was created to be the ruler of the earth, but by
  obeying Satan, he surrendered his dominion.
- **Need for Rescue:** Because the world lies in wickedness, we cannot save
  ourselves. We need a Savior from _outside_ this world to intervene.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A man in quicksand cannot pull himself out by his own
hair. He needs a firm hand from solid ground to reach down and save him. That
Hand is Christ.

---

### Q18. When Christ came to redeem the world, what did Satan do to Him?

**“And immediately the Spirit driveth Him into the wilderness. And He was there
in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and
the angels ministered unto Him." Mark 1:12, 13. See also Matt. 4:1-11.**

**Answer:** Satan fiercely tempted Christ. He knew that if he could cause Jesus
to commit even one sin, the plan of salvation would fail, and Satan would secure
his claim over the earth.

---

### Q19. How severely was Christ tempted?

**“For we have not a High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
Heb. 4:15.**

**Answer:** Christ was tempted "in all points" as we are.

- **The Humanity of Christ:** To save us, Christ took upon Himself our fallen
  human nature (Hebrews 2:14-17). He fought the battle on our ground, feeling
  the pull of hunger, weariness, and the desire for self-preservation.
- **Victory is Possible:** Because Jesus conquered sin _in human flesh_, He
  proved that humanity, connected to divinity by faith, can keep God’s law.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We do not overcome by our own power, but by the
  "faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12). His victory is credited to us for
  justification, and His life is lived out in us for sanctification.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a general sits in a bunker miles from the front line,
he cannot understand the soldier's fear. But our General (Jesus) jumped into the
trench with us, fought the enemy face-to-face, and won.

---

### Q20. Has the church suffered persecution since the days of Christ?

**“And when the dragon [Satan. verse 9] saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
persecuted the woman [the church] ." Rev. 12:13.**

**Answer:** Yes. Unable to destroy Christ, Satan turned his wrath against
Christ’s followers.

- **The Woman:** In Bible prophecy, a pure woman represents God’s true church
  (Jeremiah 6:2; 2 Corinthians 11:2).
- **Historical Fulfillment:** This prophecy was notably fulfilled during the
  1260 years of papal supremacy (538 A.D. – 1798 A.D.), where millions of
  Bible-believing Christians were persecuted for their faith.

---

### Q21. Will the last, or remnant, church feel his wrath? and why?

**“And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the
remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony
of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.**

**Answer:** Yes, the "remnant" (the last piece of the cloth, identical to the
first piece) will face Satan's special wrath.

- **Identifying Marks:** The true church in the last days is identified by two
  characteristics:
  1.  **They keep the commandments of God:** Not 9, but all 10, including the
      fourth commandment Sabbath.
  2.  **They have the testimony of Jesus:** Which Revelation 19:10 defines as
      "the spirit of prophecy."
- **Why the Wrath?** Satan hates the Law because it exposes his lies. He hates
  the Spirit of Prophecy because it exposes his plans.

---

### Q22. How will he deceive men in the closing work of the gospel?

**“And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles
which he had power to do in the sight of the beast." Rev. 13:14.**

**Answer:** He will use **miracles** and supernatural signs.

- **Counterfeit Revival:** In the last days, faith will not be a matter of
  seeing, but of believing God's Word. Satan will produce spectacular miracles
  (healings, apparitions) to prove that he is god.
- **The Test:** We must test every spirit by the law and the testimony (Isaiah
  8:20). If a miracle worker contradicts the Bible or God's Law, the power is
  not from God.

---

### Q23. What will be the tendency of this work?

**“For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the
kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that
great day of God Almighty." Rev. 16:14.**

**Answer:** The tendency is to unite the political and religious powers of the
world against God's people, leading to the final conflict (Armageddon).
Spiritualism (communication with the dead/demons) will be the glue that bonds
disparate religions and nations together.

---

### Q24. Why will men be thus allowed to fall under the delusion of Satan?

**“They received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for
this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie,
that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in
unrighteousness." 2 Thess. 2:10-12.**

**Answer:** Men are deceived because they reject the truth.

- **Moral Choice:** Deception is not just an intellectual mistake; it is often a
  heart issue. When people prefer "pleasure in unrighteousness" over the clear
  Word of God, they open the door to Satan's lies.
- **Sanctification by Truth:** Jesus said, "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy
  word is truth" (John 17:17). To be safe from the final delusion, we must love
  the truth and allow it to change our lives.

---

### Q25. What will be his last work?

**“And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his
prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters
of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, the number of
whom is as the sand of the sea." Rev. 20:7, 8.**

**Answer:** His last work is to deceive the resurrected wicked at the end of the
Millennium.

- **The Millennium:** For 1000 years, the earth is desolate (Satan's prison). At
  the end, the wicked are resurrected (the "second resurrection").
- **Incorrigible:** Even after 1000 years of reflection, Satan’s character is
  unchanged. He immediately organizes the wicked to attack the Holy City, the
  New Jerusalem, which has descended from heaven.

---

### Q26. As Satan and his host compass the camp of the saints, what will take place?

**“And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the
saints about, and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven,
and devoured them." Rev. 20:9.**

**Answer:** Fire comes down from God and **devours** them. This is the "Second
Death." The long controversy ends not with a physical battle, but with the
executive judgment of God.

---

### Q27. What doom will he finally meet?

**“I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that
behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at
thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be anymore." Eze. 28:18, 19;
Heb. 2:14.**

**Answer:** Satan will be completely destroyed—reduced to ashes.

- **No Eternal Torment:** The Bible does not teach that Satan will oversee a
  burning hell for eternity. Ezekiel says, "never shalt thou be anymore."
- **Clean Universe:** Sin, sinners, and the originator of sin will be blotted
  out. The universe will be clean again. This is the ultimate vindication of
  God’s character—He removes sin without perpetuating suffering forever.

---

### Q28. What exhortation is given to Christians in view of Satan's hatred of them?

**“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion,
walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist steadfast in the faith."
1 Peter 5:8, 9.**

**Answer:** We are called to sobriety, vigilance, and resistance through faith.

- **Resist:** We are not to fear Satan, but to resist him. James 4:7 promises,
  "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from
  you."
- **Steadfast in the Faith:** Victory comes not by our own strength, but by
  holding fast to Jesus.
- **Sanctuary Application:** As our High Priest intercedes in the heavenly
  sanctuary, we must afflict our souls, turn from every known sin, and trust in
  His blood to cover us and His Spirit to empower us.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A roaring lion is terrifying to an unarmed man, but to a
man inside a fortress, the roar is harmless. Christ is our Fortress (Psalm 91).
As long as we abide in Him, the lion cannot touch us.
