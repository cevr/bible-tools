## Slide 1 – Title: The Spirits in Prison

**A Bible Study on Atonement, the State of the Dead, and Victory over Sin**

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Suffering of Christ

- **Question:** In what way did Christ suffer for the unjust?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:18 – “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the
  just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death In the
  flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Atonement & Justification)

- **The Divine Exchange**
  - Christ is the "Just" (Righteous); we are the "unjust" (law-breakers).
  - He took our penalty (death) to give us His reward (life).
  - **Definition of Atonement:** Romans 5:11 – “And not only so, but we also joy
    in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the
    atonement.”
- **Suffering for Sin**
  - Christ was more than a martyr; He was the Sin-Bearer.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no
    sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”
  - **Sanctuary Connection:** Like the **Altar of Sacrifice**, the innocent Lamb
    died for the guilty sinner.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Key Points (Reconciliation & Faith)

- **Bringing Us to God**
  - Sin causes separation (Isaiah 59:2). Christ acts as the Bridge-Builder to
    restore communion.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
    that is in Christ Jesus.”
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - We cannot climb to God with ropes of our own works.
  - We must be _brought_ by Christ.
  - Faith lays hold of Him, and He carries us into the Father's presence.

---

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Debtor and the Prince**
  - Imagine a debtor in a dark prison, owing a sum he can never pay.
  - The judge must keep him there legally.
  - A wealthy Prince pays the entire debt and opens the door.
  - The Prince does not just pay; He leads the ex-prisoner by the hand into the
    King's palace as a friend.
  - **Application:** Christ paid our debt of death to bring us out of
    condemnation and into the throne room of God.

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Christ Made Alive

- **Question:** By what was He quickened, or made alive?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:18 – “Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened
  by the Spirit.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points (Resurrection & Power)

- **Put to Death in the Flesh**
  - Christ took upon Himself our nature and truly died.
  - Hebrews 2:16 – “For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
    took on him the seed of Abraham.”
- **Quickened by the Spirit**
  - "Quickened" means made alive.
  - The resurrection demonstrates the power of the Spirit (Romans 8:11).
- **Sanctification: The Power to Overcome**
  - The same Spirit that raised Christ dwells in the believer to conquer sin.
  - Ephesians 2:1 – “And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and
    sins.”
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification...”

---

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Seed and the Life-Force**
  - A dry seed has no power to grow on its own.
  - When placed in soil and touched by rain/sun (symbols of the Spirit), life is
    triggered.
  - It bursts through the hard shell and heavy earth to bear fruit.
  - **Application:** We are the seed; the Holy Spirit is the life-force that
    "quickens" us to bear the fruit of righteousness.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Preaching to Spirits in Prison

- **Question:** By what did He preach to the spirits in prison?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:19 – “By which also He went and preached unto the
  spirits in prison.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Agency of the Spirit)

- **"By Which" (The Method)**
  - Refers back to the "Spirit" in verse 18.
  - Christ preached _by the Holy Spirit_.
  - 1 Peter 1:11 – “Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
    which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings
    of Christ...”
- **Agency of Preaching**
  - Christ preached to the people before the Flood (antediluvians) through His
    representative, Noah.
  - 2 Peter 2:5 – “And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth
    person, a preacher of righteousness...”

---

## Slide 11 – Q3: Key Points (State of the Dead)

- **No Second Chance After Death**
  - The Bible teaches the dead are unconscious.
  - Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead
    know not any thing...”
  - Hebrews 9:27 – “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
    the judgment.”
- **The Warning**
  - The preaching happened while the people were still alive.
  - God always warns before destruction (Amos 3:7).

---

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The President and the Ambassador**
  - If a President sends an ambassador to deliver a message, the ambassador
    speaks the President's words.
  - We say, "The President told them," even though he was not physically there.
  - **Application:** Christ preached to the lost generation of Noah's day _by_
    the Spirit, speaking _through_ Noah.

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: The Mission of Christ

- **Question:** What did the Saviour say He had been anointed to do?
- **Key Text:** Luke 4:18 – “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath
  anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the
  brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight
  to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q4: Key Points (Spiritual Liberty)

- **Identifying the Captives**
  - Christ came to open the spiritual prison house of Satan.
  - **"Spirits in Prison"** = Living men and women bound by sinful habits and
    ignorance.
- **The Gospel as Power**
  - Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
    power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth...”
- **Righteousness by Faith Application**
  - Christ provides power to _stop_ sinning.
  - He sets the captive free from the _power_ of sin, not just the guilt.
  - Revelation 3:18 – “...and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest
    see.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Chain and the Iron Ball**
  - Imagine a man chained to a heavy iron ball; he cannot run.
  - Forgiveness alone is like saying, "I forgive you for being slow," but
    leaving the chain.
  - The Gospel is the bolt-cutter.
  - **Application:** Christ forgives the past (Justification) and cuts the chain
    of habit (Sanctification), setting the prisoner at liberty.

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Bondage and Slavery

- **Question:** By whom is a man taken into bondage?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 2:19 – “For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
  brought in bondage.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q5: Key Points (Mastership)

- **The Law of Bondage**
  - You serve whoever you obey.
  - Romans 6:16 – “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to
    obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of
    obedience unto righteousness?”
- **Overcome vs. Overcomer**
  - To be "overcome" by sin is to be in prison.
  - To "overcome" is the promise of victory.
  - Revelation 3:21 – “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my
    throne...”
- **The Lie of Liberty**
  - You cannot claim to be free if you are sinning; sin is bondage.

---

## Slide 18 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Defeated Army**
  - In ancient times, defeated soldiers became the slaves of the victor.
  - They lost their rights and had to obey the conqueror.
  - **Application:** When we yield to temptation, we surrender territory to
    Satan. Only Christ, the Stronger One (Luke 11:21-22), can win us back.

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Sold Under Sin

- **Question:** Under what is one thus sold into bondage?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:14 – “For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am
  carnal, sold under sin.”

---

## Slide 20 – Q6: Key Points (The Law & The Sinner)

- **The Nature of the Law**
  - The law is "spiritual," "holy," and "good" (Romans 7:12).
  - It detects the thoughts and intents of the heart.
- **The Nature of Man (Carnal)**
  - "Carnal" means fleshly, unrenewed.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **"Sold Under Sin"**
  - We are born into the slave market of sin, unable to buy our own freedom.
  - **Sanctuary Connection:** We need a Kinsman-Redeemer (Leviticus 25:48) to
    pay the price we cannot pay.

---

## Slide 21 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Mirror and the Dirt**
  - The Law is like a mirror; it shows the dirt on your face (sin).
  - The mirror is truthful and good, but it cannot wash the face.
  - You are "sold" to the dirt until you go to the soap and water.
  - **Application:** The Law points out the prison; Christ opens the door.

---

## Slide 22 – Q7: The Timing of the Preaching

- **Question:** When did the Spirit of God preach to these "spirits in prison,"
  who were disobedient?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:20 – “Which sometime were disobedient, when once the
  longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
  preparing.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q7: Key Points (Probation)

- **The Specific Timeframe**
  - The preaching happened "in the days of Noah."
  - The "spirits in prison" were the disobedient people alive then.
- **Longsuffering and Probation**
  - God waited 120 years (Genesis 6:3).
  - Ezekiel 33:11 – “...As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the
    death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live...”
- **Sanctuary Application**
  - Just as the ark was preparing, Christ is preparing a place for us now (John
    14:2).
  - There is a time of probation before the door closes (Luke 17:26).

---

## Slide 24 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Death Row Pardon**
  - A Governor sends a pardon to a prisoner on death row.
  - The prisoner mocks and rejects it. Later, he is executed.
  - The Governor tried to save him _while he was alive_.
  - **Application:** The offer of mercy was made while "longsuffering waited,"
    not after death.

---

## Slide 25 – Q8: The Striving Spirit

- **Question:** Did the Spirit of God try to deliver the captives of sin in the
  days of Noah?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:3 – “And the LORD said, My Spirit shall not always
  strive with man, for that he also is flesh; yet his days shall be a hundred
  and twenty years.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q8: Key Points (Striving & Mercy)

- **The Striving of the Spirit**
  - The Spirit battles against our carnal nature.
  - Galatians 5:17 – “For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
    against the flesh...”
  - John 16:8 – “And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
    righteousness, and of judgment.”
- **The Limit of Mercy**
  - "My Spirit shall not always strive."
  - Persistent rejection leads to the unpardonable sin (Matthew 12:31-32).
  - We must hear His voice "Today" (Hebrews 3:15).

---

## Slide 27 – Q8: Application (Sanctuary)

- **Christ the Mediator**
  - Christ was the "Angel of the Lord" in the Old Testament (Exodus 23:20-21).
  - It was His Spirit in Noah pleading with the people.
- **Antitypical Day of Atonement**
  - We are living in the great Day of Atonement.
  - We must allow the Spirit to break the "prison" of our bad habits now, while
    the Ark of safety is still open.

---

## Slide 28 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Warning Siren**
  - A siren blows at the beach to warn of an approaching hurricane.
  - The lifeguard shouts, but people ignore the sound to enjoy the water.
  - Eventually, the siren stops because the storm has arrived.
  - **Application:** We must heed the Spirit while He strives, before the time
    of probation ends.
