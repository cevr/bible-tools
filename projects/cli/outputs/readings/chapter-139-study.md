### Q1. What is the promise to those who ask and seek for the things they need?

“Everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." Matt. 7:8.

**Answer:**

The promise of God regarding prayer is absolute and unconditional for the sincere heart. Christ presents a threefold progression of intensity: asking, seeking, and knocking.

1.  **The Certainty of the Promise:** The text does not say "might receive," but "receiveth." God is not reluctant; He is more willing to give than we are to receive.
2.  **The Progression of Faith:**
    *   **Asking:** Represents the simple request of a child to a father, acknowledging dependence.
    *   **Seeking:** Implies a deeper pursuit, searching the Scriptures and one’s own heart.
    *   **Knocking:** Suggests perseverance, overcoming obstacles, and desiring entrance into the presence of the King.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** We often ask for temporal blessings, but the greatest need is the righteousness of Christ. When we ask for pardon (Justification) and a new heart (Sanctification), we can be sure God answers immediately. We do not need to *feel* the answer; we have His word for it.

*   **Justification:** God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ’s merits, not their own works (Romans 3:24; 5:1).
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to purify the believer’s character and make them holy in daily life (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]** A beggar knocking at a king's gate does not break down the door. He knocks and waits, confident that the king is generous. Our knocking is not to persuade God to be good, but to open our own hearts to receive the abundance He is already waiting to pour out.

### Q2. How does the Saviour illustrate the willingness of Heaven to grant favors to those who ask?

“If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?" Matt. 7:11.

**Answer:**

Christ uses an argument from the lesser to the greater to establish our confidence in God.

*   **Human vs. Divine Nature:** Even fallen humanity ("being evil"—meaning possessing a sinful nature) still possesses natural affection for their offspring. If sinful parents delight in feeding their children, how much more does the infinite God, whose very nature is love (1 John 4:8), delight to bless His children?
*   **The "Good Things":** In the parallel passage of Luke 11:13, Jesus specifies that these "good things" are the Holy Spirit. The Spirit brings the life of Christ into the soul, which is the essence of the New Covenant promise (Ezekiel 36:26–27).
*   **The Fatherhood of God:** We do not pray to a distant tyrant, but to a Father who pities His children (Psalm 103:13). This relationship is the foundation of all true prayer.

---

### Q3. In whose name should we present our prayers to God?

"And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it." John 14:13, 14.

**Answer:**

To pray in the name of Jesus is the key that unlocks the storehouse of heaven.

1.  **Mediatorial Authority:** We have no merit of our own to present before the Father. Our best prayers are stained with selfishness. We must approach God through the merit of our High Priest, Jesus Christ.
2.  **The Sanctuary Meaning:** In the earthly sanctuary, the priest offered incense upon the golden altar before the veil. This incense represents the merits and intercession of Christ mingled with the prayers of the saints (Revelation 8:3–4). We cannot approach the Father directly in our own name; we come covered in the righteousness of the Son.
3.  **Praying in His Character:** "In His name" means more than closing a prayer with a formula. It means praying in His Spirit, for the things He would desire, and submitting our will to His. It is a union of the human purpose with the Divine will.

*   **Intercession:** The work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, pleading His blood on our behalf to secure our pardon and help (Hebrews 7:25).

**[ILL]** If a poor man goes to the bank with a check signed by the wealthiest man in the city, the bank does not look at the poor man's clothes or poverty; they look at the signature on the check. When we pray, we present the "signature" of Jesus Christ. God honors the request for the sake of His Son.

---

### Q4. Why is it necessary to ask God for all these things?

“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." James 1:17.

**Answer:**

Asking is necessary not to inform God of our needs, but to acknowledge our source.

*   **Total Dependence:** The fall of man resulted in a separation from God. Independent living is the essence of sin. Prayer restores the proper order: the creature depending entirely on the Creator.
*   **The Source of Righteousness:** As James states, *every* good gift comes from above. We cannot generate righteousness, patience, or love from within our fallen nature (Romans 7:18). It must be "imparted" or given to us from outside, from the Father.
*   **God’s Unchangeable Nature:** God does not change ("no variableness"). Prayer does not change God; it changes us. It brings us into a condition where God can consistently grant us blessings that would be harmful if we were proud or self-sufficient.

---

### Q5. Through what means are these gifts received?

“Everyone that asketh receiveth." Matt. 7:8. "If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him." Matt. 7:11. "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it you." John 16:23. "Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full." John 16:24.

**Answer:**

The appointed means of reception is **asking in faith**.

*   **The Law of Reception:** God has established a spiritual law: we must ask to receive. He respects our free will and will not force His blessings, especially the blessing of character transformation, upon those who do not desire or request it.
*   **Fullness of Joy:** The result of this transaction is "joy." This is the joy of a cleansed conscience and a restored relationship with God (Psalm 51:12).
*   **Sanctuary Application:** Just as the Israelites brought their sacrifices to the door of the tabernacle to receive atonement, we must bring our petitions to the throne of grace to receive mercy and help (Hebrews 4:16).

---

### Q6. How should we pray to God.

“I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also." 1 Cor. 14:15.

**Answer:**

Paul instructs that true prayer engages the whole person—heart and mind.

1.  **With the Spirit:** Prayer must be energized by the Holy Spirit. It is not cold logic or recitation. "For we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us" (Romans 8:26).
2.  **With the Understanding:** Emotionalism without truth is dangerous. Our prayers should be intelligent, based on a knowledge of God's will as revealed in His Word.
3.  **Balance:** To pray only with the understanding makes one a formalist (dry legalism); to pray only with the "spirit" (emotion) without biblical understanding leads to fanaticism. True Righteousness by Faith involves the intellect grasping the promise and the heart trusting the Promiser.

---

### Q7. With what should the prayers of a suppliant be mingled?

“Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God." Phil. 4:6.

**Answer:**

Our requests must be mingled with **thanksgiving**.

*   **The Cure for Anxiety:** The command "be careful for nothing" means "be anxious for nothing." The antidote to worry is thankful prayer.
*   **Gratitude as Faith:** Thanking God *before* we see the answer is the highest form of faith. It acknowledges that God is faithful and that His past leadings guarantee His future care.
*   **Supplication:** This term refers to earnest, humble entreaty. It implies a sense of need. We come not demanding a right, but begging for grace.

**[ILL]** If a child constantly asks a parent for gifts but never says "thank you" for what has already been received, the relationship becomes transactional and cold. Thanksgiving warms the heart and opens it to receive more.

---

### Q8. Should certain forms be repeated in public for the purpose of being heard by men?

“But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking." Matt. 6:7.

**Answer:**

Christ warns against performative or mechanical prayer.

*   **Vain Repetitions:** God is not impressed by the length of a prayer or the repetition of words, as if He were deaf or needed to be worn down. This was a common practice in heathen worship (e.g., the prophets of Baal in 1 Kings 18:26).
*   **Public vs. Private:** Prayer intended to be "heard by men" is hypocrisy. It turns an act of worship into a display of self-righteousness.
*   **Simplicity:** The prayer of the publican, "God be merciful to me a sinner" (Luke 18:13), was short, but it was heard because it came from a broken heart.

---

### Q9. What must necessarily prompt our petitions, in order to please God?

“But without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." Heb. 11:6.

**Answer:**

**Faith** is the essential element of prevailing prayer.

*   **Defining Faith:** In this context, faith is not just believing God exists ("that He is"), but believing in His character as a "rewarder." It is trust in His benevolence.
*   **The Root of Righteousness:** All true obedience springs from faith. If we do not believe God loves us and wants to empower us, we will try to earn His favor by works. Faith accepts that the favor is already given in Christ.
*   **Diligence:** Faith is not passive; it "diligently seeks." It pursues God because it values Him above all else.

---

### Q10. How strong must this faith be?

“Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them." Mark 11:24.

**Answer:**

Faith must be strong enough to believe the transaction is done the moment the request is made according to God's will.

*   **Present Tense:** "Believe that ye *receive* them" (in the Greek, it often carries the sense of "have received").
*   **God's Word is Fact:** In Creation, God spoke, and it was done. In redemption, when God promises, it is as good as done.
*   **Practical Application:** When we ask for victory over a specific sin, we must rise from our knees believing that Christ *has* given us the power, and act upon that faith. We do not wait to feel the power; we go forward, and the power comes.

**[ILL]** When you purchase something online, you receive a confirmation email. You do not have the product in your hands yet, but you "own" it because you trust the merchant. God's promise in the Bible is the confirmation receipt.

### Q11. When praying for forgiveness, how should we feel toward those who have in any way injured us?

“And when ye stand praying, forgive if ye have aught against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses." Mark 11:25.

**Answer:**

We must possess a spirit of **forgiveness** toward others.

*   **The Condition:** God’s forgiveness is offered freely, but a heart that is hard and unforgiving toward others is closed to the Spirit of God. We cannot receive the flow of God's mercy if we block that flow to others.
*   **Reflecting the Character:** To be a Christian is to have the character of Christ. Christ forgave His murderers. If we refuse to forgive, we are declaring that we do not belong to Him.

---

### Q12. What will result if this injunction is not carried out?

“But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses." Mark 11:26.

**Answer:**

The result is the retention of our own guilt.

*   **Not Arbitrary:** This is not God being vindictive. It is a spiritual reality. An unforgiving spirit is a form of cherished sin. As long as we cherish sin (even a "respectable" sin like a grudge), we cannot be justified.
*   **Atonement Blocked:** In the sanctuary service, the blood was applied to cleanse sin. If we hold onto bitterness, we are refusing the cleansing process. We cannot be right with God while wrong with our brother (1 John 4:20).

---

### Q13. What should we do when in affliction?

“Is any among you afflicted? let him pray." James 5:13.

**Answer:**

Affliction should drive us to **prayer**, not to complaint or despair.

*   **The Purpose of Trials:** Trials are often the discipline of God to refine our characters (Hebrews 12:6, 11). Prayer in affliction connects us to the Comforter.
*   **Victory:** We may not always be delivered *from* the affliction, but through prayer, we are given grace to bear it, which is a greater victory (2 Corinthians 12:9).

---

### Q14. Should we pray in secret?

“But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly." Matt. 6:6.

**Answer:**

Yes, secret prayer is the lifeblood of the soul.

*   **The "Closet":** This represents any place of privacy where the soul can be alone with God.
*   **Authenticity:** In public, we may be tempted to pray to impress others. In secret, it is just us and God. The masks come off. We can confess the secret sins that we would never speak aloud in public.
*   **Sanctuary Type:** The High Priest went alone into the Most Holy Place. In secret prayer, we enter the audience chamber of the Most High to obtain mercy.

---

### Q15. To what places did our Saviour retire for secret devotion?

“And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, He was there alone." Matt. 14:23.

**Answer:**

Jesus chose quiet, secluded places like mountains and gardens.

*   **The Example:** If the spotless Son of God felt the need to retire from the busyness of ministry to recharge through prayer, how much more do we, with our sinful natures, need this time?
*   **Communion with Nature:** Being in nature, away from the noise of man, helps the soul hear the voice of God more clearly.

---

### Q16. But if it should happen that we were thrown into the presence of those who ridicule prayer, or were forbidden to pray, should we give up our customary devotion?

“Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime." Dan. 6:10.

**Answer:**

No, we must value our duty to God above the laws of men or the ridicule of the world.

*   **Daniel's Consistency:** Daniel did not change his habit. He did not hide, nor did he ostentatiously parade his prayer. He did "as he did aforetime."
*   **The Great Controversy:** This foreshadows the final conflict. The law of the land (Medo-Persia) conflicted with the law of God (Commandment 1). Daniel chose obedience to God, even at the risk of death (Acts 5:29).
*   **Windows toward Jerusalem:** Daniel looked toward the earthly sanctuary, which was in ruins, by faith looking to the restoration. We look toward the Heavenly Sanctuary, where Jesus ministers for us.

---

### Q17. What is said of Cornelius and his family?

“A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway." Acts 10:2.

**Answer:**

Cornelius is an example of practical godliness combined with a prayerful life.

*   **Universal Grace:** Though a Gentile, his prayers and alms went up as a "memorial before God" (Acts 10:4). This shows that God hears the sincere heart of any background who seeks Him light.
*   **Prayer and Works:** He "prayed alway" and "gave much alms." Faith and works go together. Prayer should lead to benevolence.

---

### Q18. Did the apostolic believers have gatherings for prayer?

“And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying." Acts 12:12.

**Answer:**

Yes, the early church recognized the power of corporate, united prayer.

*   **United Intercession:** This gathering was specifically praying for Peter's release from prison.
*   **The Result:** While they were praying, an angel was dispatched to open the prison doors. United prayer moves the arm of Omnipotence in ways that individual prayer sometimes does not (Matthew 18:19–20).

---

### Q19. How often does the apostle exhort the church to pray?

“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit." Eph. 6:18.

**Answer:**

We are to pray "always."

*   **The Armor of God:** This verse concludes the description of the spiritual armor. Prayer is the energy that makes the armor effective.
*   **Dependence:** To pray always means to live in a state of constant dependence on Christ. It is the practical application of "Without Me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5).

---

### Q20. How does he express himself on this point elsewhere?

“Pray without ceasing." 1 Thess. 5:17.

**Answer:**

To pray without ceasing does not mean we are always on our knees, but that the heart is always open to God.

*   **A Continual Atmosphere:** Just as we breathe without ceasing to maintain physical life, prayer is the breath of the soul.
*   **Walking with God:** It means maintaining a mindset where every joy is shared with Him, and every temptation is immediately met with a cry for help.

**[ILL]** A deep-sea diver relies on an air hose connected to the surface. He does not take a breath only once an hour; the connection must remain open constantly, or he dies. Prayer is our connection to the atmosphere of heaven while we walk on this earth.

### Q21. In the parable of the importunate widow, what reason did the judge give for finally heeding her petition?

“Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me." Luke 18:4, 5.

**Answer:**

The judge answered her solely because of her **persistence**. He wanted to avoid the annoyance of her "continual coming."

*   **The Contrast:** This is a parable of contrast, not comparison. God is *not* like the unjust judge. If even a wicked man will grant a request due to persistence, how much more will a loving God answer His children?

---

### Q22. How does the Saviour apply the parable?

“And the lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them?" Luke 18:6, 7.

**Answer:**

Jesus applies this to "His own elect" who face the struggles of the last days.

*   **Day and Night:** This implies a time of great distress (likely the "time of trouble" mentioned in Daniel 12:1).
*   **"Bear Long":** God may seem to delay. This delay tests our faith and allows character to be developed. It allows the fruit of patience to ripen (James 1:3–4).

---

### Q23. What does the Saviour conclude in answer to His own question on this point?

“I tell you that He will avenge them speedily." Luke 18:8.

**Answer:**

Though it seems long to us, in the light of eternity, God acts "speedily." When the time is fully ripe, God will intervene to deliver His people from the power of the enemy. He will not wait one moment longer than is necessary for their salvation and His glory.

---

### Q24. What question does the Saviour immediately ask?

“Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shalt He find faith on the earth?" Luke 18:8.

**Answer:**

This haunting question suggests that in the last days, true, persistent faith will be rare.

*   **The Great Apostasy:** As the Second Coming approaches, the love of many will wax cold (Matthew 24:12).
*   **The Nature of End-Time Faith:** The faith Jesus looks for is the faith of the widow—a faith that does not give up when the answer is delayed, a faith that trusts God even in the darkness. This is the "faith of Jesus" mentioned in Revelation 14:12.

---

### Q25. For what purpose was the parable employed?

“And He spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray and not to faint." Luke 18:1.

**Answer:**

The purpose was to teach **perseverance** against discouragement.

*   **"Not to Faint":** To faint means to give up, to lose heart, or to stop praying.
*   **The Battle:** The Christian life is a warfare. We are tempted to think God has forgotten us. Jesus teaches that we must press our petitions to the throne of grace and never let go of the arm of the Lord.

---

### Q26. What injunction did the Saviour leave on this point for the special benefit of those who would live just before His second coming?

“Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man." Luke 21:36.

**Answer:**

The final instruction for the last generation is to **watch and pray**.

1.  **Accounted Worthy:** This worthiness is not of our own earning. It is the result of receiving Christ's righteousness (Justification) and allowing His Spirit to reproduce His character in us (Sanctification). We are "accounted worthy" only in Him.
2.  **To Stand:** "Who shall be able to stand?" (Revelation 6:17). Only those who have been sealed and have made Christ their refuge.
3.  **Sanctuary Context:** To stand before the Son of Man refers to the conclusion of the Investigative Judgment. When Christ ceases His intercession, those who have prayed, watched, and overcome by His blood will be able to stand in His presence without being consumed by His glory.

**[ILL]** A sentinel on duty in wartime must never sleep. If he sleeps, the enemy enters. We are living in the final hours of earth's history. Prayer is the act of keeping our spiritual eyes open, watching for the return of our King.
