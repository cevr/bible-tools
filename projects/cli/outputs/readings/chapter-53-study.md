### Q1. What symbol is introduced in Rev. 12:3?

"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and, behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads." (Revelation 12:3)

**Answer:**

The first major symbol in this prophecy is the **Dragon**. To understand this symbol, we must look at both its primary agent and the spirit behind it.

1.  **The Spirit Behind the Symbol:** Revelation 12:9 explicitly identifies the great dragon as "that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan." It represents the arch-enemy of God and man, who initiates the conflict against the government of heaven.
2.  **The Earthly Agent:** In Bible prophecy, dragons and beasts also represent earthly powers used by Satan to carry out his work (Jeremiah 51:34; Ezekiel 29:3). In the context of the birth of Christ (see Q3), the dragon specifically symbolizes **Pagan Rome**. It was the Roman power, not Satan personally in visible form, that ruled the world when Christ was born and sought to destroy Him.
3.  **The Nature of the Conflict:** The color red denotes the bloodshed and persecution that has characterized Satan’s war against God's people.

**Theological Term:**
*   **The Great Controversy:** The cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the universe.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A puppet master remains hidden behind the curtain, but the puppet on stage moves according to his will. While the Roman Empire (the puppet) was the visible force oppressing the world, the hands pulling the strings belonged to Satan (the master), who hates the image of God in humanity.

### Q2. At what time in the world's history did this symbol apply?

“And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars." (Revelation 12:1)

**Answer:**

This symbol applies to the time of the first advent of Christ. The **Woman** in prophecy represents the Church, the bride of Christ (Jeremiah 6:2; 2 Corinthians 11:2).

1.  **Clothed with the Sun:** This represents the New Testament church experiencing the full light of the gospel. They are clothed not in their own merit, but in the brilliance of Christ, the "Sun of Righteousness" (Malachi 4:2). This points to **Righteousness by Faith**—the church has no light of her own; she shines only because she is wrapped in the glory of Jesus.
2.  **The Moon Under Her Feet:** The moon has no light of its own but reflects the sun. This represents the Old Testament sacrificial system and types, which reflected the coming Messiah. Now that the "Sun" (Christ) had come, the "Moon" (the ceremonial law) was under her feet—foundational, yet surpassed by the reality.
3.  **Crown of Twelve Stars:** Representing the twelve apostles of the Lamb, the spiritual fathers of the New Testament church.

**Theological Term:**
*   **Justification:** Being "clothed" with Christ’s righteousness. It is a legal declaration by God that the believing sinner is righteous, based entirely on Christ’s perfect life and death (Isaiah 61:10; Romans 3:22).

---

### Q3. What did the dragon design to do to the child about to be born to the church?

“And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born." (Revelation 12:4)

**Answer:**

The dragon designed to destroy the Saviour of the world before His mission could begin.

1.  **The Target:** The "Man Child" is unmistakably Jesus Christ (see Q4). Satan knew that if Jesus lived a perfect life and died a sacrificial death, the power of sin would be broken, and man could be restored to obedience.
2.  **The Motivation:** Satan's hatred is directed against the **Law of God**. Jesus came to magnify the law and make it honorable (Isaiah 42:21) and to show that through dependence on the Father, a human being could keep God's commandments perfectly. Satan had to stop this demonstration to maintain his claim that God's law is unjust and impossible to keep.

[ILL] **Illustration:** If a rebel general knows that the rightful King provides a cure for a deadly plague used to control the people, the general will stop at nothing to destroy the Cure-bearer before He enters the city. Satan, the rebel, sought to destroy Christ, the Cure for sin.

---

### Q4. What became of the child?

“And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to His throne." (Revelation 12:5)

**Answer:**

Satan failed. The child was born, lived a sinless life, died as the perfect sacrifice, and was resurrected and ascended to heaven.

1.  **Caught Up:** This refers to the ascension of Christ to the Heavenly Sanctuary (Acts 1:9). There, He began His work as our High Priest, mediating the merits of His blood on our behalf (Hebrews 8:1–2).
2.  **Rule with a Rod of Iron:** This indicates the absolute authority of Christ. While He is a Lamb to those who accept His grace, He is a conquering King to those who persist in rebellion (Psalm 2:9; Revelation 19:15).
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** When Christ was "caught up," He entered the Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary to begin the work of intercession. He presents His perfect righteousness to cover the repentant sinner.

**Theological Term:**
*   **Mediation:** The work of Jesus standing between the Holy God and sinful man, bridging the gap through His sacrifice and ongoing life (1 Timothy 2:5).

---

### Q5. Who sought to slay Christ as soon as He was born?

“Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men." (Matthew 2:16)

**Answer:**

Herod the Great, a representative of the Roman authority (the Dragon power), sought to slay Jesus.

1.  **Historical Fulfillment:** This confirms that the "Dragon" in its secondary sense represents **Pagan Rome**. Herod was a vassal king appointed by the Roman Senate. He used the civil power of the state to attempt to destroy the spiritual deliverer.
2.  **The Method of the Enemy:** Force, violence, and the decree of the state are the dragon’s tools. In contrast, Christ’s kingdom advances by love, truth, and the free choice of the will.
3.  **Providence:** God protected His Son until His hour had come. No earthly power can thwart the plan of salvation.

---

### Q6. What symbol was next seen by the prophet?

“And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy." (Revelation 13:1)

**Answer:**

The prophet sees a **Beast rising from the sea**.

1.  **Identity:** This beast represents the **Papacy** (the Roman Catholic civil-religious system) which rose to power upon the ruins of the Pagan Roman Empire.
2.  **The Sea:** In prophecy, "waters" or the "sea" represent "peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues" (Revelation 17:15). This power arose in a densely populated area—Europe.
3.  **Name of Blasphemy:** Blasphemy in Scripture is defined as man claiming the power to forgive sins (Mark 2:7) or a man claiming to be God (John 10:33). This power claims the titles and prerogatives of God on earth, instituting a priesthood that obscures the true ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.

**Theological Term:**
*   **Antichrist:** Not merely an open enemy, but one who puts himself *in place of* Christ. This system directs men to human priests and earthly rituals rather than to Christ's mediation in heaven.

---

### Q7. From what did this government receive its seat and power?

“And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority." (Revelation 13:2)

**Answer:**

The Papacy received its authority from the Dragon (Pagan Rome).

1.  **Historical Transfer:** As noted in the question's note, Emperor Constantine moved the capital to Constantinople (AD 330), leaving the Bishop of Rome to eventually fill the power vacuum in the West.
2.  **Justinain's Decree:** In AD 533, Emperor Justinian declared the Bishop of Rome the head of all the churches. The military defeat of the Ostrogoths in AD 538 cleared the way for this power to exercise civil authority.
3.  **The Dragon's Hand:** While it claims to be the church of Christ, prophecy reveals it received its "seat" (capital city, Rome) and "great authority" from the political empire that sought to kill Christ.

---

### Q8. What was to happen to this beast?

“And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast." (Revelation 13:3)

**Answer:**

The beast was to receive a "deadly wound," losing its political supremacy for a time.

1.  **The Wound:** This represents the loss of its civil power—the ability to use the state to enforce religious decrees and punish "heretics."
2.  **The Healing:** The prophecy predicts a restoration. The "deadly wound" would be healed, and the Papacy would regain global influence.
3.  **World Wondering:** We are living in the time of the healing. The entire world is increasingly looking to this power for moral and political leadership.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A venomous creature may be struck a heavy blow that renders it unconscious or seemingly dead. But if the life is not extinguished, it may revive, and its bite becomes dangerous again. The "life" of this beast is the union of church and state; when that union is restored, the beast lives again.

---

### Q9. How was this wounding to be brought about?

“He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword." (Revelation 13:10)

**Answer:**

The wounding would be an act of divine retribution carried out by military force ("the sword").

1.  **The Principle:** God’s law of sowing and reaping applies to nations. This power had used the "sword" of the state to persecute dissenters; therefore, it would be brought down by the "sword" of the state.
2.  **The Agency:** It was not the preaching of the gospel that inflicted this specific political wound, but war and captivity.

---

### Q10. Had the papacy led others into captivity?

“And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations." (Revelation 13:7)

**Answer:**

Yes. For over a millennium (the 1260 years of prophecy), this power waged war on those who held to the Bible alone.

1.  **War with the Saints:** Millions were martyred for refusing to bow to church dogmas that contradicted Scripture. This persecution highlights the cost of faithfulness.
2.  **Victory of the Saints:** Though they were "overcome" physically (killed), they were spiritually victorious because they did not compromise their faith. "They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony" (Revelation 12:11).
3.  **RBF Connection:** True righteousness by faith produces a character that prefers death to disobedience. These martyrs had the law of God written in their hearts (Hebrews 8:10).

---

### Q11. When was the papal head wounded by being taken into captivity?

In 1798, the French army under Berthier then abolished the papacy in Rome, proclaimed a republic there, and carried Pope Pius VI a captive from place to place till he died at Valence, France, August 28, 1799.

**Answer:**

The deadly wound was inflicted in **1798**.

1.  **Prophetic Timing:** This event marks the end of the 1260-year period (538 AD – 1798 AD). The accuracy of this date confirms the reliability of God’s Word.
2.  **Loss of Civil Power:** With the capture of the Pope, the church lost its status as a sovereign political power capable of enforcing its will on other nations.

---

### Q12. At that time what additional symbol was seen by the prophet?

“And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon." (Revelation 13:11)

**Answer:**

At the very time the first beast was going into captivity (1798), a second beast was seen rising. This represents the **United States of America**.

1.  **Timing:** The US was rising to prominence and establishing its constitution exactly as the Papacy was losing its power in the late 18th century.
2.  **Coming up out of the Earth:** Unlike the first beast which rose from the "sea" (populated nations), this one rises from the "earth." In prophecy, earth represents a relatively uninhabited area. The US arose in the New World, away from the crowded, war-torn monarchies of Europe.
3.  **Providential Design:** God prepared a place of refuge where the "woman" (the church) could find freedom to spread the final gospel message.

---

### Q13. Has the United States "come up" sufficiently to warrant the application of the prophecy to this country?

The "Centennial History of the United States" says: "The extent of the conceded domain of the United States, in 1776, was not more than half a million square miles. Now (1875) it is more than three million, three hundred thousand square miles. Its population then was three million; in 1875-forty million. Today it is over two hundred fifty million.

**Answer:**

Yes. The growth of the United States is a phenomenon of history.

1.  **Rapid Rise:** From a few colonies to a global superpower, the US grew "like a plant" (a possible translation of "coming up" in the Greek).
2.  **Fulfillment:** No other nation on earth fits the specifications: rising in the New World, appearing around 1798, and growing into a dominant world power.

---

### Q14. What do the "two horns like a lamb" represent?

A horn represents a kingdom, or a component part of a kingdom, as in Dan. 7:7, 8, 24, 25. Lamb-like horns would indicate youthfulness, innocence, and gentleness. The "two" horns may represent the two leading principles of the government, civil and religious liberty.

**Answer:**

The **Lamb-like horns** represent the foundational principles that made America unique and great: **Republicanism** (Civil Liberty) and **Protestantism** (Religious Liberty).

1.  **Lamb-like Character:** The Lamb is a symbol of Christ. A government with lamb-like horns mimics the spirit of Christ in the political sphere—it does not force the conscience. It recognizes that "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (2 Corinthians 3:17).
2.  **Separation of Church and State:** The absence of crowns on these horns (unlike the first beast) shows a government where the people rule (a republic) and where the church does not wield the sword of the state.
3.  **RBF Application:** True righteousness cannot be legislated. God accepts only voluntary service prompted by love. A "Lamb-like" government protects the right of every man to worship (or not worship) according to his conscience.

[ILL] **Illustration:** The sun cannot be forced to shine, nor a flower forced to bloom. Likewise, the heart cannot be forced to love God. The "Lamb-like" principles protect the garden of the heart so that faith may grow freely, without the iron boot of the state crushing it.

---

### Q15. Notwithstanding the lamb-like pretensions of this power, what is it ultimately to do?

“And he spake as a dragon." (Revelation 13:11)

**Answer:**

The prophecy predicts a tragic change. The nation that began with the mildness of a lamb will eventually speak with the voice of a **dragon**.

1.  **Speaking:** A nation "speaks" through its laws and legislative acts.
2.  **The Dragon's Voice:** As seen in Q5, the dragon represents the use of force and persecution against God's people.
3.  **The Contradiction:** While retaining the *appearance* of a lamb (professing Christianity and liberty), the nation will deny the *power* thereof (2 Timothy 3:5) by enacting oppressive laws. This marks a departure from the principles of the Constitution and the gospel.

---

### Q16. What will he say?

“Saying unto them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live." (Revelation 13:14)

**Answer:**

The US will urge the formation of an **Image to the Beast**.

1.  **What is the "Image"?** The "Beast" was a church clothed with civil power. An "Image" to the beast is a replica of that system. It represents apostate Protestantism uniting with the state to enforce religious observances.
2.  **Ecumenical Movement:** For this to happen, the fragmented Protestant churches must unite on common points of doctrine and seek the aid of the government to enforce their decrees.
3.  **The Danger:** When the church seeks the power of the state, it is because she has lost the power of the Spirit. It is an attempt to substitute legal force for the converting power of the Holy Ghost.

**Theological Term:**
*   **Sanctification:** The work of the Holy Spirit writing the law on the heart. Legalism (the Dragon's voice) tries to force the law from the outside; the Gospel (the Lamb) writes it on the inside.

---

### Q17. When the image to the beast has been formed in the United States, what will follow?

“And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed." (Revelation 13:15)

**Answer:**

Once the union of church and state is formed, persecution follows.

1.  **Giving Life:** The "life" of the image is the active use of civil penalties to punish dissenters.
2.  **The Death Decree:** Ultimately, the conflict over worship becomes a matter of life and death. This parallels the story of Daniel's friends in Babylon who faced the fiery furnace for refusing to bow to the golden image (Daniel 3).
3.  **The Final Test:** This will reveal who truly has the faith of Jesus. Those who trust in Christ's righteousness will stand firm, knowing that their life is hid with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3).

---

### Q18. How are the people to be led to form the image to the beast?

“And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast." (Revelation 13:14)

**Answer:**

The people will be led astray by **deception** and **miracles**.

1.  **Spiritualism:** Satan will work with "all power and signs and lying wonders" (2 Thessalonians 2:9). This points to the rise of modern spiritualism and charismatic manifestations that bypass the Word of God.
2.  **False Evidence:** People who do not love the truth will be convinced by their senses ("I saw a miracle!") rather than by "Thus saith the Lord."
3.  **Sanctuary Safeguard:** We must be grounded in the Most Holy Place experience—knowing the Law of God and the true work of Atonement—so we are not deceived by counterfeit revivals.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A counterfeit bank note may look perfect to the eye and feel crisp to the touch. Only those who know the specific security markers (the watermarks and strips) can detect the fraud. The Bible is our detector; miracles alone are not proof of God’s presence, for even Egyptian magicians mimicked Moses.

---

### Q19. How much power will be exercised in the matter?

“And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed." (Revelation 13:12)

**Answer:**

The US will exercise **global authority** ("all the power") to enforce homage to the Papacy.

1.  **Global Influence:** Just as the first beast ruled the "world," the second beast causes the "earth and them which dwell therein" to follow suit.
2.  **Forced Worship:** The issue is **worship**. By enforcing the institutions of the Papacy (specifically the Sunday sabbath, which is the mark of her authority), the US leads the world in an act of homage to the "man of sin."

---

### Q20. What will the two-horned beast power try to enforce on the people?

“And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads." (Revelation 13:16)

**Answer:**

The power enforces the **Mark of the Beast**.

1.  **The Forehead:** Represents the mind, judgment, and conscience (Hebrews 10:16). Those who receive the mark here are intellectually convinced of the error or deceived.
2.  **The Hand:** Represents actions and labor (Ecclesiastes 9:10). Those who receive the mark here may not believe it, but they comply for convenience or fear of economic loss.
3.  **The Contrast:** God places His **Seal** only in the forehead (Revelation 7:3)—it requires a settled conviction of truth. The Beast accepts a mark in the hand—mere outward compliance.
4.  **Righteousness by Faith:** The man who lives by faith cannot be coerced. His conscience belongs to God. He refuses the Mark because to accept it would be to break God's Law (the fourth commandment) in order to obey man's law.

---

### Q21. How far is this to be carried?

“And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name." (Revelation 13:17)

**Answer:**

It will be carried to the point of a total **economic boycott**.

1.  **No Buy or Sell:** Faithful believers will be cut off from earthly support. This forces a total dependence on God for "bread and water" (Isaiah 33:16).
2.  **The Logic of Persecution:** When arguments fail, force is the last resort of every false religion.
3.  **The Victory:** This trial refines the saints. It demonstrates to the universe that their faith is genuine. They do not serve God for material gain (as Satan accused Job), but out of pure love and loyalty to their Creator and Redeemer.

**Theological Term:**
*   **The Time of Trouble:** The period just before Christ returns when earthly supports are removed, and God's people live solely by faith in the intercession of Christ (Daniel 12:1).
