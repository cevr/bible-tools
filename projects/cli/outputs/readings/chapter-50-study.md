### Q1. Has God appointed the day of judgment?

**“Because He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in
righteousness." Acts 17:31.**

**Answer:**

Yes, the Bible clearly teaches that God has set a specific time for judgment.
This is not a random event, but a fixed appointment in the divine calendar.

- **Universal Accountability:** The text states He will judge "the world." No
  one is exempt. Every life, whether king or servant, believer or skeptic, comes
  under the review of the Creator.
- **Judged in Righteousness:** The standard of judgment is God’s character,
  which is transcribed in His law (Psalm 119:172; James 2:12). However, because
  all have sinned, "righteousness" in the judgment ultimately means we must
  possess the righteousness of Christ.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot stand in this judgment on our own
  merits. Our only hope is to be found in Christ (Philippians 3:9). When the
  Judge looks at a repentant, believing sinner, He sees the perfect life of
  Jesus credited to their account (**Justification**).

**[ILL] The Court Appointment:** Imagine receiving a summons for a court date.
If you have broken the law and have no lawyer, the date is terrifying. But if
the Judge is your Father, and the Defense Attorney is your Savior who has
already paid your fine, the appointment becomes a day of vindication, not
condemnation. The judgment reveals who has accepted the Advocate.

### Q2. To whom has this event been made known?

**“Surely the Lord God will do nothing but He revealeth His secret unto His
servants the prophets." Amos 3:7.**

**Answer:**

God acts with transparency and love. Before any major event in salvation
history—whether the Flood, the Exodus, or the First Advent of Christ—God sent
prophets to warn and prepare the world.

- **Divine Mercy:** God does not wish for anyone to be caught unprepared (2
  Peter 3:9). He reveals the "secret" of the judgment so that men and women may
  make peace with Him before the books are closed.
- **The Role of Prophecy:** Prophecy is not merely to satisfy curiosity about
  the future; it is to facilitate repentance and preparation in the present.
- **The Prophetic Chain:** Just as Noah warned of the Flood, God raised up a
  prophetic movement in the "time of the end" to announce the opening of the
  judgment.

---

### Q3. Where is the announcement of the judgment made?

**“Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of
His judgment is come." Rev. 14:7.**

**Answer:**

This announcement is found in the **First Angel’s Message** of Revelation 14.
This is the last warning message to be given to the world before Christ returns.

- **"Is Come":** Notice the verb tense. It does not say the hour of judgment
  _will_ come, but that it _is_ come. This indicates a judgment that begins
  _before_ the Second Coming of Christ. In Adventist theology, this is known as
  the **Investigative Judgment** (or Pre-Advent Judgment), where the lives of
  professed believers are reviewed in the heavenly sanctuary.
- **Fear God:** This does not mean to be afraid of Him, but to reverence Him and
  respect His authority. It means to hate evil (Proverbs 8:13) and to surrender
  our will to His.
- **Give Glory to Him:** We give glory to God by revealing His character in our
  own lives. When we allow Christ to live in us, producing "fruits of
  righteousness," God is glorified (John 15:8).
- **Worship the Creator:** The verse concludes by calling us to worship Him who
  made heaven and earth. This is a call back to the true God and His memorial of
  creation, the Sabbath (Exodus 20:8–11).

**Definition:**

- **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of judgment beginning in 1844
  (fulfillment of Daniel 8:14) where God reviews the records of humanity to
  determine who is safe to save, blotting out the sins of the righteous before
  Christ returns.

---

### Q4. What does the angel preach who makes this announcement?

**“And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting
gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people." Rev. 14:6.**

**Answer:**

The foundation of the judgment warning is the **Everlasting Gospel**. One cannot
understand the judgment without understanding the "good news."

- **The Gospel and Judgment:** These are not two separate messages. The Gospel
  is the good news that Christ has conquered sin and death. The judgment is the
  process by which God vindicates those who have accepted that Gospel.
- **Global Scope:** The message is for "every nation." It is not for one secret
  group; it is a universal call to the human race.
- **Power to Save:** The Gospel is the "power of God unto salvation" (Romans
  1:16). It includes:
  1.  **Pardon:** Forgiveness for past sins through the blood of Jesus.
  2.  **Power:** Victory over the power of sin in the present life through the
      indwelling Spirit.
  - _Righteousness by Faith connection:_ God does not ask us to face the
    judgment and _then_ find the Gospel. He gives us the Everlasting Gospel so
    that we may be transformed and stand "faultless" in the judgment (Jude 24).

**[ILL] The Lifeboat:** The warning that a ship is sinking (judgment) is
terrifying only if there is no lifeboat. The First Angel points to the sinking
ship of this world but simultaneously points to the unsinkable Lifeboat, the
"Everlasting Gospel" of Jesus Christ.

---

### Q5. By what is this angel accompanied before his work is accomplished?

**“And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen... And the third
angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and
his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the same shall
drink of the wine of the wrath of God." Rev. 14:8-10.**

**Answer:**

The First Angel is not alone. He is followed immediately by a Second and a Third
Angel.

- **A Threefold Message:** These messages are cumulative. The First calls for
  true worship; the Second warns against false systems of worship (Babylon); the
  Third warns against the specific mark of loyalty to that false system (the
  Mark of the Beast).
- **Babylon is Fallen:** Spiritual confusion and apostasy have corrupted the
  churches that reject the First Angel's warning.
- **The Wrath of God:** This is God’s final rejection of sin. Those who cling to
  sin and false worship cannot dwell in the presence of a holy God.
- **The Result:** These messages produce a people described in verse 12: "Here
  are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

---

### Q6. What will be the effect of the united work of these three messages?

**“And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him
that sat on the cloud, Thrust in Thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for
thee to reap,. for the harvest of the earth is ripe." Rev. 14:15. (See Matt.
13:39.)**

**Answer:**

The proclamation of these messages ripens the world for the harvest. It forces
every human being to make a final decision: for God or against Him.

- **The Ripening:** In agriculture, the harvest comes when the fruit is fully
  mature. The "wheat" (the righteous) fully reflect the character of Christ—this
  is the work of sanctification completed. The "tares" (the wicked) become fully
  settled in rebellion.
- **Separation:** The Three Angels’ Messages act as a winnowing fan, separating
  the chaff from the wheat.
- **Sanctification by Faith:** The harvest demonstrates that the Gospel works.
  God will have a people upon the earth who, through faith, have overcome the
  world, the flesh, and the devil.

**[ILL] The Sun and the Clay:** The same sun that hardens clay melts wax. The
same message of God's judgment and love hardens the hearts of those who resist
it (like Pharaoh) but softens and purifies the hearts of those who receive it.
The message brings everyone to their true "ripe" condition.

---

### Q7. What takes place in connection with the harvest?

**“And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sat like unto
the Son of man, haying on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp
sickle." Rev. 14:14.**

**Answer:**

This verse describes the glorious **Second Coming of Christ**.

- **King of Kings:** He no longer wears the priestly mitre but a "golden crown"
  (stephanos/diadem). His mediatorial work in the sanctuary has ended.
- **The Reaper:** Christ comes to claim His own. He comes to gather those who
  have accepted His righteousness and allowed Him to write His law in their
  hearts.
- **Sequence:** First the warning (vv. 6-12), then the probation closes, then
  the King returns to reap (v. 14).

---

### Q8. What was the appearance of an angel seen by John, as recorded in chapter ten?

**“And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud;
and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his
feet as pillars of fire." Rev. 10:1.**

**Answer:**

The description of this "mighty angel" strongly suggests this is **Jesus
Christ** appearing in a special role to guide His people.

- **Clothed with a cloud:** Throughout Scripture, clouds are associated with
  God’s presence and judgment (Exodus 19:9; Matthew 24:30).
- **Rainbow:** This recalls the rainbow around the throne (Revelation 4:3),
  symbolizing God’s covenant of mercy and faithfulness. Even in judgment, mercy
  is present.
- **Face as the sun:** This matches the description of the glorified Christ in
  Revelation 1:16 and on the Mount of Transfiguration (Matthew 17:2).
- **Pillars of fire:** Symbolizing firmness and the tread of a conqueror,
  similar to Revelation 1:15.

---

### Q9. What did he hold in his hand?

**“And he had in his hand a little book open." Rev. 10:2.**

**Answer:**

He holds a "little book" that is now "open."

- **Implied Closure:** If the book is described specifically as _open_ now, it
  implies it was previously _closed_ or sealed.
- **Identity of the Book:** As we shall see, this points to the book of Daniel,
  the only book in the Bible that was explicitly sealed until the "time of the
  end."

---

### Q10. And what did the angel do?

**“And he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and
cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth." Rev. 10:2, 3.**

**Answer:**

The positioning of the feet signifies **supreme authority** and **worldwide
dominion**.

- **Sea and Earth:** By standing on both land and water, the Angel indicates
  that the message contained in the little book is not local (for one city or
  nation) but universal. It involves the destiny of the whole planet.
- **Lion's Roar:** This symbolizes the power of God's voice (Hosea 11:10). The
  message is to be proclaimed with power and urgency.

---

### Q11. What was the burden of this message?

**“And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his
hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth forever and ever... that there
should be time no longer." Rev. 10:5, 6.**

**Answer:**

The solemn declaration is that "there should be time no longer."

- **Not the End of World History:** This does not mean the world ends
  immediately, nor that time as a dimension ceases. The context is _prophetic
  time_.
- **End of Prophetic Periods:** This declaration marks the end of the longest
  time prophecy in the Bible (the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14). After this point
  (1844), there are no more definite time prophecies setting dates for the
  Lord's return.
- **Urgency:** It means probation is running out. We are now living in the "time
  of the end," where the next major event is the close of probation and the
  Second Coming.

---

### Q12. The book in the hand of the angel, from which he proclaimed this time message, was said to be "open." When was the only sealed book of the Bible, that contained definite time, to be opened?

**“But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of
the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased." Dan.
12:4.**

**Answer:**

The book of Daniel is the companion to Revelation 10.

- **Sealed until the End:** Daniel was told that his prophecies—specifically
  those regarding the long time periods—would be "sealed" (not fully understood)
  until the "time of the end."
- **Knowledge Increased:** In the early 19th century (leading up to the 1840s),
  there was a worldwide surge in the study of Daniel's prophecies. Men of God
  "ran to and fro" in the Scriptures, and the Holy Spirit "opened" the
  understanding of the 2300-day prophecy.
- **The "Little Book":** The open book in the Angel's hand (Rev 10) is the
  unsealed book of Daniel.

---

### Q13. What does the prophet Daniel say about the judgment?

**“I beheld till the thrones were cast down. I and the Ancient of days did
sit,... thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten
thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."
Dan. 7:9, 10.**

**Answer:**

Daniel was given a view of the **Investigative Judgment** taking place in
heaven.

- **The Courtroom:** The Ancient of Days (God the Father) presides. Millions of
  angels attend. This is a scene of awesome solemnity.
- **The Books:** The judgment is based on records.
  1.  _Book of Life:_ Records the names of the saved (Phil 4:3).
  2.  _Book of Remembrance:_ Records good deeds (Malachi 3:16).
  3.  _Records of Sin:_ Contains the record of iniquity (Ecclesiastes 12:14).
- **The Purpose:** Before the Second Coming, heaven determines who has truly
  accepted the robe of Christ's righteousness and retained it by faith.

---

### Q14. What did Daniel see the little horn (Roman Church) do after the judgment opened?

**“I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake."
Dan. 7:11.**

**Answer:**

Daniel sees that while the judgment is sitting in heaven, the "little horn"
power on earth is still speaking great, boastful words.

- **Parallel Events:** This proves the judgment in Daniel 7 is not the execution
  of the wicked at the very end of time (after the millennium), but a judgment
  that occurs _while history is still unfolding on earth_.
- **The Antichrist Spirit:** While heaven is cleansing the sanctuary, earthly
  powers are still warring against God’s truth.

---

### Q15. When did the angel say this judgment work, called the cleansing of the sanctuary would commence?

**“And he said unto me, Unto two thousand three hundred days; then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed." Dan. 8:14.**

**Answer:**

This is the key time prophecy that unlocked the Advent movement.

- **Prophetic Time:** In Bible prophecy, a day represents a year (Numbers 14:34;
  Ezekiel 4:6).
- **The Calculation:** The 2300 years began with the command to restore and
  build Jerusalem in **457 B.C.** (Ezra 7). Counting 2300 years forward brings
  us to **A.D. 1844**.
- **Cleansing the Sanctuary:** In the earthly service, the sanctuary was
  cleansed once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This was a day of
  judgment. Therefore, in 1844, Jesus entered the Most Holy Place of the
  heavenly sanctuary to begin the final work of atonement and judgment.

**Definition:**

- **Cleansing the Sanctuary:** The removal of the record of sins from the
  heavenly temple, corresponding to the blotting out of sins for the believer
  (Acts 3:19).

---

### Q16. What did John do with the little book given him by the angel? And what effect did it have upon him?

**“And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was
in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter."
Rev. 10:10.**

**Answer:**

This prophecy predicts the experience of the early Advent believers, known as
the "Great Disappointment."

- **Sweet as Honey:** The believers in the 1840s "ate" the book of Daniel. They
  discovered the time prophecy pointing to 1844. The thought that Jesus would
  return in their lifetime was the sweetest news imaginable. It produced joy,
  love, and deep consecration.
- **Bitter Belly:** When the date passed and Jesus did not appear, the sweetness
  turned to crushing bitterness. They had the right _time_ (Oct 22, 1844), but
  the wrong _event_. They thought the sanctuary was the earth (to be cleansed by
  fire), but the sanctuary was in heaven (to be cleansed by blood/judgment).

---

### Q17. What was symbolized by his eating the book?

**“Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll,
and go speak unto the house of Israel." Eze. 3:1.**

**Answer:**

Eating the book symbolizes the **internalization of the message**.

- **More than Intellectual Assent:** God’s word must become part of our very
  being, just as food becomes flesh and blood. The Advent believers didn't just
  study the prophecies intellectually; they absorbed them. It changed their
  lives.
- **RBF Connection:** Just as we must "eat" the word of prophecy, Jesus said we
  must eat His flesh and drink His blood (John 6:53)—meaning we must receive Him
  by faith into our hearts. The message of His coming is only sweet to those who
  have received His life.

---

### Q18. Were not the disciples disappointed in their expectations concerning Christ's work at His first advent?

**“When they therefore were come together, they asked of Him, saying, Lord, will
thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?" Acts 1:6. See also Luke
24:19-21.**

**Answer:**

Yes. There is a striking parallel between the disciples at the First Advent and
the Advent believers before 1844.

- **Misunderstood Prophecy:** The disciples had the correct _Person_ (Jesus) and
  the correct _time_ (Daniel 9’s 70 weeks), but they misunderstood the _event_.
  They expected a political kingdom of glory; Christ gave them a spiritual
  kingdom of grace.
- **The Cross as Disappointment:** When Jesus died, their hopes were crushed
  ("We trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel" - Luke
  24:21). Yet, in that very disappointment, the greatest victory of the universe
  was accomplished.
- **Testing Faith:** As noted in the study introduction, God allows
  disappointment to test the sincerity of His people. It sifts those who follow
  for reward from those who follow out of love for truth. The disappointment of
  1844 led the sincere believers to study deeper, leading to the discovery of
  the heavenly sanctuary and the Sabbath.

**[ILL] The Wrong Train Station:** If you wait for a friend at the airport, but
he arrives at the train station, he has certainly arrived, but you miss seeing
him because you are looking in the wrong place. The Advent believers were
looking at the "earth" for the cleansing; Jesus went into the "Most Holy Place"
in heaven. The event happened, but they had to turn their eyes of faith upward
to see it.

---

### Q19. What did the lord say should afterward be done?

**“And He said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and
nations, and tongues, and kings." Rev. 10:11.**

**Answer:**

The Great Disappointment was not the end of the movement; it was a new
beginning.

- **Prophesy Again:** After the bitterness, God commissioned them to preach
  again. They were not to preach a new date, but to preach the _full_
  message—including the third angel’s message, the Sabbath, and the sanctuary
  truth.
- **Global Commission:** The message must go to "many peoples, and nations."
  This birthed the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist mission. The judgment hour
  message must still be heralded to the ends of the earth.

---

### Q20. What message was immediately to follow the proclamation of the judgment?

**“And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen." Rev.
14:8.**

**Answer:**

The proclamation of the judgment (First Angel) is followed by the announcement
of the moral fall of Babylon (Second Angel).

- **Rejection of Light:** When the organized churches of the day rejected the
  message of the First Angel—the announcement of the judgment and the coming
  King—they experienced a spiritual fall. They turned from Scripture to human
  tradition.
- **Transition:** This leads us directly to the study of the Second Angel's
  message in the next chapter, where we analyze what constitutes "Babylon" and
  why God calls His people out of her.
