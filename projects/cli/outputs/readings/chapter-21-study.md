### Q1. What does Paul say of the carnal mind?

"The carnal mind is enmity against God..." Romans 8:7.

**Answer:**
The apostle Paul here diagnoses the fundamental problem of the human condition.
*   **The Definition:** The "carnal mind" refers to the unrenewed, natural human nature inherited from Adam. It is the mind dominated by the "flesh"—the selfish desires and instincts of humanity separated from the Spirit of God.
*   **The Condition:** The text states that this mind is "enmity." It does not merely *have* enemies; it *is* enmity itself. This denotes a deep-seated, active hostility toward the character and government of God.
*   **The Implication:** This teaches that man is not merely "sick" and in need of medicine, but is a rebel in need of a complete change of government—a new heart (Ezekiel 36:26). We cannot educate or improve the carnal mind into submission; it is fundamentally opposed to God’s principle of self-sacrificing love.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine oil and water poured into the same jar. No matter how much you shake them or try to mix them, they remain separate. The oil naturally resists the water. Similarly, the carnal mind is like the oil; by its very nature, it resists the "water" of God’s Spirit. It requires a chemical change—a miracle of grace—to unite them.

---

### Q2. Why is the carnal mind enmity?

"For it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." Romans 8:7.

**Answer:**
The source of the hostility is the **Law of God**.
*   **The Conflict:** The law of God is a transcript of His character (holy, just, and good—Romans 7:12). It demands supreme love for God and unselfish love for our neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40). The carnal mind, being selfish, resents this demand. It desires to be its own god.
*   **The Inability:** The text says the carnal mind *cannot* be subject to God's law. This is the essence of the **Righteousness by Faith** message: a sinner, left to their own strength, is utterly incapable of obeying God's law perfectly (John 15:5).
*   **The Need for a Miracle:** Because the natural heart cannot submit to the law, any attempt to keep the commandments without a transformed heart is legalism and ends in failure. The law detects the sin, but only Christ can provide the remedy. We do not need the law changed; we need the *mind* changed.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A train is built to run on tracks. If a train decides it wants to be "free" and drives off the tracks into a field, it destroys itself. The "tracks" are God's law. The carnal mind thinks the tracks are restrictive and hateful, not realizing that they are the only path to true movement and life.

### Q3. Can one please God while he is carnally minded?

"So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God." Romans 8:8.

**Answer:**
This verse shatters the hope of salvation by works of the flesh.
*   **Motives Matter:** God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). A person might perform outward acts of charity or religious duty, but if the motivating principle is self-glory, fear, or pride (attributes of the carnal mind), those works are "dead works" (Hebrews 9:14).
*   **The Necessity of the Spirit:** To "please God" is to have the character of Jesus Christ. Without the Holy Spirit dwelling within, we cannot produce the fruit of righteousness.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** This emphasizes that our standing before God is not based on our human performance, which is always flawed by the flesh, but on our acceptance of Christ's life in place of ours.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If a wolf wears a sheepskin, it may look like a sheep from a distance, but it cannot bleat like a sheep or eat grass like a sheep. It cannot please the shepherd because its nature is still that of a wolf. We must be "born again" (John 3:3) to receive the nature of the Lamb.

---

### Q4. What will those receive who remain in that state?

"For to be carnally minded is death." Romans 8:6.

**Answer:**
The inevitable result of the carnal life is death—not merely physical sleep, but eternal separation from God.
*   **The Law of Cause and Effect:** As the note in the outline suggests, "sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4), and "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23).
*   **Separation from Life:** God is the fountain of life (Psalm 36:9). The carnal mind cuts the connection with God; therefore, death is the natural consequence, just as a light bulb goes out when severed from the power source.
*   **The Sanctuary Truth:** In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner saw that his sin caused the death of the innocent lamb. This taught the gravity of the carnal mind—it costs life. Ultimately, it cost the life of the Son of God.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Consider a diver deep underwater who decides to cut his air hose because he finds it "restrictive." The moment he severs that connection, he is doomed. The carnal mind cuts the air hose connecting the soul to heaven.

---

### Q5. In what way may this condition be changed?

"We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." 2 Corinthians 5:20.

**Answer:**
The remedy is **Reconciliation**.
*   **Definition:** *Reconciliation* means to restore friendship and harmony between two parties who were at war.
*   **God's Initiative:** Notice that we do not reconcile God to us; He is already seeking us. Paul says God is "beseeching" (begging) us through Christ. The enmity is on *our* side, not God's. He loves the sinner but hates the sin.
*   **The Exchange:** To be reconciled means to drop our rebellion, surrender our weapons of warfare (our self-will), and accept His terms of peace, which are terms of mercy and grace.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a rebellious son who ran away from home and slandered his father. The father stands on the porch every day with arms open, calling for the son. The father does not need to change; the son needs to turn around and come home. That return is reconciliation.

### Q6. How was this reconciliation brought about in the case of the wicked Ninevites, when Jonah prophesied their destruction?

The king of Nineveh said, "Let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn everyone from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hand." "And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that He had said that He would do unto them; and He did it not." Jonah 3:8, 10.

**Answer:**
The experience of Nineveh illustrates the practical steps of reconciliation:
*   **Conviction:** They believed the warning message.
*   **Humiliation:** They covered themselves in sackcloth, symbolizing a removal of pride.
*   **Turning Away:** They did not just feel sorry; they turned "from his evil way" and "from the violence."
    *   **Sanctification connection:** True reconciliation always leads to a change in behavior. We cannot be friends with God while clinging to the sins that crucified His Son.
*   **God's Response:** When the Bible says God "repented," it does not mean He was wrong. It means He changed His course of action because the people changed their position. He could now extend mercy instead of judgment (Jeremiah 18:7–8).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A captain steers his ship toward a rocky cliff (destruction). The lighthouse keeper warns him. The captain spins the wheel and turns the ship around (repentance). The crash does not happen. Did the rocks move? No. The ship moved, changing the outcome.

---

### Q7. Are repentance and confession still essential to reconciliation?

"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out." Acts 3:19. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9.

**Answer:**
Yes, they are absolutely essential.
*   **Repentance:** This is a heartfelt sorrow for sin and a turning away from it. It is a gift from God (Acts 5:31). It is realizing that sin is not just breaking a rule, but breaking God's heart.
*   **Confession:** This implies agreeing with God about the specific nature of our guilt. We do not hide it; we bring it to the Light.
*   **The Sanctuary & Blotting Out:** Acts 3:19 points to the **Investigative Judgment**. Sins are forgiven now, but they are ultimately "blotted out" (erased from the record) when our life creates a final history of victory through Christ.
*   **Faithful and Just:** God is "just" to forgive because the penalty has already been paid by Christ on the cross. He does not overlook sin; He sees it covered by the blood of the Lamb.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If you have a deep splinter, you cannot just put a bandage over it. You must expose it, allow the physician to remove it (confession and repentance), and then the healing balm can be applied. Keeping the splinter hidden leads to infection (death).

---

### Q8. Is this work effected independently of the sinner's action?

"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. "For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life." Romans 5:10.

**Answer:**
The work of *provision* is independent of us, but the *application* requires our faith.
*   **God's Sovereign Act:** God gave the Son and Christ died for the ungodly while we were yet sinners (Romans 5:6). We did not ask for the Atonement; God provided it out of infinite love.
*   **Justification & Sanctification:** Romans 5:10 reveals two parts of salvation:
    1.  **Reconciled by His death:** This is *Justification*—our legal clearing and pardon at the cross.
    2.  **Saved by His life:** This is *Sanctification*—the indwelling life of the resurrected Jesus saving us daily from the power of sin (Hebrews 7:25).
*   **Faith is Key:** The "whosoever believeth" clause shows that while the gift is universal, it is only effective for those who accept it by faith.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A wealthy benefactor deposits one billion dollars into a bank account for a poor debtor. The provision is made entirely without the debtor's help. However, if the debtor refuses to believe the money is there or refuses to write a check against it, he remains poor. Faith claims what God has already provided.

### Q9. How is the carnal mind destroyed?

"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin." Romans 6:6.

**Answer:**
The carnal mind is not improved; it is executed.
*   **Crucifixion:** Paul uses the image of the cross. The "old man" (the carnal, selfish nature) must be "crucified with Christ." This means we surrender our will completely to God, accepting a death to self-seeking.
*   **The Purpose:** "That the body of sin might be destroyed." The goal of the gospel is not just forgiveness, but the destruction of sin's power over us.
*   **Victory:** "That henceforth we should not serve sin." Through the indwelling Christ, the believer is freed from the slavery of sin. We are no longer obligated to obey the carnal nature. This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**—Christ living His victorious life in us (Galatians 2:20).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A caterpillar does not learn to fly by taking lessons. It must wrap itself in a cocoon and practically "die" to its old form. Only through this process does the butterfly emerge. The crawling "old man" must die for the flying "new man" to live.

### Q10. When the work on the part of the sinner has been thoroughly done, how complete will be the change in him?

"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new." 2 Corinthians 5:17.

**Answer:**
The change is total and comprehensive.
*   **New Creation:** The term "new creature" implies a creative act as powerful as the creation of the world (Genesis 1). God speaks a new nature into existence within the believer.
*   **Old Things Pass:** Old habits, old prejudices, old addictions, and the old love of the world lose their gripping power.
*   **All Things New:** A converted man has new motives, new tastes, and a new love for God's law. He loves what he once hated and hates what he once loved. This is the mark of true **Biblical Sanctification**.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If you take a thorny briar bush and graft a rose branch into it, the bush will eventually stop producing thorns and start producing roses. The root remains, but the life-force is new. When we are grafted into Christ, our nature produces His fruit.

---

### Q11. How may we know whether or not one has experienced this change?

"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them." Matthew 7:20.

**Answer:**
The test of reconciliation is the life that follows.
*   **The Fruit Test:** We cannot read hearts, but we can read lives. Profession means nothing without fruit. A person who claims to be "saved" but continues to live a willful, selfish, law-breaking life is deceiving themselves (1 John 2:4).
*   **Harmony with Law:** Since the carnal mind is enmity against the law (Rom 8:7), the spiritual mind will delight in the law (Psalm 119:97). Obedience is the fruit of faith.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
You may hang a sign on a dead tree that says "Apple Tree," but that does not make it one. Only when you see apples growing on the branches do you know the tree is alive and genuine.

---

### Q12. If one has a spiritual mind, what fruit will he bear?

"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." Galatians 5:22, 23.

**Answer:**
These nine attributes describe the character of Jesus Christ reproduced in the believer.
*   **Singular Fruit:** Notice it says "fruit" (singular), not "fruits." The Holy Spirit produces a unified character. You cannot have true spiritual "peace" without "temperance" (self-control).
*   **Temperance:** This includes control over appetite and passion. A reconciled man cares for his body as the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19), abstaining from what is harmful (alcohol, unclean foods, tobacco) and using wisely what is good.
*   **The Law Reflected:** This list is simply the Ten Commandments translated into character traits. Love is the fulfilling of the law (Romans 13:10).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
White light passed through a prism breaks into a rainbow of colors (red, orange, yellow, etc.). Similarly, the pure life of Christ (the Light) passed through the believer breaks into the rainbow of the Spirit's fruit (love, joy, peace, etc.).

### Q13. What is the first result of justification?

"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Romans 5:1.

**Answer:**
The immediate result is **Peace**.
*   **Definition:** *Justification* is the legal declaration by God that the sinner is counted righteous because of Jesus. It is the forgiveness of all past sins.
*   **End of Hostilities:** Since the carnal mind was at war (enmity) with God, justification marks the signing of the peace treaty. The conscience is no longer terrified of judgment because the penalty has been paid.
*   **Through Christ:** This peace is not a feeling we manufacture; it is a standing we have "through our Lord Jesus Christ." He is our Peace.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a soldier in the trenches, constantly afraid of the enemy's fire. Suddenly, the news comes: "The war is over! A treaty is signed." The soldier can stand up, lay down his rifle, and breathe. That is the peace of justification.

---

### Q14. How complete is the justification of that person who becomes reconciled to God?

"But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin." 1 John 1:7.

**Answer:**
The work of Christ provides a complete remedy—cleansing from *all* sin.
*   **Walking in the Light:** Justification leads to a walk (sanctification). As we advance in the Christian life, God reveals more of His will. "Walking in the light" means obeying the truth as we understand it.
*   **Continuous Cleansing:** The verb "cleanseth" is continuous. As we walk with Jesus in the Holy Place of His sanctuary ministry, His blood applies to our daily failings and His Spirit gives us victory over besetting sins.
*   **Full Restoration:** The goal is not just a legal pardon, but a character cleansed from every stain of selfishness, fully restored to the image of God.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Walking in the light is like walking toward the sun. The closer you get, the more dust you see on your coat. This doesn't mean you are getting dirtier, but that the light is revealing what needs to be brushed off. The blood of Jesus is the brush that removes every speck of sin as it is revealed.

---

### Q15. When thus reconciled to God, how will the individual stand?

"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Romans 8:1.

**Answer:**
The reconciled believer stands in a state of **No Condemnation**.
*   **In Christ:** This is the key. As long as the believer abides in Christ (John 15:4), they are covered by His righteousness. The law condemns the sinner, but it cannot condemn Christ, and we are hidden in Him.
*   **The Condition:** The verse adds a description of true believers: they "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
    *   This does not mean they never make a mistake, but that the *direction* of their life has changed. They are no longer ruled by the carnal mind.
*   **Assurance:** We can face the judgment with confidence, not because we are perfect in ourselves, but because we are united with the One who is Perfect.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If you are standing outside in a storm, you get wet and cold (condemned). But if you step inside a strong, waterproof shelter, the storm still rages, but you are dry and safe. Christ is that Shelter. As long as we "abide" (remain) in Him, the storm of judgment cannot touch us.
