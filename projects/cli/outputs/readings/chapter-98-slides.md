## Slide 1 – Title Slide
- **Topic:** Civil Government and Religious Liberty
- **Based on:** Romans 13, Daniel, and Acts
- **Theme:** The Christian’s Duty to God and State

***

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Christian and Civil Power
- **Question:** Who should be subject to civil government?
- **Key Text:** Romans 13:1 – “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.”

***

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points
- **Not Anarchists:** The Bible teaches that the Christian is not an anarchist but a model citizen.
- **God of Order:** God establishes civil government to maintain order in a sinful world (1 Corinthians 14:33).
- **Universal Command:** The command applies to "every soul." Being a citizen of heaven does not exempt us from earthly laws (Philippians 3:20).
- **Source of Authority:** All authority originates with God, who allows rulers to rise and fall to serve His purposes (Daniel 2:21).
- **Conscience:** We submit not just to avoid punishment, but because lawlessness is contrary to God’s character.

***

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **Imagine a Busy Intersection:**
  - Without traffic lights or rules, there is chaos and injury.
  - The authority exists to keep traffic moving and people safe.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Even a holy person must stop at a red light.
  - Civil law exists to protect the community from chaos.

***

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Source of Power
- **Question:** By whom are the powers ordained?
- **Key Text:** Romans 13:1 – “...For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.”

***

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points
- **Office vs. Character:** God ordains the *office* of government to prevent hell on earth, even if He does not approve the *character* of every ruler.
- **God’s Sovereignty:** He delegates authority to human governments to check crime.
- **God’s Hand in History:** Even heathen kings like Nebuchadnezzar were called God’s "servants" insofar as they executed His will in history (Jeremiah 27:6).
- **Definition:** "Ordained" means appointed or established. Government is God's idea, not Satan's.

***

## Slide 7 – Q3: Resisting Just Authority
- **Question:** What does one resist who resists just civil authority?
- **Key Text:** Romans 13:2 – “Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.”

***

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points & Application
- **Rebellion Against God:** Disobeying laws that protect life and property (that do not contradict God's law) is rebellion against God.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - A Christian with the law written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10) will naturally be the most law-abiding citizen.
  - We cannot claim to be led by the Spirit while willfully violating laws that protect our neighbors.
- **The Principle:** God’s kingdom is founded on law; habitual law-breaking reveals a rebellious heart.

***

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Babysitter:**
  - A father tells his child to obey the babysitter.
  - If the child kicks the babysitter, they are actually disobeying the father.
- **The Lesson:**
  - When we disregard just civil laws, we disrespect the God who established civil order.

***

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Sphere of Authority
- **Question:** What are the proper sphere and work of civil authorities?
- **Key Text:** Romans 13:3-4 – “For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil... If thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.”

***

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points
- **Jurisdiction:** The state regulates "works" (actions) between man and man, not the conscience.
- **Protection:** The magistrate "bears the sword" to punish those who violate the rights of others.
- **Not for Religion:** The sword judges evil *deeds*, not thoughts or religious convictions. Force cannot change the heart; only the Spirit can (Zechariah 4:6).
- **The Sword:** A symbol of the power to enforce law (including capital punishment). Force is for civil peace, never for spreading the Gospel (Matthew 26:52).

***

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Purpose of Law Enforcement
- **Question:** Who is it that receives the enforcement of law?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 1:9 – “Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient...”

***

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)
- **The Righteous Man:** A person justified by faith does not need the threat of jail to keep from sinning; they are constrained by the love of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:14).
- **The Lawless:** Those rejecting grace need the "bit and bridle" of civil law to restrain selfish impulses.
- **Internal vs. External:**
  - The Gospel implants a new nature (Ezekiel 36:26).
  - **Sanctification:** The Holy Spirit imparts Christ's character so we obey out of love, not fear.

***

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration
- **Love vs. Law:**
  - A man who deeply loves his wife does not need a law saying, "Do not hit your wife."
  - His love is a higher law that prevents harm.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The law against assault is made for the man who has no love in his heart.

***

## Slide 15 – Q6: Christian Duties (Part 1)
- **Question:** How should Christians respect civil authority?
- **Key Text:** Titus 3:1 – “Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work.”

***

## Slide 16 – Q6: Christian Duties (Part 2)
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 2:13-17 – “Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake... Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.”
- **Key Text:** Romans 13:7 – “Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.”

***

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points
- **Pay Taxes:** We pay "tribute" honestly to support the government's protection and infrastructure.
- **Honor the Office:** Even if a ruler is flawed, we respect the position and avoid sedition.
- **Witness:** Submission is an act of worship. By being good citizens, we "adorn the doctrine of God our Savior" (Titus 2:10).

***

## Slide 18 – Q7: Two Spheres of Authority
- **Question:** In what words does Christ reveal that there are two spheres of authority: one that belongs to earthly governments, and another, higher one, that belongs to God alone?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 22:21 – “...Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.”

***

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points
- **Foundational Principle:** Separation of Church and State.
- **Caesar's Realm:** Money, civil obedience, taxes, and maintaining order.
- **God's Realm:** The conscience, the soul, worship, and faith.
- **The Boundary:** Caesar cannot demand what belongs to God (worship), and God does not ask Caesar to enforce religion.

***

## Slide 20 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Image on the Coin:**
  - The coin bears Caesar's image; it belongs to the state.
- **The Image on the Man:**
  - A human being bears God's image (Genesis 1:27); they belong to the Creator.
- **The Lesson:**
  - We give the coin to the state, but we give ourselves only to God.

***

## Slide 21 – Q8: Exclusive Worship
- **Question:** To whom alone did Jesus say that worship can and must be given to?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 4:10 – “...Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”

***

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points
- **Exclusive Relationship:** Worship is between the creature and the Creator.
- **First Table of the Law:** No government has authority to legislate the first four commandments (who, when, or how to worship).
- **Great Controversy:** Satan desires to force worship through civil powers (Revelation 13:15), but true worship must be voluntary.

***

## Slide 23 – Q9: Nebuchadnezzar's Decree
- **Question:** What decree did King Nebuchadnezzar once make to all the citizens of his empire?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 3:5-6 – “That at what time ye hear the sound... ye fall down and worship the golden image... and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.”

***

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points
- **Abuse of Power:** The king united **State Power** (the furnace) with **Religious Observance** (the image).
- **Uniformity:** He sought to unify the empire through a common religion.
- **Coercion:** Using death threats to enforce religion is the spirit of Antichrist, not Christ.

***

## Slide 25 – Q10: The Believer's Response
- **Question:** What answer did the three faithful Hebrew captives give?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 3:16-18 – “...we are not careful to answer thee in this matter... our God whom we serve is able to deliver us... But if not... we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image...”

***

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points
- **Polite but Firm:** They refused to disobey the Second Commandment (Exodus 20:4-5).
- **Faith over Feeling:** Their loyalty was based on doing right, not on escaping pain.
- **Civil Disobedience:** When earthly law conflicts with God's Law, the Christian must peacefully disobey the state to obey the Lord.

***

## Slide 27 – Q11: The Consequence of Faithfulness
- **Question:** What did Nebuchadnezzar then do?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 3:20 – “He commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.”

***

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points
- **Persecution:** The inevitable result when the state enforces religion.
- **The Dragon's Wrath:** Revelation 12:17 predicts this same wrath against those who keep the commandments of God.

***

## Slide 29 – Q12: Divine Deliverance
- **Question:** After their miraculous deliverance, what did Nebuchadnezzar then declare to everyone?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 3:28 – “Blessed be the God... who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.”

***

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points
- **God Vindicated:** By overruling the decree ("changing the king's word"), God showed He is the High King.
- **The Fourth Man:** Jesus walked with them in the fire (Verse 25).
- **The Promise:** He does not always save us *from* trouble, but He is with us *in* trouble (Isaiah 43:2).

***

## Slide 31 – Q13: Daniel's Character
- **Question:** In what way alone were the envious leaders of Medo-Persia able to complain about Daniel?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:5 – “We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.”

***

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points
- **Faultless Citizen:** Daniel was not corrupt, lazy, or rebellious.
- **Sanctified Life:** His character was blameless before men; the only trap was a conflict between civil and religious duty.

***

## Slide 33 – Q14: The Trap Set
- **Question:** What religious law did they succeed in urging the king to enact?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:7 – “That whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, a king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.”

***

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points
- **Regulating Prayer:** A statute controlling a purely religious exercise.
- **Man as God:** Placing the king in the place of God (a type of the "man of sin" in 2 Thessalonians 2).

***

## Slide 35 – Q15: Daniel's Consistency
- **Question:** Did Daniel obey this new governmental edict?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:10 – “...his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did a foretime.”

***

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points & Sanctuary
- **No Compromise:** Daniel did not hide his faith nor flaunt it; he simply continued.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - He prayed toward Jerusalem (the site of the temple/sanctuary).
  - This demonstrated faith in the sacrifices and mediation the temple represented (1 Kings 8:29-30).
- **Lifestyle:** Faith was his daily habit ("as he did aforetime"), not a crisis reaction.

***

## Slide 37 – Q16: The Penalty
- **Question:** What was done to Daniel for disobeying it?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:16 – “Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions.”

***

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points
- **Death Decree:** The penalty for violating a state-enforced religious law was death.
- **Satan's Target:** Satan hates prayer because it connects the soul to the Source of power.

***

## Slide 39 – Q17: The King's Question
- **Question:** What did Darius say when Daniel was taken out of the lions' den?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:20 – “O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?”

***

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points
- **A Continual Service:** Even the heathen king recognized Daniel served God "continually."
- **Preparation:** A life of constant connection with Christ is the only preparation for the time of trouble.

***

## Slide 41 – Q18: Daniel's Testimony
- **Question:** What was Daniel's reply to the king?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:21-22 – “...My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths... forasmuch as before Him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt.”

***

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points
- **Two Innocencies:**
  1. **Before God:** Faithful to divine law.
  2. **Before the King:** "Done no hurt" to the state.
- **True Religion:** Practicing true faith is never an actual threat to the stability of a government.

***

## Slide 43 – Q19: The Great Commission
- **Question:** What parting command did Christ give to His disciples?
- **Key Text:** Mark 16:15 – “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”

***

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points
- **Marching Orders:** The command comes from the King of Kings.
- **Priorities:** No earthly "stop sign" can invalidate this divine "green light."

***

## Slide 45 – Q20: The Counter Command
- **Question:** What counter command did the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem soon give them?
- **Key Text:** Acts 4:18 – “And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.”

***

## Slide 46 – Q20: Key Points
- **Direct Conflict:** God said "Go"; authorities said "Stop."
- **Religious Tyranny:** Religious leaders used civil power (temple guard/Sanhedrin) to silence truth.

***

## Slide 47 – Q21: The Apostles' Answer
- **Question:** What reply did Peter and John give to these authorities?
- **Key Text:** Acts 4:19-20 – “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.”

***

## Slide 48 – Q21: Key Points
- **Higher Allegiance:** A lower officer cannot countermand a superior general.
- **Constraint of Love:** "We cannot but speak." When Christ is in the heart, the testimony flows out naturally as a result of a transformed life.

***

## Slide 49 – Q22: The Result of Preaching
- **Question:** For continuing to preach the Word of God, after being forbidden to do so, what was the result?
- **Key Text:** Acts 5:17-18 – “Then the high priest rose up... and were filled with indignation, and laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.”

***

## Slide 50 – Q22: Key Points
- **Force vs. Truth:**
  - Truth relies on the Spirit and the Word.
  - Error relies on indignation and prisons.
- **Weakness:** Using force to suppress truth is a sign of spiritual weakness.

***

## Slide 51 – Q23: God's Intervention
- **Question:** Did God then reveal Himself to be on the side of governmental authorities when they did wrong?
- **Key Text:** Acts 5:19-20 – “But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said, Go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.”

***

## Slide 52 – Q23: Key Points
- **God's Vote:** God voted against the Sanhedrin by releasing the apostles.
- **No Jurisdiction:** God demonstrated that civil authority has no right to stop the preaching of the Gospel.
- **Renewed Command:** "Go, stand and speak."

***

## Slide 53 – Q24: The Charge
- **Question:** When the apostles were called before the council again, what question did the high priest ask them?
- **Key Text:** Acts 5:28 – “Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.”

***

## Slide 54 – Q24: Key Points
- **Self-Preservation:** The authorities were concerned with their reputation ("bring this man's blood upon us") and their power.
- **The Conflict:** They fought to preserve their authority; the apostles fought to save souls.

***

## Slide 55 – Q25: The Declaration of Independence
- **Question:** What reply did the apostles make to the authorities?
- **Key Text:** Acts 5:29 – “We ought to obey God rather than men.”

***

## Slide 56 – Q25: Key Points
- **The Golden Rule of Liberty:** When man's law and God's law agree, obey both. When they disagree, God's law is supreme.
- **Conscience:** The voice of God in the soul. To violate it is spiritual suicide.
- **Liberty of Conscience:** The freedom to practice religion without state interference, provided others' rights are not violated.

***

## Slide 57 – Q26: The Higher Court
- **Question:** Who is higher than the "higher powers" of this earth?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 5:8 – “...marvel not at the matter: for He that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.”

***

## Slide 58 – Q26: Key Points & Sanctuary
- **The Supreme Court:** There is a court in heaven higher than any earthly ruler.
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - Every ruler and citizen will stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
  - Secret acts of oppression are recorded in heaven's books.
- **Hope:** When justice is denied on earth, the believer looks to the heavenly sanctuary where Christ ministers true justice.

***

## Slide 59 – Q27: The Shadow of the End
- **Question:** Because Mordecai refused to bow down before Haman... what imperial decree did Haman succeed in enacting?
- **Key Text:** Esther 3:13 – “And the letters were sent... to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old... in one day...”

***

## Slide 60 – Q27: Key Points
- **Foreshadowing:** This mirrors the final conflict in the Great Controversy.
- **The Issue:** Refusal to give divine honor to a man.
- **The Spirit:** Satan seeks to wipe out the people who keep the commandments of God (Revelation 13:15).

***

## Slide 61 – Q28: Defining Religion
- **Question:** What is religion?
- **Definition:** “The recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and obedience... The duty which we owe to our Creator... Man's personal relation of faith and obedience to God.”

***

## Slide 62 – Q28: Key Points
- **Matter of the Heart:** True religion is the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:33).
- **Not Legislated:** It cannot be forced or proxied.
- **Vertical Relationship:** Because it is a duty to the Creator, no government has the right to interfere.

***

## Slide 63 – Q29: Spiritual Fatherhood
- **Question:** In religious things, whom alone dare we call "Father”?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 23:9 – “And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.”

***

## Slide 64 – Q29: Key Points
- **No Earthly Superior:** In the spiritual sense, no human can dictate our faith.
- **Usurpation:** Giving a religious leader the authority of "Father" (in the sense of spiritual infallibility) usurps God's place.

***

## Slide 65 – Q30: Christ's Defense
- **Question:** When tempted to bow down before Satan, what reply did Christ make?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 4:10 – “...Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”

***

## Slide 66 – Q30: Key Points
- **The Sword of the Spirit:** Jesus used the Word of God to define worship.
- **God Only:** Any power—civil or religious—that demands worship is acting as an agent of Satan.

***

## Slide 67 – Q31: Individual Accountability
- **Question:** To whom alone, then, is each one accountable in religion?
- **Key Text:** Romans 14:12 – “So then everyone of us shall give account of himself to God.”

***

## Slide 68 – Q31: Key Points
- **Pillar of Truth:** Individual accountability.
- **No Proxies:** A priest, king, or pastor cannot answer for you in the Judgment.
- **Freedom Needed:** Since you alone must answer to God, you alone must have the freedom to decide how to worship Him.

***

## Slide 69 – Q32: Playing God
- **Question:** What do those do, therefore, who make men accountable to them in matters of religion?
- **Answer:** They put themselves in the place of God. (See 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).

***

## Slide 70 – Q32: Key Points
- **Antichrist Spirit:** Placing man in the temple of God.
- **One Mediator:** Any system putting a human or state between the soul and God denies the sole priesthood of Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5).

***

## Slide 71 – Q33: One Master
- **Question:** Why is it, that in areas of religion, Christ declared that men must not be called masters?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 23:10 – “Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.”

***

## Slide 72 – Q33: Key Points
- **Equality:** We are all sinners saved by grace; Christ is the Head.
- **No Force:** No believer has authority to force the conscience of another.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Our righteousness comes from Christ, not from adherence to human leaders.

***

## Slide 73 – Q34: God's Servants
- **Question:** To whom, then, as servants of God, are we responsible in matters of faith and worship?
- **Key Text:** Romans 14:4 – “Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth.”

***

## Slide 74 – Q34: Key Points
- **God is Master:** Just as a neighbor cannot fire your gardener, no human can judge God's servant in matters of conscience.
- **Divine Power:** God is able to make His servant stand.

***

## Slide 75 – Q35: Bought with a Price
- **Question:** Whose servants are we not to be?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 7:23 – “Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.”

***

## Slide 76 – Q35: Key Points
- **The Price:** We were purchased with the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19).
- **The Ownership:** We belong to Jesus.
- **The Conflict:** If we allow men to dictate our religion contrary to the Bible, we rob Christ of His property.

***

## Slide 77 – Q36: The Final Exam
- **Question:** Where must all men finally appear to render account of their lives and actions?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:10 – “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that everyone may receive the things done in his body...”

***

## Slide 78 – Q36: Key Points (Sanctuary & Gospel)
- **Investigative Judgment:** The books are opened, and every life is reviewed.
- **Personal Responsibility:** God holds every individual personally responsible; therefore, every individual must be free to choose.
- **The Only Hope:** In that day, no civil law can save us. Only the righteousness of Christ—imputed and imparted—will stand. We must follow the Lamb (Revelation 14:4).

***

## Slide 79 – Q36: Illustration
- **The Final Exam:**
  - In a classroom exam, the teacher does not allow anyone else to hold the pen for the student.
  - The student passes or fails on their own work.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Life is the testing time; the Judgment is the exam.
  - We must be free to write our own answers in the book of life.
