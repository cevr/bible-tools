### Q1. For what were the precious promises of the word written?

**“For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.” Rom. 15:4.**

**Answer:**

The Bible is not merely a record of ancient history; it is the handbook of salvation designed for our present spiritual survival and growth.

*   **The Purpose of Scripture:** The history of God’s dealings with His people—their trials, their failures, and their deliverances—was recorded so that we might understand the character of God. By seeing how He delivered them, we gain **hope** that He will deliver us.
*   **The Role of the Promises:** The promises of God are the means by which we partake of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). When we claim a promise (e.g., for forgiveness or power over sin), we are laying hold of the reality of God’s power.
*   **Patience and Comfort:** The Christian walk is often a battle against the flesh and the world. Without the "comfort of the Scriptures," we might despair. The Word provides the endurance needed to continue the journey until the end.

> **Definition:**
> **Hope:** In the Bible, hope is not wishful thinking; it is a confident expectation of future good based on the promises of God (Hebrews 11:1; Titus 2:13).

**[ILL]** Imagine a hiker trekking through a dark, treacherous mountain pass. If he had no map and no light, he would despair and likely stop. The Scriptures are both the map showing the destination and the lantern lighting the immediate path (Psalm 119:105). The stories of those who hiked the path before us give us the "patience" to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

### Q2. What is the Father Himself called?

**“The God of patience and consolation.” Rom. 15:5.**

**Answer:**

Our ability to be patient originates in the very nature of God. He is the source.

*   **God’s Character:** God describes Himself as "merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (Exodus 34:6). If God were not the "God of patience," humanity would have been consumed by judgment long ago.
*   **Imputed and Imparted Grace:**
    *   **Imputed Righteousness (Justification):** Because God is patient, He holds back the immediate penalty of sin to give us time to repent (2 Peter 3:9). He accepts us in Christ despite our past failures.
    *   **Imparted Righteousness (Sanctification):** As we behold the God of patience, we are changed into His image (2 Corinthians 3:18). We cannot generate true spiritual patience by human willpower; it must be received from Him as a gift.
*   **The Sanctuary:** God’s patience is illustrated in the sanctuary service. The High Priest ministers daily, bearing with the ignorance and errors of the people, seeking to bring them to perfection before the final judgment.

**[ILL]** Consider a master artist teaching an apprentice. The apprentice makes clumsy strokes and mistakes. The master does not throw the canvas away in anger. He patiently corrects the hand of the student, over and over, until the student learns the master’s touch. God is that patient Master, working to reproduce the image of Jesus in us.

### Q3. Is patience enjoined upon us in Holy Writ?

**“Be patient toward all men.” 1 Thess. 5:14. "In your patience possess ye your souls." Luke 21:19.**

**Answer:**

Yes, patience is not optional; it is a command of Scripture and a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22).

*   **Self-Control through the Spirit:** The phrase "possess ye your souls" suggests self-mastery. When we lose patience, we lose control of our spirit, effectively handing control over to our lower nature or to the enemy. To "possess" the soul means to keep the mind under the control of the Holy Spirit.
*   **Toward "All" Men:** It is easy to be patient with those we love or those who treat us well. The command to be patient "toward all men" includes the irritating, the unjust, and the enemies of truth. This is the "higher ground" of Christian living.
*   **Victory over Temper:** This command proves that the "quick temper" often excused as a personality trait is actually a sin that must be overcome. Through Christ, the most volatile temper can be subdued and replaced with divine calm.

> **Definition:**
> **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the believer is cleansed from sin and made holy in character, resulting in obedience to God’s law (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:13).

**[ILL]** A city under siege must maintain control of its gates. If the gates are flung open in a moment of panic or rage, the enemy rushes in. Patience is the gatekeeper of the soul. When we "possess our souls" in patience, we keep the gates barred against the enemy's temptations to anger and retaliation.

### Q4. What contrast in drawn between the patient and the hasty spirit?

**“He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding; but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.” Prov. 14:29.**

**Answer:**

Solomon here contrasts the wisdom of God's way with the foolishness of the natural heart.

*   **Hasty of Spirit:** This refers to impulsiveness—reacting immediately to provocation without consulting God or reason. The Bible says this "exalteth folly," meaning it puts stupidity on display for all to see.
*   **Slow to Wrath:** This does not mean one is indifferent to wrong, but that one has the "great understanding" that vengeance belongs to God. A patient person understands the Great Controversy—they realize that reacting in anger only serves Satan's purpose.
*   **The Law of Love:** A hasty spirit is a violation of the law of love (1 Corinthians 13:4, "Charity suffereth long"). By faith, the believer claims the power of Christ to pause, pray, and respond with the Spirit of Jesus rather than the spirit of the world.

**[ILL]** Think of a small spark landing in dry grass. If you stomp it out immediately (patience/self-control), no damage is done. If you let the wind catch it (hasty spirit), it becomes a wildfire that destroys everything in its path. A hasty word often starts a fire that cannot be easily put out (James 3:5–6).

### Q5. What worthy persons did James refer to, while dwelling on patience?

**“Take, my brethren, the prophets... for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience." "Ye have heard of the patience of Job." James 5:10, 11.**

**Answer:**

James points us to the "cloud of witnesses" to show that patience is forged in the fires of affliction.

*   **The Prophets:** They spoke for God, yet they were often persecuted, ignored, or killed. Their patience consisted of continuing to speak the truth even when it was unpopular.
*   **Job's Experience:** Job represents the ultimate test of patience in the Great Controversy.
    *   Satan claimed Job only served God because God blessed him (selfishness).
    *   Job lost his wealth, his children, and his health, yet he said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him" (Job 13:15).
    *   Job's patience vindicated God’s character before the universe, proving that grace can keep a man faithful even when all earthly support is removed.
*   **Suffering and Glory:** There is no such thing as a "fair-weather Christian" who is truly patient. Patience is only revealed when things go wrong.

**[ILL]** A diamond is merely a piece of coal that has endured extreme pressure and heat over a long period. The prophets and Job are like spiritual diamonds; the pressure of their trials did not crush them but rather crystallized their character into something precious.

### Q6. For what glorious event are the children of God bidden patiently to wait?

**“And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ." 2 Thess. 3:5. "Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Be ye also patient, stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh." James 5:7, 8.**

**Answer:**

The ultimate focus of the believer's patience is the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.

*   **The Agricultural Analogy:** James 5:7 compares the believer to a husbandman (farmer) waiting for the precious fruit of the earth.
    *   The farmer cannot rush the harvest.
    *   He must wait for the "early rain" (germination/conversion) and the "latter rain" (ripening/final outpouring of the Spirit).
*   **Stablish Your Hearts:** As we approach the end of time, the world will become more unstable. To "stablish" the heart means to be rooted and grounded in the truth (2 Peter 1:12). This preparation takes time and patience.
*   **Sanctuary Context:** We are currently in the antitypical Day of Atonement. While the High Priest (Jesus) is finishing His work in the Most Holy Place, the people on earth must patiently afflict their souls, putting away sin, and waiting for Him to come out to bless them (Leviticus 16; Hebrews 9:28).

**[ILL]** When a builder sets concrete for a foundation, he must wait for it to cure. If he builds on it while it is wet, the structure will collapse. God is "curing" our characters—settling us into the truth—so that we can stand in the final storm. We must wait patiently for this work to be completed.

### Q7. What good things are spoken of those who endure?

**“Behold, we count them happy which endure." James 5:11. "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation." James 1:12. "He that endureth to the end, shall be saved." Matt. 10:22.**

**Answer:**

Salvation is promised not just to those who *start* the race, but to those who *finish* it.

*   **Endurance and Salvation:** The popular idea of "once saved, always saved" is not supported here. Jesus says we must endure *to the end*. This implies a continual reliance on Christ's power day by day.
*   **The Crown of Life:** James 1:12 promises a crown to those who endure temptation. This is the "crown of righteousness" (2 Timothy 4:8) given to those who have loved His appearing and allowed Him to reign in their lives.
*   **Happiness in Trial:** It seems contradictory to say we are "happy" (or blessed) when we endure suffering. But the blessing lies in the result: a purified character that can stand in God's presence.

> **Definition:**
> **Righteousness by Faith:** This is the experience where the believer, having no righteousness of their own, trusts wholly in Christ. Christ's righteousness is *imputed* for pardon and *imparted* for obedience and victory over sin (Philippians 3:9; Romans 8:3–4).

**[ILL]** A runner in a marathon may be exhausted, his muscles burning, but there is a joy and "blessedness" in crossing the finish line that the spectator on the sidelines never knows. The endurance itself yields the victory.

***

### Q8. What does the trying of faith work?

**“Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience." James 1:3. "Not only so but we glory in tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience." Rom. 5:3.**

**Answer:**

Trials are God's workshop for producing patience.

*   **The Mechanism:** Faith is like a muscle. It only grows strong when resistance is applied. God permits trials ("the trying of your faith") not to break us, but to force us to lean harder on Him.
*   **Tribulation:** The word used here comes from the Latin *tribulum*, a heavy threshing sledge used to separate wheat from chaff.
    *   God uses the "threshing" of trials to separate the chaff of selfishness, pride, and worldliness from the wheat of our character.
*   **The Result:** "Patience" (Greek: *hypomone*) means "abiding under." It is the ability to remain steadfast under a heavy load. This character trait is essential for the 144,000 who must stand without an intercessor after the close of probation (Revelation 15:8).

**[ILL]** Consider a piece of iron. Cold, it is hard and brittle. But put it in the fire, and it becomes soft; the blacksmith can then shape it into a useful tool. The trials of life are the fire that makes us pliable in the hands of the Creator.

### Q9. What will be one of the characteristic traits of those who shall prepare for the second coming of Christ?

**“Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus... And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle." Rev. 14:12, 14.**

**Answer:**

This verse (Revelation 14:12) describes the specific group of people—the Remnant—who live just before the harvest of the earth (the Second Coming).

*   **Three Identifying Marks:**
    1.  **Patience:** They have endured the "great tribulation" and the deceptive pressure of the Mark of the Beast. They waited for the Lord when the whole world wandered after the beast.
    2.  **Keep the Commandments:** Not merely in theory, but in practice. Their lives are brought into harmony with the Ten Commandments (including the fourth commandment Sabbath) through the power of the indwelling Christ. This vindicates God’s law against Satan’s charges that it cannot be kept.
    3.  **The Faith of Jesus:** Note it does not say "faith *in* Jesus" (though they have that), but the "faith *of* Jesus." They possess the same quality of trust and dependence on the Father that Jesus had in Gethsemane and on the Cross.
*   **Victory over Sin:** This text proves that before Jesus returns, there will be a people who, by God's grace, have ceased to sin. They keep the commandments because the Law is written on their hearts (Hebrews 8:10).
*   **The Harvest:** Immediately following this description, the Son of Man comes with a sickle (v. 14). The grain is fully ripe. The character of Christ is fully reproduced in His people.

**[ILL]** A reflection in a pool of water is only clear when the water is perfectly still and the mud has settled. The "patience of the saints" describes a people whose lives are so calm and settled in the truth that they perfectly reflect the image of Jesus to the world.

***

### Q10. What should be the language of every heart?

**“I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I hope." Ps. 130:5.**

**Answer:**

The attitude of the true believer is one of active, hopeful waiting upon God's Word.

*   **Soul Waiting:** This is not a passive, bored waiting. It is an intense longing, like a watchman waiting for the morning (Psalm 130:6).
*   **Hope in the Word:** Our feelings fluctuate; our circumstances change. We cannot rely on our emotions or our own strength. Our hope must be anchored entirely in "His Word." If God has said it, He will do it.
*   **Practical Application:** In every decision, in every trial, in every delay, we must ask: "What has God promised?" and then wait for Him to fulfill His word, moving forward in obedience as He directs.

**[ILL]** When a ship is in a storm, the passengers may be terrified, but the captain keeps his eyes on the compass and the lighthouse. His "hope" is in the navigation instruments. We are in the storm of the last days; our eyes must be fixed on the Word of God, which points us to the safe harbor of eternity.
