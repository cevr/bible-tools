## Slide 1 – Q1: The True God vs. False Gods

- **Question:** In what way is the true God distinguished from all false gods?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 10:10-12
  - “But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king... The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Creation & Power)

- **The Living God vs. Perishing Idols**
  - False gods are things that are *made*; the true God is the *Maker*.
  - An idol has no life; it must be carried and maintained.
  - The true God is the source of all life (Acts 17:25 – “Seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.”).
- **Creative Power as Authority**
  - God’s right to rule as “everlasting king” is based on His creation of the territory.
  - He owns the earth because He made it by His power.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Power to Create is Power to Save

- **Creation and the Gospel**
  - The power required to create is the same power required to save.
  - Creation called light out of darkness; Salvation shines light into the sinful heart (2 Corinthians 4:6 – “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”).
- **Redemption is Re-creation**
  - If God were not the Creator, He could not be the Redeemer.
  - Salvation is a work of creating a clean heart (Psalm 51:10 – “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.”).

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Artist and the Painting**
  - Imagine a magnificent painting in a gallery.
  - An idol is like a figure painted *inside* the canvas—it is part of the creation and cannot help itself.
  - The true God is the Artist standing *outside* the canvas.
  - He is not part of the creation but the Designer.
  - Only the Artist can restore the painting if it is damaged; the painted figures cannot fix themselves.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Paul’s Message to Athens

- **Question:** How did Paul explain to the idolatrous Athenians the identity of the true God?
- **Key Text:** Acts 17:23, 24
  - “Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (The Unknown God)

- **The Foundation of Reality**
  - Paul did not argue tradition; he went straight to Creation.
  - He identified the “Unknown God” as the Creator of all things.
  - A God who made the world cannot be contained in human temples.
- **The Basis of Worship**
  - Worship is due to God because He is our Origin.
  - If we evolved by chance, we would owe God nothing.
  - Because we depend on Him for existence, our lives belong to Him (Acts 17:28 – “For in him we live, and move, and have our being...”).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Definition of Worship

- **What is Worship?**
  - To ascribe worth, honor, and glory to a superior being.
  - It is the response of the created being to the Creator.
  - **Revelation 4:11** – “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Message to Lystra

- **Question:** What did the apostles tell the idolaters at Lystra?
- **Key Text:** Acts 14:15
  - “...We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Turning to the Living God)

- **The Call to Repentance**
  - Salvation involves turning from “vanities” (useless things) to the Living Creator.
  - **Righteousness by Faith Application:** Repentance is turning away from reliance on self and idols to rely wholly on the Living God.
- **The First Angel's Message**
  - This parallels the final warning in Revelation.
  - **Revelation 14:7** – “...Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”
- **Harmony of Scripture**
  - To deny the Creation account is to turn away from the foundation of the Gospel.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Drowning Man**
  - If a man is drowning, he does not need a statue of a lifeguard.
  - He needs a living lifeguard who can swim and rescue him.
  - Idols and salvation-by-works are like statues—they look religious but cannot save.
  - The “Living God” is the active Rescuer who made the sea and has power over it.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Reason for the Sabbath

- **Question:** What is the reason given in the fourth commandment for keeping the Sabbath holy?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:11
  - “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Memorial & Seal)

- **The Memorial of Creation**
  - Just as a birthday remembers the beginning of a life, the Sabbath remembers the beginning of the world.
  - It keeps the truth of Creation fresh in the mind.
- **God's Rest**
  - God did not rest because of fatigue (Isaiah 40:28 – “...the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary...”).
  - He rested because His work was perfect and complete.
- **The Seal of God**
  - A king’s seal contains: Name, Title, and Territory.
  - The Fourth Commandment is the only one containing the seal of the Living God:
    1. Name: The Lord thy God.
    2. Title: Maker/Creator.
    3. Territory: Heaven and earth.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Builder's Plaque**
  - When a builder finishes a great cathedral, he often places a cornerstone or plaque with his name and the completion date.
  - If you remove that plaque, people may forget who built it.
  - The Sabbath is the “plaque” on the cathedral of time.
  - It testifies weekly that “God built this.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: The Sabbath as a Sign

- **Question:** What is the Sabbath to those who keep it holy?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 20:20
  - “And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Knowledge & Loyalty)

- **A Sign of Knowledge**
  - The text says, “that ye may know.”
  - Sabbath keeping is educational; pausing our work to contemplate God’s work grows our knowledge of Him.
- **A Sign of Loyalty**
  - In a world that ignores the Creator, keeping the Sabbath identifies the believer as a worshiper of the true God.
- **Sanctuary Connection**
  - The Ten Commandments were placed inside the Ark, in the Most Holy Place.
  - They resided directly under the Mercy Seat (Christ’s blood).
  - The Sabbath is central to God's government and covered by His mercy.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Covenant Definition

- **What is a Covenant?**
  - A solemn, binding agreement between God and man.
  - God promises salvation and power; man responds with faith and obedience.
  - **Hebrews 8:10** – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Importance of Knowing God

- **Question:** How important is it that we come to know God?
- **Key Text:** John 17:3
  - “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Relationship & Faith)

- **Experiential Knowledge**
  - Biblical knowledge implies intimate relationship, not just data.
  - We know God by experiencing His power to forgive and sustain.
- **The Channel of Life**
  - Spiritual life is found only in Christ (1 John 5:12 – “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.”).
  - The Sabbath provides time to cultivate this relationship.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - Faith implies trusting a Person. You cannot trust someone you do not know.
  - We need this relationship so our righteousness may be found in Him (Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ...”).

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Danger of Forgetting

- **Question:** Is there any danger that the people of God may forget Him?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 8:11
  - “Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Amnesia & Disobedience)

- **Forgetting Leads to Breaking**
  - The text links forgetting the Lord with not keeping His commandments.
  - Losing sight of the Lawgiver leads to losing the motive to obey.
- **The Danger of Prosperity**
  - When people become comfortable, they take credit for their own success.
  - **Deuteronomy 8:17** – “And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.”
- **The Sabbath Remedy**
  - The Sabbath is a weekly “stop” sign.
  - It forces us to acknowledge we are creatures dependent on the Creator.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **Spiritual Alzheimer's**
  - Alzheimer's disease is a tragedy where a person forgets their own family.
  - “Spiritual Alzheimer's” is a tragedy of the soul where we forget our Father.
  - The Sabbath is the weekly medicine prescribed by God to prevent this spiritual memory loss.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Sabbath and Sanctification

- **Question:** What other reason is given for keeping the Bible Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 31:13
  - “Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Sanctification by Faith)

- **The Creator is the Sanctifier**
  - The God who created the world is the “Lord that doth sanctify you.”
- **Works vs. Grace**
  - If we could make ourselves holy by works, we would not need a sign of God’s power.
  - By resting, we acknowledge we cannot save ourselves.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application**
  - True Sabbath-keeping is the opposite of legalism.
  - Legalism says, “I work to be saved.” The Sabbath says, “I rest in God’s finished work.”
  - We trust God to finish the work of grace in us (Philippians 1:6 – “Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.”).

## Slide 24 – Q8: Definition of Sanctification

- **What is Sanctification?**
  - The process by which God makes a believer holy.
  - It is the work of a lifetime, accomplished by the Holy Spirit.
  - **1 Thessalonians 5:23** – “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Israel’s Special Reason

- **Question:** What special reason did Israel have for keeping the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 5:15
  - “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points (Creation & Redemption)

- **Double Obligation**
  - Believers owe God for **Creation** (Exodus 20) and **Redemption** (Deuteronomy 5).
  - He made us, and He bought us back.
- **Freedom from Bondage**
  - In Egypt, slaves had no rest. God liberated them and gave the Sabbath as a badge of freedom.
- **Spiritual Application**
  - Egypt represents sin (Revelation 11:8 – “...which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt...”).
  - Every Christian has been “brought out” of the slavery of sin.
  - We keep the Sabbath because God has saved us from the tyranny of sin.

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Purpose of Redemption

- **Question:** As God brought the Israelites out of bondage in Egypt, so He brings us out of the bondage of sin. Why did He bring His people out of Egypt?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 105:43-45
  - “And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness... And gave them the lands of the heathen... That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the Lord.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points (Liberty for Obedience)

- **Freedom is for Holiness**
  - We are saved *from* sin, not *in* sin.
  - True liberty is not the freedom to do whatever we want, but the power to do what is right.
- **Law and Gospel Combined**
  - **The Gospel:** God brings them out (Grace).
  - **The Law:** That they might keep His statutes (Obedience).
  - Grace precedes obedience, but obedience is the fruit of grace.

## Slide 29 – Q10: Application (Victory & Justification)

- **Victory Over Sin**
  - Through the indwelling Christ, the believer is enabled to keep God's law.
  - The Sabbath is a sign of resting from the struggle of sin, trusting in the Savior's power.
- **Definition: Justification**
  - God's gracious declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous based on Christ's merits.
  - **Romans 3:24** – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 30 – Q11: Meaning of "Sabbath"

- **Question:** What does the word "sabbath" mean?
- **Answer:** The word comes from the Hebrew *shabbath*, meaning **“Rest”** or **“Cessation.”**

## Slide 31 – Q11: Key Points (Types of Rest)

- **Ceasing from Labor**
  - Physically stopping ordinary toil to protect man from materialism.
- **Spiritual Rest**
  - Points to the “rest” of faith in the gospel.
  - **Hebrews 4:9-10** – “There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.”
- **Restoration**
  - Not merely idleness, but active engagement with God to be refreshed (Exodus 31:17).

## Slide 32 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Unstrung Bow**
  - A bow that is always bent will eventually lose its power or break.
  - It must be unstrung to retain its strength.
  - The Sabbath is God’s way of “unstringing the bow” of human life.
  - It allows us to be renewed physically, mentally, and spiritually.

## Slide 33 – Q12: Public Worship

- **Question:** Was it God's plan that the Seventh day Sabbath be used as a day for public worship?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 23:3
  - “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.”

## Slide 34 – Q12: Key Points (Gathering Together)

- **A Holy Convocation**
  - “Convocation” implies a calling together or assembly.
  - God designed His people to gather for encouragement and praise.
- **Biblical Examples**
  - **Jesus:** Luke 4:16 – “...as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day...”
  - **Paul:** Acts 18:4 – “And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.”
- **Foregleam of Heaven**
  - **Isaiah 66:23** – “And it shall come to pass... from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 35 – Q12: Application (Atonement)

- **Definition: Atonement**
  - The work of reconciling God and man ("At-one-ment").
  - The sanctuary service shows sin being blotted out to restore oneness with God.
  - The Sabbath gathering celebrates this unity with God and each other.
