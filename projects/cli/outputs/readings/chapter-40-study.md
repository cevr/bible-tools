### Q1. By what means is all Scripture given?

"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness." 2 Tim. 3:16.

**Answer:**

The Bible does not claim to be a mere collection of human wisdom or historical records; it claims to be the direct result of the **inspiration** of God.

*   **Defined:** *Inspiration* (from the Greek *theopneustos*) literally means "God-breathed." It is the process by which the Holy Spirit communicated God's eternal truth to human agents, ensuring that the message recorded is the authoritative Word of God (2 Peter 1:21).
*   **The Authority of the Word:** Because Scripture is breathed out by God, it stands above human tradition, church councils, or personal feelings. It is the supreme standard for all doctrine (teaching) and the test of all experience (Isaiah 8:20).
*   **The Work of the Word:** The verse highlights a practical, four-fold purpose for this inspiration:
    1.  **Doctrine:** Teaching us the truth about God’s character and His law.
    2.  **Reproof:** Convicting us of our sin and need for a Savior.
    3.  **Correction:** restoring us to the right path when we have strayed.
    4.  **Instruction in righteousness:** Training us how to live in harmony with God's law.

**[ILL]** Think of a musician playing a trumpet. The trumpet (the human writer) has a specific shape and tone, but the breath that flows through it and creates the melody comes entirely from the musician (the Holy Spirit). Without the breath, the instrument is silent; with it, a clear, certain sound is produced.

### Q2. For what purpose?

“That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works." 2 Tim. 3:17.

**Answer:**

The ultimate goal of Bible study and prophecy is not merely to fill the head with facts, but to transform the character.

*   **Defined:** *Perfect* in the biblical sense (Greek *artios*) often means "complete," "mature," or "fitted for its purpose." It refers to a Christian character that has been fully restored to the image of God through the grace of Christ (Matthew 5:48; Colossians 1:28).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Note that the Scripture furnishes us unto "all good works." We are not saved *by* our works, but we are created in Christ Jesus *unto* good works (Ephesians 2:10). When the Word of God is received by faith, it becomes an active power in the life, imparting the power to obey.
    *   **Sanctification:** This is the work of a lifetime—using the Word of God to become "thoroughly furnished" or equipped to overcome every temptation and reflect Christ’s love to the world.
*   **The Standard:** God’s law is the standard of righteousness, and the Word of God provides the "equipment" (the promises, the warnings, and the revelation of Christ) necessary to bring our lives into harmony with that standard.

**[ILL]** A master carpenter brings a toolbox to a job site. The box contains every tool necessary to build a house—hammer, saw, level, and plane. The Bible is the Christian’s toolbox. It contains every spiritual tool needed to build a character that can stand the storms of life and fit us for heaven.

### Q3. To whom do the things revealed belong?

“The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever." Deut. 29:29.

**Answer:**

While God is infinite and retains mysteries beyond our comprehension, He has given us specific revelations—especially prophecies—that become our property and inheritance.

*   **Our Responsibility:** Prophecy is not given to satisfy idle curiosity, but to be understood and applied. When God reveals a truth—such as the prophecies regarding the time of the end or the sanctuary—we are responsible for that light. To ignore it is to reject a gift from the King.
*   **For Our Children:** We are commanded to teach these truths to the next generation. The "revealed things" (the plan of salvation, the law of God, the history of His leading) are the legacy we leave to our families to guide them through the perils of the last days.
*   **The Limits of Speculation:** We must study what is *revealed* (the Bible) rather than speculating on the *secret things* (dates of Christ's return which are not given, or mysteries God has not explained).

**[ILL]** Imagine a wealthy father leaves a Last Will and Testament for his children. The children do not know the full extent of the father's business dealings (the secret things), but the Will explicitly outlines what has been given to them (the revealed things). It would be foolish for the heirs to ignore the Will that secures their inheritance.

### Q4. What is the last book of the Bible called?

“The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him." Rev. 1:1.

**Answer:**

The last book of the Bible is not primarily about beasts or dragons; it is the *Revelation of Jesus Christ*.

*   **Defined:** *Revelation* comes from the Greek *apokalypsis*, meaning an "unveiling" or "uncovering."
*   **The Central Figure:** This book unveils Jesus in His work *after* His ascension. While the Gospels show Christ on earth as the suffering Sacrifice, Revelation shows Him in heaven as the conquering King and our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1–2).
*   **The Sanctuary Context:** The book opens with Jesus walking among the candlesticks (the Holy Place) and moves toward the opening of the temple of God in heaven (Rev 11:19). It reveals His work of judgment and His final victory over sin.

**[ILL]** If a statue is covered by a thick canvas, you cannot see its form. When the canvas is pulled away, the statue is "revealed." The book of Revelation pulls back the curtain of the natural world so we can see the supernatural reality: Jesus Christ controlling the destiny of nations and caring for His church.

### Q5. What is said of those who read or study this book?

“Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein." Rev. 1:3.

**Answer:**

A special blessing is pronounced upon those who engage with the prophecies of Revelation, but the blessing is conditional on three actions: Reading, Hearing, and Keeping.

*   **Defined:** *Keeping* the words of prophecy means obeying the instructions found therein. It implies that the warnings and admonitions in Revelation are practical for daily living.
*   **Harmony of Law and Gospel:** To "keep" the things written therein requires the power of God. Revelation describes the saints as those who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Rev. 14:12).
    *   **Justification:** We hear the message of Christ's blood washing us from sin (Rev 1:5).
    *   **Sanctification:** We keep the message by allowing His life to produce obedience in us.
*   **Urgency:** The verse adds, "for the time is at hand." Prophecy is a call to immediate action—repentance and preparation for the judgment.

**[ILL]** A doctor gives a patient a prescription for a life-saving cure. It is not enough to *read* the prescription, nor just to *hear* the doctor explain it. The patient is only blessed (healed) if he *keeps* the instruction by actually taking the medicine.

### Q6. How were the Old Testament prophecies given?

“For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21.

**Answer:**

The reliability of prophecy rests on its source. It did not originate in the "will of man"—human political calculation or guesswork.

*   **The Agency:** The Holy Ghost (Holy Spirit) is the active agent. He "moved" the prophets. The Greek word used here implies being carried along, like a ship driven by the wind.
*   **Holy Men:** God chose individuals who were surrendered to Him to be His vessels. While the writers retained their own personalities and vocabulary, the thoughts and truths conveyed were entirely divine.
*   **Certainty:** Because the source is God, who knows the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:9–10), we can trust prophecy to be accurate even when it predicts events thousands of years in the future.

**[ILL]** Consider a pen in the hand of a writer. The pen does not decide what to write; it yields to the movement of the writer's hand. The prophets were the pens; the Holy Spirit was the Writer.

---

### Q7. What is said of the interpretation of these prophecies?

“Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation [impulse]." 2 Peter 1:20.

**Answer:**

Because prophecy did not come from man (v. 21), it cannot be interpreted by man's private ideas or opinions.

*   **Defined:** *Private interpretation* refers to forcing a meaning onto the text that originates with the reader rather than the Author (the Holy Spirit).
*   **Scripture Interprets Scripture:** The only safe rule of Bible study is to allow the Bible to explain itself. If a symbol is used in Revelation (like a "beast"), we must look to other parts of Scripture (like Daniel) to find God's definition of that symbol.
*   **Protection against Error:** This principle protects the church from false teachers who twist Scripture to fit their own theories. We must ask, "What saith the Lord?" rather than "What do I think this means?"

**[ILL]** If you find a single puzzle piece, you cannot force it into the puzzle wherever you choose. You must look at the shape and the surrounding picture to see where the creator of the puzzle intended it to fit. We do not force our meaning into the Bible; we let the Bible fit us into its truth.

### Q8. In giving their prophetic utterances, what did the prophets seek?

“Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you." 1 Peter 1:9, 10.

**Answer:**

The central theme of all prophecy is the **salvation of the soul**.

*   **The Focus:** The prophets were not merely predicting the rise and fall of empires for history's sake; they were tracing the "crimson thread" of redemption. They searched diligently to understand how God would solve the problem of sin.
*   **Grace:** They prophesied of the "grace that should come unto you." This refers to the plan of salvation—God's unmerited favor in giving His Son to die for sinners.
*   **Connection to Us:** The prophets of old longed to understand the very truths that we are privileged to read clearly in the New Testament. We are living in the days they looked forward to with hope.

**[ILL]** Imagine watchmen on a high city wall during a long night of war. They are scanning the horizon, not just to look at the landscape, but diligently searching for the arrival of the King who brings rescue. The prophets were those watchmen, searching for the Messiah.

---

### Q9. By whose spirit were they actuated?

“Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow." 1 Peter 1:11.

**Answer:**

This verse establishes a profound truth: It was the **Spirit of Christ** (the pre-incarnate Jesus working through the Holy Spirit) that inspired the Old Testament prophets.

*   **Christ the Author:** Jesus is the Word of God (John 1:1). He is the Author of the entire Bible. When Isaiah or Jeremiah prophesied, it was the Spirit of Christ speaking through them.
*   **The Two-Fold Message:** The Spirit testified of two great events:
    1.  **The Sufferings of Christ:** His first coming as the Lamb of God to die for our sins (Justification/Atonement).
    2.  **The Glory that should follow:** His second coming as King of Kings and His high priestly ministry (Final Deliverance/Glorification).
*   **Sanctuary Pattern:** This mirrors the sanctuary service—first the sacrifice in the courtyard (sufferings), then the glory of the High Priest's work in the sanctuary.

**[ILL]** If a man writes an autobiography, he knows his own story better than anyone else. The Bible is, in a sense, the autobiography of Christ, dictated to the prophets by His own Spirit before He even came to earth as a man.

### Q10. How did Peter confirm his former preaching on the coming of Christ?

“For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of His majesty." 2 Peter 1:16.

**Answer:**

Peter affirms that the Christian faith is based on historical fact, not mythology ("cunningly devised fables").

*   **Eyewitness Testimony:** The apostles did not invent the idea of Christ's divinity. They saw His miracles; they saw Him raised from the dead; and specifically, Peter refers here to the Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1–5).
*   **The Majesty:** Peter saw a preview of the Kingdom of Glory. He saw Jesus glorified, speaking with Moses and Elijah. This proved that Jesus was indeed the Son of God and that His promise to return in power is true.

---

### Q11. When did the apostle see the majesty (kingship) of Christ, and hear the a probative words of God?

“And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount." 2 Peter 1:18.

**Answer:**

The event took place on the "holy mount" (likely Mt. Tabor or Mt. Hermon) during the Transfiguration.

*   **Divine Confirmation:** Peter heard the literal voice of God the Father saying, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
*   **Significance:** This event anchors our faith in reality. It is not a philosophical theory; it is an event that happened in time and space, witnessed by credible men who were willing to die for what they saw.

**[ILL]** In a court of law, hearsay (rumor) is not admissible. The strongest evidence is a reliable witness who can say, "I was there, I saw it happen, and I heard the voice." Peter is offering sworn testimony to the church.

---

### Q12. What other and more certain evidence did he have of the power and coming of Christ?

“We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts." 2 Peter 1:19.

**Answer:**

This is a startling statement. Peter says that prophecy is "more sure" even than his own eyewitness experience on the mount.

*   **Why "More Sure"?** Our senses can be deceived. We can misinterpret what we see or hear. But the written Word of prophecy, fulfilled over centuries (the rise and fall of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome), stands as an immovable rock. It is objective evidence outside of ourselves.
*   **Light in a Dark Place:** This world is a "dark place" of sin and confusion. Prophecy is the lamp that illuminates our path (Psalm 119:105), showing us where we are in the stream of time.
*   **The Day Star:** The goal of prophecy is not just intellectual knowledge, but that the "Day Star" (Christ) arises *in your hearts*.
    *   **Internal Experience:** As we study the sure word, Christ’s character is formed within us (Galatians 4:19). The external word leads to an internal reality—Christ in you, the hope of glory.

**[ILL]** Imagine being on a ship in a storm at night. Lightning flashes (experiences) give brief, blinding glimpses of the surroundings, but they are gone in an instant. A lighthouse (prophecy) provides a steady, constant beam that guides the ship safely to the harbor. We should trust the steady light of prophecy over the flashes of feeling or experience.

### Q13. To what prophecy did Christ refer His disciples when predicting the destruction of Jerusalem?

“When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth, let him understand)." Matt. 24:15.

**Answer:**

Jesus specifically authenticated the **Book of Daniel**.

*   **The Abomination of Desolation:** Historically, this referred to the Roman armies surrounding Jerusalem (Luke 21:20), which was a sign for Christians to flee.
*   **Dual Application:** In the "time of the end," it also points to the work of the antichrist power (the "little horn" of Daniel 7 and 8) which casts down God's truth and attempts to change His law.
*   **"Let Him Understand":** Christ commands us to study Daniel. He implies that our safety depends on understanding these prophecies. If Jesus studied and quoted Daniel, how much more should we?

**[ILL]** A tornado siren is designed to warn people of approaching danger. If you know what the siren sounds like, you can take shelter and live. Jesus points to the book of Daniel as the siren for the end times.

### Q14. When were all the prophecies in the book of Daniel to be understood?

“But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased." Dan. 12:4.

**Answer:**

Certain portions of Daniel’s prophecies were "sealed" or hidden until a specific period known as the **Time of the End**.

*   **Defined:** *The Time of the End* is a prophetic period beginning in 1798 (at the conclusion of the 1260-year prophecy of Daniel 7:25).
*   **Running To and Fro:** This refers not only to modern travel but primarily to "running to and fro" *through the pages of Scripture*. It describes diligent Bible study.
*   **Knowledge Increased:** Since 1798, the understanding of the prophecies of Daniel—specifically the 2300 days, the sanctuary message, and the investigative judgment—has been opened to the church.
*   **Our Privilege:** We live in the time when the seal has been broken. We can understand what Daniel himself did not fully comprehend. This places upon us the solemn responsibility to share this "sure word of prophecy" with the world before the final harvest.

**[ILL]** A time-lock safe cannot be opened until the clock reaches the set hour. No amount of force or skill can open it early. God placed a "time-lock" on the prophecies of the last days. That time-lock expired at the "time of the end," and now the treasures of Daniel are open for all to see.
