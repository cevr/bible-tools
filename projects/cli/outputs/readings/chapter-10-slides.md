## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Delight

- Question: In what does the Lord delight?
- Key Text: Micah 7:18 – “Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (God’s Character)

- **The Uniqueness of God**
  - Heathen gods were often depicted as angry and needing appeasement.
  - The God of the Bible actively seeks to pardon and lift the burden of sin.
- **Pardoning Iniquity (Sanctuary Connection)**
  - In the sanctuary, the priest bore the iniquity, foreshadowing Christ bearing our sins.
  - 1 Peter 2:24 – “Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (The Remnant & Mercy)

- **The Remnant**
  - Refers to the faithful end-time group described in Revelation.
  - Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”
  - Even their acceptance is based on God’s pardoning mercy, not inherent merit.
- **Mercy vs. Anger**
  - God’s anger is His “strange work” (Isaiah 28:21).
  - His “delight”—His natural preference and joy—is mercy.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Judge and the Son**
  - A judge must uphold the law against a criminal who is his own estranged son.
  - He hates the crime but loves the son.
  - After pronouncing the just sentence, he steps down, removes his robe, and pays the full penalty himself.
  - **Lesson:** God delights not in the sentence of condemnation, but in the restoration of the sinner.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Daily Mercy

- Question: How is His mercy continually manifested?
- Key Text: Lamentations 3:22, 23 – “It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **Protection from Destruction**
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
  - We are alive because God holds back the results of sin to give time for repentance.
- **Daily Renewal**
  - Like manna (Exodus 16:21), grace must be gathered fresh every morning.
  - We need **daily consecration** to live victoriously.
- **Unfailing Compassion**
  - 2 Timothy 2:13 – “If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Morning Sun**
  - The sun rises every morning to dispel darkness, regardless of crimes committed during the night.
  - It does not ask permission to shine; it simply gives light.
  - **Lesson:** God’s mercy rises upon us each day, offering a fresh start and power to walk in the light.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Universal Mercy

- Question: Is His mercy limited to any special class?
- Key Text: Acts 17:25 – “Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.”
- Key Text: Matthew 5:45 – “That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **Universal Benevolence**
  - “Common grace” (sun and rain) is given to all to lead them to repentance.
  - Romans 2:4 – “Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”
- **The Standard for Believers**
  - If God blesses the unjust, we cannot limit our kindness only to our own “class.”
  - We must reflect the character of our Father.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Human Response

- Question: How has mankind repaid Him for His love in creating them and giving them all things to enjoy?
- Key Text: Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Sin & Glory)

- **The Universal Condition**
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **Defining Sin**
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **Coming Short of the Glory**
  - “Glory” refers to God’s character (Exodus 34:6–7).
  - We fail to reflect His self-sacrificing love; the image of God in man is marred.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Total Corruption)

- **The Spiritual Condition**
  - Isaiah 1:6 – “From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.”
  - Sin is a leprosy the sinner cannot cure himself.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Anchor Chain**
  - If a chain holds a ship to an anchor, it does not matter if one link breaks or ten links break.
  - Once the connection is severed, the ship drifts.
  - **Lesson:** Humanity has broken the chain of obedience; we have drifted "short" of the harbor of God’s glory.

## Slide 14 – Q5: God’s Initiative

- Question: While all men were in this condition, how did God still further show His love to them?
- Key Text: John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
- Key Text: Romans 5:8 – “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Initiative of God**
  - God acted “while we were yet sinners,” not waiting for us to become righteous.
- **The Cost and Purpose**
  - **Atonement:** Reconciliation through Christ’s sacrifice and priestly ministry.
  - Without this gift, the result of sin is to “perish” (eternal death).
- **The Great Exchange**
  - We give Him our sins; He gives us His righteousness.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Father and The Son

- Question: Is there any difference between the love of the Father and that of the son?
- Key Text: John 10:30 – “I and my Father are one.”
- Key Text: John 14:11 – “Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **Perfect Unity**
  - The Bible rejects the idea of an angry Father needing a gentle Son to appease Him.
  - The Father *sent* the Son; their love is identical.
- **God in Christ**
  - 2 Corinthians 5:19 – “To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.”
  - Seeing Jesus (compassion for lepers, forgiveness of the thief) is seeing the Father.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **Sunlight and Heat**
  - A ray of light and the heat from the sun are distinct, yet originate from the same source.
  - You cannot have the sun’s warmth without its light.
  - **Lesson:** The Father and Son work together perfectly to bring life to the earth; they are one in nature and purpose.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Adoption

- Question: Into what relationship to God does His love bring us, if we accept it?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:1 – “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **Adoption (Justification)**
  - A change of legal status: from rebels to sons and daughters.
  - We are treated as if we had never sinned.
- **Alienation from the World**
  - The world operates on selfishness and force; God’s children operate on love.
  - Being misunderstood by the world is a sign of true conversion.

## Slide 21 – Q8: Evidence of Sonship

- Question: What is given us to show that we are sons?
- Key Text: Romans 8:14-16 – “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God... ye have received the Spirit of adoption... The Spirit itself beareth witness with out spirit, that we are the children of God.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **Led by the Spirit**
  - Ezekiel 36:27 – “And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.”
  - Being "led" implies movement away from sin and into obedience.
- **Spirit of Adoption vs. Bondage**
  - **Bondage:** Serving God out of fear (legalism).
  - **Adoption:** Obeying the Father out of love.
- **Sanctification:** The imparting of Christ’s character to make us obedient from the heart.

## Slide 23 – Q9: The New Heart

- Question: What does the Holy Spirit beget in the hearts of those who receive it?
- Key Text: Romans 5:5 – “And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points (New Covenant)

- **Love and the Law**
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”
  - Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.”
  - When the Spirit sheds love abroad in the heart, He is writing the law there.
- **A Supernatural Gift**
  - This love is not human affection; it is the divine nature implanted in humanity.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Canal and the River**
  - A dry canal cannot water fields by trying harder.
  - If a river is diverted into the canal, water flows naturally bringing life.
  - **Lesson:** Our hearts are the canal; the Holy Spirit is the river. When He fills us, love flows out naturally.

## Slide 26 – Q10: The Effect of Love

- Question: If the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, what effect will it have?
- Key Text: 1 John 4:11 – “Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points

- **The Inevitable Result**
  - Divine love cannot be contained; it must flow out to others.
- **The Test of Profession**
  - 1 John 4:20 – “If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?”
- **Horizontal and Vertical**
  - True Righteousness by Faith restores both love to God (vertical) and love to man (horizontal).

## Slide 28 – Q11: The Measure of Love

- Question: How much must we love one another?
- Key Text: John 15:12 – “This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.”
- Key Text: 1 John 3:16 – “Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Standard:** “As I have loved you.”
- **Laying Down Life**
  - Means dying to self daily.
  - 1 Corinthians 15:31 – “I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.”
  - We sacrifice time, convenience, and pride for others.
- **The Fruit of the Gospel**
  - This obedience is impossible for the natural man, but natural to the Spirit-filled man.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Walking in Love

- Question: What exhortation is based upon Christ's love for us?
- Key Text: Ephesians 5:2 – “And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.”

## Slide 31 – Q12: Key Points (Sanctuary Imagery)

- **Sweetsmelling Savour**
  - Leviticus 1:9 – “...and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.”
  - Represents a life fully consumed and dedicated to God.
- **Imitation of Christ**
  - We are called to enter the fellowship of His sufferings.
  - Self-denial for the good of others is a “sweet savor” to God.

## Slide 32 – Q13: Loving Enemies

- Question: If we have the love of God, will we love only those who love us?
- Key Text: Matthew 5:44 – “But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Distinctive Mark**
  - Loving family is natural; loving an enemy is supernatural.
  - It is the definitive proof that God is living in the heart.
- **Active Love**
  - Not just a feeling, but active verbs: *Bless, Do Good, Pray*.
- **Perfection of Character**
  - Matthew 5:48 calls us to be “perfect” like the Father.
  - Contextually, this means loving impartially, just as God gives rain to the just and unjust.

## Slide 34 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Sandalwood Tree**
  - A sandalwood tree perfumes the very axe that chops it down.
  - **Lesson:** This is the nature of Christ’s love—forgiveness and grace extended even to those who harm us.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Not by Works

- Question: Did God love us because of any good that we had done?
- Key Text: Titus 3:5 – “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us...”
- Key Text: Ephesians 2:4-5 – “But God... for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points

- **Not By Works**
  - Ephesians 2:10 – “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works...”
  - Works are the *result* of salvation, not the *cause*.
- **Washing of Regeneration**
  - “Regeneration” means being born again.
  - Ephesians 5:26 – “That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.”
- **Dead in Sins**
  - A dead man cannot save himself; God “quickened” (made alive) us.

## Slide 37 – Q15: Motivation

- Question: What alone should prompt all our acts?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 5:14 – “For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead.”

## Slide 38 – Q15: Key Points

- **Constraining Love**
  - Obedience is not driven by fear of hell, but by the “constraining” (gripping) love of Christ.
- **The Logic of the Cross**
  - 2 Corinthians 5:15 – “And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.”
  - We owe our lives to Him; therefore, we live for Him.
- **True Service**
  - Any service not springing from love is legalism.

## Slide 39 – Q16: Discipline

- Question: In what other way is God's love manifested to His people?
- Key Text: Revelation 3:19 – “As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.”
- Key Text: Hebrews 12:6 – “For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.”

## Slide 40 – Q16: Key Points

  - A loving father corrects his child to save him from ruin.
- **The Purpose**
  - Hebrews 12:10 – “...but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.”
  - Trials refine character and remove the dross of selfishness.

## Slide 41 – Q16: Illustration

- **The Sculptor**
  - A sculptor strikes the marble hard with a chisel.
  - He does not do this to destroy the stone, but to remove rough edges so the beautiful image is revealed.
  - **Lesson:** God is the sculptor; we are the marble.

## Slide 42 – Q17: Confidence

- Question: What may we confidently expect, from the fact that God so loved us as to give Christ to die for us?
- Key Text: Romans 8:32 – “He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?”

## Slide 43 – Q17: Key Points

- **Argument from Greater to Lesser**
  - If God gave the greatest gift (His Son), He will surely give the smaller gifts we need.
- **"All Things"**
  - 2 Peter 1:3 – “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”
  - We have every resource needed for victory over sin.

## Slide 44 – Q18: Turning the Curse

- Question: What is God's love for His children able to do when enemies rise up against them?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 23:5 – “Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.”

- **Curse into Blessing**
  - Genesis 50:20 – “But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.”
  - The Cross was the greatest evil, yet God turned it into the greatest blessing.
- **Security:** We are safe “because the Lord thy God loved thee.”

## Slide 46 – Q19: Trust

- Question: If we appreciate this loving kindness, what will we do?
- Key Text: Psalms 36:7 – “How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.”

## Slide 47 – Q19: Key Points

- **Trust (Faith)**
  - The natural response to love is faith (taking God at His word).
- **Shadow of Thy Wings**
  - Suggests sanctuary imagery (cherubim over the mercy seat) and nature (protection).
  - When we know God loves us, we run *to* Him (refuge), not *away* from Him.

## Slide 48 – Q20: Everlasting Love

- Question: How enduring is God's love to us?
- Key Text: Jeremiah 31:3 – “The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.”

## Slide 49 – Q20: Key Points

- **Everlasting Love**
  - God’s love is an eternal principle, not a temporary emotion.
- **Drawing Power**
  - We do not initiate; He draws us.
- **Perseverance**
  - Even when we fail, His love remains to draw us back.

## Slide 50 – Q21: Security in Christ

- Question: Can anything turn aside the love of God for those who trust Him?
- Key Text: Romans 8:38, 39 – “For I am persuaded, that neither death... nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

## Slide 51 – Q21: Key Points

  - No external power (political, spiritual, or physical) can sever the bond.
- **The Condition**
  - The promise is for those “in Christ Jesus.”
- **Personal Choice**
  - Isaiah 59:2 – “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God...”
  - We can choose to leave, but no enemy can pluck us from His hand (John 10:28).

## Slide 52 – Q22: Eternal Praise

- Question: Unto whom will the saints of God ascribe universal praise both here and in eternity?
- Key Text: Revelation 1:5 – “...Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.”

## Slide 53 – Q22: Key Points (Salvation Complete)

- **The Center of Praise**
  - Praise is not for our achievements, but for His love and blood.
- **Washed from Sins**
  - Includes both **Justification** (forgiveness) and **Sanctification** (cleansing).
  - Hebrews 9:14 – “How much more shall the blood of Christ... purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?”
- **Motivation for Eternity:** We love Him because He first loved us.

## Slide 54 – Q22: Illustration

- **The Rescue**
  - A man rescued from a burning building does not brag about how he climbed down the ladder.
  - He points to the firefighter who carried him out through the flames.
  - **Lesson:** In heaven, we will point only to the Lamb of God.
