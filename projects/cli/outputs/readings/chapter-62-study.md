### Q1. What promise is made to those who look for the appearing of Christ?

“So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look
for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation." Heb. 9:28.

**Answer:**

The promise is a complete and final **salvation**—a deliverance from the very
presence of sin and from this dying world.

- **"Once offered to bear the sins":** At His first coming, Christ appeared as
  the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29). He came to the outer court of this earth to
  offer Himself as a sacrifice. He bore our sins in His own body on the tree (1
  Peter 2:24). This was the work of **Justification**—providing the legal right
  for sinners to be forgiven.
- **"Without sin":** When He returns, He does not come as a sin-bearer to make
  another atonement. His work as High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary will be
  finished. He comes as a conquering King to claim His people.
- **"Unto them that look for Him":** This implies an active state of
  preparation, not merely a passive waiting. To "look" for Him means to live
  with the eye of faith fixed on Jesus, allowing Him to do His work of
  **Sanctification** in our hearts today.

**The Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary service, the people
waited outside while the High Priest went into the Most Holy Place on the Day of
Atonement. They anxiously "looked for" his return, for when he came out, the
work of cleansing was done, and their sins were symbolically banished (Leviticus
16). Just so, Christ is currently in the heavenly Most Holy Place. When He
finishes His work of judgment, He will step out to bless His waiting people.

> **Definition:** **Justification:** The legal act where God declares a
> repentant sinner righteous because of Christ’s sacrifice (Romans 3:24).
> **Sanctification:** The process where the Holy Spirit transforms the
> believer’s character to be like Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

[ILL] Imagine a family waiting for a father to return from a long war. They do
not forget him; they keep his picture on the mantle, they talk of him daily, and
they keep the house ready for his arrival. This is how the believer "looks" for
Jesus—by keeping the heartswept and garnished by grace, ready to welcome the
King.

### Q2. How many will receive a reward when He comes?

“For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and
then He shall reward every man according to his works." Matt. 16:27.

**Answer:**

**Every man**—without exception—will receive a reward. There are only two
classes: those who receive the reward of eternal life, and those who receive the
wages of sin.

- **According to his works:** This verse is often misunderstood. We are not
  saved _by_ our works (Ephesians 2:8-9), but we are judged _by_ them. Why?
  Because works are the infallible evidence of faith.
  - If Christ dwells in the heart by faith, the life will naturally produce
    "good fruit" (Matthew 7:17).
  - A profession of faith without obedience is dead (James 2:26).
- **The Investigative Judgment:** Before Christ returns to give these rewards,
  there must be an examination of the records in heaven to determine who has
  retained the "robe of righteousness" and who has cast it aside. When He comes,
  His reward is _with_ Him (Revelation 22:12), meaning the decision has already
  been made.

**Righteousness by Faith:** True righteousness is not a human modification of
behavior; it is the life of Christ implanted in the believer. When God judges us
"according to works," He is looking to see if the works flow from a heart
renewed by His Spirit. He crowns His own grace in us.

[ILL] A fruit tree is not an apple tree _because_ it bears apples; it bears
apples because it _is_ an apple tree. The fruit is the proof of the tree’s
nature. At the harvest, the farmer rewards the tree based on the fruit. So God
looks at our works as the evidence of whether we are truly grafted into the
Vine, Christ Jesus (John 15:5).

### Q3. Did the disciples think that death would be the second coming of Christ?

“Peter seeing him [John] saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus
saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
follow thou Me. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, he shall not die; but, If
I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?" John 21:21-23.

**Answer:**

No, the disciples clearly understood that death and the Second Coming were two
entirely different events.

- **The Misunderstanding:** The disciples thought Jesus meant John would _never_
  die but would live until the Second Advent.
- **The Distinction:** Jesus contrasted "dying" with "tarrying till I come." If
  death were the same as the Second Coming, Jesus’ words would make no sense.
- **The Biblical Truth:** The Bible consistently teaches that death is a "sleep"
  (John 11:11-14). The dead do not immediately go to heaven to receive their
  reward; they rest in the grave until the resurrection at the last day (John
  6:40).

**Theological Point:** If the righteous went straight to heaven at death, there
would be no need for a general resurrection or a Second Coming to "receive"
them. The glory of the Advent is that it breaks the bands of death.

---

### Q4. If death is not the coming of Christ, how will He come?

“And when He had spoken these things, while they beheld, He was taken up; and a
cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked steadfastly toward
heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also
said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus
which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have
seen Him go into heaven." Acts 1:9-11 (Rev. 14:14).

**Answer:**

He will come **in like manner** as He went. The ascension sets the pattern for
the return.

1.  **Personal:** It will be "this same Jesus"—not a spirit, not a metaphor, but
    the Savior with the nail prints in His hands (Zechariah 13:6).
2.  **Visible:** They "beheld" Him and "looked steadfastly." It was not a secret
    disappearance.
3.  **Physical:** He was taken up bodily.
4.  **With Clouds:** A cloud received Him; He returns with clouds (Rev 1:7).

**Righteousness by Faith Application:** Because it is "this same Jesus"
returning—the One who loved us and gave Himself for us—we need not fear the
judgment if we are abiding in Him. The Judge is our Friend and Savior.

[ILL] If a friend leaves your house by walking out the front door and down the
driveway, and promises to return "in like manner," you do not expect him to
manifest as a ghost in the attic or send a text message. You expect to see him
walk up the driveway and through the door. Jesus returns physically and visibly.

---

### Q5. How many will behold Him when He comes?

“Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which
pierced Him." Rev. 1:7.

**Answer:**

**Every eye shall see Him.**

- **Universal Visibility:** The Second Coming is not a secret event known only
  to the faithful. It is the most public event in human history. The wicked and
  the righteous alike will witness it (Matthew 24:30).
- **"They also which pierced Him":** This refers to a special resurrection of
  those who were instrumental in Christ's suffering and the persecution of His
  truth, raised to witness His glorification (Daniel 12:2; Matthew 26:64).

---

### Q6. What wonderful demonstration will accompany the Lord's coming?

“The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel, and with the trump of God." 1 Thess. 4:16.

**Answer:**

The Coming will be accompanied by overwhelming sound and authority. It includes:

1.  **A Shout:** The command of the King of Kings.
2.  **The Voice of the Archangel:** Michael (Christ) asserting dominion over
    death.
3.  **The Trump of God:** This trumpet wakes the dead.

This dispels the theory of a "secret rapture." A shout, a voice, and a trumpet
are the loudest things described in Scripture. It is a wake-up call to the
nations and to the sleeping saints.

> **Definition:** **Archangel:** The "chief messenger" or commander of the
> angels. In Scripture, this title is associated with Michael (Jude 9), who is
> identified as the pre-incarnate Christ in His role as protector of His people
> (Daniel 12:1).

---

### Q7. What will then take place?

“We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the
twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the
dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed." 1 Cor. 15:51, 52.
(1 Thess. 4:16-17).

**Answer:**

Two miraculous events occur simultaneously:

1.  **Resurrection:** The righteous dead are raised with "incorruptible" bodies.
    They are no longer subject to disease, aging, or death.
2.  **Translation:** The righteous living are "changed." Their mortal bodies are
    instantly transformed into immortal bodies without tasting death.

**A Crucial Doctrine:** This passage proves that humans do not possess natural
immortality. We must be _changed_ to become immortal. Immortality is a gift
brought by Christ at His coming (2 Timothy 1:10), not something we possess from
birth.

**Sanctification of the Body:** While our characters must be purified by grace
_before_ He comes, our physical bodies are glorified _when_ He comes
(Philippians 3:21).

---

### Q8. Have not the martyrs of old gone to their reward?

“And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the
promise, God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us
should not be made perfect." Heb. 11:39, 40.

**Answer:**

No, they have not yet received the final reward.

- **"Received not the promise":** Though they are saved by faith, they are
  currently sleeping in the grave.
- **"They without us should not be made perfect":** God's plan is for the entire
  family of the redeemed—from Adam to the last believer—to be gathered home
  _together_.
- This highlights the communal nature of salvation. Paul, David, and the martyrs
  are waiting for _us_. We will all enter the pearly gates at the same time.

[ILL] Consider a graduation ceremony. Students may finish their exams at
different times during the week, but they do not receive their diplomas until
the ceremony where the whole class gathers. So it is with the saints; they sleep
in peace until the Grand Graduation Day at the resurrection.

---

### Q9. When were the disciples to be recompensed?

“For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just." Luke 14:14.

**Answer:**

The reward is given **at the resurrection of the just.**

Jesus places the timing of the reward at the resurrection, not at the moment of
death. This confirms the teaching that between death and the resurrection, the
dead are asleep, awaiting the call of the Life-giver.

---

### Q10. How is this to be brought about?

“If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto
Myself." John 14:3.

**Answer:**

It is brought about by the personal return of Jesus to **receive** His people.

- **"Receive you unto Myself":** This is the language of a marriage. Christ is
  the Bridegroom coming to claim His bride (the Church).
- **The Preparation:** He is preparing a place (the New Jerusalem). We must
  allow Him to prepare _us_ for that place.

**Righteousness by Faith:** Heaven is a place of perfect holiness. Unless we
have the character of Christ (the law written on the heart), we would not be
happy there. We are fitted for heaven by the imparted righteousness of Christ
now, so that we are at home with Him then.

---

### Q11. What was Enoch's belief about this event?

“And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the
Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment upon all." Jude
14-15.

**Answer:**

Enoch, one of the earliest prophets, believed:

1.  The Lord is coming with **myriads of holy ones** (angels, see Matt 25:31).
2.  The purpose is to **execute judgment**.

**Executive vs. Investigative Judgment:** The _investigative_ judgment happens
in heaven before He comes (Daniel 7:9-10). When He returns, He executes that
judgment—saving the righteous and separating the ungodly.

---

### Q12. What was Job's hope when in the depths of affliction?

“For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day
upon the earth, And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
flesh shall I see God; whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold,
and not another." Job 19:25-27.

**Answer:**

Job’s hope was in a literal, bodily resurrection.

- **"In my flesh shall I see God":** Job understood that even though his body
  would decompose ("worms destroy this body"), God would recreate him. He did
  not expect to see God as a disembodied spirit, but in restored flesh.
- **"My Redeemer liveth":** The resurrection is guaranteed because our Redeemer
  lives. Because He conquered the grave, we shall live also (John 14:19).

---

### Q13. How did David express himself on this point?

“For He cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth; He shall judge the world with
righteousness, and the people with His truth." Ps. 96:13.

**Answer:**

David rejoiced that the Lord comes to **judge**.

- For the believer who is covered in the righteousness of Christ, judgment is
  good news. It means vindication, deliverance from oppression, and the setting
  right of all wrongs.
- **"With His truth":** God's law is the standard of truth. The judgment reveals
  that God’s law was holy, just, and good, and that His government is based on
  love.

---

### Q14. Did Daniel teach this same sentiment?

“And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for
the children of thy people;... and at that time thy people shall be delivered
everyone that shall be found written in the book." Dan. 12:1.

**Answer:**

Yes. Daniel connects the "standing up" of Michael with the **deliverance** of
God’s people.

- **"Michael stand up":** In the language of courts, a judge sits to hear a case
  and stands up to render the verdict. This signifies the close of human
  probation. The intercessory work in the sanctuary ceases.
- **"Written in the book":** Only those who have their names retained in the
  Lamb’s Book of Life—those who have overcome sin by the blood of the Lamb (Rev
  3:5; 12:11)—will be delivered.

**Practical Application:** Now is the time, while the High Priest is seated, to
ensure our names are in that book through repentance and surrendering our will
to God.

### Q15. In what splendor will the Saviour come?

“For whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of My words, of him shall the Son of
man be ashamed, when He shall come in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of
the holy angels." Luke 9:26.

**Answer:**

He comes in a threefold glory:

1.  **His own glory** (as the Conqueror of sin and death).
2.  **His Father’s glory** (the infinite majesty of the Godhead).
3.  **The glory of the holy angels** (countless millions of shining beings).

This glory is a "consuming fire" to sin (Hebrews 12:29). Therefore, only those
who have been purified by grace and possess the righteousness of faith can
endure the brightness of His coming. To the wicked, this glory is terrifying; to
the righteous, it is the light of home.

---

### Q16. When Christ, at the transfiguration, represented His future glory, how did He appear?

“And was transfigured before them; and His face did shine as the sun, and His
raiment was white as the light." Matt 17:2.

**Answer:**

He appeared as a being of light.

- **Face as the sun:** Radiating divine energy and purity.
- **Raiment white as light:** Symbolizing the perfect righteousness that clothes
  Him and His people.

The Transfiguration was a miniature representation of the Kingdom of Glory.

---

### Q17. What is the appearance of an angel?

“His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning,
and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to
polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude." Dan.
10:6.

**Answer:**

A single angel appears with terrifying majesty—like lightning and fire.

- If one angel caused the Roman guards at the tomb to fall as dead men (Matthew
  28:2-4), imagine the scene when _all_ the holy angels accompany Christ!
- This emphasizes why we need a Savior to stand before such power.

---

### Q18. What is the appearance of the glory of God Himself?

“And from the appearance of His loins even downward, I saw as it were the
appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. As the appearance of the
bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the
brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of
the Lord." Eze. 1:27, 28.

**Answer:**

Ezekiel describes God’s glory as **fire** and **brightness**, surrounded by a
**rainbow**.

- **The Fire:** Represents God's holiness and His reaction to sin (Deuteronomy
  4:24).
- **The Rainbow:** Represents God's covenant of mercy and grace (Genesis 9:13;
  Revelation 4:3).

**The Gospel in the Glory:** Even in the overwhelming brightness of His justice
(fire), the rainbow of promise encircles the throne. For the believer, God is
both Just and the Justifier (Romans 3:26).

---

### Q19. For what was Paul waiting when in his Roman dungeon?

“Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all
them also that love His appearing." 2 Tim. 4:8.

**Answer:**

Paul was waiting for the **crown of righteousness**.

- Note that Paul did not expect the crown at the moment of his beheading, but
  "at that day"—the day of Christ’s appearing.
- **Loving His appearing:** Those who love sin are afraid of His appearing.
  Those who love righteousness long for it.
- **The Crown:** It is called a crown of _righteousness_ because it is given to
  those who have allowed Christ to work His righteousness in them. It is the
  crown of a victor who has overcome the world through faith (1 John 5:4).

---

### Q20. How will the Saviour be seen of those who are finally permitted to behold Him?

“But we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see
Him as He is." 1 John 3:2.

**Answer:**

The saved will see Him **as He is** because they will be **like Him**.

- **Moral Likeness:** Before He comes, we must be like Him in character—loving,
  pure, and obedient to the Father. This is the work of sanctification.
- **Physical Likeness:** When He comes, our vile bodies are changed to be like
  His glorious body.
- Only the pure in heart shall see God (Matthew 5:8). The beholding of Christ
  transforms us (2 Corinthians 3:18).

---

### Q21. What description does the beloved John give of His appearance?

“His eyes were as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass, as if they
burned in a furnace; and His voice as the sound of many waters... And His
countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength." Rev. 1:14-16.

**Answer:**

John describes the glorified Christ in terms of power and judgment:

- **Eyes of fire:** Nothing is hidden from Him. He sees the secrets of the
  heart.
- **Feet of brass:** Strength and stability.
- **Voice of many waters:** Overwhelming authority.
- **Countenance as the sun:** Unapproachable light.

This is not the "lowly Nazarene" in weakness, but the King of Kings.

---

### Q22. When He shall have gathered together His elect (Matt. 24:31), if we are among them, what shall we hear from the Saviour?

"Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of My
Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."
Matt. 25:34.

**Answer:**

The sweetest words ever spoken: **"Come, ye blessed... inherit the kingdom."**

- **"Blessed of My Father":** We are accepted in the Beloved.
- **"Inherit":** We are children of the King, joint-heirs with Christ (Romans
  8:17).
- **"Prepared for you":** God never intended for man to die. The plan of
  salvation restores what Adam lost—the kingdom of peace, face-to-face communion
  with God, and a life of eternal development.

**Appeal:** To hear these words then, we must hear His voice now saying, "Come
unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden" (Matthew 11:28). If we come to
Him now for grace, we shall come to Him then for glory.

[ILL] When a ship has been tossed by storms for weeks, risking destruction in
the dark waves, nothing is sweeter to the captain and crew than the sight of the
harbor lights and the call of the pilot to guide them in. This world is the
storm-tossed sea. Christ is the Pilot. The Second Coming is the entrance to the
harbor of eternal peace. Let us be ready for that day.
