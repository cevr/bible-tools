### Q1. Who made the Sabbath and gave it to mankind?

“In six days the Lord made the heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and
hallowed it.” Exodus 20:11.

**Answer:** The Sabbath is not a human invention, a church ordinance, or a
legislative decree. It is the direct creation of God Himself, established at the
very foundation of the world.

1.  **The Authority of the Creator:** The Sabbath derives its authority solely
    from the Creator. Since “without him was not any thing made that was made”
    (John 1:3), Christ Himself is the Author of the Sabbath. It stands as a
    memorial of His finished work of creation.
2.  **A Finished Work:** God rested not because He was tired (Isaiah 40:28), but
    because His work was perfect and complete. This parallels the Gospel: just
    as Adam entered into God’s finished work of creation on the seventh day, the
    believer enters into Christ’s finished work of redemption by faith (Hebrews
    4:10).
3.  **Universal Gift:** The text says He made it at Creation, long before the
    existence of the Jewish nation. Jesus confirmed this when He said, “The
    sabbath was made for man” (Mark 2:27)—meaning all mankind, not merely for
    one ethnicity.

**Key Term Definition:**

- **Hallowed:** To make holy, sanctify, or set apart for sacred use. Only God
  has the power to make a segment of time holy.

**[ILL] The Architect’s Seal:** If a great architect designs a building, he
places his seal or signature upon the cornerstone to identify the builder. The
Sabbath is God’s seal in the very heart of His law. No city council or state
government has the authority to remove the Architect’s seal and replace it with
their own, any more than a painter has the right to sign his name to another
artist’s masterpiece.

### Q2. To whom does the Sabbath belong?

“The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” Exodus 20:10.

**Answer:** The Bible leaves no doubt regarding the ownership of the Sabbath. It
is God’s exclusive property.

1.  **The Lord’s Day:** God calls the Sabbath “my holy day” (Isaiah 58:13).
    Therefore, the Sabbath is the true “Lord’s Day” of Scripture (Revelation
    1:10).
2.  **Not Human Property:** Because the Sabbath belongs to God, human beings
    have no right to alter it, sell it, or legislate it according to their own
    convenience. We are stewards of God’s time, not owners of it.
3.  **Sanctuary Truth:** This commandment sat inside the Ark of the Covenant in
    the Most Holy Place, under the visible presence of God (the Shekinah glory).
    This signifies that the Sabbath is central to God’s government and rule.

**[ILL] The Tithe of Time:** Just as the tithe (one-tenth of our income) belongs
to the Lord and is holy to Him (Leviticus 27:30), the Sabbath is the tithe of
our time—one-seventh of our week. If a man takes money from his employer’s
register, he is a thief. Similarly, to take the hours of the Sabbath for common
work or for a day of human choosing is to rob God of what is His own.

### Q3. To whom, then, should its observance be rendered?

“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
God's.” Mark 12:17.

**Answer:** Christ here establishes the fundamental principle of the separation
of church and state (civil and religious jurisdiction).

1.  **Two Distinct Kingdoms:**
    - **Caesar (The State):** Has jurisdiction over civil matters—property,
      taxes, interactions between citizens, and maintaining public order (Romans
      13:1–7).
    - **God (The Spirit):** Has jurisdiction over the heart, the conscience,
      worship, and faith.
2.  **The Limit of Civil Power:** The state has a right to demand our taxes
    ("tribute") and our civil obedience. However, the Sabbath belongs to God
    (see Q2). Therefore, to render Sabbath observance to Caesar (by keeping it
    merely because the law demands it) is to give Caesar what belongs to God.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** True obedience must spring from love and faith,
    “for whatsoever is not of faith is sin” (Romans 14:23). A government can
    force a man to be idle, but it cannot force a man to be holy. Forced rest is
    not Sabbath-keeping; it is merely idleness.

**Key Term Definition:**

- **Render:** To give back, pay, or perform what is due or owed. We owe taxes to
  the government; we owe worship and our undivided heart to God.

**[ILL] The Coin and the Image:** In the verse quoted, Jesus asked whose image
was on the coin. They said, "Caesar's." The coin bore Caesar's image, so it
belonged to him. But man bears _God’s_ image (Genesis 1:27). Therefore, our
entire being—our conscience and worship—belongs to God alone, not to the state.

### Q4. In religious matters, to whom alone are we accountable for our words and actions?

“So then everyone of us shall give account of himself to God.” Rom. 14:12.

**Answer:** This verse strikes at the root of all religious legislation.
Individual accountability to God precludes the right of the state to dictate
religious duty.

1.  **Individual Judgment:** The Investigative Judgment is a personal
    transaction between the soul and God. No magistrate, king, or president can
    stand in our place at the judgment bar of God. Since the state cannot answer
    for our sins, it has no authority to dictate our religion.
2.  **The Conscience:** God has created the mind free. The conscience is the
    holy ground where the Holy Spirit meets the individual. When the state steps
    between the conscience and God, it usurps the place of the Holy Spirit.
3.  **Liberty in the Gospel:** The Gospel invites, it does not compel by force
    (Revelation 22:17). “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty” (2
    Corinthians 3:17).

**Key Term Definition:**

- **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly
  sanctuary where the lives of professed believers are reviewed before the
  universe, determining who is fit for the kingdom (Daniel 7:9–10; 2 Corinthians
  5:10).

**[ILL] The Proxy:** If you commit a crime, you cannot send a friend to serve
your prison sentence. You must answer for yourself. In the same way, because the
government cannot take your punishment in the final judgment, the government has
no right to dictate your worship now.

### Q5. How does God show the holiness of the Sabbath day?

“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” Exodus 20:8. "The seventh day is
the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation." Leviticus 23:3.

**Answer:** The Sabbath is not a civil institution for physical relaxation
alone; it is a spiritual institution for holiness.

1.  **Nature of the Day:** The text calls it a "holy convocation" (a sacred
    assembly). It involves worship, the study of God's Word, and communion with
    the Creator.
2.  **The Argument:**
    - The Sabbath is holy.
    - To keep it properly requires a holy heart (sanctification).
    - The state is a secular power; it cannot generate holiness.
    - Therefore, any law regulating the Sabbath is a religious law, outside the
      state's province.
3.  **Sanctification Connection:** To "keep" the Sabbath holy, one must _be_
    holy. A man cannot keep what he does not have. Only through the indwelling
    of Christ (Justification and Sanctification) can a believer truly keep the
    Sabbath. A state law forces the unregenerate man to act hypocritically.

**Key Term Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The process by which God cleanses the believer’s nature
  and imparts His own righteousness, making the believer holy in character (1
  Thessalonians 4:3).

### Q6. So then, what is the true nature of all Sabbath legislation?

**Answer:** It is religious legislation.

1.  **Defining the Act:** Since the Sabbath (or Sunday, often called the
    "Christian Sabbath") is a religious institution, any law commanding its
    observance is a law enforcing a religious dogma.
2.  **The Violation:** Such legislation violates the first table of the
    Decalogue (man's duty to God). Civil government was ordained to enforce the
    second table (man's duty to man—protecting life and property).
3.  **A Counterfeit:** True Sabbath-keeping is an act of love and loyalty to the
    Creator (John 14:15). Legislated Sabbath-keeping (or Sunday-keeping) is an
    act of submission to the state. It substitutes the fear of the magistrate
    for the fear of God.

**[ILL] The Baptism Law:** If the government passed a law requiring every
citizen to be baptized, everyone would immediately recognize it as a violation
of religious liberty and a union of church and state. Yet, baptism is a
religious ordinance, just as the Sabbath is a religious ordinance. Legislating
one is as illegitimate as legislating the other.

### Q7. Religious legislation unites church with state. What has generally been the result of enacting religious legislation?

**Answer:** Religious intolerance and persecution.

1.  **The Lesson of History:** Whenever the church has used the power of the
    state to enforce her dogmas, the result has been the persecution of
    dissenters. This was true of pagan Rome, papal Rome during the Dark Ages,
    and various state-churches since.
2.  **The Spirit of the Dragon:** Revelation 12 and 13 reveal that the spirit of
    force is the spirit of the dragon (Satan). Christ’s kingdom is not of this
    world and does not use the sword (John 18:36).
3.  **The Great Controversy:** The central issue is _force_ versus _love_. Satan
    alleges that God's law is a burden and must be forced; God demonstrates that
    His law is love, written on the heart by the Spirit (Hebrews 8:10).
    Religious legislation aligns with Satan’s method of government.

**Key Term Definition:**

- **Persecution:** The infliction of pain, penalty, or suffering for adherence
  to a particular religious belief or opinion.

### Q8. What was the first Sunday law in history?

**Answer:** Constantine’s Sunday law of March 7, 321 A.D.

**Historical Context:** Constantine the Great, a Roman Emperor, sought to unite
his empire, which was divided between pagans (who worshipped the sun) and
Christians. He created a compromise by elevating the "Day of the Sun."

- **The Edict:** _"On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and
  people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed..."_
- **The Nature of the Law:** Notice the text calls it the "Day of the Sun"
  (_venerabili die Solis_), not the Sabbath of the Lord. It was a heathen
  festival baptized into the church to make Christianity more palatable to
  pagans.
- **The Result:** This opened the door for a flood of compromise, eventually
  leading to the establishment of the Papacy and the suppression of the biblical
  Sabbath.

### Q9. What church council required Sunday observance and forbade Sabbath observance?

**Answer:** The Council of Laodicea (circa A.D. 364).

**The Decree:** Christians were commanded to keep Sunday, and if they persisted
in resting on the Sabbath (Saturday), _"they shall be shut out from Christ"_
(anathema).

1.  **The "Little Horn" Power:** This fulfilled the prophecy of Daniel 7:25,
    which warned that a power would arise out of Rome thinking "to change times
    and laws."
2.  **Authority Shift:** By this act, the church claimed the authority to
    transfer the holiness of God's Sabbath to a day of human choosing. This
    places church tradition above the Bible (Mark 7:7–9).
3.  **The Gospel Issue:** To claim the power to alter God's law is to claim the
    power to alter the terms of salvation. If the church can change the law, the
    definition of sin changes, and the need for the Atonement is obscured. We
    must stand on the Bible and the Bible alone (_Sola Scriptura_).

---

### Q10. Was there any additional governmental Sunday legislation in later years?

**Answer:** “Constantine’s decrees marked the beginning of a long, though
intermittent series of imperial decrees in support of Sunday rest.”

1.  **A Persistent Pattern:** Once the principle was accepted—that the state
    could enforce religious observances—laws became increasingly strict.
2.  **Prophetic Warning:** The Bible warns that in the last days, this history
    will be repeated. Revelation 13 describes a time when an "image to the
    beast" will be formed—a union of church and state in the modern era—which
    will enforce the "mark of the beast" (worship contrary to God's law) through
    economic boycotts and legislation (Revelation 13:16–17).
3.  **Our Duty:** In light of this, the believer’s duty is to:
    - Live a life of faith and obedience to God.
    - Defend the principle of religious liberty for all people.
    - Trust in Christ, who is our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, to
      empower us to stand firm when human laws conflict with Divine laws (Acts
      5:29).

**[ILL] The Thermometer:** Legislation is like a thermometer; it shows the
temperature of the society. When a church has lost the fire of the Holy Spirit
and the power of love to draw people to its services, it often turns to the cold
steel of the state to force them in. A Spirit-filled church needs no civil law
to support it.
