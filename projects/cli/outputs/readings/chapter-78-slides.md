## Slide 1 – Q1: Abolished on the Cross?

- **Question:** Did our Saviour abolish anything on the cross?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:15 – “Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Ceremonial System

- **The Specific Law Abolished:**
  - Christ did not abolish the moral law. The Apostle Paul specifies the “law of commandments contained in **ordinances**.”
  - This refers to the ceremonial system (types, shadows, sacrifices) given to point forward to the Messiah.
- **The "Enmity":**
  - This system created a “middle wall of partition” between Jews and Gentiles.
  - Strict rituals regarding circumcision and the temple made fellowship impossible between the two groups.
- **Abolished by Fulfillment:**
  - The ceremonial system was a shadow; Christ is the reality.
  - Colossians 2:17 – “Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.”
  - When Jesus died, the temple veil was rent (Matthew 27:51), signifying the end of earthly animal sacrifices.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Distinctions

- **Distinction from the Moral Law:**
  - **Ceremonial Law:** Temporary, remedial, pointed to Christ. Abolished because the Reality (Christ) has come.
  - **Moral Law:** The Ten Commandments. Eternal standard of righteousness. Not abolished.
- **Defining Atonement:**
  - In the Old Testament, atonement was symbolized by animal blood.
  - In the New Testament, it is accomplished by the blood of Christ.
  - Romans 5:11 – “And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Blueprint and the Building:**
  - Imagine a blueprint for a magnificent building.
  - While under construction, the blueprint is essential.
  - Once the building is finished, you do not live in the paper blueprint; you live in the building.
  - **Lesson:** The ceremonial law was the blueprint (shadow). Christ is the building (reality).
  - Once the reality is here, the blueprint is set aside, but the laws of physics (the Moral Law) that hold the building up remain in force.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Christ and the Law

- **Question:** What did He Himself say about the law?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:17 – “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Fulfillment)

- **"Think Not":**
  - Jesus warns us against the idea that He came to dissolve or annul God's government.
  - Salvation restores man to harmony with the law; it does not remove the law.
- **To Fulfill (*Pleroo* - to make full):**
  - **Prophetically:** Christ met the predictions of the Messianic prophets.
  - **Morally:** He lived out the Ten Commandments perfectly, showing their spiritual depth (reaching thoughts and intents).
- **Justification:**
  - Christ fulfilled the law to offer His perfect obedience to us.
  - Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Justification Defined:**
  - The legal act where God declares a repentant sinner righteous based solely on the merits of Jesus Christ.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”
- **The Purpose of Grace:**
  - Jesus did not fulfill the law so we could go on breaking it.
  - He fulfilled it to provide the power for us to walk in His steps.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Endurance of the Law

- **Question:** How long did He say the law would endure?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:18 – “For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Permanence)

- **Till Heaven and Earth Pass:**
  - As long as we live on this earth, God’s law remains in effect.
  - It is the transcript of God’s character: holy, unchangeable, and eternal.
- **Jot and Tittle:**
  - The "jot" was the smallest Hebrew letter; the "tittle" was a tiny stroke.
  - Jesus emphasizes that not even the smallest detail of the moral standard will be altered.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The Ten Commandments were inside the Ark in the earthly sanctuary (Exodus 25:21).
  - They remain in the heavenly sanctuary as the foundation of God’s government.
  - Revelation 11:19 – “And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Governor’s Pardon:**
  - If a criminal is pardoned by the governor, does that pardon abolish the law against the crime?
  - **No.** The pardon frees the man from the penalty, but the law remains on the books.
  - **Lesson:** Grace saves the sinner, but it does not abolish the law that defines sin.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Paul’s View of the Law

- **Question:** What did Paul say of the law of God?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Attributes)

- **The Law is Holy:**
  - It comes from a holy God and requires holiness in His people.
  - 1 Peter 1:16 – “Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.”
- **The Law is Just:**
  - It is equitable, fair, and the standard of the Great Judgment.
  - Ecclesiastes 12:13 – “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.”
- **The Law is Good:**
  - It is designed for our happiness and protection, like a guardrail on a cliff.
- **The Mirror:**
  - The law shows us our defects (sin), but the law is not the enemy—the sin is.
  - James 1:23 – “For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Regarding the Law

- **Question:** How did he regard it?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:22 – “For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **The Inward Man:**
  - The carnal mind is at enmity with God (Romans 8:7), but the new nature is born of the Spirit.
  - Ezekiel 36:26 – “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.”
- **Delight in Obedience:**
  - To the believer, commandments are a joy, not a burden.
  - Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”
- **Sanctification:**
  - The process where the Holy Spirit writes the law on the heart and transforms the character into the image of Christ.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Proof of Love

- **Question:** What does one show by keeping the commandments?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 5:3 – “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Love & Power)

- **Love as the Motive:**
  - Obedience is not legalism; it is a response to being saved.
  - John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”
- **Not Grievous:**
  - God's commands are only burdensome to those who love sin.
  - To those walking in the Spirit, they are the path of life.
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - We cannot obey in our own strength. Christ must live His life through us.
  - Philippians 2:13 – “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Marriage Relationship:**
  - A woman who marries a man she does not love finds his requests annoying.
  - If she loves him deeply, doing things that please him is a joy, not a duty.
  - **Lesson:** Our "marriage" to Christ makes obedience a labor of love, not a forced obligation.

## Slide 18 – Q7: The Reality of Sin

- **Question:** Does sin still exist?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:8 – “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points

- **Universal Condition:**
  - Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”
- **The Need for a Saviour:**
  - If sin were not real, we would not need a Saviour or a High Priest in heaven.
  - The fact that we need forgiveness proves that sin exists.
- **Ongoing Battle:**
  - Believers can have victory, but we must remain vigilant against the sinful nature and the world.

## Slide 20 – Q8: Law and Sin

- **Question:** Could there be sin now, if Christ abolished the law?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:13 – “For until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points (Logic)

- **The Definition of Sin:**
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **No Law = No Sin:**
  - If the moral law was abolished, there is no standard to measure righteousness.
  - Without a law, murder and idolatry would not technically be "sin."
- **The Conclusion:**
  - Since people still need a Saviour from sin, the Law that defines sin *must* still exist.

## Slide 22 – Q9: Abolishing the Ordinances

- **Question:** What was made possible by abolishing the law of commandments contained in ordinances?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:13 – “But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.” (See also Eph 2:12-14)

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Unity)

- **Access for All:**
  - Under the ceremonial system, Gentiles were "aliens" restricted from the inner temple.
  - Christ removed these barriers, allowing anyone to approach the Father.
- **Breaking the Middle Wall:**
  - Christ demolished the division between Jew and Gentile.
  - We are now one spiritual family, saved by faith rather than ritual.
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - We have a High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary open to all.
  - Hebrews 4:16 – “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Separation of Jew and Gentile

- **Question:** What was the chief thing that separated the Jews and the Gentiles?
- **Key Text:** Acts 11:3 – “Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Ceremonial Barriers)

- **Ritual Separation:**
  - Jews believed associating or eating with Gentiles made them ceremonially unclean.
  - This was based on "traditions of the elders" and ceremonial laws, not moral laws.
- **Peter’s Vision:**
  - God showed Peter that the gospel is for everyone.
  - Acts 10:34 – “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.”
- **Clarification:**
  - This issue was about ceremonial defilement, not the health laws of the Bible (Leviticus 11).

## Slide 26 – Q11: Circumcision

- **Question:** Was circumcision done away in Christ?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:15 – “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points (New Creation)

- **A New Sign:**
  - The physical sign of the Old Covenant is replaced by the spiritual reality.
  - Baptism is the new sign of entrance (Colossians 2:11–12).
- **Regeneration:**
  - What matters is a "circumcision of the heart" (Romans 2:29).
  - 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: What Remains?

- **Question:** After circumcision and the ordinances connected with it lost their force, what still remained of the utmost importance?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 7:19 – “Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (Summary)

- **Ritual Law is "Nothing":**
  - Ceremonial ordinances (circumcision, sacrifices) have passed away.
- **Moral Law Remains:**
  - "The keeping of the commandments of God" is still vital.
  - Abolishing the ritual law did not affect the standing of the moral law.
- **The Remnant:**
  - God's people in the last days are identified by both Law and Grace.
  - Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Illustration

- **Scaffolding vs. Foundation:**
  - **Scaffolding:** The ceremonial law was used to build the house of faith.
  - **House:** When Christ’s work was completed, the scaffolding was taken down.
  - **Foundation:** The Moral Law remains.
  - **Lesson:** If you tear down the foundation, the house collapses. Christ removed the scaffolding (ceremonies), but He strengthened the foundation (commandments).
