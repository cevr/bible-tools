## Slide 1 – Q1: The Promise to the Overcomer

- Question: What general promise is given to the overcomer?
- Key Text: Revelation 21:7 – “He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and
  I will be his God, and he shall be My son.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **Inheritance through Christ:**
  - Adam lost his dominion and standing as the "son of God" (Luke 3:38 – “Which
    was the son of Enos... which was the son of Adam, which was the son of
    God.”).
  - Christ, the Second Adam, regained this inheritance.
  - Believers become “joint-heirs with Christ” (Romans 8:17 – “And if children,
    then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we
    suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.”).
- **Adoption and Intimacy:**
  - The promise restores the broken family relationship.
  - Victory through faith restores the face-to-face communion enjoyed in Eden.
- **The Condition:**
  - The promise is for "he that overcometh."
  - We must cling to the Savior and allow Him to conquer sin in our lives.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Lost Prince:**
  - Imagine a prince kidnapped as a child, raised in a slum, forgetting his true
    identity.
  - When the King finds him, He does not just give him money.
  - The King restores him to the palace, gives him the family name, and makes
    him heir to the kingdom.
  - **Lesson:** God does this for the sinner who accepts Christ—restoring us to
    the royal family of heaven.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Defining "To Overcome"

- Question: What is it to overcome?
- Definition: “To vanquish, to conquer, to be victorious.” (Webster)

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Active Warfare:**
  - The Christian life is a battlefield, not a life of ease.
  - The Great Controversy is fought on the ground of every human heart.
  - To "vanquish" means to subdue the enemy completely.
- **Not Passive:**
  - We are saved by grace, but grace empowers us to fight.
  - We are called to “Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal
    life...” (1 Timothy 6:12).
- **Defining the Victory:**
  - Successfully resisting temptation.
  - Subduing selfish passions.
  - Remaining loyal to God despite persecution or trial.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Swimmer:**
  - A swimmer in a rushing river cannot stay in the same place by doing nothing;
    the current will sweep them away.
  - To reach the shore, they must stroke _against_ the current.
  - **Lesson:** The "current" is our fallen nature and the world. "Overcoming"
    is the Spirit-empowered motion toward God.

## Slide 7 – Q3: What Must Be Overcome?

- Question: What must be overcome to realize the promises to the overcomer?
- Key Text: Romans 12:21 – “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
  good.”
- Key Text: 1 John 5:4 – “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world:
  and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Evil and the World)

- **Overcoming Evil:**
  - Includes external malice from others and internal fallen inclinations.
  - We overcome not by revenge, but by responding with the love of Christ.
- **Overcoming the World:**
  - The "world" is the system of rebellion: “the lust of the flesh, and the lust
    of the eyes, and the pride of life” (1 John 2:16).
  - We must refuse to be molded by its standards, fashions, and sinful
    pleasures.
- **Sanctification:**
  - The process of separating from the world and growing in holiness.
  - “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should
    abstain from fornication” (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **Light in a Dark Room:**
  - If you bring a light into a dark room, you do not have to shovel the
    darkness out.
  - The presence of the light "overcomes" the darkness instantly.
  - **Lesson:** We overcome evil not by fighting it in our own strength, but by
    being filled with the "Light of the World," Jesus Christ.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Overcoming the World

- Question: What is meant by overcoming the world?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:9 – “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his
  seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **A New Nature:**
  - Regeneration (New Birth) creates a nature that hates sin (John 3:3).
  - It is contrary to the nature of a born-again Christian to live in willful
    sin.
- **Not "Committing" Sin:**
  - The Greek tense implies a continuous habit or practice.
  - A believer may fall (1 John 2:1), but sin is not their lifestyle or master.
- **Victory is Possible:**
  - The Gospel provides power for the present, not just forgiveness for the
    past.
  - Through the indwelling Christ, the power of sin is broken.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Pig and the Lamb:**
  - Both may fall into a mud puddle.
  - The pig delights in the mud and stays there; that is its nature.
  - The lamb hates the mud and bleats until it is cleansed.
  - **Lesson:** The overcomer has the nature of the Lamb (Christ) and cannot
    remain comfortable in the "mud" of the world.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Exercise for the Promise

- Question: What, then, must we exercise in order to claim the promise of
  inheriting all things?
- Key Text: 1 Timothy 4:8 – “For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness
  is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of
  that which is to come.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **Godliness Defined:**
  - "God-likeness"—a life reflecting God's character through the indwelling
    Spirit.
- **The Life that Now Is:**
  - Holiness brings blessings on earth.
  - Obedience to moral and physical laws protects us from vice and disease.
  - Includes care for the body temple: “What? know ye not that your body is the
    temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you...?” (1 Corinthians 6:19).
- **The Life to Come:**
  - Godliness fits the character for heaven.
  - We are saved _to_ godliness, fitting us for the future life.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Athlete:**
  - An athlete exercises daily and denies himself junk food, not to punish
    himself, but to win the prize.
  - His discipline is profitable for his health today _and_ secures the trophy
    tomorrow.
  - **Lesson:** Christian discipline ("godliness") brings present health and
    future reward.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Who Alone Can Overcome?

- Question: Who alone can overcome?
- Key Text: 1 John 5:5 – “Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that
  believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Object of Faith:**
  - We do not have faith in our own strength.
  - We believe Jesus overcame, and we claim His victory as our own.
- **Union with Christ:**
  - Faith connects human weakness to Divine omnipotence.
  - Christ dwells in the heart and does the overcoming work.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot fight Satan alone.
  - We hide ourselves in the One who has already defeated him.
  - **Justification:** God declares the sinner righteous by imputing Christ's
    perfect righteousness to their account (Romans 4:5).

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **Child and the Boulder:**
  - A small child cannot move a heavy boulder.
  - But if the child holds the hand of his strong father, and the father moves
    the boulder, the child has "overcome."
  - **Lesson:** We overcome the obstacles of sin through the Father's strength,
    not our own.

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Means of Victory

- Question: By what means are we enabled to overcome?
- Key Text: 1 John 5:4 – “This is the victory that overcometh the world, even
  our faith.”
- Key Text: Revelation 12:11 – “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,
  and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the
  death.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (The Three-Fold Arsenal)

- **The Blood of the Lamb:**
  - Deals with the guilt of sin (Justification).
  - Knowing we are cleansed gives us courage to stand.
- **The Word of Their Testimony:**
  - Using the Sword of the Spirit (God's Word) and confessing Christ.
  - Active faith speaks truth against Satan's lies.
- **Faith:**
  - The hand that grasps the victory.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Sanctuary Connection & Illustration

- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - **The Blood:** Points to the Altar of Burnt Offering (Christ’s sacrifice).
  - **The Word & Faith:** Point to the Holy Place (Light of the Spirit, Bread of
    Life).
- **Illustration (The Courtroom):**
  - How does a defendant overcome an accuser?
  - He presents evidence that the debt is paid (**The Blood**).
  - He testifies to the truth (**The Word**).
  - Satan, the accuser, is silenced by Christ’s blood.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Strength to Overcome

- Question: Who gives us strength to overcome? and through whom is it bestowed?
- Key Text: 1 Corinthians 15:57 – “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the
  victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
- Key Text: Romans 8:37 – “Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors
  through him that loved us.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **Source and Mediator:**
  - God the Father originates the plan; it is bestowed _through_ Jesus Christ.
  - “For without me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5).
- **"More than Conquerors":**
  - A conqueror may win but suffer heavy losses.
  - To be "more than a conqueror" means the victory is so decisive that even
    trials are turned into blessings.
- **Connection:**
  - We do not receive independent power; we must remain connected to the Source.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **David and Goliath:**
  - The Israelites were terrified and helpless.
  - David (a type of Christ) defeated the giant.
  - The army then chased the enemy and took the spoil.
  - **Lesson:** They were "more than conquerors"—sharing in a victory won by
    their Champion.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Purpose of Promises

- Question: What is one important purpose of the promises given in the Bible?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 1:4 – “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
  precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature,

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points

- **Transformation:**
  - Promises are for restoring the image of God in man.
  - We share in God's moral character (love, purity) through the Spirit.
- **Escaping Corruption:**
  - The world decays through "lust" (sinful desire).
  - We escape by taking in God's promises.
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - Christ’s righteousness produced _inside_ the believer, resulting in
    obedience.
  - “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
    liveth in me...” (Galatians 2:20).

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Bank Draft:**
  - A promise is only as good as the person making it.
  - God’s promises are backed by the infinite "bank" of Heaven.
  - **Lesson:** When we claim a promise by faith, we receive the actual
    "currency" of the Divine Nature to overcome sin.

## Slide 28 – Q10: The Greatest Promise

    reward.
  - They are not currently in heaven; they wait in the grave.
- **The "Better Thing":**
  - “God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should
    not be made perfect” (Hebrews 11:40).

    _together_ at the First Resurrection.

## Slide 36 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Banquet:**
  - At a grand banquet, the host does not let guests start eating one by one.
