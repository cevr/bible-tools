### Q1. What is the character of the "day of the Lord?

**“The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord; the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress." Zeph. 1:14, 15.**

**Answer:**

The Scriptures present the "day of the Lord" not as a time of universal peace or a secret rapture, but as a solemn period of divine intervention and judgment. It marks the transition from the era of human probation to the execution of God’s justice.

*   **A Time of Accounting:** The prophet Zephaniah describes it as a "day of wrath" and "trouble." This wrath is not an emotional outburst, but the settled, righteous antagonism of a holy God toward sin. For those who have clung to their sins rather than to the Savior, it is a day of distress because their shelter of lies is swept away (Isaiah 28:17).
*   **The End of Delay:** The repetition—"it is near, it is near"—indicates the urgency. In our day, the signs of the times indicate this event is imminent. The "voice" of this day speaks to the conscience, warning that the time to make peace with God is now.
*   **The Only Safety:** While the text speaks of the "mighty man" crying bitterly, there is hope for the humble. In the same context, the prophet counsels: "Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth... seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger" (Zephaniah 2:3). This hiding place is Christ Jesus.

**Definitions:**
*   **Day of the Lord:** A prophetic time period involving God's direct intervention in human history to judge sin, deliver His people, and purify the earth (Joel 2:11; 2 Peter 3:10).
*   **Probation:** The time granted to humanity to choose between God and rebellion; a period of testing before the final judgment is fixed.

Imagine a building inspector coming to examine a house foundation. To the homeowner who has built according to code with solid materials, the inspection is a day of validation. But to the builder who cut corners and used rotten wood covered with paint, the inspector’s arrival is a day of "trouble and distress." The day of the Lord reveals what our characters are truly built of—whether the solid Rock of Christ or the shifting sand of self (Matthew 7:24–27).

### Q2. Under which of the seven seals does this time of wrath begin?

**“And I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal." "for the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?" Rev. 6:12, 17.**

**Answer:**

The opening of the sixth seal ushers in the signs that announce the immediate approach of the end. The cry of the lost in verse 17—"For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?"—is the most piercing question in the Bible.

*   **The Transition:** The first five seals cover the history of the church from the apostles down to the time of the end (persecution, martyrdom, and apostasy). The sixth seal shifts the focus to cosmic disturbances that herald the Second Coming.
*   **The Question of Standing:** To "stand" in the presence of a holy God requires a holy character. This is impossible for fallen humanity to generate on its own.
    *   **Justification:** We must have a legal right to stand, which is the imputed righteousness of Christ (Romans 3:24).
    *   **Sanctification:** We must have a fitness to stand, which is the imparted righteousness of Christ working in us to subdue sin (Jude 24).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** The only ones able to stand are those who have "washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 7:14). They do not trust in their own works, but they have allowed Christ to live His life of perfect obedience within them (Galatians 2:20).

**Definitions:**
*   **Justification:** God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ’s merits, not their own deeds (Romans 5:1).
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to purify the believer’s character and life, making them like Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]**
If a diver wants to stand at the bottom of the deep ocean, they cannot do so in their natural state; the pressure would crush them. They must be encased in a specialized suit that withstands the pressure. Similarly, the "pressure" of God's infinite holiness would consume sin instantly. Only those "encased" in Christ—clothed in His righteousness and filled with His Spirit—can stand in that great day without being consumed.

### Q3. What signs were to appear in the heavens under this seal?

**“The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind." Rev. 6:12, 13.**

**Answer:**

Under the sixth seal, God provides specific celestial signposts to alert the world that the end is approaching. Historicist Bible students recognize these as literal events in history:

*   **The Dark Day (May 19, 1780):** A supernatural darkness covered a vast portion of New England and the Atlantic coast. The sun was darkened, and the moon appeared as blood the following night, fulfilling the prophecy with striking accuracy.
*   **The Falling of the Stars (November 13, 1833):** The great meteoric shower, the most extensive and spectacular ever recorded, fulfilled the prediction of the stars falling "as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs."
*   **Purpose of Signs:** These events were not merely natural anomalies; they were God’s alarm clock for the world, signaling that the "time of the end" had begun and the investigative judgment was drawing near.

---

### Q4. What great events were these signs to precede?

**“Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." Matt. 24:29, 30.**

**Answer:**

Jesus connects the celestial signs directly to His Second Coming.

*   **Timing:** The "tribulation of those days" refers to the long period of papal supremacy and persecution (the 1260 years, ending in 1798). However, the intense persecution was cut short (Mark 13:20) by the Reformation and the rise of democracy before 1798. The signs (dark day of 1780) occurred "in those days, after that tribulation" (Mark 13:24).
*   **The Sequence:**
    1.  The Tribulation (Dark Ages).
    2.  The Signs (Sun, Moon, Stars).
    3.  The Shaking of Powers (current events/future).
    4.  The Sign of the Son of Man (The Second Coming).
*   **The Mourning:** Why do the tribes of the earth mourn? because they realize too late that they have rejected the only means of salvation. They see the King of Kings, but they have no relationship with Him. For the believer, however, this is not a day of mourning, but of looking up, for "redemption draweth nigh" (Luke 21:28).

**[ILL]**
Road signs are placed *before* the destination, not at it. If you see a sign saying "Bridge Out - 1 Mile," you have time to stop. If you ignore the sign and keep driving until you reach the chasm, it is too late. God gave the signs in the heavens (1780, 1833) to wake up the world so that we might prepare *before* the bridge is out.

### Q5. Under which of the seven seals will the Lord come to earth?

**“And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." Rev. 8:1.**

**Answer:**

The actual coming of Christ occurs under the opening of the **seventh seal**.

*   **Silence in Heaven:** Why is there silence? Throughout Revelation, heaven is filled with the sound of praise and worship. This silence occurs because the angelic hosts have left the courts of glory to accompany the King of Kings to the earth.
*   **The Angelic Escort:** Jesus said, "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and *all the holy angels with him*" (Matthew 25:31). Heaven is temporarily emptied of its inhabitants as they focus entirely on the gathering of the saints.
*   **Prophetic Time:** In prophecy, where a day represents a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6), "half an hour" would represent about one week of literal time (1/48th of a 24-hour day/year). This suggests the duration of the Second Coming event itself.

**Definition:**
*   **Prophetic Time:** A principle of interpretation where a symbolic "day" in prophecy equals a literal solar year in history.

### Q6. How is the wrath of the day of the Lord to be manifested?

**“And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God." Rev. 15:1.**

**Answer:**

The "wrath of God" in its final, unmixed form is manifested in the **seven last plagues**.

*   **"Filled Up":** This phrase implies completion. These are the final judgments upon a world that has fully rejected the gospel and the law of God.
*   **The Nature of the Plagues:** These fall only on those who have the "mark of the beast" and worship his image (Revelation 16:2). They are similar to the plagues of Egypt—literal judgments designed to show the powerlessness of false gods and false systems of worship.
*   **Sanctuary Context:** These plagues are poured out *after* probation closes. In Revelation 15:8, the temple is filled with smoke, and "no man was able to enter into the temple." This means Christ's intercessory ministry has ceased.
*   **Preparation:** Because there is no Intercessor during this time, God’s people must have the "seal of God." Their characters must be fully cleansed from sin *before* this time begins. This is the practical urgency of the Righteousness by Faith message—Christ must fully dwell in us now, so we can stand then.

**Definition:**
*   **Atonement (Final):** The closing work of Christ in the Most Holy Place to blot out the record of sin and cleanse the sanctuary/people, preparing them to live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor (Leviticus 16; Hebrews 9:28).

---

### Q7. Are the most of these plagues to be poured out before the Lord comes?

**“And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates... Behold, I come as a thief: Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame." Rev. 16:12-15.**

**Answer:**

Yes. The plagues occur sequentially. The verses describe the sixth plague, which prepares the way for the "battle of that great day of God Almighty" (Armageddon). It is in this context—just before the final collapse of earthly powers—that Christ inserts a warning about His coming.

*   **The Warning:** "Behold, I come as a thief." To the world, His arrival is a shock. To the believer, it is the climax of expectation.
*   **The Garments:** In Scripture, garments symbolize character.
    *   Filthy garments = Our own self-righteousness (Isaiah 64:6).
    *   White raiment = The righteousness of Christ (Revelation 3:18).
*   **Nakedness:** To be "naked" in the judgment means to be found without the covering of Christ's life. It is not enough to profess faith; we must "keep" our garments. This implies an active, vigilant walk with God—a daily dying to self and living in Christ.
*   **Victory Over Sin:** Keeping the garment means we do not allow the stains of the world to defile us. "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment" (Revelation 3:5).

**[ILL]**
In the ancient temple service, the Captain of the Temple guard would make rounds at night. If he found a Levite guard sleeping at his post, he had the authority to set the guard's clothes on fire or strip them off, leaving the guard to wake up in shame and nakedness. We are watchmen on the walls of Zion. If we sleep in spiritual apathy, indulging in sin, we risk being found "naked" when the Captain of our Salvation appears.

### Q8. What great event will take place at His coming?

**“For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first." 1 Thess. 4:16.**

**Answer:**

The central event of the Second Coming is the **resurrection of the righteous**, also known as the "First Resurrection."

*   **The Manner of Coming:** It is audible ("shout," "voice," "trump") and visible. There is nothing secret about it.
*   **The "Dead in Christ":** Those who died trusting in Jesus—from Adam to the last martyr—are raised to life. They are given immortal, glorified bodies (1 Corinthians 15:52).
*   **The Living Saints:** Verse 17 tells us the living righteous are "caught up together with them."
*   **The Separation:** This event separates the human race into two classes forever: those who have accepted the Life-giver and those who have rejected Him.

**Definition:**
*   **First Resurrection:** The resurrection of God's faithful people at the Second Coming. "Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power" (Revelation 20:6).

---

### Q9. How long after the righteous will the wicked be raised to life?

**“And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection." Rev. 20:4, 5.**

**Answer:**

There is a period of **one thousand years** (the Millennium) between the resurrection of the righteous and the resurrection of the wicked.

*   **The State of the Wicked:** When Christ returns, the living wicked are destroyed by the "brightness of his coming" (2 Thessalonians 2:8), and the wicked who were already dead remain in their graves. The text is explicit: "The rest of the dead [the wicked] lived not again until the thousand years were finished."
*   **The State of the Earth:** During this time, the earth is desolate, a "bottomless pit" or abyss (Rev 20:1–3). There are no human inhabitants alive on earth.
*   **The Work of the Saints:** The righteous are in heaven "reigning with Christ." This reign involves the work of judgment—reviewing the records of the lost and of fallen angels, validating that God’s judgments are just and true (1 Corinthians 6:2–3).

---

### Q10. When the wicked come up again on the earth, what will they be incited to do?

**”And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea." Rev. 20:7, 8.**

**Answer:**

At the end of the millennium, the Holy City, New Jerusalem, descends from heaven (Revelation 21:2). The wicked are raised (the "Second Resurrection"). This releases Satan from his "prison" of isolation because he now has people to deceive again.

*   **The Final Deception:** Satan does not admit defeat. He deceives the resurrected billions ("Gog and Magog" symbolizing the enemies of God) into believing they can capture the City of God by force.
*   **The Character of the Wicked:** Even after a thousand years of death, the wicked awake with the same rebellious character they had when they died. Probation is closed; their nature is fixed against God. This proves that a second probation would not change their hearts—they would simply sin again.

---

### Q11. What will then take place?

**“And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them." Rev. 20:9.**

**Answer:**

As the wicked surround the city, the final executive judgment takes place.

*   **The Great White Throne:** Before the fire falls, the judgment is pronounced. Every knee bows and acknowledges the justice of God (Philippians 2:10–11).
*   **The Fire:** "Fire came down from God." This is the "hell fire" of Scripture. It is not a place where people go immediately at death, but a future event on the surface of this earth.
*   **"Devoured":** The text says the fire *devours* them. It consumes them. The goal of God’s wrath is the eradication of sin and sinners, not the eternal perpetuation of sin in a chamber of torture.

**[ILL]**
When a farmer burns the chaff after the harvest, the purpose is to clear the field, not to keep the chaff burning forever. Malachi 4:1 says the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and the wicked shall be "stubble"—leaving them "neither root nor branch." The fire does its work of cleansing, and then goes out.

---

### Q12. What is this lake of fire called?

**” The lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death." Rev. 21:8.**

**Answer:**

The Bible calls this event the **Second Death**.

*   **First vs. Second Death:**
    *   The *first death* is the natural death resulting from Adam's fall. It is a sleep from which there is a resurrection.
    *   The *second death* is the penal death for personal, unrepented sin. It is final. There is no resurrection from it. It is the total extinction of life and consciousness—the wages of sin (Romans 6:23).
*   **God’s Justice and Love:** The doctrine of the "Second Death" vindicates God’s character. He is not a cruel tyrant who tortures enemies for eternity for a short life of sin. Rather, He respects their choice to be separated from Him, the Source of Life. Since they cannot live in His holy presence, and they refuse His healing, they cease to be.

**Definition:**
*   **Second Death:** The final punishment of the unrepentant; complete destruction and cessation of existence.

---

### Q13. To what are the present heavens and earth reserved?

**“But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men." 2 Peter 3:7.**

**Answer:**

The earth itself is "reserved" or stored up for this final purification.

*   **Cleansing by Fire:** Just as the ancient world was cleansed by water (the Flood) because of sin, the present world is reserved for cleansing by fire.
*   **Perdition:** This word means destruction or ruin. The fire targets the "ungodly men" and the curse of sin that has infected the planet.
*   **The Continuity of Law:** The "same word" that created the worlds and brought the Flood now holds the earth for this final event. God’s word is sure.

---

### Q14. But will the day of the Lord reach to, and include, the burning of the earth?

**“But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise. and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also; and the works that are therein shall be burned up." 2 Peter 3:10.**

**Answer:**

Yes. The "Day of the Lord" is a broad term that encompasses the entire chain of events from the close of probation, through the Second Coming and Millennium, culminating in the final burning of the earth.

*   **Total Purification:** The "elements shall melt." This intense heat purges the earth of every trace of sin, disease, death, and the works of man. The scars of sin are erased.
*   **A New Beginning:** Peter immediately follows this verse with the promise: "Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (2 Peter 3:13).
*   **Practical Application:** Peter asks in verse 11, "Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?"
    *   If the material world is to be burned, we should not set our hearts on earthly treasure.
    *   We should focus on character—the only thing we can take from this world to the next.
    *   Through the power of the Holy Spirit, we are to live lives of "holy conversation" (conduct), proving that God's law can be kept by faith in Jesus.

**[ILL]**
A silversmith puts ore into the crucible and applies intense heat. The heat burns away the dross (impurities) until only pure silver remains. The fire of the last day acts as a cosmic crucible. It burns up the "dross" of sin and sinners, leaving behind a purified planet where the righteous—refined like silver—will dwell with God forever.
