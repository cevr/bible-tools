### Q1. How did God communicate with man in the Eden?
“And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?" Gen. 3:9.

**Answer:**
In the beginning, before the entrance of sin, humanity enjoyed open, face-to-face communion with the Creator. There was no veil, no separation, and no need for an intermediary. Adam and Eve could speak with God as a man speaks with his friend (Exodus 33:11). This direct communication was the natural result of holiness; because there was no sin to consume, the glory of God was a source of life and joy, not terror.

However, the verse quoted (Genesis 3:9) captures the tragic moment immediately following the Fall. It reveals God’s character: man had sinned and hidden himself, but God took the initiative to seek him out. God’s call, "Where art thou?" was the first step in the plan of redemption—seeking the lost to restore them to righteousness.

*   **The Barrier of Sin:** Isaiah 59:2 tells us, "But your iniquities have separated between you and your God."
*   **The Goal of Salvation:** To restore this face-to-face communion (Revelation 22:4).

**[ILL] illustration:**
Imagine a clear windowpane allowing sunlight to flood a room. This represents Eden. Now, imagine that window painted over with thick black paint. The sun is still shining, but the connection is broken. Sin is that black paint. God, in His mercy, did not destroy the house; instead, He devised a plan to let the light in through a different method until the window could be fully cleaned.

### Q2. Since the fall, how has God made known His will?
“God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets." Heb. 1:1.

**Answer:**
Since sin made direct contact with God’s consuming glory impossible for fallen man (Exodus 33:20), God established the agency of **prophets**.

*   **Sundry Times:** God did not reveal His entire plan at once. He revealed truth progressively as men could bear it (John 16:12), unfolding the plan of salvation step by step—from the first promise in Eden to the full light of the gospel.
*   **Divers Manners:** God used various methods: dreams, visions, audible voices, and the ministry of angels.
*   **By the Prophets:** A prophet is a spokesperson for God. The word implies one who "bubbles up" or pours forth words given by another.

**Definition:**
**Prophet:** A man or woman called by God to receive divine communications and transmit them to the people. They serve as God’s "mouth" (Exodus 4:16; Jeremiah 1:9).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
When a king wishes to speak to rebels who have barricaded themselves in a fortress, he does not walk in alone lest they be destroyed by his army. He sends an ambassador with a white flag. The ambassador speaks not his own words, but the words of the king. The prophet is God's ambassador to a rebel world.

---

### Q3. What was the object of speaking "by the prophets?
“Surely the Lord God will do nothing but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets." Amos 3:7.

**Answer:**
God’s government is transparent to His people. He does not strike without warning, nor does He change the dispensation of grace without explanation. The "secret" of the Lord is primarily His covenant and the plan of salvation (Psalm 25:14).

*   **Warning Before Judgment:** Before the Flood, God sent Noah. Before the destruction of Sodom, He told Abraham. Before the first advent of Christ, John the Baptist prepared the way.
*   **Guidance in Righteousness:** The prophetic gift is not merely for predicting the future; it is to reveal the mind of God regarding sin and righteousness, so that the people may prepare for what is coming.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
God reveals His secrets so that we may be "covered" before the storm comes. The only safety in the judgment is to be found in Christ, having His righteousness imputed to us for pardon and imparted to us for obedience. The prophets were sent to call people back to this covenant relationship.

---

### Q4. By what influence did the prophets reveal God's will?
“For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. " 2 Peter 1:21 (2 Sam. 23:2).

**Answer:**
Prophecy is not the product of human genius, deep study, or philosophical speculation. It is the direct result of the **Holy Ghost** moving upon the human agent.

*   **"Moved":** The Greek word implies being "borne along" or carried, like a ship driven by the wind. The prophet is the vessel; the Holy Spirit is the wind that determines the course and the message.
*   **Human and Divine Union:** Just as Christ was fully God and fully man, the Scriptures (and true prophecy) act as a union of the divine and human. The words may reflect the writer's vocabulary, but the thought and truth are infallibly God's.

**Definition:**
**Inspiration:** The supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on the writers of Scripture and prophets, ensuring that what they wrote or spoke was the Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16).

---

### Q5. Then what may the gift of prophecy be called?
A gift of the Holy Spirit, or a spiritual gift.

**Answer:**
Because the prophecy comes only when men are "moved by the Holy Ghost," it is rightly termed a "Spiritual gift" (1 Corinthians 12:1). It is not a natural talent that can be developed by education; it is a sovereign bestowal of the Spirit for the edification of the church.

---

### Q6. What was said regarding the words of God's prophets?”
If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream." Num. 12:6.

**Answer:**
God identifies the legitimate modes of prophetic communication: **visions** (usually while awake or in a trance) and **dreams** (while asleep). In this state, the prophet’s natural senses are often suspended, and they see and hear realities of the spiritual world presented by the Lord.

*   **Supernatural State:** In the case of Daniel (Daniel 10:8, 17) and Balaam (Numbers 24:4), the physical effects (loss of strength, eyes open but seeing the vision) confirmed the supernatural origin of the message.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A telescope allows a person to see things that are real but far beyond the capability of the naked eye. The Spirit acts as a telescope for the prophet, bringing the distant future or the hidden realities of heaven into sharp focus.

---

### Q7. How were the Lord's words preserved to the people?
"Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters." Dan. 7:1 (Jer. 51:60, 61).

**Answer:**
God commanded the prophets to commit the revelations to writing. This transitioned the message from a momentary oral proclamation to a permanent record.

*   **Purpose of Writing:** To preserve the truth for future generations (Psalm 102:18) and to provide a standard by which to test all future teaching and experience (Isaiah 8:20).
*   **The Great Controversy:** Satan delights in forgetting and twisting oral tradition. The written Word acts as an unchangeable "sword of the Spirit" (Ephesians 6:17) to defeat error.

---

### Q8. What had these writings to do with the people's understanding future events?
“I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that He would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem." Dan.9:2.

**Answer:**
This verse reveals a profound truth: prophets studied the writings of other prophets. Daniel, though a major prophet himself, studied the scroll of Jeremiah to understand the timing of the deliverance from Babylon.

*   **Historicist Understanding:** Daniel recognized that the "seventy years" were a specific period of time predicted by God. This validates the study of time prophecies.
*   **Application:** If Daniel needed to study "by books" to understand God's plan, how much more should we study the Bible to understand the signs of our times?

**Sanctuary Connection:**
Daniel was praying toward the desolate sanctuary in Jerusalem (Daniel 9:17). His study of prophecy led him to intercede for the restoration of the sanctuary services—a type of Christ’s work for us.

---

### Q9. How did God's ministers use the words of the prophets in exhorting the people to obedience?
“Should ye not hear the words which the Lord hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity?" Zech. 7:7 (2 Chron. 20:20).

**Answer:**
The writings of the "former prophets" were used to call the people to repentance and obedience. The prophetic gift is not merely for satisfying curiosity about the future; its primary purpose is moral and spiritual restoration.

*   **Righteousness by Faith:** The prophets consistently preached that ritual service (sacrifices/fasting) was useless without a changed heart and a life of justice and mercy (Zechariah 7:9–10). They pointed away from human works to the necessity of a heart renewed by God.
*   **The Call:** "Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper" (2 Chronicles 20:20).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A map is useful only if the traveler follows it. The prophecies are the map of the Christian journey. To admire the map but ignore its directions is to ensure we get lost.

---

### Q10. How were people to know whether or not the words of prophets were from the Lord?
“When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously; thou shalt not be afraid of him." Deut. 18:22.

**Answer:**
The first test of a prophet is **predictive accuracy**. God claims the unique ability to declare the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:9–10). If a prophet makes a specific prediction that fails, they are not speaking for God.

*   *Note:* Some prophecies are conditional (like Jonah preaching to Nineveh). If the people repent, the judgment may be averted (Jeremiah 18:7–10). However, if a prophet claims to speak for God and their word fails without a conditional cause, they are a false prophet.

---

### Q11. What was considered a still better test on this point?
“If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul." Deut. 13:1-3.

**Answer:**
This is the supreme test: **Fidelity to God's Law and Doctrine.** Even if a prophet performs a miracle ("sign or wonder") or makes a correct prediction, if they lead the people to violate God's commandments ("go after other gods"), they are false.

*   **Satanic Counterfeits:** Satan can work miracles and make accurate guesses to deceive (2 Thessalonians 2:9; Revelation 16:14).
*   **The Standard:** "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20). A true prophet will never contradict previous established truths of Scripture.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
True prophecy leads to loving the Lord "with all your heart" (Deuteronomy 13:3). This is the essence of the New Covenant—the law written on the heart. Any "gift" that excuses sin or downplays the necessity of obedience is a deception.

---

### Q12. What was predicted concerning the spirit of prophecy in the last days?
“And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions." Joel 2:28.

**Answer:**
God promised a special outpouring of the Spirit in the "last days." This outpouring would result in the reactivation of the prophetic gift among God's people ("sons and daughters").

*   **"All Flesh":** This indicates that the gift would not be limited to a priestly class but would be seen across different ages and genders within the remnant people.

---

### Q13. When did this prediction commence to be fulfilled?
“But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams." Acts 2:16, 17.

**Answer:**
Peter identified the day of Pentecost as the commencement of this fulfillment. This was the "Early Rain" of the Spirit, which launched the Christian church with power and spiritual gifts. However, prophecy indicates a dual fulfillment: the "Early Rain" at Pentecost, and the "Latter Rain" just before the harvest (end of the world) to ripen the grain (James 5:7).

---

### Q14. To whom was this promise to extend?
“Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." Acts 2:38, 39.

**Answer:**
The promise of the Holy Spirit and His attendant gifts was not limited to the apostles or the first century. It extends "to all that are afar off"—down through the corridors of time to the very end of the age. As long as God is calling men to repentance, the Spirit is available to equip the church.

**Definition:**
**Remission of Sins:** The removal of the guilt of sin (Justification).
**Gift of the Holy Ghost:** The power for a new life (Sanctification) and service.

---

### Q15. What relation should the Christian church sustain toward these spiritual gifts?
“Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant." 1 Cor. 12:1.

**Answer:**
Paul admonishes the church not to be ignorant. Ignorance regarding spiritual gifts leads to two dangers:
1.  **Fanaticism:** Accepting false manifestations as genuine.
2.  **Rejection:** Rejecting genuine manifestations because of prejudice or lack of understanding.
We are called to study, understand, and test the gifts.

---

### Q16. What is the object of these gifts?
“But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal." 1 Cor. 12:7.

**Answer:**
The gifts are not given for the self-aggrandizement of the individual, but for the "profit" or benefit of the entire body of believers. They are tools for service, not badges of status.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A carpenter has many tools—a hammer, a saw, a plane. The hammer does not boast over the saw. Each tool is designed for a specific function to build the house. Spiritual gifts are God's tools to build His spiritual house, the church.

---

### Q17. What are some of these gifts?
“For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom;... to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of Spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues." 1 Cor. 12:8-10.

**Answer:**
The Spirit bestows a variety of gifts, including wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discernment, and languages (tongues).
*   **Unity in Diversity:** Though the gifts are different, the Spirit is the same.
*   **Sovereignty:** The Spirit divides "to every man severally as he will" (v. 11). We do not choose our gift; God chooses the gift that fits us for His work.

---

### Q18. Which one of these does the apostle say is especially desirable?
“Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy." 1 Cor. 14:1.

**Answer:**
While all gifts are useful, Paul elevates **prophecy** as the most desirable gift for the church to seek. Love (charity) is the context in which all gifts must operate, but among the gifts, prophecy holds a primary place because of its ability to communicate God's mind clearly to the community.

---

### Q19. Whom was this gift designed to benefit?
“Prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe." 1 Cor. 14:22.

**Answer:**
Prophecy is primarily for the "inside" of the church—"for them which believe." While miracles or tongues might serve as signs to arrest the attention of unbelievers, the prophetic gift is designed to guide, correct, comfort, and instruct the church family itself.

---

### Q20. What effect is the exercise of these gifts to have upon the church?
“And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." Eph. 4:11-13.

**Answer:**
This is the central purpose of the gifts: **The Perfecting of the Saints.**
The gifts are the means God uses to bring His people to spiritual maturity.

*   **Unity of the Faith:** Prophecy protects the church from "every wind of doctrine" (v. 14).
*   **The Stature of Christ:** The goal is nothing less than the full restoration of the image of God in man.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
Note the goal: a "perfect man." God provides the Spirit of Prophecy to help the church attain victory over sin and a character like Christ’s. We cannot reach this "measure of the stature" by human effort, but through the ministry of the gifts God has placed in the church, pointing us constantly to the power of Christ.

---

### Q21. Where did God place these gifts?”
And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues." 1 Cor. 12:28.

**Answer:**
God "set" them in the church. They are constituent parts of the body of Christ. Just as a human body is not complete without eyes or ears, the church is not complete according to the divine pattern without the gifts, particularly the "eyes" of the church—the prophets (1 Samuel 9:9).

---

### Q22. Who came down from Judea to Ceasarea while Paul was there?
“And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus." Acts 21:10.

**Answer:**
Years after the ascension of Christ, the gift of prophecy was still active in the New Testament church. Agabus is a specific example of a New Testament prophet who was not one of the twelve apostles.

---

### Q23. What did he do as soon as he saw the apostle?
“And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles." Acts 21:11.

**Answer:**
Agabus used an object lesson (acting out the prophecy) and delivered a specific message from the Holy Ghost regarding Paul’s future. This shows the practical nature of the gift—warning of danger and preparing the believer for trial.

---

### Q24. At a later period, what did Paul say these trials had wrought?
“But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel." Phil. 1:12.

**Answer:**
Although the prophecy predicted hardship and imprisonment, it did not mean Paul was outside of God's will. The warning prepared Paul to face the trial, and God overruled the enemy's attack for the "furtherance of the gospel." The prophetic word gives us courage to face the future, knowing God is already there.

---

### Q25. How long was it designed that these gifts should last?
“For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away." 1 Cor.13:9, 10.

**Answer:**
The gifts are necessary as long as we know "in part." They are to last until "that which is perfect is come."
*   **When is "the perfect"?** Verse 12 says it is when we see "face to face." This refers to the Second Coming of Christ and the glorification of the saints.
*   **Conclusion:** Since we are not yet in the glorified state and do not yet see Jesus face to face, the church still needs the gifts of the Spirit.

---

### Q26. What admonition does Paul give respecting the gift of Prophecy?
“Despise not prophesyings." 1 Thess. 5:20.

**Answer:**
Paul warns against "despising" the gift. Why would people despise it?
1.  **It brings Reproof:** Prophecy often cuts across our cherished sins and calls for self-denial. The carnal heart resents correction.
2.  **Counterfeits:** Because of false prophets, some may be tempted to reject all prophecy.
3.  **Simplicity:** Sometimes God uses humble instruments (like the fishermen apostles, or Ellen White, a woman with little education) which the proud may despise.

**Application:**
To despise the message sent by God is to despise the One who sent it.

---

### Q27. What is the "testimony of Jesus?
“The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." Rev. 19:10.

**Answer:**
This is a crucial definition. The "Testimony of Jesus" mentioned in Revelation is not just our testimony *about* Him, but His testimony *to* us. It is defined specifically as the **Spirit of Prophecy**. It is Jesus speaking to His church through the medium of the Holy Spirit and the prophet.

---

### Q28. Why is it necessary for the church now to have confirmed in it the testimony of Christ?
“Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: so that ye come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 1:6, 7.

**Answer:**
Paul connects the "testimony of Christ" (prophecy) with the church that is "waiting for the coming of our Lord."
*   **End-Time Necessity:** As we approach the crisis of the last days, we need the guidance of Heaven more, not less. The church that is truly prepared for the Second Coming will "come behind in no gift"—meaning it will possess all the spiritual gifts, including prophecy.

---

### Q29. What will characterize the last, or "remnant," church?”
And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.

**Answer:**
This verse identifies the two specific marks of the true church in the very last days (the "remnant" of the woman's seed):

1.  **They Keep the Commandments of God:** They restore the downtrodden Law of God, including the fourth commandment Sabbath. This is the fruit of Righteousness by Faith—obedience made possible by the indwelling Christ.
2.  **They Have the Testimony of Jesus:** As defined in Rev 19:10, this is the **Spirit of Prophecy**.

**Sanctuary Connection:**
In the Most Holy Place of the earthly sanctuary, the Ark of the Covenant contained the Law of God (Commandments). Above the Law was the Mercy Seat, where the visible presence of God (Shekinah) was manifested and where God spoke to the High Priest.
Similarly, the Remnant church possesses the Law (Commandments) and the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit through the prophetic gift (Testimony of Jesus).

**Conclusion:**
God has not left His people alone in the perils of the last days. He has given the Law to show the standard of righteousness, and the Spirit of Prophecy to guide, comfort, and instruct His people until they stand on the sea of glass.
