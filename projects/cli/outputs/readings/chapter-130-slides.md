## Slide 1 – Q1: The Divine Pattern of Unity

- **Question:** What relation do the Father and the Son sustain to each other?
- **Key Text:** John 10:30 – “I and My Father are one.”

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: Unity of Character and Will

- **The Absolute Standard:**
  - The unity between the Father and Son is the source of all true unity in the universe.
  - It is not just mathematical, but a perfect unity of character, purpose, and will.
- **Unity of Character:**
  - Jesus reveals the Father’s exact nature.
  - Hebrews 1:3 – “Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.”
  - John 14:9 – “Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?”
- **Unity of Will:**
  - There is no conflict between them; Christ does the Father's will perfectly.
  - John 6:38 – “For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Foundation of the Gospel

- **A Joint Work:**
  - Salvation is not the Son placating an angry Father.
  - It is the Father and Son working together to save humanity.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:19 – “To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.”

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Tuned Instruments:**
  - Consider two musical instruments perfectly tuned to the same pitch.
  - When a note is struck on one, it is in perfect harmony with the other.
  - They are two distinct instruments, yet they produce one united sound.
  - **Lesson:** The Father and Son are distinct persons, yet they are one in the melody of holiness and love.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Christ’s Prayer for His Disciples

- **Question:** In what did Christ ask the Father in behalf of His disciples?
- **Key Text:** John 17:11 – “And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Kept by the Name

- **The Power for Unity:**
  - Christ identifies the Father's "name" as the keeping power.
  - In Scripture, a name represents character.
  - Exodus 34:6 – “And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.”
- **The Standard:**
  - We are called to be one “as We are.”
  - This unity is organic and spiritual, not a forced organizational agreement.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Unity through Sanctification

- **A Supernatural Work:**
  - Humans are naturally selfish; true unity is impossible without a change of nature.
  - **Sanctification:** The work of the Holy Spirit to purify the character.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - Unity occurs when the believer becomes like Jesus in nature and conduct.
  - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 – “But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Tied Cats:**
  - If you tie two cats together by their tails and hang them over a clothesline, you have “union” (they are connected).
  - However, you certainly do not have “unity” (they will fight).
  - **Lesson:** True unity does not come from being tied together by rules, creeds, or force. It comes from sharing the same internal life and nature of Christ.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: The Witness to the World

- **Question:** Could the church be thus, what influence would it have on unbelievers?
- **Key Text:** John 17:21 – “That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Credibility and Union

- **The Argument for the Gospel:**
  - A loving church is the strongest argument *for* the Gospel.
  - A divided church is the strongest argument *against* it.
  - The world judges the mission of Christ based on the unity of His followers.
- **Union with Christ First:**
  - We cannot be one with each other unless we are first “one in us” (in God).
  - Division ceases only when self dies.

---

## Slide 11 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Hub and the Spokes:**
  - As we submit to Christ, His righteousness is **imputed** (credited) to us and **imparted** (lived out) in us.
  - Selfish pride is the root of division; Christ’s righteousness destroys pride.
  - **The Principle:** The closer the spokes of a wheel get to the hub (Christ), the closer they automatically get to one another.

---

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Magnet:**
  - A magnet draws many iron filings to itself.
  - Because every filing holds onto the magnet, they all cling to each other.
  - If the magnet is removed, they fall apart.
  - **Lesson:** Christ is the magnet. Our unity with one another depends entirely on our contact with Him.

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Paul’s Appeal for Harmony

- **Question:** What did the apostle Paul teach on this point?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 1:10 – “Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q4: Deep Doctrinal Unity

- **Speaking the Same Thing:**
  - Paul does not settle for superficial peace.
  - Truth is one; the Holy Spirit leads into a unified understanding of the Word.
  - John 16:13 – “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.”
- **No Schisms:**
  - "Divisions" implies tears in a garment. The church is to be seamless.
- **Having the Mind of Christ:**
  - Philippians 2:5 – “Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus.”
  - We find common ground only when we surrender our opinions to the authority of the Bible.

---

## Slide 15 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Orchestra:**
  - If every musician plays whatever tune they like best, the result is noise (chaos).
  - If every musician keeps their eye on the one conductor and plays the score exactly as written, the result is a symphony (unity).
  - **Lesson:** The Bible is our score, and Christ is our Conductor.

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: The Cause of Division

- **Question:** What was a prominent cause of division in the early church?
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:29-30 – “For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q5: Departing from Truth

- **Internal Dangers:**
  - Paul warned that corruption would arise from *within* the church.
  - The goal of false teachers is to “draw away disciples after *them*” rather than pointing them to Christ.
- **Perverse Things:**
  - Distorted doctrines that mix the gospel with philosophy or legalism.
- **The Test of Truth:**
  - Unity must never be sought at the expense of truth.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: The Mystery of Iniquity

- **Question:** What did this division cause among the believers even in Paul's day?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:7 – “For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Working of Lawlessness:**
  - Even in the apostolic age, seeds of apostasy were germinating.
  - **Mystery of Iniquity:** Man seeking to become God to rule over others.
  - **Mystery of Godliness:** God becoming man to save us (1 Timothy 3:16).
- **The Antichrist Spirit:**
  - Replacing humble reliance on Christ’s righteousness with human authority and tradition.

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: The Removal of the Restrainer

- **Question:** When paganism, that which hindered the full development of this "mystery," was taken out of the way, what followed?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:8 – “And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Rise of the Papacy

- **The "Hinderer" Removed:**
  - Historically understood as the civil power of Pagan Rome.
  - When the Caesars fell and the capital moved, the Bishop of Rome filled the power vacuum.
- **Revelation of "That Wicked":**
  - A system claiming the prerogatives of Christ while obscuring His work.
- **Final Destruction:**
  - This power spans history from the fall of Rome until the Second Coming.
  - It is destroyed by the brightness of Christ’s return.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Man of Sin

- **Question:** By what name is this power elsewhere called?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 – “Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God... showing himself that he is God.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Identifiers of the Power

- **Man of Sin:**
  - Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4).
  - This power attempts to change God’s law (Daniel 7:25), setting itself above the Lawgiver.
- **Son of Perdition:**
  - A title used elsewhere only for Judas Iscariot (John 17:12).
  - Indicates a betrayer from *within* the church, not an open enemy.

---

## Slide 24 – Q8: Application (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Sitting in the Temple:**
  - Signifies a usurpation of Christ’s High Priestly ministry.
  - By establishing an earthly priesthood and the mass, this system obscures Jesus' work in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - 1 Timothy 2:5 – “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Vice-President Usurper:**
  - Imagine a vice-president entering the Oval Office while the President is alive.
  - He sits in the chair, signs laws, and changes the constitution.
  - This constitutes treason.
  - **Lesson:** This illustrates the "Man of Sin" claiming to be the Vicar (substitute) of Christ on earth, taking the place that belongs only to Jesus.

---

## Slide 26 – Q9: The Body of Christ

- **Question:** To what does the apostle liken the church?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 12:27 – “Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q9: Organic Unity and Headship

- **A Living Organism:**
  - The church is not artificial limbs strapped together; it is connected by life.
- **Christ as Head:**
  - Colossians 1:18 – “And he is the head of the body, the church...”
  - The body must obey the signals from the Head.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - As High Priest, Christ directs His church on earth from the sanctuary in heaven. We must be sensitive to His leading.

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: Members of One Another

- **Question:** And being members of Christ's body, of what else do we become members?
- **Key Text:** Romans 12:5 – “So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.”

---

## Slide 29 – Q10: Mutual Dependence

- **Interconnected:**
  - We are not independent atoms; we are interconnected tissue.
  - Just as the eye needs the hand, every believer needs the gifts of others.
- **No Lone Christians:**
  - Separation from the body often leads to spiritual coldness.
  - We belong to each other in Christ.

---

## Slide 30 – Q11: The Care of the Body

- **Question:** As members of one another, what is the duty of each?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 12:25 – “That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.”

---

## Slide 31 – Q11: Sympathy and Service

- **Shared Suffering:**
  - 1 Corinthians 12:26 – “And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it...”
- **Practical Care:**
  - Galatians 6:2 – “Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.”
- **The Cure for Schism:**
  - Division comes from pride.
  - Caring more for a brother’s welfare than our own opinion prevents schism.

---

## Slide 32 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Injured Thumb:**
  - When you hit your thumb with a hammer, the whole body reacts.
  - The knees buckle, the lungs gasp, the eyes tear up.
  - The body doesn't criticize the thumb; it rushes to comfort it.
  - **Lesson:** This is how the church should treat a struggling member—with immediate sympathy and care.

---

## Slide 33 – Q12: The United Aim

- **Question:** If the church is one, as the body of Christ, what should be its united aim?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 4:1-3 – “...walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q12: Preserving Unity

- **Character Traits of Unity:**
  - **Lowliness and Meekness:** The traits of Jesus (Matthew 11:29). Pride divides; humility unites.
  - **Forbearance:** "Putting up with" the faults of others without retaliation.
- **A Gift to Keep:**
  - Unity is created by the Spirit; our job is to "keep" it in the bond of peace.

---

## Slide 35 – Q12: Application (Fruit of the Spirit)

- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot manufacture meekness or long-suffering.
  - These are fruits of the Spirit, the result of Christ living out His life in us.
  - Galatians 5:22-23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”

---

## Slide 36 – Q13: The Watchmen’s Harmony

- **Question:** When the Lord is about to come, how will the true ministers of the gospel stand on this point?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 52:8 – “Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q13: The Gathering Time

- **Seeing Eye to Eye:**
  - Prophecy points to a final harmony among God's true ministers.
  - They see truth from God's perspective.
- **Singing Together:**
  - Represents the harmony of their message; no contradictory gospels.
- **Restoration:**
  - This unity signals that the Lord is restoring Zion (the church) to purity and power for the final harvest.

---

## Slide 38 – Q14: The Unifying Message

- **Question:** What solemn message, just before the Lord's coming, will bring this unity?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:9, 12 – “...If any man worship the beast and his image... Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

---

## Slide 39 – Q14: The Third Angel's Message

- **Separation produces Unity:**
  - Calling people *out* of Babylon (confusion) gathers them into the unity of truth.
- **Two Pillars of the Remnant:**
  1.  **The Commandments of God:** Restored obedience to the moral law, including the Sabbath.
  2.  **The Faith of Jesus:** A trust in God so deep it produces total victory over sin.

---

## Slide 40 – Q14: Application (Justification by Faith)

- **The Gospel in Verity:**
  - The Third Angel's Message combines Law and Gospel perfectly.
  - It teaches salvation by grace through a faith that works by love.
  - Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q15: The Final Cry of Victory

- **Question:** When the lord comes, what will be the united cry of these faithful ones?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 25:9 – “And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”

---

## Slide 42 – Q15: Rejoicing Together

- **"Our God":**
  - Not just "my" God, but "our" God. A collective triumph.
  - They have suffered, labored, and waited together.
- **Rejoice in HIS Salvation:**
  - Their boast is not in their own works, but in the Lamb who redeemed them.
- **The Patience of the Saints:**
  - They endured the delay and persecution, and now share the reward.

---

## Slide 43 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Besieged City:**
  - Imagine a city under siege waiting for a liberating army.
  - When the liberator breaks through, the cry of joy is a unified shout from the whole city.
  - **Lesson:** So will be the shout of the redeemed when the King of Kings appears in the clouds to take His people home.
