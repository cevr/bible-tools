## Slide 1 – Title: Obedience – The Fruit of Faith

- **Topic:** The Role of Obedience in the Plan of Salvation
- **Foundation:** The Third Angel’s Message
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 2 – Introduction: Obedience vs. Legalism

- **Common Confusion:** Many confuse obedience with legalism (trying to earn heaven by works).
- **Biblical Reality:** True obedience is the fruit of faith.
- **Source of Power:** It is the inevitable result of Christ living within the believer.
- **Reference:** Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”
- **Goal:** Restoration to God's image means harmony with His law through the Holy Spirit.

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: God’s Regard for Obedience

- **Question:** How does God regard obedience to His word?
- **Key Text:** 1 Samuel 15:22 – “Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Key Points (Nature of Obedience)

- **Surrender over Form:** God places the surrender of the will above outward religious forms (tithes, attendance, ministry).
- **King Saul’s Error:** He offered a sacrifice while willfully disregarding God’s specific instructions.
- **True Obedience:** It is "hearkening"—listening with intent to follow.
- **Motivation:** True obedience springs from love, not fear.
  - John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”
- **Ritualism:** Without a contrite heart, religious acts are an abomination.
  - Proverbs 28:9 – “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.”

## Slide 5 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **No Cloak for Sin:** We cannot cover a cherished sin with a religious offering.
- **Sanctification:** The Holy Spirit sets the believer apart, resulting in willing obedience.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”
- **The New Covenant:** Justification is the gateway to having the law written on the heart.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”

## Slide 6 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Broken Vase:**
  - Imagine a child breaks a vase by playing ball in the house after being told not to.
  - He brings his mother flowers to smooth things over, but immediately plays ball in the house again.
  - Does the mother delight in the flowers? No.
- **The Lesson:** She desires a heart that respects her word.
- **Application:** God desires the surrender of our will more than the "flowers" of formal worship.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Rebellion and Stubbornness

- **Question:** To what are rebellion and stubbornness likened?
- **Key Text:** 1 Samuel 15:23 – “For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Key Points (The Root of Sin)

- **Witchcraft (Rebellion):** Seeking power or a way other than God’s. Rebelling against the Word cuts us off from God’s power and invites the enemy's control.
- **Idolatry (Stubbornness):** Elevating the human will above the Divine will.
- **Self-Worship:** Refusing to yield to a "Thus saith the Lord" is worshipping one's own mind.
- **Origin of Sin:** This self-exaltation was the root of Lucifer's fall.
  - Isaiah 14:13-14 – “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the most High.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Saul’s Excuse

- **Question:** What excuse did Saul make for his disobedience?
- **Key Text:** 1 Samuel 15:24 – “I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Fear of Man)

- **Peer Pressure:** Saul compromised because he feared the people more than God.
- **Last Days Warning:** Majority opinion often runs contrary to God’s commandments.
  - Exodus 23:2 – “Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment.”
- **Shifted Responsibility:** True repentance admits "I have sinned" without blaming others.
  - Psalm 51:3 – “For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Definition & Illustration

- **Definition of Transgression:** Literally "stepping across" the boundary line God set for our protection.
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **Illustration – The Compass:**
  - A compass should point north. If a magnet is placed near it, the needle swings to the magnet.
  - Saul’s heart should have pointed to God, but the "magnet" of people's praise pulled him off course.
  - We must be grounded in Christ so no earthly magnet diverts our loyalty.

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Exact Obedience

- **Question:** How strictly does God require His commandments to be kept?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 4:2 – “Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points (God’s Standard)

- **No Adding:** We must not add human traditions (Legalism).
  - Matthew 15:9 – “But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”
- **No Diminishing:** We must not explain away unpopular truths (Lawlessness).
- **Perfection:** God’s law is perfect and unchangeable.
  - Psalm 19:7 – “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.”
- **Christ's Role:** Jesus came to fulfill the law and empower us to keep it.
  - Matthew 5:17 – “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Doctor's Prescription:**
  - If a doctor prescribes a specific medicine for a deadly disease, you would not say, "I will remove two ingredients and add three of my own."
  - Altering the prescription invites death.
- **Application:** God’s Word is the prescription for the sin-sick soul. We must take it exactly as the Great Physician wrote it.

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: The Messenger to Bethel

- **Question:** Who was sent from Judah to Bethel with a message from God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:1 – “And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the Lord unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Warning Against Apostasy)

- **Context:** King Jeroboam had set up counterfeit worship (golden calves) to keep people from Jerusalem.
- **God’s Mercy:** God sent a prophet ("man of God") to protest against this false worship.
- **Lesson:** God does not leave His people without warning when they drift into apostasy.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: The King’s Invitation

- **Question:** What did king Jeroboam invite the man to do?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:7 – “And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Compromise)

- **The Tactic:** The king tried to neutralize the rebuke with hospitality and bribery.
- **Enemy's Strategy:** If the truth cannot be silenced by threats, the enemy attempts to dilute it with worldly favor and "rewards."

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Refusal

- **Question:** What reply did he return to the king?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:8-9 – “If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place; for so was it charged me by the word of the Lord.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Standing Firm)

- **Separation:** To eat with the king would be to fellowship with his idolatry.
  - 1 Corinthians 5:11 – “But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater... with such an one no not to eat.”
- **Loyalty:** His refusal was based on a direct command from God.
- **Lesson:** Loyalty to God’s Word must be stronger than the allure of a palace.

---

## Slide 21 – Q8: The Old Prophet

- **Question:** Who also dwelt at Bethel?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:11 – “Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points (Spiritual Decline)

- **The Character:** An "old prophet" who once knew the truth.
- **The Condition:** He was living in the midst of idolatry without protesting against it.
- **Representation:** He represents a backslidden leader or church that retains the title of "prophet" but has lost the power and connection with Heaven.

---

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Second Invitation

- **Question:** What did this old prophet say to the man of God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:15 – “Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points (Temptation from Within)

- **New Source:** The temptation did not come from the wicked king, but from a fellow "prophet."
- **The Danger:** The test of obedience is hardest when temptation comes from within the church or from respected religious leaders.

---

## Slide 25 – Q10: The Lie

- **Question:** After hearing his refusal, and the reason for it, what did he say to the man of God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:18 – “He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points (The Test of Truth)

- **The Deception:** A claim of fresh revelation ("an angel spake") that contradicted the plain Word of God.
- **God’s Consistency:** God does not contradict Himself.
  - Malachi 3:6 – “For I am the Lord, I change not.”
- **The Standard:** If an angel or prophet speaks contrary to the Law and Testimony, they are to be rejected.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”
  - Galatians 1:8 – “But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q11: The Yielding

- **Question:** What effect did this persuasive statement have upon him?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:19 – “So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points (Delegated Conscience)

- **The Error:** He trusted the word of a man (older, experienced) over the direct Word of God.
- **Fatal Mistake:** Delegating conscience to others.
- **Lesson:** Every believer must study the Word for themselves and obey it, regardless of what others claim.

---

## Slide 29 – Q12: The Judgment

- **Question:** What was the result of his yielding to the lying importunities of the prophet?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:21-22 – “Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou has disobeyed the mouth of the Lord... thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulcher of thy fathers.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points (Faith and Obedience)

- **Severity:** The result was judgment and death.
- **Small Things?** Eating a meal seems small, but it demonstrated unbelief in God’s specific command.
- **Faith Application:** Faith is taking God at His word. Disobedience is the fruit of unbelief.
- **Warning:** Even those used by God can fall if they listen to human voices instead of the Master.

---

## Slide 31 – Q13: Sanctuary Fire

- **Question:** Where was the priest to obtain the fire with which he offered incense in the sanctuary?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 16:12 – “And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points (Sanctuary Typology)

- **Holy Fire:** The fire on the altar was originally kindled by God Himself.
- **Symbolism:** This fire represents the merit of Christ’s sacrifice and the work of the Holy Spirit.
- **Lesson:** Only the fire God provides can make our prayers (incense) acceptable. We cannot generate this light ourselves.

---

## Slide 33 – Q14: Strange Fire

- **Question:** What two priests ventured to disobey this instruction?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 10:1 – “And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points (Self-Righteousness)

- **Strange Fire:** Common fire of their own kindling.
- **Meaning:** Trying to serve God with human energy or methods rather than the sanctified power of the Holy Spirit.
- **Self-Righteousness:** Bringing our own "good works" instead of relying wholly on the merits of Christ (the true Altar).
- **A Warning:** They may have been under the influence of alcohol, clouding their discernment.
  - Leviticus 10:9 – “Do not drink wine nor strong drink... when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q15: The Consequence

- **Question:** And what came of their disobedience?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 10:2 – “And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they died before the Lord.”

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points (God’s Holiness)

- **Consuming Fire:** The presence of God is life to the obedient but a consuming fire to the disobedient.
  - Hebrews 12:29 – “For our God is a consuming fire.”
- **Reverence:** We cannot approach God in a careless, self-willed manner.
- **Salvation:** The plan of salvation saves us *from* sin, not *in* sin.

---

## Slide 37 – Q16: Examples for Us

- **Question:** For what purpose were these Old Testament examples written?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 10:11 – “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.”

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points (Antitypical Day of Atonement)

- **Admonition:** These types apply specifically to the church in the last days.
- **Sanctuary Context:** We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement. We are called to holiness and putting away sin.
- **The Conflict:** The deceptions of the "old prophet" and the temptation of "strange fire" are rampant today. The Bible is our only safeguard.

---

## Slide 39 – Q17: Doers vs. Hearers

- **Question:** In view of these examples, what ought all to do?
- **Key Text:** James 1:22 – “But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.”

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points (Practical Application)

- **Self-Deception:** Believing we are saved because we know correct doctrine, while the heart remains unchanged.
- **Living Faith:** Faith that does not lead to action is dead.
  - James 2:26 – “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”
- **Action:** If we know the truth (e.g., the Sabbath, health laws), we must live it.

## Slide 41 – Q17: Illustration

- **The Map Reader:**
  - A man may memorize a map perfectly.
  - But if he never travels, he will never reach the destination.
- **Application:** Being a "hearer only" is like memorizing the map but staying home. Being a "doer" is traveling the path to the Kingdom.

---

## Slide 42 – Q18: Entering the Kingdom

- **Question:** Who only will enter the kingdom of heaven?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:21 – “Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.”

## Slide 43 – Q18: Key Points (Imputed & Imparted Righteousness)

- **The Will of the Father:** Summarized in the Ten Commandments and the law of love.
- **No Counterfeits:** Verbal profession ("Lord, Lord") without surrender is empty.
- **Evidence of Salvation:** We are saved by Christ's merit alone (imputed righteousness), but the evidence of that salvation is a life that does the Father's will (imparted righteousness).

---

## Slide 44 – Q19: The Wise Builder

- **Question:** To whom does Christ liken the man who obeys the word of God?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:24-25 – “I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.”

## Slide 45 – Q19: Key Points (The Rock)

- **The Rock:** Jesus Christ and His unchangeable Word.
  - 1 Corinthians 10:4 – “And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.”
- **Digging Deep:** The wise builder doesn't rest on surface feelings; he anchors his life in the Word through obedience.
- **Stability:** When judgment comes, those united with Christ by obedience will stand.

---

## Slide 46 – Q20: The Foolish Builder

- **Question:** To whom does He liken him who hears, but does not obey?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:26-27 – “And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand, and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”

## Slide 47 – Q20: Key Points (The Sand)

- **The Sand:** Human theories, popular opinion, feelings, and tradition.
- **The Similarity:** Both men built houses; both heard the sayings of Jesus.
- **The Difference:** The foolish man did not *obey*. His religion was superficial.
- **The Collapse:** Without the indwelling power of Christ and obedience, the character collapses in the storm.

## Slide 48 – Q20: Illustration

- **Ships in the Harbor:**
  - Two ships look identical. One is anchored in bedrock; the other's anchor rests on shifting mud.
  - In calm weather, you cannot tell the difference.
  - When the hurricane comes, one holds fast, the other is driven onto the rocks.
- **Lesson:** Obedience is the chain that connects us to the Anchor, Christ Jesus.

---

## Slide 49 – Summary & Appeal

- **Small Deviations:** As seen with Saul and the Man of God, "small" deviations from God's command are seen as rebellion.
- **The Modern Test:** The Christian world is tested today on the Fourth Commandment.
  - **God says:** "The seventh day is the Sabbath."
  - **Tradition says:** "The first day."
- **The Choice:** Do we follow the clear Word of the Lord, or the contradictory voice of "old prophets" and tradition?
- **Final Thought:** In the judgment, only the house built on the Rock of God's Word will stand.
