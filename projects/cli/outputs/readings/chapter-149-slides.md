## Slide 1 – Title: Support of the Ministry

- **Topic:** Biblical Principles of Stewardship and Tithing
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Money and property are resources claimed by two opposing kingdoms.
  - God claims them for salvation and blessing.
  - The enemy uses them to foster selfishness and pride.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Tithing is not a legalistic payment to purchase favor.
  - It is outward evidence of a heart surrendered to Christ.
  - It is an act of faith acknowledging God as Owner and ourselves as stewards.

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: Dangers of the Worldly Minded

- **Question:** What are some of the dangers of the worldly minded?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:9 – “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Trap:** The danger is not in money itself, but in the *will* to be rich.
- **The Snare of Self-Sufficiency:**
  - Wealth whispers that we do not need God.
  - This opposes the gospel, which requires us to acknowledge our spiritual bankruptcy (Matthew 5:3).
- **Destruction and Perdition:**
  - When material gain displaces God, it breaks the first commandment.
  - This leads to eternal loss.
- **The Solution:** Stewardship—recognizing we own nothing and God owns everything.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Anchored Ship**
  - A ship is designed to float *on* the water.
  - If the water gets *into* the ship, it sinks.
  - A Christian lives in the world and may have resources.
  - However, if the love of the world gets *into* the heart, the believer drowns in destruction.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Charge to the Rich

- **Question:** What charge is given to those who have much of this world?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:17 – “Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Pride & Trust)

- **High-mindedness (Pride):**
  - Wealth often tempts people to think they are better than others.
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** All stand level at the foot of the cross; the rich need the blood of Christ just as much as the poor.
- **Misplaced Trust:**
  - Riches are "uncertain" (markets crash, thieves steal).
  - Trust must be anchored in the "living God," not the gift.
- **Sanctification:**
  - The Spirit’s work is to break the power of selfishness.
  - God desires us to be rich in faith (James 2:5).

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: God’s Ownership of Gold

- **Question:** Who claims the gold and silver of earth?
- **Key Text:** Haggai 2:8 – “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Absolute Sovereignty:** Because God is the Creator, He is the Owner.
- **No Independent Ownership:**
  - Humans are possessors or managers, not absolute owners.
- **Stewardship Implication:**
  - How we spend money is a religious act.
  - Every transaction is subject to God's review.
  - Using His resources for vice or vanity misappropriates the King's funds.

---

## Slide 9 – Q4: God’s Ownership of Nature

- **Question:** Who owns all the cattle and fowls of the earth?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 50:10, 11 – “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **God’s Sufficiency:**
  - God does not need our sacrifices because He is hungry (Psalm 50:12).
  - He already owns the "cattle on a thousand hills."
- **Why We Give:**
  - We do not give to enrich God.
  - We give to acknowledge His sovereignty.
  - Giving crushes selfishness in our own hearts.
  - It is for *our* benefit, that we may grow into the likeness of His generous character.

---

## Slide 11 – Q5: Man’s Capacity as Steward

- **Question:** Man, then, really owns nothing of this world. In what capacity does he hold property?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:14 – “For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points

- **Steward Defined:** A manager who oversees the goods of another and is accountable to the owner.
- **The Trust:**
  - Our time, talents, influence, and money are "His goods."
- **The Reckoning (Judgment):**
  - There is a day of accounting (the investigative judgment).
  - The Master will ask if we used His property to advance His kingdom or buried it in worldly pursuits.

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Cashier**
  - A bank cashier handles millions of dollars daily.
  - The money passes through his hands, but he never thinks, "This is mine."
  - He knows he is handling the bank's property.
  - Christians are God's cashiers in this world.

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: Power to Get Wealth

- **Question:** How does man have power to get wealth?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 8:18 – “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Source of Ability:** Physical strength, mental acuity, and business sense are direct gifts from God.
- **Preventing Pride:**
  - We cannot boast, "My power... hath gotten me this wealth" (Deut. 8:17).
- **Dependence on Christ:**
  - We depend on Him for spiritual righteousness (Justification).
  - We depend on Him for physical sustenance.
  - Both the bread for the body and the Bread of Life come from the same hand.

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: Attitude Towards God

- **Question:** What, then, should be one's attitude towards God?
- **Key Text:** Luke 10:27 – “And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points

- **Love and Stewardship:**
  - One cannot love God with "all your strength" while hoarding the *fruits* of that strength.
  - True love manifests in giving (John 3:16).
- **The Connection:**
  - If God has the whole heart, He will have the wallet also.
  - A converted heart leads to a consecrated purse.

---

## Slide 18 – Q8: Showing Honor

- **Question:** How may one show honor to God?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 3:9 – “Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points

- **Firstfruits Principle:**
  - We honor God by giving the very first portion, not the leftovers.
  - In ancient Israel, the first sheaf consecrated the entire harvest.
- **Priority:**
  - Paying tithe and offerings first demonstrates that God is the priority.
  - Giving what remains after luxuries are paid honors self, not God.

---

## Slide 20 – Q9: The Lord’s Claim

- **Question:** What part of one's income does the Lord claim?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 27:30 – “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points

- **Definition:** "Tithe" literally means "a tenth."
- **Current Ownership:**
  - The text says it *is* the Lord's.
  - It does not *become* His when we give it; it is His while in our paycheck.
- **Holy Substance:**
  - Just as the Sabbath is holy time, the Tithe is holy substance.
  - To use what is holy for common purposes is profanity.
  - We "return" the tithe acknowledging God's authority.

---

## Slide 22 – Q10: Withholding as Robbery

- **Question:** If one withholds from God that which belongs to Him, of what sin is he guilty?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:8 – “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points

- **The Charge:** Withholding tithe is defined by Scripture as robbery.
- **A Serious Sin:** A person may be honest with neighbors and the government, yet be considered a robber by Heaven for embezzling God's funds.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - A believer who accepts Christ as Lord cannot persistently rob Him.
  - The grace of Christ provides the power to overcome selfishness and be honest with God.

---

## Slide 24 – Q11: History of Tithing

- **Question:** How early in the history of the world do we read of tithe paying?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 7:1, 2 – “For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points

- **Predates Levitical Law:**
  - Abraham paid tithe to Melchisedec long before the Jewish nation existed.
- **Moral Obligation:**
  - Tithing is a universal principle of worship.
  - It was not merely a ceremonial law that ended at the cross.
  - It was practiced by the patriarchs as part of their covenant with God.

---

## Slide 26 – Q12: The Melchisedec Order

- **Question:** Tithes were collected under the Melchisedec priesthood. Is that order of priesthood now in existence?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 6:20 – “Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points

- **Christ as High Priest:** Jesus is our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, of the order of Melchisedec.
- **The Logic of Support:**
  - Abraham (father of the faithful) paid tithe to Melchisedec (type of Christ).
  - We (spiritual children) pay tithe to support the ministry of Christ (the Antitype).
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The earthly tabernacle required support.
  - The work of the heavenly High Priest involves a ministry on earth (the gospel) designed to be supported by tithe.

---

## Slide 28 – Q13: Works of Abraham

- **Question:** If we are Abraham's children indeed, what should we do?
- **Key Text:** John 8:39 – “Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.”

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Key Points

- **Faith and Works:**
  - We are justified by faith alone, but saving faith produces works.
  - Abraham believed God (Gen 15:6) and he gave a tenth.
- **Consistency:**
  - One cannot claim the covenant blessings of Abraham while ignoring the covenant duties of Abraham.

---

## Slide 30 – Q14: Christ’s Approval

- **Question:** Did Christ, when on earth, approve of the tithing system?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 23:23 – “Ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.”

---

## Slide 31 – Q14: Key Points

- **Christ’s Command:** "These ought ye to have done."
- **The Balance:**
  - Jesus rebuked legalism (tithing herbs while neglecting mercy).
  - He did *not* abolish tithing; He commanded both justice/mercy *and* tithing.
- **Gospel Order:**
  - Tithing is not a substitute for a converted heart.
  - However, a converted heart does not neglect tithing.

---

## Slide 32 – Q15: Old Testament Support

- **Question:** What did Paul say of those who ministered in the temple of the old dispensation?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 9:13 – “Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?”

---

## Slide 33 – Q15: Key Points

- **Sanctuary Service:**
  - Priests in the Old Testament were sustained entirely by tithes and offerings.
  - They were set apart for holy service and did not engage in secular business for their living.

---

## Slide 34 – Q16: Argument for Gospel Support

- **Question:** What does he argue from this for the support of gospel ministers?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 9:14 – “Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q16: Key Points

- **The Parallel ("Even so"):**
  - Levitical priests were supported by tithe to minister in the type (earthly sanctuary).
  - Gospel ministers are supported by tithe to minister in the antitype (pointing to the heavenly sanctuary).
- **God's Ordinance:**
  - This system is ordained by the Lord.
  - It frees the minister to devote his energies to prayer and the ministry of the Word.

---

## Slide 36 – Q17: Restrictions on Ministry

- **Question:** Who only were allowed to minister at the altar?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 16:40 – “That no stranger which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the Lord.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q17: Key Points

- **Sacred Calling:** Only those specifically called (seed of Aaron) could minister.
- **Application to Tithe:**
  - The use of tithe is restricted to the support of the ministry of the Word.
  - It is for the "service of the altar."
  - It is not for building repairs, school bills, or general charity.

---

## Slide 38 – Q18: Levite’s Living

- **Question:** What constituted the living of the Levites?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 18:21 – “And behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.”

---

## Slide 39 – Q18: Key Points

- **Tithe as Inheritance:**
  - Other tribes received land; Levi received the tithe.
- **God as Their Portion:**
  - God told Levi, "I am thy part and thine inheritance" (Num 18:20).
  - The tithe was God’s property given to sustain His workers.

---

## Slide 40 – Q19: Rendering to God

- **Question:** The tenth of the herds and of the increase of the field, God claims as His own. Lev. 27:30-32. What did the Saviour command on this point?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 22:21 – “Then saith He unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q19: Key Points

- **Dual Citizenship:**
  - We pay "tribute" (taxes) to Caesar for civil benefits.
  - We must also render to God what is His.
- **What is God's?**
  - Scripture explicitly identifies the Tithe as "the Lord's."
  - Rendering tithe fulfills Christ's command in Matthew 22.

---

## Slide 42 – Q20: Responsibility for Support

- **Question:** Who ought to feel responsible for the support of the minister?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 9:11 – “If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?”

---

## Slide 43 – Q20: Key Points

- **Reciprocity:**
  - If a minister feeds the flock with spiritual food (the Word), the flock should feed him with material ("carnal") support.
- **Fairness:**
  - This is a matter of gratitude and justice within the body of Christ.

---

## Slide 44 – Q21: Paul’s Doctrine of Duty

- **Question:** Does Paul enforce this doctrine as a duty?
- **Key Text:** Romans 15:27 – “For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.”

---

## Slide 45 – Q21: Key Points

- **A Spiritual Debt:**
  - Paul calls it a "duty" (literally, a debt).
  - Salvation is free, but spreading the message costs resources.
- **Love’s Obligation:**
  - Those blessed by the "good news" have a moral obligation to ensure it reaches others.

---

## Slide 46 – Q22: The Storehouse

- **Question:** How much of the tithes does the Lord demand to be brought into the store-house?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:10 – “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house.”

---

## Slide 47 – Q22: Key Points

- **"All" the Tithe:** God commands the full portion be returned.
- **The Storehouse:**
  - Old Testament: Temple treasury chambers (Neh. 13:12-13).
  - New Testament: The organized treasury of the church body.
- **The Purpose:**
  - "That there may be meat in mine house."
  - God’s work of warning the world should never be crippled by a lack of resources.

---

## Slide 48 – Q23: The Promise

- **Question:** What will the Lord do for those who give Him His own?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:11 – “And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.”

---

## Slide 49 – Q23: Key Points

- **Protection:** God promises to rebuke the devourer (Satan) for our sakes.
- **The Mathematics of Faith:**
  - 90% with God’s blessing accomplishes more than 100% without it.
- **The Covenant Test:**
  - God invites us: "Prove me now herewith" (Mal 3:10).
- **Spiritual Blessing:**
  - Freedom from the tyranny of selfishness.
  - Partnership with Jesus Christ in saving souls.

---

## Slide 50 – Q23: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Hose**
  - A garden hose blocked at the outlet will burst or stop flowing.
  - A hose that stays open allows water to flow freely.
  - God looks for channels through which His means can flow to the world.
  - If we remain open channels, He keeps the supply flowing.
