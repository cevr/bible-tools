## Slide 1 – Q1: Walking as He Walked

- **Question:** How alone should the Christian walk?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 2:6 – “He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also
  so to walk, even as he walked.”
- **See also:** Colossians 2:6 – “As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the
  Lord, so walk ye in him.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Righteousness by Faith

- **Union with Christ:** The Christian life is not solitary self-improvement,
  but a daily union with a living Person. To "abide" is to maintain a constant
  connection, like a branch to a vine (John 15:4–5).
- **The Standard:** We are not merely to admire Christ, but to reflect His
  character.
- **Righteousness by Faith Defined:**
  - **Justification:** Surrendering self and trusting wholly in Christ’s merits
    for pardon.
  - **Sanctification:** Relying on His indwelling Spirit for power to obey.
- **Imitation vs. Possession:** We cannot reproduce His life by human effort; we
  must possess His life.
  - Colossians 1:27 – “To whom God would make known what is the riches of the
    glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope
    of glory.”
- **The Result:** When His Spirit dwells within, obedience is the natural fruit.
  - Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
    heart.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Glove and the Hand:**
  - A glove by itself is limp and powerless; it cannot work.
  - If a living hand is inserted, the glove moves and acts exactly as the hand
    does.
  - The glove does not struggle to imitate the hand; it yields to the hand
    filling it.
- **The Lesson:** We are the glove; Christ is the Hand. We walk as He walked
  only when filled with His life.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Mind of Christ

- **Question:** What mind should be in us?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 2:5 – “Let this mind be in you, which was also in
  Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Humility & Sanctification)

- **Self-Renouncing Love:** The "mind of Christ" is the spirit of self-sacrifice
  for the good of others, contrasting with the world's pride.
- **Humility:** True greatness is found in esteeming others better than
  ourselves.
  - Philippians 2:3 – “Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in
    lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.”
- **Submission:** Christ’s mind was tuned to the Father’s will.
  - John 5:30 – “I can of mine own self do nothing... because I seek not mine
    own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.”
- **Sanctification Defined:** The progressive work of the Holy Spirit removing
  the love of sin and imparting Christ’s character.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”
- **How We Change:** By beholding Christ in His Word.
  - 2 Corinthians 3:18 – “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
    glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even
    as by the Spirit of the Lord.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Jar and the River:**
  - You cannot empty a jar of stale air by scooping it out with your hand.
  - If you plunge the jar into a flowing river, the water rushes in and drives
    the air out instantly.
- **The Lesson:** We cannot empty ourselves of pride by willpower. We must
  immerse ourselves in Christ’s love; His presence displaces the selfish mind.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Obedience in the Home

- **Question:** While yet but a child, what example of obedience to parents did
  He present to us?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:51 – “And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth,
  and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her
  heart.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Sanctifying Home Life:** Jesus, the Creator, submitted to earthly parents.
  This honors manual labor and obedience to the Fifth Commandment.
- **Holiness in Little Things:**
  - Christ’s example proves that sweeping a floor or obeying a parent is as holy
    as preaching a sermon when done for God’s glory.
  - True religion begins in the home.
- **Preparation for Ministry:** Before ministering as High Priest, Jesus learned
  faithfulness in the humble duties of Nazareth.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Foundation:**
  - A skyscraper’s foundation is hidden underground but carries the weight of
    the entire structure.
  - If the foundation is weak, the building collapses.
- **The Lesson:** Jesus’ thirty years of hidden obedience were the foundation of
  His public ministry. If we are not Christians at home, we cannot be Christians
  in public.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Childhood and Youth

- **Question:** How are His childhood and youth described?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:52 – “And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in
  favour with God and man.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **Holistic Development:** The plan of salvation restores the whole person.
- **Physical ("Stature"):** Jesus cared for His body; health laws are part of
  God's law.
- **Mental ("Wisdom"):** He studied Scripture and nature; His mind was kept
  clear of sin.
- **Spiritual/Social ("Favour"):** He maintained connection with the Father and
  kindness toward neighbors.
- **Our Growth:** We are called to grow in grace.
  - 2 Peter 3:18 – “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
    Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Example in Baptism

- **Question:** What example did He give us in regard to baptism?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 3:13–15 – “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto
  John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be
  baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him,
  Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.
  Then he suffered him.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Sanctuary & Obedience)

- **Fulfilling Righteousness:** Jesus had no sin, but was baptized to set an
  example and identify with sinners.
- **The Pledge:** Baptism is a public renunciation of sin and a pledge to live a
  new life.
  - Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
    like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even
    so we also should walk in newness of life.”
- **Sanctuary Connection:** As priests were washed before service (Exodus 29:4 –
  “And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of
  the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.”), Christ was baptized to
  inaugurate His ministry.
- **Divine Approval:** God spoke, "This is my beloved Son" (Matthew 3:17). We
  are accepted in the Beloved when we obey.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration

- **The General and the Troops:**
  - A general may not need to carry a heavy pack like a private soldier.
  - To build morale and show unity, he marches with them, carrying the same
    load.
- **The Lesson:** Jesus, the Captain of our salvation, stepped into the Jordan
  not for His own cleansing, but to march alongside us in the path of obedience.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Importance of Prayer

- **Question:** How important was prayer in His life?
- **Key Text:** Luke 6:12 – “And it came to pass in those days, that he went out
  into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.”
- **See also:** Luke 9:28 – “And it came to pass about an eight days after these
  sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to
  pray.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points

- **Dependence:** If the sinless Son of God needed all-night prayer, how much
  more do we?
  - John 5:19 – “The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father
    do...”
- **Preceding Decisions:** He prayed all night before choosing His disciples. We
  should pray before major decisions.
- **Victory over Temptation:** Prayer prepared Him for the cross.
  - Matthew 26:41 – “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the
    spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Dedicated to Service

- **Question:** To what kind of work did Jesus dedicate His life?
- **Key Text:** Acts 10:38 – “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
  Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were
  oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **Active Benevolence:** Jesus did not isolate Himself; He mingled with people
  to bless them.
- **Ministry Pattern:** He ministered to both body and soul.
  - Matthew 20:28 – “Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
    to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”
- **Our Duty:** True religion involves practical service.
  - James 1:27 – “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
    To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction...”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Illustration

- **Two Seas:**
  - The Dead Sea receives water but has no outlet; it is stagnant and lifeless.
  - The Sea of Galilee receives water and gives it out; it is teeming with life.
- **The Lesson:** The Christian who only receives truth but does not "go about
  doing good" will spiritually stagnate. We must be channels of blessing.

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Great Exchange

- **Question:** What was it that caused Jesus to leave the riches of heaven and
  come down and live here on earth?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 8:9 – “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus
  Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye
  through his poverty might be rich.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points (Grace & Righteousness)

- **His Poverty:** Christ left the glory of God to be born in a stable and die a
  criminal’s death.
- **Our Riches:** Because He took our poverty (sin and death), we receive His
  riches (righteousness and eternal life).
- **Imputed & Imparted Righteousness:**
  - **Justification:** He took our record of sin so we could have His record of
    obedience.
  - **Sanctification:** He sends His Spirit to dwell in us, enriching our
    characters.

## Slide 22 – Q9: Reaction to Mistreatment

- **Question:** When misunderstood, reviled, and mistreated, what did He do?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 2:23 – “Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again;
  when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
  righteously.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points

- **Non-Retaliation:** The natural heart strikes back; Christ’s heart loves
  enemies.
  - Isaiah 53:7 – “He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
    mouth...”
- **Trusting the Judge:** We can let go of resentment because God judges
  righteously.
  - Romans 12:19 – “Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves... for it is written,
    Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”
- **Death to Self:** Insults cannot hurt those who are dead to pride.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me...”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Burning Coal:**
  - If you throw a burning coal at someone to hurt them, you must burn your own
    hand first.
  - Holding onto anger and revenge damages the holder more than the target.
- **The Lesson:** Christ dropped the "coal" of judgment into the Father’s hands,
  leaving His own hands free to heal.

## Slide 25 – Q10: Prayer for Enemies

- **Question:** How did He pray for those who crucified Him?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:34 – “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they
  know not what they do.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points

- **Intercession:** Even while suffering, Christ pleaded for His tormentors. He
  hated the sin but loved the sinner.
- **The Standard for Us:** We cannot claim to follow Him if we harbor
  unforgiveness.
  - Matthew 6:15 – “But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
    your Father forgive your trespasses.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Prophecy of His Life

- **Question:** What did the Bible predict His life would be like?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 1:9 – “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated
  iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
  gladness above thy fellows.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **Loving Righteousness:** It is not enough to do right as a duty; we must come
  to love it.
  - Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God...”
- **Hating Iniquity:** We must develop a hatred for sin because it destroys.
- **Sanctification Defined:** Coming to be in such harmony with God that we love
  what He loves and hate what He hates.
- **Result:** True gladness (joy) comes only from righteousness.

## Slide 29 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Magnet:**
  - A magnet naturally attracts iron and repels non-magnetic material.
  - It doesn't "struggle" to do this; it is its nature.
- **The Lesson:** A heart sanctified by the Spirit is like a spiritual
  magnet—naturally drawn to purity and repelled by sin.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Power to Save

- **Question:** How powerfully can Jesus bring us salvation?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 63:1 – “Who is this that cometh from Edom... I that speak
  in righteousness, mighty to save.”

## Slide 31 – Q12: Key Points

- **Mighty to Save:** There is no habit so deep that Jesus cannot break it.
  - Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
    power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth...”
  - Isaiah 59:1 – “Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot
    save...”
- **Righteousness by Faith:** He speaks righteousness. His word has creative
  power to make the sinner righteous (Justification) and keep them righteous
  (Sanctification).

## Slide 32 – Q13: Purpose of Coming

- **Question:** What was Christ's purpose in coming to this world?
- **Key Text:** Luke 19:10 – “For the Son of man is come to seek and to save
  that which was lost.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points (Atonement)

- **The Initiative:** Man did not seek God; God sought man.
- **"Lost":** Implies value. God values the human soul.
- **To Save:** He saves from the _penalty_ (death) and _power_ (slavery) of sin.
- **Atonement:** Reconciling estranged humanity with God.
  - Romans 5:11 – “And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord
    Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Made Perfect

- **Question:** Through what was Christ made a complete and perfect Saviour?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:10 – “For it became him, for whom are all things, and
  by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain
  of their salvation perfect through sufferings.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: Key Points

- **Experiential Knowledge:** Christ was "perfected" (qualified) for His office
  as High Priest by experiencing human suffering.
- **Learning Obedience:**
  - Hebrews 5:8 – “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
    which he suffered.”
- **Our Captain:** He has walked the path before us and asks us to endure
  nothing He has not faced.

## Slide 36 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Surgeon:**
  - A surgeon may know all medical theory, but is not fully "perfected" until he
    has performed surgery.
- **The Lesson:** Christ knew suffering as God (theory), but "perfected" His
  qualification as our Sympathetic Priest by experiencing it in human flesh.

## Slide 37 – Q15: Result of Suffering

- **Question:** As a result of His suffering and temptation, what is Christ able
  to do?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:18 – “For in that he himself hath suffered being
  tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.”

## Slide 38 – Q15: Key Points (Sanctuary Priest)

- **Succour:** To run to the aid of; to help in distress.
- **Sympathy:** Because He felt the force of temptation, He knows our struggle.
- **Victory is Possible:** He was tempted as we are, yet without sin.
  - Hebrews 4:15 – “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
    the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we
    are, yet without sin.”
- **Sanctuary:** He is our Brother-Priest in the Heavenly Sanctuary.

## Slide 39 – Q16: A Complete Saviour

- **Question:** How complete a Saviour is He?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the
  uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
  intercession for them.”

## Slide 40 – Q16: Key Points (Intercession)

- **To the Uttermost:** Completely and forever. No sin is too great to forgive
  if we come to Him.
- **Present Truth:** He "ever liveth." He is active in the Heavenly Sanctuary
  right now.
- **Intercession:** Standing between the sinner and the broken law, presenting
  His blood/merits for the believer.
- **The Only Way:**
  - John 14:6 – “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no
    man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”

## Slide 41 – Q17: Kept from Falling

- **Question:** From what is He able to keep us?
- **Key Text:** Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling,
  and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
  joy.”

## Slide 42 – Q17: Key Points (Victory & Judgment)

- **Kept from Falling:** Christ provides power to keep the surrendered believer
  from sinning.
  - 1 John 3:9 – “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
    remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.”
- **Faultless:** The goal is restoration. In the judgment, God's people are
  found without fault (clothed in His righteousness).
  - Revelation 14:5 – “And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are
    without fault before the throne of God.”

## Slide 43 – Q17: Illustration

- **The Toddler:**
  - A toddler falls often when walking alone.
  - If the child holds the parent's hand tightly, they are "kept from falling."
  - If the child lets go to run into danger, they fall.
- **The Lesson:** We are safe from sin only as long as our hand is in the hand
  of Christ.

## Slide 44 – Q18: Friends of God

- **Question:** What does Jesus, our Pattern, Helper, and Friend, call those who
  accept Him?
- **Key Text:** John 15:15 – “Henceforth I call you not servants; for the
  servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for
  all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.”

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points

- **Servants vs. Friends:** Servants obey without understanding; friends share
  the Master's counsel and plans.
- **Partnership:** We voluntarily cooperate with God out of love.
  - 1 Corinthians 3:9 – “For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's
    husbandry, ye are God's building.”

## Slide 46 – Q19: What Kind of Friend?

- **Question:** What kind of friend is He?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 18:24 – “A man that hath friends must shew himself
  friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.”

## Slide 47 – Q19: Key Points

- **Faithfulness:** Human friends may leave, but Jesus remains.
  - Hebrews 13:5 – “...for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake
    thee.”
- **Availability:** He is always accessible.
  - Psalm 46:1 – “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
    trouble.”
- **Unchanging:**
  - Hebrews 13:8 – “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.”

## Slide 48 – Q20: Evidence of Friendship

- **Question:** What is the evidence of a genuine friend?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 17:17 – “A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is
  born for adversity.”

## Slide 49 – Q20: Key Points

- **Consistency:** Jesus proves His friendship most powerfully in our adversity.
- **Our Response:** We show our friendship by obedience and standing for truth.
  - John 15:14 – “Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.”
- **Conclusion:** We have the Pattern, the Helper, and the Friend.
  - 2 Corinthians 9:15 – “Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.”
