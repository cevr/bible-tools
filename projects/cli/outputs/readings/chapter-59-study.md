### Q1. For what did Christ censure the Jewish people?

"O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?" Matt. 16:3.

**Answer:**

The Lord reproved the religious leaders of His day because they were intellectually sharp regarding natural things (the weather) but spiritually blind regarding the things of God. They had studied the letter of the law, but they failed to recognize the Author of the law standing before them.

This censure highlights a dangerous spiritual condition:
1.  **External Religion:** They could interpret the physical world ("face of the sky") but ignored the spiritual realities prophesied in Scripture.
2.  **Willful Blindness:** The signs of Christ's first advent were fulfilled before their eyes, yet their hearts were hardened by pride and tradition.
3.  **The Need for Spiritual Discernment:** True discernment comes only through the Holy Spirit. As we approach the end of time, we face the same danger—being absorbed by worldly politics, economics, or science while failing to see that prophecy is fulfilling around us.

**Key Term:**
*   **Hypocrisy:** Claiming to believe God’s Word while acting contrary to its spirit; wearing a mask of religion without the inner power of a changed heart (Matthew 23:27–28).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a ship's captain who is an expert at reading the clouds and waves to navigate a storm, yet he ignores the lighthouse flashing directly in front of him warning of sharp rocks. He knows the science of the sea, but he ignores the specific warning meant to save his life. So were the Pharisees; they knew the weather, but ignored the Light of the World (John 8:12).

### Q2. What sign had Isaiah given by which Christ might be known as the Messiah?

“Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel." Isa. 7:14.

**Answer:**

The prophet Isaiah, writing centuries before the event, identified a miraculous sign: the Virgin Birth. This was not merely a biological miracle; it was the method by which God would unite with humanity.

*   **The Sign:** A virgin conceiving indicates that salvation is not of man's making. It is a divine intervention.
*   **The Name:** *Immanuel* means "God with us." This is the heart of the Gospel. God did not send a subordinate; He came Himself. In the plan of salvation, Christ took upon Himself our nature, that He might reach man where he is.
*   **The Connection to Righteousness by Faith:** Because He is "God with us," He can be "God *in* us." He took our infirmities so that He might impart to us His strength (Hebrews 2:14–18).

**Key Term:**
*   **Incarnation:** The act of God the Son taking on human flesh and nature, becoming fully man while remaining fully God (John 1:14).

### Q3. Was this fulfilled?

“Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel." Matt. 1:22, 23.

**Answer:**

Yes, the New Testament opens with the confirmation that God keeps His appointments. Matthew, writing under inspiration, links the historic event of Jesus' birth directly to the ancient prophecy.

This fulfillment teaches us two things:
1.  **Reliability of Scripture:** If God was faithful to fulfill the prophecies of the First Advent to the letter, we can be certain He will fulfill the prophecies of the Second Advent (Habakkuk 2:3).
2.  **The Mystery of Godliness:** The fulfillment was humble—a carpenter's family in a simple setting—yet it was the pivotal moment of history. God often fulfills His word in ways that prideful men overlook.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If you have a lock with a complex, unique shape, and you find a key that fits it perfectly and opens the door, you know that key was made by the locksmith for that specific lock. Prophecy is the lock; history is the key. The life of Jesus fits the lock of Isaiah’s prophecy perfectly, proving He is the one sent to open the door of salvation.

### Q4. Where had the prophet said Christ should be born?

“But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel." Micah 5:2.

**Answer:**

The prophet Micah pinpointed the exact location of the Messiah's birth: Bethlehem. This was a small, seemingly insignificant town, yet it was the city of David.

*   **God chooses the humble:** He did not choose Jerusalem, the center of power and religious pride, but Bethlehem (meaning "House of Bread").
*   **The Bread of Life:** It was fitting that the "Bread of Life" (John 6:35) should be born in the "House of Bread."
*   **Eternal Origins:** The verse in Micah continues to say His goings forth have been "from of old, from everlasting," affirming Christ's pre-existence and divinity before He was born as a babe.

---

### Q5. Where was Christ born?

“Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea." Matt. 2:1.

**Answer:**

History confirms the prophecy. Through a decree from Caesar Augustus regarding taxation (Luke 2:1–4), God moved the political machinery of the Roman Empire to ensure Mary and Joseph were in Bethlehem at the exact moment necessary to fulfill the Scripture.

*   **Sovereignty of God:** Even heathen rulers are unwitting agents in God’s hand to fulfill His word.
*   **Certainty of Faith:** We do not follow "cunningly devised fables" (2 Peter 1:16). Our faith is grounded in historical facts predicted by prophets.

### Q6. What had been predicted of His ride into Jerusalem?

“Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King cometh unto thee; He is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass." Zech. 9:9.

**Answer:**

Zechariah predicted the Triumphal Entry, but with a specific character:
*   **He is Just:** He comes with righteousness.
*   **He is Lowly:** Unlike earthly conquerors who rode warhorses to signify power and bloodshed, Christ rode a donkey, a symbol of peace and humility.
*   **He has Salvation:** His mission was not to conquer Rome, but to conquer sin and death.

**Righteousness by Faith Point:**
Christ’s kingdom is not established by force, but by love. He comes "lowly." To receive His righteousness, we too must lay down our pride. We are saved by grace, not by our own greatness (Ephesians 2:8–9).

---

### Q7. Was this fulfilled?

“All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, saying Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass." Matt. 21:4, 5.

**Answer:**

Yes. Jesus intentionally orchestrated this event to declare Himself the Messiah and to fulfill the Scripture. He accepted the homage of the people, allowing them to cry "Hosanna," which means "Save now."

This event marked the beginning of His final week—the week of the Atonement, where the Lamb of God would be slain. He rode into Jerusalem as a King, but He would be crowned with thorns to pay the penalty for our transgression of God's law.

**Key Term:**
*   **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation between God and man. It involves Christ's sacrifice (paying the debt of sin) and His priestly ministry (cleansing the sinner and the sanctuary). (Romans 5:11; Leviticus 16).

---

### Q8. Did the believers of these and other evidences of His Messiaship, expect a sign of His second coming?

“And as He sat upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came unto Him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?" Matt. 24:3.

**Answer:**

The disciples understood that the first arrival of the Messiah was not the end of the story. They associated the destruction of the temple (which Jesus had just mentioned) with the end of the age. In Matthew 24, Jesus blends the description of two events:
1.  The destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70).
2.  The final destruction of the world at His Second Coming.

This question sets the stage for the "Signs of the Times" that are relevant to us today. It shows that true disciples are always "looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God" (2 Peter 3:12).

### Q9. How does Luke record our Saviour's answer to this query?

“And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth." Luke 21:25, 26.

**Answer:**

Jesus points to signs in the natural world as markers of the end. These are not merely random weather events, but specific, predicted interruptions in the order of nature.
*   **Celestial Signs:** Disturbances in the sun, moon, and stars.
*   **Terrestrial Signs:** Distress of nations and roaring seas.
*   **Psychological Signs:** Fear and perplexity among those who do not know God.

**Sanctuary Connection:**
In the earthly sanctuary, before the High Priest came out to bless the people on the Day of Atonement, there was a time of intense solemnity. These signs in nature are the universe's way of signaling that the High Priest (Jesus) is about to finish His work in the Heavenly Sanctuary and step out to redeem His people (Daniel 12:1).

---

### Q10. What is said of these signs by an Old Testament prophet?

“And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come." Joel 2:30, 31.

**Answer:**

Joel confirms that before the "Day of the Lord" (the Second Advent), the cosmos itself will signal the event. The darkening of the sun and the moon turning to blood are specific precursors to the end.

This prophecy indicates that nature itself "groans and travails" (Romans 8:22) awaiting the redemption of God's children. These signs serve as a wake-up call to a sleeping world, urging them to repent while probation lingers.

---

### Q11. Have the sun and the moon been darkened in fulfillment of these predictions?

They have, as stated in the following: NOTE. - "But especially I mention that wonderful darkness on the 19th of May [1780]..."

**Answer:**

Yes. As historicist Bible students have long recognized, this prophecy met a literal and specific fulfillment on **May 19, 1780**, known in history as "The Dark Day."

*   **Timing:** The prophecy in Matthew 24:29 states these signs would occur "immediately after the tribulation of those days." The "tribulation" refers to the 1260 years of papal persecution (538 A.D. – 1798 A.D.). The intense persecution was cut short by the Reformation in the mid-18th century. The Dark Day occurred right at this transition point, marking the beginning of the "Time of the End."
*   **The Event:** It was not an eclipse (the moon was full). It was a supernatural darkening that covered the northeastern United States, causing birds to roost at noon and men to light candles, fearing the Judgment had come.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
When a theater manager dims the house lights, the audience knows the show is about to begin; the focus must turn to the stage. On May 19, 1780, God dimmed the lights of the sun to tell the world that the drama of the ages was entering its final act.

### Q12. Has there been a display of falling stars that would meet the specifications predicted?

The celebrated astronomer and meteorologist, Prof. Olmstead, of Yale College, says: "Those who were so fortunate as to witness the exhibition of shooting stars on the morning of Nov.13, 1833, probably saw the greatest display of celestial fire works that has ever been since the creation of the world..."

**Answer:**

Yes. On **November 13, 1833**, the great Leonid meteor shower fulfilled the prophecy of the stars falling "as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs" (Revelation 6:13).

*   **Scope:** This was seen across North America and beyond.
*   **Significance:** Coming 53 years after the Dark Day, this sign heralded the approaching close of the 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14 (which ended in 1844). It was a direct precursor to the beginning of the Investigative Judgment.
*   **Impact:** It spurred the Great Awakening and the Advent movement, leading men and women to search the Scriptures and prepare their hearts for the Lord's return.

### Q13. What may be said with reference to the late unusual ocean tempests?

Burnet, in his "Sacred Theory of the Earth," remarks: "Let us then proceed in our explication of this sign, the roaring sea and waves, applying it to the end of the world..."

**Answer:**

Jesus predicted "the sea and the waves roaring" (Luke 21:25). In recent centuries, and intensifying in our own time, we see an increase in natural disasters, tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods.

These are not just geological events; they are the voice of God speaking through nature. They testify that this earth is old, wearing out like a garment (Psalm 102:26), and is unable to sustain itself without the recreating power of God. They warn us not to build our hopes on this world, but to build on the Solid Rock, Jesus Christ.

### Q14. What other sign is to indicate the time of the end?

“But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased." Dan. 12:4.

**Answer:**

Daniel was told that his prophecies (specifically regarding the 2300 days and the sanctuary) would be "sealed" or not fully understood until the "time of the end" (the period beginning in 1798).

1.  **Religious Knowledge:** Since 1798, the study of prophecy has opened up. The truths of the Sabbath, the Sanctuary, and the Second Coming have been rediscovered. The "running to and fro" refers to diligently searching the Scriptures (Amos 8:12 context).
2.  **Scientific/General Knowledge:** The 19th and 20th centuries saw an explosion of travel and technology unparalleled in history.
3.  **The Purpose:** God allowed this increase in technology (printing press, steam, internet) to facilitate the rapid spread of the Gospel to "every nation, kindred, tongue, and people" (Revelation 14:6).

### Q15. What is predicted of the moral condition of the world in the last days?

“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof." 2 Tim. 3:15 [Note: text is 2 Tim 3:1-5].

**Answer:**

Contrary to the idea that the world will get better and better, the Bible predicts moral decay. The root of this decay is **Selfishness** ("lovers of their own selves").

*   **The Danger:** The list concludes with those "having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof." This is a warning to the church.
*   **The Form vs. The Power:**
    *   *The Form:* Going to church, professing doctrine, looking religious outwardly.
    *   *The Power:* The Gospel is the "power of God" (Romans 1:16) to save from sin. To deny the power is to claim Christ but refuse to let Him transform the character or give victory over sin.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** True religion is not a form; it is the indwelling life of Christ. We must allow the Holy Spirit to write the law on our hearts (Hebrews 8:10), making us lovers of God rather than lovers of self.

**Key Term:**
*   **Sanctification:** The process by which the believer is made holy and restored to the image of God through the power of the Holy Spirit (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

### Q16. How will the message of the Lord's coming be generally treated?

“Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days, scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." 2 Peter 3:3, 4.

**Answer:**

Peter predicts a skepticism based on **Uniformitarianism**—the belief that the world has always functioned the same way and always will.

*   **The Motive:** They scoff because they are "walking after their own lusts." If Christ is coming to judge the world, they must give up their sins. To keep their sins, they deny His coming.
*   **The Reality:** The Flood proves that things do *not* always continue as they were. God has intervened in judgment before, and He will do so again.
*   **God's Patience:** The delay is not due to God's slackness, but His mercy, "not willing that any should perish" (2 Peter 3:9).

---

### Q17. What will God's faithful servants be doing at this time?

“Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?" Matt 24:45.

**Answer:**

While the world scoffs, the faithful servant is busy working.
*   **Meat in Due Season:** This refers to "Present Truth"—the specific message from God applicable to the current time. In our day, this is the Three Angels' Messages of Revelation 14.
*   **Service:** The servant is not focused on himself, but on feeding the household.
*   **Motivation:** He serves not to *earn* salvation, but because he belongs to the Lord. His work is the fruit of his faith.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
During a long winter, a wise father ensures his family has food stored and ready for each day. He doesn't feed them summer fruit in winter. The faithful teacher of God's word gives the "winter food"—the solemn warnings and promises needed for the final crisis—to sustain the flock.

---

### Q18. What are all admonished to do when these signs have appeared?

“Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh." Matt. 24:44.

**Answer:**

The command is to **"Be ready."** This implies a state of being, not just a momentary action.

*   **What is readiness?** It is having the "wedding garment" on (Matthew 22:11–12), which is the imputed righteousness of Christ. It means living in a state of confessed sin and dependence on Jesus.
*   **The Surprise:** He comes when "ye think not." Even for the watchful, the final events will move with surprising rapidity.
*   **Practical Application:** We must live today as if it were our last, yet work as if we have years. Readiness means if Jesus came this moment, there is no known sin we are holding onto, and our trust is entirely in His merits.

### Q19. What will be done to those evil ones who say in their hearts that the Lord delays His coming?

“The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matt. 24:50, 51.

**Answer:**

The "evil servant" is not an atheist; he is a servant who believes the Master is coming *eventually*, but thinks he has plenty of time.
*   **The Fatal Error:** Believing "My Lord delayeth his coming." This leads to careless living ("smite his fellow servants") and worldly association ("eat and drink with the drunken").
*   **The Result:** He is caught unprepared. He shares the fate of the hypocrites because he knew the truth but did not live it.
*   **The Lesson:** We cannot presume upon God's grace. Today is the day of salvation. The sanctuary doors will one day close; let us enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus while there is time (Hebrews 10:19).

**Key Term:**
*   **Probation:** The period of time granted by God for men to accept salvation and have their characters transformed before the final judgment.
