### Q1. Of what family does Paul speak in Ephesians 3:14, 15?

**"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named." (Ephesians 3:14, 15)**

**Answer:**
The apostle Paul speaks of a single, united family that encompasses both the unfallen beings in the heavenly courts and the redeemed believers on earth. In God's original plan, there was no division; all creation was united in love and obedience to the Creator. Sin caused a breach, separating the earthly family from the heavenly. However, through the **atonement** made by Jesus Christ, this breach is healed.

*   **The Center of the Family:** The family is named after the Father and Jesus Christ. It is the character of God—His law of love—that binds this family together.
*   **Reunion through Christ:** The work of redemption is to bring the earthly children back into harmony with the heavenly family (Colossians 1:20).
*   **Universal Brotherhood:** While we are currently lower than the angels by nature (Psalm 8:5), through faith in Christ, we become spiritual siblings to the angels, worshipping the same King.

**[ILL]** Imagine a large family separated by a vast ocean. Those on one side (heaven) have never rebelled against the Father. Those on the other side (earth) ran away and fell into trouble. Christ is the Elder Brother who builds the bridge (the Cross) to bring the runaways back home, restoring the "whole family" to one household.

### Q2. By what name are the members of this family called?

**“Now there was a day when the sons of God [angels] came to present themselves before the Lord." (Job 1:6)**
**"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God." (1 John 3:1)**

**Answer:**
Both the unfallen angels and redeemed humans share the dignified title "sons of God."

*   **Angels:** They are "sons of God" by direct creation. They have never lost their standing or their holiness.
*   **Believers:** We are "sons of God" by **adoption** and re-creation. Though we sold our birthright through sin, God’s amazing grace restores us to the family.
*   **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** We do not earn the right to be called sons and daughters. It is a gift "bestowed" upon us. When we accept Christ, His righteousness is imputed to us (credited to our account), giving us the title to heaven. As we walk with Him, His righteousness is imparted to us (worked into our character), fitting us for the family likeness (Romans 8:14–16).

**Definition:**
*   **Adoption:** The legal act of God whereby He receives a repentant sinner as His own child, granting them full rights to the inheritance of Jesus Christ (Galatians 4:4–7).

---

### Q3. By what name are they known to us?

**“And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne." (Revelation 5:11)**

**Answer:**
To us, these heavenly beings are known as **angels**.

*   **Meaning of the Word:** The word "angel" (Greek *angelos*) simply means "messenger." It describes their office and work rather than their nature. They are God's ministers, carrying His light, His warnings, and His protection to the universe.
*   **Nature:** They are spiritual beings, higher in power and intelligence than humanity in our present state (2 Peter 2:11).

---

### Q4. Did angels exist before the death of any of the human family?

**“So He drove out the man: and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim." (Genesis 3:24)**

**Answer:**
Yes. This text proves two vital theological points:

1.  **Pre-existence:** Angels existed and were active before the first human died (Abel). Therefore, angels are not the "spirits of the dead," as popular culture often suggests.
2.  **Guardians of Holiness:** The Cherubim were placed to guard the way to the Tree of Life. This illustrates that sin cannot exist eternally. God, in His mercy, prevented sinful man from eating of the tree and immortalizing sin.

**Theological Note:** The Bible teaches that the dead "know not anything" (Ecclesiastes 9:5) and sleep until the resurrection. Angels are a distinct order of creation, made by God to serve Him.

---

### Q5. Who witnessed the laying of the foundations of the earth?

**“Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" (Job 38:6, 7)**

**Answer:**
The "morning stars" and "sons of God" (angels) witnessed the creation of the world.

*   **Joy in Creation:** They did not merely watch; they "shouted for joy." They celebrated the manifestation of God’s power and wisdom.
*   **Harmony:** Before sin entered the universe, there was perfect harmony. The song of the angels at creation will be echoed by the song of the redeemed at the re-creation of the new earth.

---

### Q6. How many of these beings did John see around the throne?

**“And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beasts and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands." (Revelation 5:11)**

**Answer:**
John saw a number expressed as "ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands."

*   **The Heavenly Sanctuary:** This scene takes place in the heavenly sanctuary, the center of God's government.
*   **Vastness:** In the Greek, "ten thousand" is a *myriad*. The phrase essentially means "myriads of myriads"—a number so vast it cannot be easily comprehended.
*   **United Praise:** They are gathered to praise the Lamb (Christ) who was slain. This shows that the entire angelic host is deeply interested in the work of Christ for our redemption.

---

### Q7. What does Paul say of their number?

**“But ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels." (Hebrews 12:22)**

**Answer:**
Paul describes them as an "innumerable company."

*   **Practical Comfort:** When a believer feels lonely or outnumbered by the forces of evil, they should remember they are allied with an uncountable army of holy beings. "They that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:16).
*   **The Heavenly City:** Faith brings us, even now, into spiritual communion with this vast assembly in the heavenly Jerusalem.

---

### Q8. What shows that those angels sent to Abraham were real beings?

**“And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat." (Genesis 18:8; see also Genesis 19:3)**

**Answer:**
The fact that they ate food prepared by Abraham demonstrates they are real, tangible beings, not merely disembodied ghosts, ideas, or impressions.

*   **Reality of the Unseen:** Just because they are usually invisible to our eyes does not mean they lack substance. They have bodies suited to their sphere of existence (1 Corinthians 15:40).
*   **Condescension:** It shows the humility of heavenly beings to sit and commune with faulty humanity, foreshadowing the time when we shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.

---

### Q9. What seems to be the principle employment of the angels?

**“Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" (Hebrews 1:14)**

**Answer:**
Their principal work is to **minister** (serve) those who are "heirs of salvation."

*   **Servants of Mercy:** Though they are greater in power, they serve us. They do not demand our worship (Revelation 19:10); rather, they work to help us worship God.
*   **Heirs of Salvation:** This refers to those who have accepted Christ by faith.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot see the battles fought for us, but God sends His angels to strengthen our faith, push back darkness, and assist us in overcoming sin. They cooperate with the Holy Spirit to bring to our remembrance the promises of God.

**[ILL]** A wealthy king assigns his strongest royal guards to watch over his toddler child. The child is weak and helpless, but the guards are strong. The angels are God's royal guard, assigned to watch over the "little ones" of Christ's family.

---

### Q10. How do they minister to God's people?

**“The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them." (Psalm 34:7)**

**Answer:**
They minister by "encamping" around believers—setting up a spiritual perimeter of protection.

*   **Condition:** The promise is for those who "fear Him." To fear God means to respect Him, reverence His law, and trust His mercy (Ecclesiastes 12:13).
*   **Deliverance:** This protection is often physical, preserving life until one's work is done, but primarily it is spiritual—shielding the mind from the overwhelming power of Satan so that we have the freedom to choose Christ.

---

### Q11. Give examples of their ministrations.

**“My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before Him innocency was found in me." (Daniel 6:22)**
*(See also 2 Kings 6:8-17; Dan. 9:21; 10:12; Acts 12:5-11)*

**Answer:**
Scripture provides numerous concrete examples:
1.  **Daniel in the Lions' Den:** An angel physically shut the mouths of hungry beasts.
2.  **Elisha (2 Kings 6):** An invisible army of fiery chariots protected the prophet from the Syrian army.
3.  **Peter (Acts 12):** An angel broke Peter's chains and led him out of a maximum-security prison.

*   **Innocency:** Note Daniel's testimony: "Innocency was found in me." This is the result of **Sanctification**. Daniel's faith led to a life of obedience, and God honored that trust.

---

### Q12. When Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his subjects to worship the golden image... how were they protected from the ravages of the fire?

**“I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the son of God." ... "Blessed be the God... who hath sent His angel, and delivered His servants that trusted in Him..." (Daniel 3:25, 28)**

**Answer:**
They were protected by the personal presence of the "Son of God" (Christ in His pre-incarnate glory) or His special angel messenger.

*   **The Test of Loyalty:** The three Hebrews refused to break the Second Commandment (idol worship), even under threat of death. They trusted God to deliver them, but even if He didn't, they would not sin (Daniel 3:18).
*   **Walking in the Fire:** The fire burned the ropes that bound them, but it did not singe their hair or clothes.
*   **Victory:** This illustrates the ultimate victory of the saints in the last days. When the "beast" commands false worship (Revelation 13), God’s people will be preserved through the fire of persecution by the presence of Jesus.

**[ILL]** Gold is put into the fire not to be destroyed, but to be purified. The only thing the fire consumed on the three Hebrews was their bonds. So it is with trials; God allows them to burn away our "bonds" of selfishness and sin, while His presence keeps us safe.

### Q13. When Elijah was to take his forty days' journey... how was he strengthened for the task?

**“And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God." (1 Kings 19:7, 8)**

**Answer:**
God sent an angel to provide physical food and water, which miraculously sustained Elijah for forty days.

*   **Tender Care:** Elijah was depressed and suicidal (1 Kings 19:4). The angel did not rebuke him for his lack of faith but ministered to his physical needs first.
*   **Divine Strength:** This foreshadows the spiritual food we need. We have a journey "too great" for human strength—the journey of overcoming sin and preparing for heaven. We must eat the "bread of life" (Jesus) to find the strength to walk (John 6:35).

---

### Q14. What interest do angels have in the plan of salvation?

**“Which things the angels desire to look into." (1 Peter 1:12)**

**Answer:**
The angels have an intense, studious interest in the plan of redemption.

*   **The Mystery of Love:** Angels, who have never sinned, marvel at the cost God was willing to pay to save rebels. The cross is a subject of endless study to them.
*   **Sanctuary Type:** In the earthly sanctuary, the golden cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant looked down reverently toward the mercy seat (Exodus 25:20). This symbolized the angelic host looking into the work of atonement—how God could be just (law) and yet the justifier (mercy) of the believer (Romans 3:26).

---

### Q15. Are they interested in individual cases?

**“Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth." (Luke 15:10)**

**Answer:**
Yes, they watch individual lives with keen interest.

*   **Joy in Heaven:** The conversion of a single soul causes a celebration in heaven. This proves that God and angels are not indifferent to us; they are emotionally invested in our salvation.
*   **Repentance:** Note that the joy is over a sinner who *repenteth*.
*   **Definition:** *Repentance* is not just saying "sorry"; it is a genuine change of mind and heart, a turning away from sin toward God (Acts 3:19). It is a gift from God that leads to reformation of life.

---

### Q16. Before whom are we said to speak when excusing ourselves from a vow?

**“Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error..." (Ecclesiastes 5:5, 6)**

**Answer:**
We speak before "the angel." This implies that angels are present, listening to our words and witnessing our vows to God.

*   **The Recording Angel:** Scripture indicates that our words and actions are recorded in heaven. The angel serves as a faithful witness.
*   **Practical Holiness:** Knowing that a holy watcher is present should lead us to be careful with our words. A Christian should not make rash promises to God or others and then casually excuse them as "mistakes."

---

### Q17. For what must men give account in the judgment?

**“But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment." (Matthew 12:36; see also Eccl. 12:13, 14)**

**Answer:**
Men must give an account for "every idle word."

*   **The Standard:** God's standard is high. It reaches beyond actions to words and thoughts.
*   **The Need for a New Heart:** "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (Matthew 12:34). If we are to stand in the judgment, we cannot merely try to control our tongue; we need a new heart created by the Holy Spirit.
*   **Cleansing:** Only the blood of Christ can wash away the record of our idle words, and only the indwelling Christ can sanctify our speech today.

---

### Q18. From what will they be judged?

**“And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works." (Revelation 20:12)**

**Answer:**
Humanity will be judged from "the books"—the records kept in heaven.

*   **The Book of Life:** Contains the names of those who have accepted God's service.
*   **The Books of Deeds:** Contain the record of life—both good and evil.
*   **According to Works:** We are saved by grace (faith), but we are judged by works. Why? Because works are the visible evidence of whether our faith was genuine (James 2:17). A profession of faith without a transformed life (sanctification) is of no value in the judgment.

**Definition:**
*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of judgment that takes place before the Second Coming, where God reviews the records to determine who has retained their faith in Christ and is ready for the Kingdom (Daniel 7:9–10).

---

### Q19. Are the actions of men recorded?

**“And the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name." (Malachi 3:16; see also Isa. 65:5, 6; Jer. 2:22)**

**Answer:**
Yes.
*   **Book of Remembrance:** Malachi specifically mentions a book that records the faithfulness, words of encouragement, and struggles of those who "feared the Lord." God does not forget our tears or our labor of love (Hebrews 6:10).
*   **Record of Sins:** Jeremiah 2:22 indicates that iniquity is also "marked" before the Lord.
*   **The Solution:** The only way to deal with the dark record of sin is to have it "blotted out" through the blood of Jesus in the sanctuary judgment (Acts 3:19).

---

### Q20. When the judgment books are opened, will the angels be present to minister before God?

**“A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him; thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened." (Daniel 7:10)**

**Answer:**
Yes. Millions of angels act as ministers and witnesses during the investigative judgment.

*   **The Courtroom:** This scene describes the Ancient of Days (the Father) taking His seat. The angels are the attendants.
*   **The Purpose:** The universe is watching God's justice. The angels act as witnesses to the fairness of God's decisions regarding every human soul.

---

### Q21. What will be done for those whose record shows them to have been overcomers?

**"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels." (Revelation 3:5)**

**Answer:**
Three specific promises are given to the overcomer:
1.  **Clothed in White Raiment:** This represents the righteousness of Christ—perfect purity. It is the "wedding garment" required for the feast.
2.  **Name Not Blotted Out:** Their name remains in the Book of Life, while their sins are blotted out forever.
3.  **Confessed before the Father:** Jesus, our High Priest, claims us as His own.

*   **What is an Overcomer?** An overcomer is not someone who never struggled, but someone who, through the power of Christ, gained the victory over the world, the flesh, and the devil. "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith" (1 John 5:4).

---

### Q22. When that work is done, and the Saviour comes to gather those who have been accounted His, who will come with Him?

**“For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every man according to his works." (Matthew 16:27)**

**Answer:**
Jesus returns with "His angels."

*   **The Glory:** Christ comes not in humility as a baby, but in the combined glory of the Father, Himself, and all the holy angels (Luke 9:26).
*   **The Escort:** The sky will be filled with the shining hosts of heaven, making the Second Coming the most visible and audible event in human history.

---

### Q23. What part will they act at this time?

**“And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." (Matthew 24:31)**

**Answer:**
The angels are the **reapers**. They will gather the "elect" (the saved) from every corner of the earth.

*   **Gathering the Family:** The angels who watched over us, recorded our lives, and protected us in danger will now personally escort us into the presence of Jesus. The "ministering spirits" finish their work by bringing the "heirs of salvation" home.

---

### Q24. Where will the saints go?

**“Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord." (1 Thessalonians 4:17)**

**Answer:**
The saints are "caught up" into the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

*   **Ascension:** We do not stay on earth immediately; we go to the "Father's house" (John 14:1–3) in the heavenly Jerusalem.
*   **Reunion:** We are caught up "together with them" (the resurrected saints). The family of earth is reunited, and then united with the family of heaven.

---

### Q25. What shout of triumph will they raise as they come out of their graves?

**"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" (1 Corinthians 15:55)**

**Answer:**
The resurrected saints shout a challenge to death itself.

*   **Victory over the Consequence of Sin:** Death was the result of sin (Romans 6:23). By conquering sin through Christ, the sting of death is removed. The grave can no longer hold God's people.

---

### Q26. What will be the final song of victory?

**“And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, Saying, Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints." (Revelation 15:3)**

**Answer:**
They sing the "Song of Moses and the Song of the Lamb."

*   **Song of Moses:** Refers to the song of deliverance sung after crossing the Red Sea (Exodus 15). It represents deliverance from enemies and the keeping of God's law.
*   **Song of the Lamb:** Refers to our redemption through the blood of Jesus.
*   **Harmony of Law and Gospel:** The final song combines the experience of obedience (Moses) with the glory of grace (The Lamb). It is a song of experience that even the angels cannot sing—the song of those who have been washed from sin and restored to the family of God.

**[ILL]** An orchestra has many instruments. In the final song of victory, the angels provide the harmony, but the redeemed of earth sing the melody—a song of grace that tells the universe, "I was lost, but Jesus found me; I was dead, but now I live."
