### Q1. What promise has been given in order that man may be redeemed from this condition?

**Scripture:** “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction." Hosea 13:14.

**Answer:**
Here is the central hope of the Christian faith. Death is not a friend to be embraced, but an enemy to be conquered. Through the entrance of sin, humanity was sold into the bondage of the grave. We had no power to liberate ourselves; the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). But God, in His infinite mercy, provides a **ransom**.

*   **The Ransom:** To ransom means to pay a price to release a captive. The price paid was the life of the Son of God (Matthew 20:28).
*   **The Redemption:** This refers not only to the spiritual buying back of the soul from sin (Justification) but the physical reclaiming of the body from the grave.
*   **The Destruction of the Grave:** God promises that the grave (Sheol/Hades) will not hold His people forever. The resurrection is the breaking of the prison bars.

**[ILL] The Paid Debt:** Imagine a man imprisoned for a debt he can never pay. He languishes in a dark cell, without hope of release. Then, a benefactor comes, pays the full sum to the court, and opens the prison door. The prisoner is legally free before he even steps out. So it is with us: Christ paid the debt at Calvary, and at the resurrection, He opens the cell door of the grave.

### Q2. Through whom will come this redemption from the grave?

**Scripture:** “For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive." 1 Corinthians 15:21, 22.

**Answer:**
The plan of salvation operates on the principle of representation.
1.  **The First Adam:** As the head of the human race, Adam’s fall brought sin and death upon all his descendants. We possess a fallen nature and are subject to mortality because of our connection to him.
2.  **The Second Adam (Christ):** Jesus came to stand where Adam fell. By His perfect life of obedience and His sacrificial death, He became the new Head of the human race (Romans 5:17–19).

Because Christ conquered death, all who are "in Christ" share in His victory. Just as surely as we inherit physical death from Adam, we inherit eternal life through faith in Jesus. This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**: we have no merit of our own, but we stand in the merit and life of our Representative.

**Definition:**
*   **Federal Headship:** The biblical principle where one person (Adam or Christ) acts on behalf of a group, their actions affecting all represented by them.

### Q3. What would have been the result to the dead had not Christ obtained their release from the grave?

**Scripture:** “For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished." Verses 16-18.

**Answer:**
This text is a powerful evidence for the Adventist understanding of the state of the dead.
*   **"Perished":** If there is no resurrection, Paul says the dead have "perished." This word means they have ceased to exist; they are lost forever.
*   **The Implication:** If the righteous dead were currently enjoying bliss in heaven as disembodied souls, Paul could not say they have "perished" without a resurrection. They would still be alive.
*   **The Necessity of Resurrection:** The Christian hope is not "dying and going to heaven," but "sleeping in the grave" until the resurrection. Without the resurrection, death would be the final end of human existence. Our entire future depends on Christ waking us up.

**[ILL] The Broken Vase:** If a beautiful vase is shattered to dust, it is ruined (perished). Unless the artist has the power to miraculously reassemble it from the dust, it remains lost forever. The resurrection is God reassembling the "dust" of our humanity into a glorified existence.

### Q4. Why did God give His only-begotten Son to the world?

**Scripture:** “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16.

**Answer:**
The motivation for the plan of salvation is the love of the Father.
*   **God Gave:** The Father did not have to be persuaded to love us by the Son; rather, the Son’s gift was the *result* of the Father’s love.
*   **To Prevent Perishing:** God’s justice requires that sin be destroyed. His love devised a way that the sinner could be separated from the sin. Christ took the "perishing" (the second death) upon Himself at the cross so that we might have the life that belongs to Him.
*   **Everlasting Life:** This life begins now through the spiritual new birth (John 5:24) and is consummated physically at the resurrection.

**Definition:**
*   **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation by which God and man are brought into unity (at-one-ment) through the life, death, and priestly ministry of Christ.

### Q5. What did the Sadducees in Christ's time deny?

**Scripture:** “Then came to Him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection." Luke 20:27.

**Answer:**
The Sadducees were the rationalists and materialists of their day. They accepted only the written Law of Moses (the Pentateuch) and rejected the oral traditions of the Pharisees. Because they did not see the resurrection clearly taught in the books of Moses (in their view), they denied the afterlife entirely, believing the soul died with the body. They represent the skeptical mind that refuses to believe in the power of God to restore life.

---

### Q6. Referring to the Old Testament, how did Christ prove the resurrection?

**Scripture:** “Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For He is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto Him." Verses 37-38.

**Answer:**
Christ met the Sadducees on their own ground—the writings of Moses (Exodus 3:6).
*   **The Logic:** Hundreds of years after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, God told Moses, "I *am* the God of Abraham." He did not say "I *was*."
*   **The Meaning:** This does not mean they are currently alive in heaven (which would contradict Paul in 1 Thessalonians 4:15–17). It means that in God’s purpose and memory, they are secure. Because God has promised to resurrect them, their life is so certain that God speaks of it as a present reality. They "live unto Him" because He guarantees their return.

**[ILL] The Architect's Plan:** An architect may point to an empty lot and say, "This is the library." It is not built yet, but in his mind and on his blueprints, the reality is so certain that he names it by its future purpose. So God looks at the sleeping saints and sees them alive by His promise.

### Q7. What example from nature is used to illustrate the resurrection and the final salvation of the righteous?

**Scripture:** “That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die." 1 Corinthians 15:36. "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." John 12:24.

**Answer:**
Nature provides a constant parable of the resurrection.
*   **The Seed:** A dry, apparently dead seed is buried in the earth. To the eye, it looks finished. But inside, there is a germ of life. When it decays, it springs forth into a new, more glorious form—the green plant.
*   **Spiritual Application:** This illustrates two things:
    1.  **Physical Resurrection:** Our bodies return to dust, but God preserves our identity to raise us in glory.
    2.  **Spiritual Sanctification:** Before we can live the life of Christ, the "old man" of self must die (Romans 6:6). We must be "buried" with Christ in baptism and daily surrender. Only when self dies can the fruit of the Spirit appear. This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**—death to self, life in Christ (Galatians 2:20).

---

### Q8. Whose voice raises the dead?

**Scripture:** “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth." John 5:28, 29.

**Answer:**
It is the voice of the Son of God, Jesus Christ.
*   **The Creator's Voice:** The same voice that spoke into the darkness saying, "Let there be light," (Genesis 1:3) will speak into the darkness of the tomb.
*   **The Good Shepherd:** Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice" (John 10:27). Even in death, the believer is tuned to the voice of their Master. When He calls, they will answer (Job 14:15).
*   **RBF Connection:** We must learn to hear and obey His voice *now* in the daily walk of sanctification (Hebrews 3:7, 15), so that we may wake with joy to His voice *then*.

---

### Q9. How many distinct groups, or classes, of people will have a resurrection?

**Scripture:** “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust." Acts 24:15.

**Answer:**
The Bible divides all of humanity into only two classes. There is no middle ground, no purgatory, and no second chance after death.
1.  **The Just:** Those who have accepted the sacrifice of Christ, whose sins have been blotted out in the heavenly sanctuary, and who have been covered by His righteousness.
2.  **The Unjust:** Those who rejected the pleadings of the Holy Spirit and held onto their sins.

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** The legal act where God declares a repentant sinner righteous, not because of their own works, but because of their faith in Christ's work.

---

### Q10. How does Christ describe these two resurrections?

**Scripture:** “All that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." John 5:28, 29.

**Answer:**
While salvation is by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8), the judgment is always according to works.
*   **Resurrection of Life:** For those who "have done good." Their good works did not save them, but were the fruit/evidence of saving faith (James 2:18). This resurrection leads to immortality.
*   **Resurrection of Damnation:** For those who "have done evil." Their works proved they had no vital connection with Christ. This resurrection leads to the second death.

**[ILL] The Fruit Tree:** You do not staple apples onto a tree to make it an apple tree; it produces apples because it *is* an apple tree. The "good done" by the righteous is the natural fruit of Christ living within them (Galatians 5:22–23).

---

### Q11. When will the resurrection of the just occur?

**Scripture:** “For The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the arch-angel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first." 1 Thessalonians 4:16. (See also 1 Corinthians 15:23.)

**Answer:**
The resurrection of the righteous does not happen individually at the moment of death. It is a grand, corporate event at the **Second Coming of Christ**.
*   **The Order:** Christ returns first. Then, the trumpet sounds. Then, the "dead in Christ" rise.
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** On the Day of Atonement, the people waited for the High Priest to come out of the Most Holy Place to bless them. We are currently waiting for Jesus to finish His work of judgment in heaven. When He steps out and descends, the sleeping saints are awakened to receive the blessing of eternal life.

---

### Q12. When are the righteous to receive their final reward?

**Scripture:** “For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just." Luke 14:14.

**Answer:**
This verse confirms that the reward is not given at death. If the righteous went to heaven at death, they would have been "recompensed" (rewarded) then. But Jesus points to the resurrection as the time of reward. Until then, the saints sleep in peace, unconscious of the passing of time, awaiting the "crown of righteousness" which the Judge will give "at that day" (2 Timothy 4:8).

---

### Q13. How did the Psalmist describe that moment when he comes to life and leaves the grave?

**Scripture:** “As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness." Psalm 17:15.

**Answer:**
David anticipated two great realities:
1.  **Beholding His Face:** The pure in heart shall see God (Matthew 5:8).
2.  **Awaking with His Likeness:** This implies a transformation.
    *   **Moral Likeness:** We must have the character of Christ (sanctification) imparted to us *now* in this life.
    *   **Physical Likeness:** We receive the glorified body *then* at the resurrection.
    *   God cannot stamp His physical image of immortality upon a character that is not morally like Him. The work of the Holy Spirit today is to carve the image of Christ into our hearts.

---

### Q14. Will our resurrection bodies be like our present bodies?

**Scripture:** “So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness,. it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body." 1 Corinthians 15:42-44.

**Answer:**
There will be a vast difference between the body that goes into the grave and the one that comes out, yet the identity remains the same.
*   **Sown vs. Raised:** The burial is like the planting of a seed.
*   **Changes:**
    *   From Corruption (decay, sickness) to **Incorruption** (eternal vitality).
    *   From Dishonor (humiliation of death) to **Glory**.
    *   From Weakness to **Power**.
    *   From Natural (flesh and blood dominance) to **Spiritual** (filled and directed wholly by the Holy Spirit).

**Definition:**
*   **Spiritual Body:** Not a ghost or immaterial spirit, but a real, tangible body (like Christ's after resurrection) that is no longer subject to the laws of sin and death, fully responsive to the Holy Spirit.

---

### Q15. After whose body will these resurrected ones be fashioned like unto?

**Scripture:** “We look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body." Philippians 3:20, 21.

**Answer:**
The standard for our future existence is Jesus Himself. After His resurrection, Jesus had a real body—He could be touched, He ate food, yet He could appear in the upper room and ascend to heaven (Luke 24:39–43).
*   **Vile Body:** Literally "body of our humiliation." Our current bodies are marred by the effects of 6,000 years of sin.
*   **Glorious Body:** We will be restored to the perfect image of God, physically and mentally. The work of redemption is not complete until the physical creation is restored as fully as the spiritual nature.

---

### Q16. In what words is the ultimate triumph over death and the grave expressed?

**Scripture:** "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" 1 Corinthians 15:55.

**Answer:**
This is the shout of the redeemed as they rise from the dust.
*   **The Sting of Death:** The sting of death is sin (v. 56). Because Christ has dealt with the sin problem through His blood (Justification) and removed the love of sin from our hearts by His Spirit (Sanctification), death has lost its "sting"—it is merely a sleep.
*   **The Victory:** The grave cannot hold those who belong to the Prince of Life. This verse marks the final defeat of the enemy that has plagued humanity since Eden.

---

### Q17. How long will the righteous live?

**Scripture:** “Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection." Luke 20:36.

**Answer:**
They will live for eternity.
*   **"Equal unto the angels":** Not that they become angels (who are a different order of creation), but they share the angels' characteristic of deathlessness.
*   **Immortality:** This is not an inherent quality of the human soul (only God has immortality, 1 Timothy 6:16), but a gift given to the righteous at the resurrection. They can die no more because they are forever connected to the Source of Life.

---

### Q18. How long does the other class wait after the first resurrection before they are raised?

**Scripture:** “And they [the righteous] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished." Rev. 20:4, 5.

**Answer:**
This period is known as the **Millennium**.
1.  **The First Resurrection:** Occurs at the Second Coming. The righteous go to heaven with Christ.
2.  **The 1,000 Years:** The righteous are in heaven engaging in the work of judgment (1 Corinthians 6:2-3), reviewing the records of history and verifying God's justice. The wicked are dead on the desolate earth, and Satan is bound by a chain of circumstances (having no one to tempt).
3.  **The Second Resurrection:** "The rest of the dead" (the wicked) are raised at the end of the 1,000 years to face final judgment.

---

### Q19. What is to be their fate?

**Scripture:** “And fire came down from heaven and devoured them." Verse 9.

**Answer:**
Following the second resurrection, the wicked, led by Satan, attempt to attack the Holy City, New Jerusalem, which has descended to earth (Revelation 21:2).
*   **The Result:** They are not tortured eternally in a conscious state, but are **devoured**.
*   **God's Justice:** This fire cleanses the earth of sin and sinners. It is God’s "strange act" (Isaiah 28:21), necessary to purify the universe so that righteousness may dwell securely.

**[ILL] The Refiner's Fire:** Fire destroys dross but refines gold. The wicked, who have identified themselves wholly with sin (the dross), are consumed along with it. The righteous, having the character of Christ (the gold), dwell in the presence of God—which is a consuming fire to sin—and are unharmed (Isaiah 33:14, 15).

---

### Q20. Who are to share this fate?

**Scripture:** “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death." Rev. 21:8.

**Answer:**
The tragedy of the second death is that it was unnecessary; Christ died to save men from this very fate.
*   **The Character of the Lost:** The list includes specific sins, but the root is the refusal to let Christ cleanse the heart. "Unbelieving" leads the list—lack of faith in Christ's power to save and transform.
*   **The Second Death:** This is the final, irreversible cessation of life. From this death, there is no resurrection. It is the complete blotting out of sin and sinners from the universe.

**RBF Application:** Victory over these sins (lying, idolatry, impurity) is promised to the believer *now* (1 John 5:4). We are saved *from* our sins, not *in* them.

---

### Q21. What is the last enemy that will be destroyed?

**Scripture:** “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." 1 Corinthians 15:26. (See Revelation 20:13, 14.)

**Answer:**
When the fire of the last days has done its work, not only are Satan and sinners gone, but death itself is destroyed.
*   **No More Death:** "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away" (Revelation 21:4).
*   **The Great Controversy Ended:** The universe is clean. The conflict is over. Christ has fully ransomed His people from the power of the grave, and love reigns supreme for eternity.

**[ILL] The Horizon:** When a storm passes, the sun breaks through and the clouds vanish, leaving a clear sky. So will the universe be when the drama of sin is finished—only the sunshine of God's love will remain.
