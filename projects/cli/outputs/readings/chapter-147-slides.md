## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Care for the Poor

- **Question:** Is the Lord indifferent to the condition of the poor?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 69:33 – “For the Lord heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.”
- **Key Text:** Psalm 72:12 – “For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Character & Sanctuary)

- **The Character of God**
  - God’s nature is love (1 John 4:8 – “He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”).
  - His law is a transcript of His character; indifference to suffering is impossible for Him.
- **The Poor in Spirit**
  - This applies physically and spiritually to those who recognize their need (Matthew 5:3 – “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”).
- **Justification by Faith**
  - Justification is God declaring a repentant sinner righteous.
  - We receive Christ’s imputed righteousness only when we admit we are destitute of merit (Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”).
- **The Sanctuary Truth**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the poor man’s offering (two turtledoves) was accepted just as the rich man’s bullock (Leviticus 5:7).
  - This foreshadowed the cross, where Christ’s blood is of infinite value for every soul.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The King's Ear**
- Imagine a great King on a throne, surrounded by loud fanfare and powerful advisors.
- Suddenly, he halts the music because he hears the faint cry of a child outside the gate.

- But the King of the Universe has an ear tuned specifically to the frequency of human need.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Christ’s Attitude

- **Question:** What was our Saviour's attitude toward the poor?

- **Key Text:** Acts 20:35 – “I have showed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **Christ’s Earthly Station**
  - The Majesty of heaven voluntarily became poor to make us rich (2 Corinthians 8:9).
  - As our High Priest, He is touched with the feeling of our infirmities because He lived without a place to lay His head.
- **The Gospel Commission**
  - The Kingdom of Grace is often most readily received by the poor of this world who are rich in faith (James 2:5).
- **Practical Righteousness (Sanctification)**
  - We cannot claim to have Christ’s righteousness *imparted* to us if we do not share His spirit of self-sacrifice.
  - A sanctified believer will inevitably follow Jesus, who "went about doing good" (Acts 10:38).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Physician's Visit**
- A doctor who only writes prescriptions from a distant office offers little comfort to the dying.

The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Deliverance)

- **Deliverance in the Time of Trouble**

- **Preservation and Strength**
  - God covenants to sustain the bed of the sick believer with supernatural comfort.
- **Reflection of the Atonement**
  - Atonement is the work of reconciliation and covering.
  - Just as we hope for God to cover our spiritual nakedness in the judgment, we show appreciation for grace by covering the physical nakedness of the poor.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Boomerang of Blessing**
- Kindness is like a seed sown in the soil.
- It may disappear from sight for a time.
- But under God’s providence, it eventually springs up to bear fruit.
- When we alleviate the suffering of others, we bank up treasures of mercy that return to us in our own hour of need.

  - However, *genuine faith works by love* (Galatians 5:6).
  - A heart that trusts God with eternal salvation will also trust Him with temporal means.
- **Stewardship**
  - We are stewards, not owners. Using the Master's goods to help His children fulfills our trust (1 Peter 4:10).

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Safe Deposit**
- If you deposit money in a failing earthly bank, you may lose it all.
- Proverbs 19:17 describes a deposit into the Bank of Heaven.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Judgment & Record)

- **The Books of Record**
  - In the heavenly sanctuary, a "book of remembrance" is written for those who fear the Lord (Malachi 3:16).

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points (Judgment & Prayer)

- **The Danger of Hard-Heartedness**
  - Hardening our hearts against a brother hardens our hearts against the Holy Spirit.
- **Condition of Answered Prayer**
  - Communion with God is affected by our conduct.
  - "If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me" (Psalm 66:18).
  - Neglecting the poor when we have power to help is a sin of omission.
- **Connection to the Judgment**
  - In the investigative judgment, a life of selfishness reveals a heart never truly broken by Christ’s love.
  - Such a person is unfit for a heaven of love.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Clogged Pipe**
- Imagine a pipe connected to a water source.
- If the outflow is blocked, the inflow eventually stops.

  - He commissions His people to provide that defense.
- **Relieving the Oppressed**
  - This involves seeking judgment (justice)—standing up for those treated unfairly.
- **The Lesson of Conversion**

  - It is the practical side of repentance: we turn from sin (justification) and learn to do well (sanctification).

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Courtroom Advocate**
- A widow stands in court with no money for a lawyer, facing a powerful accuser.
- A respected advocate steps in: "I will take her case for free."

- **Harmony of Faith and Works**
  - Righteousness by Faith is a transformative power.
  - Christ within us will produce a character that loves the unlovable and hates sin.
- **"Visiting"**
  - The Greek implies inspecting with intent to help, not just a social call.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

  - It is the "right arm" of the Third Angel's Message, preparing hearts for the gospel.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Emergency Ration**
- During a war, a soldier might skip a meal (fast).
- He does this not for ritual, but to give his rations to a starving child.
