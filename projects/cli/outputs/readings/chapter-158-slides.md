## Slide 1 – Title: Stewardship and True Riches
- **Study Topic:** Righteousness and Life – The Stewardship of Wealth
- **Focus:** God’s Ownership, Human Stewardship, and the Heart’s Allegiance
- **Key Principle:** Righteousness by Faith applied to our resources.

***

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Source of Power
- **Question:** From what source comes the power to get wealth?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 8:18 – “But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth.”

***

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points
- **God as the Source of Life:**
  - We are dependent on Him for every breath; human effort relies on His sustaining power.
  - Acts 17:25 – “Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.”
- **The Danger of Forgetfulness:**
  - We must avoid the spiritual pride of claiming, "My power... hath gotten me this wealth."
  - This attitude is the spirit of self-righteousness.
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - Just as we cannot generate wealth without God’s power, we cannot generate righteousness without Christ.
  - Stewardship begins with recognizing total dependence on God for both daily bread and the Bread of Life.
- **Definition of Stewardship:**
  - We are managers, not owners.
  - 1 Corinthians 4:2 – “Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.”

***

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Factory Worker:**
  - A worker pulls a lever to produce a product, but he does not own the machine, build the factory, or supply the electricity.
  - If he claims the factory is his because he pulled the lever, he is deluded.
  - **Lesson:** God provides the mind, health, and opportunity (the capital); we simply labor with what He provides.

***

## Slide 5 – Q2: Honoring God
- **Question:** How may we honor God?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 3:9 – “Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase.”

***

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points
- **The Principle of First-Fruits:**
  - Ancient Israel offered the first produce to God before consuming the harvest.
  - Leviticus 23:10 – “Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest.”
  - This teaches that God must be first in our thoughts and affections.
- **An Outward Sign of an Inward Grace:**
  - Tithes and offerings are an expression of faith, not payment, for God needs nothing.
  - Psalm 50:10 – “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.”
- **Overcoming Selfishness:**
  - Systematic benevolence tears away the roots of selfishness to cultivate a character like Christ’s.
  - 2 Corinthians 8:9 – “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”

***

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Farmer's Grain:**
  - A wise farmer saves his best grain for seed rather than eating it.
  - Eating the "seed corn" destroys the future.
  - **Lesson:** Giving to God is planting seeds. It may look like a loss, but it is the only way to secure a spiritual harvest (Malachi 3:10).

***

## Slide 8 – Q3: Caution Concerning Riches
- **Question:** What caution is given concerning riches?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 62:10 – “If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.”

***

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points
- **The Throne of the Heart:**
  - The heart is designed for the Holy Spirit; setting the heart on wealth displaces Christ.
  - Exodus 20:3 – “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”
- **The Deceitfulness of Wealth:**
  - Prosperity dulls spiritual senses and reduces our felt need for prayer and the High Priest.
  - Men begin to trust bank accounts rather than the blood of Christ.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - True righteousness requires the law to be written on the heart.
  - Jeremiah 31:33 – “But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.”
  - We must ask God to "circumcise" our hearts of worldly love (Deuteronomy 30:6).

***

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Anchor:**
  - A ship’s anchor cast into shifting sand or seaweed (worldly riches) will fail in a storm.
  - The anchor must be cast into solid rock.
  - **Lesson:** Our hope must be anchored "within the veil" in the heavenly sanctuary where Christ is, not in earthly gain (Hebrews 6:19).

***

## Slide 11 – Q4: Riches Kept to Our Hurt
- **Question:** Can riches be retained to our own hurt?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 5:13 – “There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.”

***

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points
- **The Law of Circulation:**
  - In creation, everything gives to sustain life (sun, ocean, earth).
  - Hoarding is contrary to nature and breaks the law of love.
- **Spiritual Atrophy:**
  - Hoarding hardens sympathies; riches become a weight dragging the soul to perdition.
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - In the judgment, God reviews how we employed our talents.
  - Unused wealth stands as a witness against the owner.
  - James 5:3 – “Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.”

***

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Dead Sea:**
  - The Sea of Galilee flows out and is full of life.
  - The Dead Sea receives water but gives nothing out; it is stagnant and lifeless.
  - **Lesson:** A Christian who receives blessings but does not pass them on becomes a spiritual "Dead Sea."

***

## Slide 14 – Q5: Example of Hoarding
- **Question:** Give an example of this.
- **Key Text:** Matthew 19:21, 22 – “Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me. But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.”

***

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Faith vs. Works)
- **The Defect in Legalism:**
  - The Rich Young Ruler kept the law outwardly but lacked the spirit of the law (love).
  - His idol was money, preventing full surrender.
- **The Call to Perfection:**
  - Jesus offered a trade: earthly trash for heavenly treasure and companionship with God.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - The young man went away sorrowful because he tried to obey in his own strength.
  - Had he asked for grace to break his chains, Christ would have given him power.
  - He could not be justified because he refused to be sanctified (separated from his idol).

***

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Trapped Monkey:**
  - A monkey grabs a nut inside a narrow-necked jar.
  - To be free, he must let go of the nut, but he refuses and is captured.
  - **Lesson:** The young ruler would not "open his hand" to let go of the world, remaining a captive of sin.

***

## Slide 17 – Q6: Difficulty of Entering the Kingdom
- **Question:** Is it easy for the rich to enter the kingdom of God?
- **Key Text:** Mark 10:23 – “And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto His disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!”

***

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points
- **Danger of Self-Sufficiency:**
  - Wealth creates a false sense of security; salvation is for the "poor in spirit" (Matthew 5:3).
- **The Laodicean Condition:**
  - The last church falsely claims to be "rich, and increased with goods" while being spiritually naked.
  - Revelation 3:17 – “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”
- **Salvation by Miracle:**
  - Only the new birth can make a rich man humble enough to enter.
  - Mark 10:27 – “And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.”

***

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Narrow Door:**
  - A very low, narrow door cannot be entered by a man carrying large baggage and wearing a proud hat.
  - He must drop the baggage and get on his knees.
  - **Lesson:** The gate to heaven is too narrow for a sinner holding onto their pride and earthly trust.

***

## Slide 20 – Q7: Charge to the Rich
- **Question:** What charge is given to the rich?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:17 – “Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.”

***

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points
- **Against High-Mindedness:**
  - Wealth breeds arrogance, but all are equal at the foot of the cross.
  - Proverbs 18:23 – “The poor useth entreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.”
- **Uncertain Riches:**
  - Economic systems, banks, and value can collapse; trusting money is building on a fault line.
- **Trust in the Living God:**
  - Trust must be in the Giver, not the gift.
  - God gives us things to enjoy so we may bless others, not hoard.

***

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Water vs. The Source:**
  - A traveler with only a canteen of water panics when it runs dry.
  - A traveler who knows the location of the spring is safe.
  - **Lesson:** Money is a canteen; God is the ever-flowing Spring.

***

## Slide 23 – Q8: Further Instructions
- **Question:** What are they further instructed to do?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:18, 19 – “That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.”

***

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points
- **Rich in Good Works:**
  - True wealth is measured by character and service.
- **Willing to Communicate:**
  - Means "to share" or hold in common; readiness to support the gospel and the needy.
- **Laying a Foundation:**
  - Works are the evidence of faith, not the cause of salvation (Ephesians 2:8).
  - By using means for God, we "lay hold" on the reality of eternal life.
- **Fitness for Heaven:**
  - Heaven is a place of ceaseless giving; sanctification fits us for that society.

***

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration
- **Currency Exchange:**
  - Moving to a foreign country requires converting money to local currency.
  - We are moving to heaven, where the currency is love and souls won.
  - **Lesson:** We "transfer" our wealth by giving to God's work now.

***

## Slide 26 – Q9: Dangers of Getting Riches
- **Question:** What dangers attend the getting of riches?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:9 – “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.”

***

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points
- **The Snare (Trap):**
  - The pursuit of money leads to compromised integrity (lies, oppression, Sabbath-breaking).
- **Hurtful Lusts:**
  - Wealth opens the door to intemperance, pride, and vanity.
- **Covetousness is Idolatry:**
  - Colossians 3:5 – “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry.”
- **Drowned in Destruction:**
  - Love of money weighs down the soul, drowning out the Holy Spirit.

***

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Bait:**
  - A fish bites the worm to get something good, not seeing the hook.
  - **Lesson:** The desire for riches is Satan’s worm; the hook is sin and death.

***

## Slide 29 – Q10: True Riches
- **Question:** What makes rich without adding sorrow?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 10:22 – “The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it.”

***

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points
- **Peace of Conscience:**
  - Wealth from fraud brings guilt; wealth from God’s providence brings peace.
- **Spiritual Wealth:**
  - Greatest riches are justification and the indwelling Spirit.
  - 1 Peter 1:8 – “Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.”
- **Contentment:**
  - Worldly wealth increases thirst like saltwater; God’s blessing satisfies.

***

## Slide 31 – Q10: Illustration
- **Manna:**
  - God provided manna as a blessing.
  - When hoarders tried to keep it selfishly against God's command, it bred worms.
  - Exodus 16:20 – “...they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank...”
  - **Lesson:** God's blessing brings life; selfish hoarding brings corruption.

***

## Slide 32 – Q11: How True Riches are Obtained
- **Question:** How are true riches obtained?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 22:4 – “By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honor, and life.”

***

## Slide 33 – Q11: Key Points
- **Humility:**
  - The prerequisite for grace; we must admit poverty to receive Christ’s riches.
  - James 4:6 – “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.”
- **The Fear of the Lord:**
  - Reverential awe and hatred of sin.
  - Proverbs 8:13 – “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.”
- **The Reward:**
  - Ultimate fulfillment is in the New Earth: Honor (child of the King) and Life (eternal).

***

## Slide 34 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Valley:**
  - Water flows down from mountains to settle in the lowest valleys.
  - **Lesson:** To receive the "water of life," we must be in the valley of humility, not the peaks of pride.

***

## Slide 35 – Q12: Happiness and Possessions
- **Question:** Does happiness depend on earthly possessions?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:15 – “And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.”

***

## Slide 36 – Q12: Key Points
- **Nature of Life:**
  - True life is union with God; objects are dead and cannot impart life.
- **The Vacuum of the Soul:**
  - The soul was made for God; filling it with things leaves the infinite gap unfilled.
- **Victory over Covetousness (RBF):**
  - We need the "expulsive power of a new affection."
  - When we love Christ supremely, earthly things lose their charm.

***

## Slide 37 – Q12: Illustration
- **The Child and the Toy:**
  - A child cries over a broken cheap toy, but forgets it when hugged by his father.
  - **Lesson:** The world offers toys; God offers the Father's embrace.

***

## Slide 38 – Q13: The Day of Wrath
- **Question:** Will silver or gold be able to deliver in the day of wrath?
- **Key Text:** Zephaniah 1:18 – “Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath.”

***

## Slide 39 – Q13: Key Points (Sanctuary & Judgment)
- **The Failure of Bribes:**
  - Earthly money works in earthly courts, but the court of heaven accepts only the blood of Jesus.
- **The Close of Probation:**
  - When the High Priest finishes His work, the "day of wrath" begins.
  - Money will not buy food or protection during the plagues.
- **The Only Covering:**
  - We must buy "gold tried in the fire" (faith/love) and "white raiment" (righteousness) now.
  - Revelation 3:18 – “I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed...”

***

## Slide 40 – Q13: Illustration
- **The Sinking Ship:**
  - When the Titanic sank, millionaires left gold behind to reach the lifeboats.
  - In the face of death, gold had no value.
  - **Lesson:** Christ is the only lifeboat.

***

## Slide 41 – Q14: Moses' Choice
- **Question:** How did Moses esteem the reproach of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:26 – “Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt; for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.”

***

## Slide 42 – Q14: Key Points
- **The Choice:**
  - Moses chose to identify with God’s people rather than be Pharaoh of Egypt.
- **The Reproach of Christ:**
  - Suffering *with* God is better than reigning *without* Him.
- **The Eye of Faith:**
  - Moses saw the invisible reality of the future reward.
  - Hebrews 11:27 – “By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.”

***

## Slide 43 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Telescope:**
  - To the naked eye, a star is a speck and a candle is bright.
  - Through a telescope, the star is a sun and the candle is nothing.
  - **Lesson:** Faith is the telescope revealing the true size of heavenly things compared to earth's trifles.

***

## Slide 44 – Q15: Two Classes of Men
- **Question:** Mention two classes of rich men.
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 13:7 – “There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing; there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.”

***

## Slide 45 – Q15: Key Points
- **Class 1: Worldly Rich / Spiritually Poor:**
  - Accumulates vast sums but has no treasure in heaven. In God's eyes, a pauper.
- **Class 2: Worldly Poor / Spiritually Rich:**
  - Self-sacrificing believers are "heirs of God."
  - Romans 8:17 – “And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ...”
- **Christ's Example:**
  - Philippians 2:7 – “But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant...”

***

## Slide 46 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Empty Box:**
  - A beautifully wrapped box that is empty is a deception.
  - A plain box filled with diamonds is valuable.
  - **Lesson:** The world looks at the wrapping (possessions); God looks at the contents (the heart).

***

## Slide 47 – Q16: Example of Class 1
- **Question:** Give an example of the first class.
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:16–20 – “And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully... But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee...”

***

## Slide 48 – Q16: Key Points
- **The Problem of "I" and "My":**
  - The man ignored God's ownership (Deut 8:18), focusing only on himself.
- **No Room for Giving:**
  - He had room for hoarding, but no room for God or the poor.
- **"Thou Fool":**
  - The world called him successful; God called him a fool.
  - He prepared for a life he couldn't keep and neglected the life eternal.

***

## Slide 49 – Q16: Illustration
- **The Sandcastle:**
  - A child builds a sandcastle and defends it, but the tide washes it away in seconds.
  - **Lesson:** The rich fool built on the sand, and the tide of death washed it all away.

***

## Slide 50 – Q17: Lesson from the Parable
- **Question:** What lesson may we learn from this parable?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:21 – “So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”

***

## Slide 51 – Q17: Key Points
- **Rich Toward God:**
  - Possessing faith, love, and a character molded by the Spirit.
  - A record of mercy in the books of heaven.
- **Misplaced Treasure:**
  - Hoarding for self fails because "you can't take it with you."
  - Giving to God sends treasure ahead.
- **Application:**
  - We become rich toward God by receiving Christ.
  - We give because we *are* His, not to *become* His.

***

## Slide 52 – Q17: Illustration
- **The Bank Transfer:**
  - If a bank is burning, a wise man transfers funds to a safe bank elsewhere.
  - The world is reserved for fire (2 Peter 3:10 – “...the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.”).
  - **Lesson:** "Rich toward God" means transferring resources to Heaven before the fire.

***

## Slide 53 – Q18: Warning to Oppressors
- **Question:** What fearful words are addressed to the rich oppressor?
- **Key Text:** James 5:2, 3 – “Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered... and shall eat your flesh as it were fire...”

***

## Slide 54 – Q18: Key Points (Prophetic Application)
- **Corrupted Riches:**
  - James foresees "last days" wealth accumulation while others suffer.
- **Oppression:**
  - Wealth gained by fraud or withholding wages (James 5:4 – “Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth...”).
- **Judgment Fire:**
  - "Rust" eating flesh implies intense remorse in the judgment.
- **Prophetic Warning:**
  - We live in these times; Adventists must avoid the spirit of hoarding.

***

## Slide 55 – Q18: Illustration
- **The Witness Stand:**
  - Imagine your possessions testifying in court.
  - Would they say, "He used us to bless"? Or, "He locked us away while neighbors starved"?

***

## Slide 56 – Q19: Poor Counted Rich
- **Question:** How may the poor of this world be counted rich?
- **Key Text:** James 2:5 – “Hearken, my beloved brethren; hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him?”

***

## Slide 57 – Q19: Key Points
- **Rich in Faith:**
  - Faith accesses the power of God and forgiveness of sins.
  - A poor man with faith has resources a wealthy atheist does not.
- **Heirs of the Kingdom:**
  - Through justification, we are adopted.
  - Romans 8:15 – “For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.”
- **God's Choice:**
  - Daily need drives the poor to dependence on God, the essence of faith.

***

## Slide 58 – Q19: Illustration
- **The Prince in Exile:**
  - A prince in rags in a foreign land looks poor but has royal blood and a kingdom waiting.
  - **Lesson:** The Christian is that prince.

***

## Slide 59 – Q20: The Eternal Inheritance
- **Question:** Can we estimate the worth of the eternal inheritance?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 64:4 – “For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside Thee, what He hath prepared for him that waiteth for Him.”

***

## Slide 60 – Q20: Key Points
- **Beyond Sense and Logic:**
  - We cannot imagine the joys of the unfallen universe.
  - 1 Corinthians 2:9 – “But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.”
- **Prepared for Waiters:**
  - The inheritance is for those who keep the "patience of the saints" (Revelation 14:12).
- **The Greatest Reward:**
  - Face-to-face fellowship with Christ is the ultimate wealth.
- **Appeal:**
  - Do not trade the eternal weight of glory for temporary, uncertain riches.

***

## Slide 61 – Q20: Illustration
- **The Acorn and the Oak:**
  - Looking at a tiny acorn, one cannot guess the mighty oak that sleeps inside.
  - **Lesson:** Looking at our current struggles, we cannot guess the glory God will reveal in us. We must trust the Gardener.
