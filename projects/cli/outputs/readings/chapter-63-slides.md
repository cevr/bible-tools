## Slide 1 – Q1: The Result of the Fall
- **Question:** Name the principal result of man's fall.
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:12 – “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Sin and Death
- **The Immediate Result:**
  - The fall brought the entrance of **sin** and its inevitable consequence, **death**.
- **The Law of Heredity:**
  - Adam was the representative head of the human race.
  - When he fell, human nature changed from holy to carnal (Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”).
  - Because the fountain was polluted, every life flowing from it shares the fallen condition.
- **Separation from Life:**
  - God is the only source of life (Psalm 36:9 – “For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.”).
  - Sin separates the soul from God (Isaiah 59:2 – “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.”).
  - Choosing sin means being cut off from vitality, making death a certainty.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application & Definitions
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - We cannot fix this condition on our own.
  - We inherited death from the "first Adam" without our consent.
  - By faith, we may inherit life and righteousness from the "second Adam," Jesus Christ, by our consent (1 Corinthians 15:22 – “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”).
- **Definitions:**
  - **Sin:** The transgression of God's law (1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”).
  - **The Fall:** The moment humanity distrusted God, resulting in a broken relationship and a decaying world.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Cut Flower:**
  - Imagine a beautiful flower cut from its bush and placed in a vase.
  - It may look alive and vibrant for a few hours or days.
  - However, it is legally and biologically dead the moment it is severed from the root because it has no source of life.
  - **Lesson:** Since the fall, humanity is "cut off" from the Source of life. Without reconnection to the Root (Christ), we must eventually wither and die.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Man in the Grave
- **Question:** In what condition is man while in the grave?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 9:10 – “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Sleep of Death
- **Suspended Activity:**
  - The Bible describes the grave as a state of **total unconsciousness**.
  - There is no work (activity), device (planning), knowledge (memory), or wisdom (thought) in the grave.
- **Soul Sleep:**
  - Scripture consistently compares death to sleep (John 11:11 – “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.”).
  - In sleep, a person is unaware of time, pain, or activity until they wake.
- **A Merciful Provision:**
  - Loved ones are not watching our sorrows or suffering in hell.
  - They are resting peacefully, awaiting the Life-giver.
- **Mortal vs. Immortal:**
  - Man is mortal; God alone has immortality (1 Timothy 6:16 – “Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto...”).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Dreamless Nap:**
  - When a tired laborer falls into a deep, dreamless sleep, the hours pass in an instant.
  - He closes his eyes, and the very next moment (to his consciousness) is the morning light.
  - **Lesson:** So it is with the dead. Adam closed his eyes thousands of years ago; to his consciousness, the next split second will be seeing the face of Jesus at the resurrection.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Promise of Redemption
- **Question:** What has been promised in order that man may be redeemed from this condition?
- **Key Text:** Hosea 13:14 – “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Ransom and Resurrection
- **Breaking the Prison:**
  - The grave is a prison house holding captives.
  - God promises to destroy the prison itself ("O grave, I will be thy destruction").
- **The Cost of Ransom:**
  - A ransom is the price paid to deliver a captive.
  - The price to release us from death was the life of the Son of God (Matthew 20:28 – “Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We are "sold under sin" and cannot ransom ourselves (Romans 7:14 – “For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.”).
  - Our deliverance relies entirely on Christ’s merit and payment, not our own penance.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Agent of Redemption
- **Question:** Through whom will come this redemption from the grave?
- **Key Text 1:** 1 Corinthians 15:21, 22 – “For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so In Christ shall all be made alive.”
- **Key Text 2:** John 5:26 – “For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: In Christ Shall All Be Made Alive
- **The Two Representatives:**
  - **Adam:** Opened the door to sin and death through disobedience.
  - **Christ:** Opened the door to righteousness and life through perfect obedience and sacrifice.
- **The Key to the Grave:**
  - Jesus holds the "keys of hell and of death" because He conquered the tomb (Revelation 1:18 – “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.”).
- **Union with Christ:**
  - "In Christ" is the vital condition.
  - Righteousness by faith means Christ's life becomes our life (Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me...”); this ensures our resurrection.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Head and the Body:**
  - If a man is submerged in water, as long as his head breaks the surface and rises, the body will surely follow.
  - **Lesson:** Christ is the Head of the church (the body). Because the Head has risen above the waters of death, the body is guaranteed to rise also.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Without the Resurrection?
- **Question:** What would be the result to the dead had not Christ procured their release from the grave?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:16-18 – “For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Perished Forever
- **No Natural Immortality:**
  - If souls went to heaven at death, Paul could not say they have "perished" without a resurrection.
  - This verse proves that without the resurrection, there is no afterlife.
- **Necessity of the Resurrection:**
  - If the grave is the end, the plan of salvation has failed and sin has won.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The High Priest's work is not finished until He comes out of the sanctuary to bless the people.
  - If Christ remained in the tomb (or if we remain in ours), the atonement is not completed in the restoration of the believer.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Location of the Dead
- **Question:** Where are the dead when they hear the voice of Christ calling them to life?
- **Key Text:** John 5:28, 29 – “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Called From the Dust
- **Location:**
  - Jesus affirms the dead are **in the graves**, not in heaven or hell.
  - They are called "forth" just as Lazarus was (John 11:43).
- **The Voice of the Archangel:**
  - It is Christ's voice that wakes the dead (1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel...”).
  - This same voice spoke the worlds into existence; re-creation is an act of the same power.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Roll Call:**
  - In a military barracks, soldiers sleep in their bunks, unconscious of the night passing.
  - When the morning bugle (reveille) sounds, they rise to duty.
  - **Lesson:** The grave is the dormitory of the earth; the voice of Jesus is the reveille that wakes the sleeping saints.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Two Classes
- **Question:** How many distinct classes will have a resurrection?
- **Key Text:** Acts 24:15 – “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Just and the Unjust
- **The Just:**
  - Those who accepted Christ’s sacrifice.
  - Their sins are blotted out in judgment, covered by the robe of Christ’s righteousness.
- **The Unjust:**
  - Those who rejected salvation and held onto their sins.
- **Universal Resurrection:**
  - No one stays in the grave forever. Everyone rises to face God’s judgment.
- **Justification Defined:**
  - The legal declaration by God that a sinner is righteous, based solely on faith in Christ's atoning blood.

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Timing of Resurrections
- **Question:** How long do the others wait after the first resurrection?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:4, 5 – “And they [the righteous] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: The Thousand Years
- **The First Resurrection:**
  - Occurs at the Second Coming.
  - It is for the "blessed and holy" (Revelation 20:6).
- **The Gap (Millennium):**
  - The "rest of the dead" (the wicked) wait in their graves for **one thousand years**.
  - During this time, the righteous are in heaven judging (1 Corinthians 6:2–3) and the earth lies desolate.
- **The Second Resurrection:**
  - Occurs at the end of the 1,000 years (resurrection of damnation).

## Slide 22 – Q9: The Time of Reward
- **Question:** When are the righteous recompensed?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:14 – “For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Recompense at Resurrection
- **Future Reward:**
  - Believers do not receive their reward immediately at death.
  - Jesus points to the resurrection day as the time of victory.
- **Sanctuary & Judgment:**
  - Before the reward is given, the **Investigative Judgment** takes place in the heavenly sanctuary (Daniel 7:9–10).
  - When Christ returns, He brings the reward with Him (Revelation 22:12 – “And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”).

## Slide 24 – Q10: David’s Expectation
- **Question:** In what condition did David expect to rise?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 17:15 – “As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Likeness and Satisfaction
- **Restoration of God's Image:**
  - Salvation restores the image of God (Genesis 1:26).
  - **Sanctification:** Restores the moral character now.
  - **Resurrection:** Restores the physical image then.
- **Righteousness Realized:**
  - David dies trusting in God's righteousness and wakes up fully restored, free from sin's presence.
- **Satisfaction:**
  - The glory of that moment outweighs all earthly suffering.

## Slide 26 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Silversmith:**
  - A silversmith refines silver until he can see his own face perfectly reflected in it.
  - **Lesson:** God refines His people through trials (sanctification) until His character is reflected in them. At the resurrection, this work is complete—we reflect His likeness perfectly in body and soul.

## Slide 27 – Q11: A Glorious Contrast
- **Question:** What great contrast will be seen between the present body, and the one to be put on at the resurrection?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:42-44 – “So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory, it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown in a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: From Mortal to Immortal
- **The Transformation:**
  - **Sown:** Corruption, Dishonor, Weakness, Natural.
  - **Raised:** Incorruption (ageless), Glory (radiant), Power (tireless), Spiritual.
- **What is a "Spiritual Body"?**
  - Not a ghost or spirit-essence.
  - A real, tangible body (Luke 24:39 – “Handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.”).
  - It is "spiritual" because it is fully energized and directed by the Holy Spirit, no longer subject to sinful appetites or death.

## Slide 29 – Q12: Fashioned Like Christ
- **Question:** After whose body will the resurrected ones be fashioned?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 3:20, 21 – “We look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: The Pattern
- **The Glorious Body:**
  - Jesus is the "firstfruits" (1 Corinthians 15:20). As He rose, so shall we.
  - He is a glorified Human-Divine being.
- **Identity Preserved:**
  - Limitations ("vile" or humble state) are removed, but individuality remains. We will know one another.
- **Sanctuary Thought:**
  - The High Priest bears the names of His people on His breastplate.
  - He carried humanity into heaven, and He will bring that glorified humanity back to us.

## Slide 31 – Q13: The Joy of Rising
- **Question:** What will the righteous do upon rising from the grave?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 26:19 – “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Awake and Sing
- **The Song of Victory:**
  - The first sound from the resurrected saints is a shout of triumph.
  - 1 Corinthians 15:55 – “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”
- **From Dust to Life:**
  - "Dew of herbs" implies fresh, springing vitality.
  - God's power revives the dust just as rain revives the grass.
- **The Contrast:**
  - No fear, only relief. The Great Controversy is over for them; the battle is won.

## Slide 33 – Q14: Eternal Life
- **Question:** How long will they be permitted to live?
- **Key Text:** Luke 20:36 – “Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Children of the Resurrection
- **Die No More:**
  - They will live forever.
  - "Equal unto the angels" refers to their state of immortality, not their nature.
- **Children of the Resurrection:**
  - A new kind of birth—born from the grave into eternal life.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - Eternal life is a gift (Romans 6:23). We do not possess it inherently.
  - We receive it through relationship with Christ. Because He lives, we live also (John 14:19).

## Slide 35 – Q15: The Fate of the Unworthy
- **Question:** What will become of those who are unworthy of a part in the first resurrection?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 21:8 – “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable... and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.”

## Slide 36 – Q15: The Second Death
- **Character of the Lost:**
  - Includes the "unbelieving" and "fearful" alongside open sinners.
  - Salvation is about a transformed character; a heart not cleansed by Christ cannot exist in a holy heaven.
- **The Second Death:**
  - This is total destruction, not eternal life in torture (Malachi 4:1 – “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven... and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble...”).
  - From the second death, there is no return.
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - This is the final "cleansing of the camp." Sin is consumed so the universe may be clean (God's "strange act" - Isaiah 28:21).

## Slide 37 – Q16: The Destruction of Death
- **Question:** What will then take place?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:26 – “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”

## Slide 38 – Q16: The End of the Enemy
- **Death Destroyed:**
  - Death is an "enemy," an intruder into God's creation.
  - It is cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14).
- **No More Sorrow:**
  - The universe is restored to perfection.
  - Revelation 21:4 – “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying...”
- **Vindication:**
  - God has proven that His law is a law of life, and sin is a law of death.

## Slide 39 – Q17: The Final Appearance
- **Question:** How will the righteous ever afterward appear?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 13:43 – “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.”

## Slide 40 – Q17: Shining as the Sun
- **Glorification:**
  - The redeemed reflect the physical light of God's glory.
- **Moral Reflection:**
  - The universe sees the character of Christ perfectly reproduced in His people.
- **The Climax of Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The sinner, once dark with guilt, has been:
    1. Washed.
    2. Justified.
    3. Sanctified.
    4. Glorified.

## Slide 41 – Q17: Illustration
- **The Diamond:**
  - A rough diamond looks like a common pebble.
  - After the Gem Cutter cuts and polishes it (sanctification) and places it in the sunlight (glorification), it blazes with fire.
  - **Lesson:** We are God's jewels (Malachi 3:17), destined to shine in His kingdom forever.
