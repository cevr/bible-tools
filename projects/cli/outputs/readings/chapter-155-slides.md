## Slide 1 – Q1: Definition of Backsliding

- **Question:** What constitutes backsliding, and how does God regard it?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 2:19 – “Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee; know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that My fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **Definition:** Backsliding is a gradual or sudden turning away from a previous position of faith and obedience.
- **A Breach of Relationship:**
  - It is an "evil thing and bitter" because it involves forsaking the Lord personally.
  - The end result of sin is separation from God and death (Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”).
- **The Root Cause:** "My fear is not in thee."
  - When reverence for God and His law fades, the life slides backward.
- **Inherent Consequence:** "Thine own wickedness shall correct thee."
  - God does not punish arbitrarily; the backslider punishes himself by walking away from the Source of peace.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Drifting Boat**
- Imagine a rowboat fighting against a strong river current.
- As long as the rower pulls on the oars (faith and active cooperation with God), the boat stays steady or moves forward.
- If the rower stops, the boat does not stand still; it immediately drifts backward.
- **Lesson:** There is no neutral ground. We are either advancing in grace or sliding back toward the world.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Human Tendency

- **Question:** What is the tendency on the part of professed Christians?
- **Key Text:** Hosea 11:7 – “And My people are bent to backsliding from Me.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **"Bent" to Backsliding:**
  - The word "bent" means inclined or prone to.
  - The carnal nature acts like gravity, pulling the soul earthward (Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”).
- **The Need for Constant Power:**
  - Because of this tendency, we cannot rely on a past conversion experience.
  - We need a present-tense connection with Christ.
- **Warning Against Self-Confidence:**
  - 1 Corinthians 10:12 – “Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **We Cannot Be Righteous Alone:**
  - This tendency proves we cannot be righteous by our own power.
  - Left to ourselves, we will naturally slide back.
- **Abiding in the Vine:**
  - True righteousness is found only by abiding in Jesus (John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.”).
  - Like a bent branch held straight by a brace, our nature must be held in the righteousness of Christ moment by moment.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Reasons for Backsliding

- **Question:** What is the reason of this tendency?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 8:5, 6 – “Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? everyone turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Perpetual Backsliding:** A state where the soul remains fallen without recovery.
- **Holding Fast Deceit:**
  - The backslider convinces himself "all is well" while disobeying.
  - 2 Timothy 3:5 – “Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”
- **Refusal to Repent:**
  - "No man repented... saying, What have I done?"
  - Backsliding becomes permanent when self-examination ceases.
- **Headlong Presumption:**
  - Like a "horse rushing into battle," the sinner acts on impulse and feeling rather than on the Word of God.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Broken Compass**
- A hiker lost in the woods who refuses to look at his compass because it contradicts his feelings will wander deeper into trouble.
- The "deceit" is believing intuition over magnetic north.
- **Lesson:** The Bible is our compass. Backsliding occurs when we hold to our own opinions rather than "Thus saith the Lord."

## Slide 10 – Q4: God’s View of the Backslider

- **Question:** How does the Lord regard the backslider?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 3:20 – “Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **A Personal Betrayal:**
  - God uses marriage to describe His covenant.
  - Backsliding is spiritual adultery (James 4:4 – “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?...”).
- **Grieving the Divine Heart:**
  - It is not just breaking a rule; it is breaking God's heart.
  - God is the faithful Husband (Isaiah 54:5 – “For thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name...”).
  - We have wounded the One who died for us.

## Slide 12 – Q5: The First Step to Return

- **Question:** In order to have the favor of the Lord again, what must the backslider first do?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 3:13 – “Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou has transgressed against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed My voice, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **Acknowledge Iniquity:**
  - We cannot be healed until we admit we are sick.
  - This is the work of the Spirit (John 16:8 – “And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.”).
- **Confession:**
  - In the sanctuary, the sinner had to lay a hand on the sacrifice and confess (Leviticus 4:29 – “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.”).
- **No Excuses:**
  - God asks for a broken heart, not justifications (Psalm 51:17 – “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.”).

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Doctor's Diagnosis**
- If a patient has a deadly infection but says, "It is just a scratch," the doctor cannot prescribe the cure.
- Confession is simply agreeing with God’s diagnosis of our condition.
- Once we admit the sickness, God can apply the remedy of Christ’s blood.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Repentance and Pardon

- **Question:** What further work must be done to meet the requirements of God?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 55:7 – “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points

- **Forsaking the Way:**
  - Repentance is a change of mind leading to a change of action.
  - Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness (Titus 2:11, 12 – “For the grace of God... Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.”).
- **Forsaking the Thoughts:**
  - Sin begins in the mind; therefore, the "unrighteous man" must forsake his own reasoning.
- **Justification:**
  - God promises to "abundantly pardon."
  - He removes the penalty and imputes Christ's perfect record to the believer.
  - **Note:** We come to Christ *in order* to be changed; we do not change ourselves to come to Him.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Transforming the Mind

- **Question:** Why is it necessary for the unrighteous to forsake their thoughts?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 55:8 – “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Conflict:**
  - The carnal mind is enmity against God (Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”).
  - Human thoughts are selfish and flawed; God’s thoughts are holy and eternal.
- **The Cure:**
  - We must exchange our thoughts for God's thoughts through the Word.
  - Jeremiah 15:16 – “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart...”
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - The Showbread in the Holy Place represented the Word of God.
  - As the priest ate the bread, we must feed on God's Word to have the mind of Christ (Philippians 2:5).

## Slide 19 – Q8: Prevention of Backsliding

- **Question:** What is especially necessary to prevent backsliding?
- **Key Text:** Mark 14:38 – “Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

- **Watchfulness:**
  - Like a sentry on a wall, we must guard the avenues of the soul (eyes and ears).
- **Prayer:**
  - Watching reveals the danger; prayer connects us to the Power that defeats it.
- **Weakness of the Flesh:**
  - Even a willing spirit is housed in fallen flesh.
  - We cannot relax our vigilance for a moment.

## Slide 21 – Q8: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Campfire**
- A campfire burns brightly only as long as logs are added and it is tended.
- If the camper falls asleep and neglects it, the fire naturally dies down to cold ash.
- **Lesson:** Prayer and watching are the tending of our spiritual flame.

## Slide 22 – Q9: The Test of Faith

- **Question:** What is necessary on the part of believers to show that they are not reprobates?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 13:5 – “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points

- **Definition of Reprobate:**
  - One who has failed the test; like dross silver rejected by the refiner (Jeremiah 6:30 – “Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them.”).
- **The True Test:**
  - The test is not church membership, but **"Is Jesus Christ in you?"**
  - Colossians 1:27 – “...Christ in you, the hope of glory.”
- **Self-Examination:**
  - If Christ dwells within, He will live out His obedience through us.
  - Backsliding occurs when this inner presence is lost.

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Law in the Heart

- **Question:** If one has the law of God in the heart, what will it do for him?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 37:31 – “The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points

- **The New Covenant Promise:**
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “...I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”
- **Internal vs. External:**
  - If the Law is only on stone or in a book, we fail.
  - When the Law (God's character) is in the heart, obedience becomes natural.
  - Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”
- **Stability:**
  - "None of his steps shall slide."
  - This is not legalism; it is the result of Christ (the Living Law) dwelling in us.

## Slide 26 – Q11: Historical Backsliding

- **Question:** In what particular does the Lord rebuke His people for their backslidings?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:7 – “Even from the days of your fathers, ye are gone away from Mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto Me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points

- **Neglected Ordinances:**
  - God notes a long-standing pattern of drifting from His statutes.
- **Spiritual Blindness:**
  - The people ask, "Wherein shall we return?" indicating they did not realize their condition.
  - This mirrors the Laodicean condition—feeling rich but being spiritually poor (Revelation 3:17 – “Because thou sayest, I am rich... and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”).

## Slide 28 – Q12: Evidence of Backsliding (Stewardship)

- **Question:** When the people asked in what thing they should return to Him, what neglect did He point out?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:8 – “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points

- **Robbery of God:**
  - Withholding tithe is considered robbery because "The earth is the Lord's" (Psalm 24:1).
- **The Heart Connection:**
  - When people stop returning tithe, it shows the heart has grown selfish.
  - Matthew 6:21 – “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Tithe supports the ministry of the sanctuary (Numbers 18:21 – “And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance...”).
  - Withholding it neglects the plan of salvation.

## Slide 30 – Q13: The Remedy and Promise

- **Question:** What remedy did the Lord propose, to rescue the people from their backslidings, and bring them where they could again have the blessings of Heaven?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:10 – “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Challenge:** "Prove Me now." God invites us to test His faithfulness.
- **The Action:** "Bring ye all the tithes."
  - This requires faith to put God first over finances.
  - It breaks the idol of selfishness.
- **The Promise:** "Windows of heaven."
  - A pouring out of spiritual power and grace, similar to the Flood, but in blessing.

## Slide 32 – Q13: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Pump**
- In old hand-pumps, one had to pour a little water in (priming it) before the well water would flow.
- **Lesson:** Faith is like priming the pump.
- We give God what is His—not to buy His favor, but to align ourselves with the flow of His power.

## Slide 33 – Q14: Why Disciples Leave

- **Question:** Why did some of the Lord's disciples leave Him?
- **Key Text:** John 6:65, 66 – “And He said. Therefore said I unto you, That no man can come unto Me, except it were given unto him of My Father. From that time many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with Him.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points

- **Rejection of Spiritual Truth:**
  - These disciples wanted political power, not spiritual life through Jesus' sacrifice (eating His flesh/drinking His blood).
- **Unwillingness to Submit:**
  - They disliked the teaching of total dependence on God's grace ("given unto him of My Father").
- **The Crisis Point:**
  - Backsliding often happens when truth cuts across selfish desires.
  - When the cross is presented, many "walk no more with Him."

## Slide 35 – Q15: Hope for the Backslider

- **Question:** Is there hope in the case of the backslider?
- **Key Text:** Hosea 14:2–4 – “Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto Him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips... I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for Mine anger is turned away from him.”

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points

- **The Prescription:**
  - "Take away all iniquity." We ask to be delivered from the sin itself, not just the penalty.
- **The Physician:**
  - "I will heal their backsliding." God treats sin as a disease He can cure.
- **Free Love:**
  - "I will love them freely." We are accepted by grace (Ephesians 1:6 – “To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.”).
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - "Calves of our lips" refers to the sacrifice of praise (Hebrews 13:15 – “By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.”).

## Slide 37 – Q16: Danger in the Last Days

- **Question:** Will there be special danger of backsliding in the last days?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:12 – “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points

- **Iniquity Abounds:**
  - "Iniquity" means lawlessness.
  - Society sets aside God's Law, removing the restraint against sin.
- **Love Waxes Cold:**
  - There is a direct link between Law and Love.
  - When lawlessness prevails, true agape love dies and selfishness reigns.
- **The Warning:**
  - The atmosphere of the world will be so charged with sin that it threatens to freeze the spiritual life of believers.

## Slide 39 – Q17: Our Duty Now

- **Question:** In view of this danger, what is everyone's duty?
- **Key Text:** Luke 21:36 – “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.”

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points

- **Watch:**
  - Be aware of the signs of the times and the condition of your own soul.
- **Pray Always:**
  - Maintain an open channel to Heaven (1 Thessalonians 5:17 – “Pray without ceasing.”).
- **The Goal:**
  - To "stand before the Son of man."
  - Only those clothed in Christ's righteousness will stand in the judgment.
- **Conclusion:**
  - The backslider falls by letting go of Christ.
  - The overcomer stands by holding Him tighter.

## Slide 41 – Q17: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Diver**
- A deep-sea diver relies entirely on the air line connected to the surface.
- If that line is twisted or cut, he dies.
- **Lesson:** In the pressure of these last days, prayer and faith are our air line to the Sanctuary above. We must "pray always" to keep that line open.
