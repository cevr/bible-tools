## Slide 1 – Q1: Walking in the Light

- **Question:** Does the Lord consider it important that His children walk in the light?
- **Key Text:** John 12:35 – “Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you; for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Urgency of Truth

- **An Active Journey:**
  - The Christian life is not a static position but a movement.
  - Light represents God’s revealed will, His truth, and His presence (Psalm 27:1 – “The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?”; 1 John 1:5).
- **Use It or Lose It:**
  - Jesus warns that the opportunity to live by truth is a passing privilege.
  - If we delay obedience, our spiritual capacity to see truth diminishes.
- **Safety in Motion:**
  - In the plan of salvation, there is no neutral ground.
  - We are either advancing toward the holiness of Christ or sliding back into the world.
- **The Result of Rejection:**
  - Spiritual darkness is the result of refusing to advance.
  - Without light, the soul loses its bearings in the Great Controversy and becomes susceptible to deception.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Traveler on the Mountain:**
  - Imagine a traveler on a dangerous mountain path as the sun begins to set.
  - While the sun shines, he sees safe footing and dangerous drop-offs.
  - If he sits down and refuses to move while the sun is up, darkness will overtake him.
- **Lesson:**
  - Once in the dark, his ability to navigate safely is gone, even if the path hasn't changed.
  - So it is with the soul that delays obedience to God's Word.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Benefits of Christ’s Blood

- **Question:** What must one do to obtain the benefits of the blood of Christ?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:7 – “But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Conditions and Fellowship

- **The Covenant Condition:**
  - The promise is conditional: "If we walk."
  - Walking is not the *means* of earning salvation, but the *evidence* that we have accepted Christ.
- **Fellowship with Heaven:**
  - Walking in the light brings harmony with God ("as He is in the light").
  - It also brings unity with the body of believers; truth and holiness unite, while sin separates.
- **Two Great Works of the Blood:**
  - **Forgiveness (Justification):** We are forgiven of past sins (Romans 3:25).
  - **Cleansing (Sanctification):** The ongoing removal of the love of sin from the heart.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Sanctuary and Sanctification

- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, blood was shed in the courtyard (the cross) but ministered in the Holy Place.
  - Jesus, our High Priest, applies His merits to cleanse our record in heaven and our characters on earth (Hebrews 9:14).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The text says the blood *cleanseth* (continuous action).
  - **Sanctification:** The continuous process by which the Holy Spirit imparts Christ’s righteousness to the believer, empowering them to overcome sin (1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Miner and the Soap:**
  - A miner comes out of a coal mine covered in black dust.
  - Soap and water are available to cleanse him.
  - If he stands near the water but refuses to apply it, he remains dirty.
- **Lesson:**
  - The "soap" (Christ's cleansing power) is available, but we must "walk" into the shower to receive the benefit.
  - We cannot cling to the "mud" of our favorite sins and expect the blood of Christ to cleanse us.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Path of the Just

- **Question:** How long may the just expect light to shine on his pathway?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 4:18 – “But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Progressive Growth

- **Progressive Revelation:**
  - God reveals His will gradually so we are not discouraged.
  - As we obey present truth, God gives more light:
    - First, accepting Christ as Savior.
    - Then, the claims of God’s Law, the Sabbath, health reform, and the sanctuary message.
- **No Stopping Place:**
  - A believer cannot say, "I am holy enough."
  - The standard is the character of Christ.
- **The Goal:**
  - We grow in grace until the "perfect day" when we see Him face to face (2 Peter 3:18).

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Sunrise:**
  - Consider the dawn: first a faint gray, then rosy colors, then the sun bursts forth.
  - It climbs higher until the "perfect day" of noon brightness.
  - If the sun stopped at dawn, the day would never fully come.
- **Lesson:**
  - We must not stop at conversion but grow until we reach the measure of the stature of Christ (Ephesians 4:13).

## Slide 11 – Q4: Light for the Righteous

- **Question:** For whom is the light sown?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 97:11 – “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Soil of the Heart

- **Prepared Ground:**
  - The "upright in heart" are those sincere and willing to do God's will.
  - In an honest heart, the seeds of truth will sprout and bear fruit.
- **Sown in the Word:**
  - Truth is scattered throughout the Scriptures.
  - To the careless, it is invisible; to the seeker, the Holy Spirit illuminates the text.
- **Joy in Obedience:**
  - Light is linked with "gladness."
  - Obedience to the truth brings freedom, not a burden (Psalm 119:165 – “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.”).

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Farmer and the Seed:**
  - A farmer sows seeds in a field; for a time, the field looks empty.
  - But life is buried there. When rain and sun come, green shoots appear.
- **Lesson:**
  - God has "sown" light in the Bible.
  - You may read a chapter today and see little, but the Holy Spirit will cause that verse to spring up with power when you need it.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Rejection of Light

- **Question:** What will become of the light which a person has if he fails to improve by it?
- **Key Text:** Luke 11:34, 35 – “The light of the body is the eye... but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness. Take heed, therefore, that the light which is in thee be not darkness.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: The Danger of Neglect

- **The Single Eye:**
  - Jesus calls for a focused, undivided loyalty to God.
- **Use It or Lose It:**
  - Light is given for use.
  - If we see a duty in Scripture but refuse it due to business, social standing, or appetite, the eye becomes "evil."
- **Conscience Seared:**
  - Rejecting known truth distorts the conscience (1 Timothy 4:2).
  - The truth one once knew is twisted to justify sin.
- **Total Darkness:**
  - The deepest darkness is not ignorance, but the rejection of light (e.g., the Three Angels' Messages).

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Bandaged Arm:**
  - If you bandage a healthy arm to your side and refuse to use it, the muscles will atrophy.
  - Though once strong, lack of exercise makes it useless.
- **Lesson:**
  - If we do not exercise faith by obeying the light we have, our spiritual faculties wither.
  - We become incapable of discerning truth from error.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Cause of Condemnation

- **Question:** Why are those condemned who do not come to the light?
- **Key Text:** John 3:19 – “And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: The Verdict of Judgment

- **The Root of Unbelief:**
  - Rejection of truth is often moral, not intellectual.
  - Jesus diagnoses the issue: a love for "evil deeds."
- **Light Exposes Sin:**
  - Light reveals dirt.
  - A man who loves "pet sins" (pride, appetite, dishonesty) hates the light because it calls for repentance.
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - God does not condemn for unavoidable ignorance (Acts 17:30).
  - Condemnation comes from turning away from the light Christ has sent.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Dirty Room:**
  - Imagine a terribly messy room. As long as the lights are off, the occupant pretends it is clean.
  - When a bright lamp is brought in, the filth is revealed.
- **The Choice:**
  - The occupant can either clean the room (repentance) or smash the lamp (rejection).
- **Lesson:**
  - Many choose to smash the lamp of truth because they love their sin.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Action of the Truth-Seeker

- **Question:** If one is really seeking for truth, what will he do?
- **Key Text:** John 3:21 – “But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Faith that Works

- **Active Faith:**
  - True faith is not just thinking about truth, but "doing" it.
  - An honest heart brings habits, business, and life to the Bible for inspection.
- **Wrought in God (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - The believer's good works are not self-manufactured.
  - They are "wrought in God"—worked out by God dwelling in the soul (Galatians 2:20).
- **Justification Defined:**
  - The legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous solely because of Christ's merits credited to them (Romans 3:24; 5:1).

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Blueprint:**
  - A builder who wants to do a good job constantly checks his work against the architect's blueprint.
  - He welcomes inspection because he wants the building to stand.
- **Lesson:**
  - The honest Christian constantly checks their life against God's Law.
  - This is not to be saved *by* the law, but to ensure they are building on the Rock, Christ Jesus.

## Slide 23 – Q8: Strong Delusion

- **Question:** What will those who reject light and truth, be finally led to believe?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12 – “And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Consequences of Choice

- **The Process of Delusion:**
  - God does not force men to lie.
  - When men reject truth to keep "pleasure in unrighteousness," God withdraws His restraining Spirit.
- **End-Time Deception:**
  - The world will be swept by spiritualism and counterfeit gospels that dismiss God's law.
  - Those who refused the "love of the truth" will have no defense.
- **Protection:**
  - Our only safety is a heart sanctified by obedience to the truth.

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Ship’s Compass:**
  - A ship captain throws his compass overboard because he dislikes the direction it points.
  - When the storm comes, he is "deluded" by shifting winds, believing he is safe while heading for rocks.
- **Lesson:**
  - The Word of God is our compass.
  - To reject it is to guarantee spiritual shipwreck.

## Slide 26 – Q9: The Source of Light

- **Question:** From what source does one derive light?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Psalm 119:105 – “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”
  - Psalm 119:130 – “The entrance of thy words giveth light...”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Sola Scriptura

- **The Ultimate Authority:**
  - Human traditions, feelings, and majority opinions are not light.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”
- **Practical Guidance:**
  - The Word is a "lamp unto my feet"—showing us how to live daily.
- **Internalizing the Word:**
  - It is not just owning a Bible, but the "entrance" of the Word into the mind that brings light.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Flashlight in the Forest:**
  - Walking through a dark forest, a flashlight doesn't illuminate the whole forest at once.
  - It casts a circle of light exactly where you need to step.
- **Lesson:**
  - As you move forward, the light moves with you.
  - The Bible gives us enough light to take the next step of obedience today.

## Slide 29 – Q10: Cornelius the Centurion

- **Question:** Who was told by an angel of God that his way pleased the Lord?
- **Key Text:** Acts 10:3, 4 – “...an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius... Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Accepted Sincerity

- **Living Up to Light:**
  - Cornelius was a Gentile who did not yet know the full gospel, but he was sincere.
  - He feared God, gave alms, and prayed according to the light he had.
- **God is Impartial:**
  - Acts 10:35 – “But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.”
- **A Memorial:**
  - God takes notice of every sincere effort to find Him.

## Slide 31 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Child’s Drawing:**
  - A small child draws a picture for their father.
  - It may be scribbled and imperfect, but the father accepts it with joy because of the love behind it.
- **Lesson:**
  - Cornelius offered his best to God, and God accepted the intent of his heart.

## Slide 32 – Q11: More Light Required

- **Question:** Did the angel then tell him that he had nothing more to learn or do, in order to be saved?
- **Key Text:** Acts 10:5, 6 – “And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter... he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.”

## Slide 33 – Q11: Advancing in Truth

- **Sincerity is Not Enough:**
  - The angel did not say, "You are good enough as you are."
  - Cornelius needed to hear the gospel of Christ from Peter.
- **Responsibility:**
  - To remain in God’s favor, he had to advance from limited knowledge to full truth.
  - If he had refused the message, his former sincerity would have become darkness.
- **God Uses Men:**
  - God entrusted the "keys" of the gospel to His church to share with the world.

## Slide 34 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Student:**
  - A first-grade student may get perfect marks.
  - But he cannot stay in first grade forever.
- **Lesson:**
  - If he refuses to move to second grade, he becomes a dropout.
  - The Christian life is a school; we must constantly move up to the next grade of light and truth.

## Slide 35 – Q12: Exhorted to Continue

- **Question:** In what are we exhorted to continue?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 3:14 – “For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.”

## Slide 36 – Q12: Perseverance

- **Holding Fast:**
  - Salvation is a continuous relationship, not a one-time event.
  - We are partakers *if* we hold our confidence to the end.
- **Abiding in Him:**
  - We must abide in Christ daily (John 15:4).
  - Just as a branch must remain on the vine to live, we must remain connected to Christ.
- **Atonement Defined:**
  - The work of reconciliation (at-one-ment) involving Christ's sacrifice and His priestly ministry to blot out sin (Romans 5:11).

## Slide 37 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Rescue Rope:**
  - A drowning man is thrown a rope.
  - He is safe as long as he holds on and lets the rescuer pull him in.
- **Lesson:**
  - If he lets go of the rope halfway to the boat, he is lost.
  - Faith is the hand that grasps Christ; we must not let go.

## Slide 38 – Q13: Blessing in Prophecy

- **Question:** Among those that hear the prophecies of Revelation, who are to have a blessing from God?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 1:3 – “Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.”

## Slide 39 – Q13: Keeping the Prophecy

- **A Threefold Blessing:**
  - It is not enough to just **read** (knowledge) or **hear** (attendance).
  - One must **keep**—obey and cherish the truth.
- **Prophetic Guidance:**
  - Revelation unveils the final conflict.
  - Keeping "these things" involves heeding the Three Angels' Messages (Revelation 14:6-12) and separating from Babylon.
- **Sanctification:**
  - Prophecy prepares a people who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).

## Slide 40 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Encrypted Message:**
  - A general sends an encrypted message to his troops with the enemy's location and orders.
  - The soldiers are blessed if they decode it.
  - But if they decode it and do not follow the orders, the message is useless.
- **Lesson:**
  - Revelation contains our marching orders for the final conflict.

## Slide 41 – Q14: Example of Overthrow

- **Question:** Is there an example of God's overthrowing people whom He once favored, because they refused to obey Him?
- **Key Text:** Jude 5 – “I will therefore put you in remembrance... how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.”

## Slide 42 – Q14: Warning from History

- **Saved but Lost:**
  - Israel was "saved" from Egypt (type of justification) and passed through the sea (baptism).
  - Yet, most died in the wilderness and missed the Promised Land.
- **Unbelief is Disobedience:**
  - They were destroyed because they "believed not" (Hebrews 3:18-19 links unbelief with disobedience).
  - They refused to walk in the advancing light (the cloud).
- **Application for Us:**
  - We have been saved by the blood of the Lamb.
  - We must combine faith with our profession and walk in the light until the journey is done.

## Slide 43 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Rescue Swimmer:**
  - A swimmer pulls a man from a riptide (Egypt) to the safety of the beach.
  - The man is safe.
  - But if he decides to jump back into the treacherous water despite warnings, he may drown.
- **Lesson:**
  - God’s grace is sufficient to keep us, but it does not force us to remain if we choose rebellion.
  - Let us "walk in the light" while we have it.
