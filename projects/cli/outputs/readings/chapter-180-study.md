### Q1. In describing the conclusion of the six-day Creation of our world, what statement is made about its termination?

**"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made." Genesis 2:1, 2.**

**Answer:**

The biblical account opens with a declaration of a completed, perfect work. When God created the world, He did not leave it half-done or imperfect.

1.  **A Finished Perfection:** At Creation, God looked upon His work and declared it "very good" (Genesis 1:31). There was no shadow of sin, no mar of decay, and no defect. This establishes the baseline for the entire Great Controversy: God is the author of perfection; sin is the intruder that brought ruin.
2.  **The Sabbath Seal:** The text notes that on the seventh day, God "ended his work." He then rested, blessed, and sanctified the Sabbath day. The Sabbath serves as the memorial of a finished creation. It is a weekly reminder that we are not our own creators, but that we rest in the finished work of God.
3.  **The Pattern for Redemption:** Just as God finished the work of Creation, He has a plan to finish the work of Redemption. He intends to restore man to that original state of "very good." The Gospel is the power of God to bring us back to the perfection of the original design.

**[ILL] illustration:** Imagine a master builder completing a magnificent temple. When the last stone is laid and the last decoration polished, he hangs a sign on the door: "Finished." He then invites guests to enter and enjoy the beauty. The Sabbath is God’s sign on the door of Creation, inviting us to enter into His rest and enjoy what He has made for us.

### Q2. When dying on the cross, what were Jesus' last words?

**"When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished: and He bowed his head, and gave up the ghost." John 19:30.**

**Answer:**

These are perhaps the most powerful words ever spoken in the history of the universe. They mark the turning point of the Great Controversy.

1.  **The Sacrifice Completed:**
    *   **Definition:** **Atonement** (in the sacrificial sense) refers to the offering Christ made to pay the penalty for sin.
    *   When Jesus said, "It is finished," He signaled that the **price** for sin had been paid in full. No human work can add to the merit of the blood of Christ. The sacrifice required by the broken law was provided (Hebrews 9:26).
2.  **The Victory Won:** By dying, Christ broke the power of death and defeated Satan (Hebrews 2:14). The "seed of the woman" had bruised the serpent’s head (Genesis 3:15). While the war would continue until the eradication of sin, the outcome was secured at the cross.
3.  **The End of Types and Shadows:** At this moment, the veil of the earthly temple was torn in two (Matthew 27:51). The system of animal sacrifices, which pointed forward to the Lamb of God, met its fulfillment. There was no longer a need for the blood of bulls and goats.
4.  **Righteousness by Faith:**
    *   **Definition:** **Justification** is God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ’s merits (Romans 3:24).
    *   Because the sacrifice is "finished," the believer can stand before God clothed in Christ’s righteousness, confident that the debt is paid. We do not work to earn pardon; we receive the finished pardon by faith.

**[ILL] illustration:** If a man is in debt for millions of dollars and cannot pay, he faces prison. If a wealthy benefactor walks into the bank and pays the entire sum, the banker stamps the invoice "PAID IN FULL." The debtor cannot add a single penny to that payment to make it more valid. He simply accepts the receipt. Christ’s cry "It is finished" is the stamp "PAID IN FULL" on the debt of our sin.

### Q3. When the seventh plague is poured out, what announcement will be made?

**"And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done." Revelation 16:17.**

**Answer:**

This third "It is done" marks the cessation of Christ’s intercessory ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.

1.  **The Close of Probation:**
    *   **Definition:** **Probation** is the period of time granted to humanity to choose between serving God or self.
    *   When this voice cries "It is done," the time for repentance has passed. The separation between the righteous and the wicked is final (Revelation 22:11). Every case has been decided in the **Investigative Judgment**.
2.  **The End of Mediation:** For thousands of years, Christ has ministered as our High Priest, pleading His blood for sinners (Hebrews 7:25). Here, He steps out of the sanctuary. There is no more blood to be applied for new sins; the work of saving men from sin is concluded.
3.  **Preparation of the Saints:** Before this announcement is made, God’s people must have reached a state of victory over sin through the power of the Holy Spirit.
    *   **Definition:** **Sanctification** is the work of God making the believer holy.
    *   Those living when this announcement is made will have the "seal of God." They will reflect the image of Jesus fully and will stand without an intercessor during the time of trouble, sustained wholly by the Spirit of God within them.

**[ILL] illustration:** In a court trial, there is a time for presenting evidence and a time for the defense attorney to speak. But finally, the judge lifts the gavel and brings it down. Once the gavel strikes, the case is closed; no new evidence can be admitted. Revelation 16:17 is the sound of the cosmic gavel falling. The court of heaven is adjourned.

### Q4. And when the new heavens and the new earth have appeared, and the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, has descended from God and becomes the center of the new creation, what announcement will then be made?

**"And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new. And He said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. And He said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end." Revelation 21:5, 6.**

**Answer:**

This final "It is done" completes the cycle. The conflict is over, not just legally (the Cross), not just judicially (the Plagues), but experientially and physically.

1.  **Total Restoration:** God does not just patch up the old world; He makes "all things new." The scars of sin on the earth are erased. The thorns, thistles, deserts, and graveyards are gone.
2.  **Sin Eradicated:** The Great Controversy ends with the total destruction of sin and sinners (Revelation 20:14–15). The universe is cleansed.
    *   **Sanctuary Insight:** On the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), the scapegoat was led into the wilderness, removing sin from the camp forever (Leviticus 16). This announcement signifies that sin has been banished from God’s universe eternally.
3.  **Alpha and Omega:** Christ is the Beginning (Creation) and the End (New Creation). What He started in Genesis, He finishes in Revelation. His plan was not frustrated by Satan; it was only delayed and deepened in meaning.

**[ILL] illustration:** After a terrible forest fire, the land is black, scarred, and dead. But years later, new growth appears, greener and more lush than before. God’s restoration is not just fixing a broken vase with glue; it is taking the shattered pieces and remaking them into a vessel of even greater glory than the first.

### Q5. What did God promise will be no more in the new earth?

**"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." Verse 4. "And there shall be no more curse." Revelation 22:3.**

**Answer:**

The conditions of the New Earth are defined by what is *absent* as much as by what is *present*.

1.  **No More Death:** Death is the "wages of sin" (Romans 6:23). With sin removed, death—the last enemy—is destroyed (1 Corinthians 15:26).
2.  **No More Sorrow or Crying:** The heartbreak that characterizes human history will cease. God Himself wipes away the tears. This suggests a tender, personal comfort from the Creator to His children regarding the trials they endured on earth.
3.  **No More Curse:**
    *   The "curse" refers to the degradation of nature and humanity caused by the violation of God’s Law (Genesis 3:17).
    *   **RBF Connection:** The curse is lifted because the Law is no longer broken. The redeemed have the Law written in their hearts (Hebrews 8:10). Where there is perfect obedience through love, there is perfect happiness.

**[ILL] illustration:** Imagine a hospital filled with patients suffering from a contagious, painful plague. Now imagine a cure is found that not only heals every patient instantly but sterilizes the building so the germ can never return. The hospital (a place of sickness) becomes a home of health. The New Earth is a world where the "virus" of sin has been completely sterilized.

### Q6. What will all the earth be like at that time?

**"The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea." Isaiah 11:6-9.**

**Answer:**

The redemption of man brings about the restoration of nature.

1.  **Peace in the Animal Kingdom:** The predatory instinct was not part of God’s original plan; it was a result of the fall. In the restoration, the law of force is replaced by the law of love, even among the beasts.
2.  **"They Shall Not Hurt nor Destroy":** This is the constitution of the New Kingdom.
    *   **Practical Application:** To live there *then*, we must learn to be harmless *now*. The character of the saints must be free from violence, malice, gossip, and hatred. We are to be "sheep" of His pasture, not wolves.
3.  **Full of the Knowledge of the Lord:** The earth will be saturated with the character of God. To know God is to love Him and to love one another (1 John 4:7, 8).

---

### Q7. What will finally be the wonderful privilege of God's children?

**"And they shall see His face." Revelation 22:4.**

**Answer:**

This is the climax of salvation—the Beatific Vision.

1.  **Restored Intimacy:** In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve spoke with God face to face. Sin severed this connection, for a sinner cannot see God and live (Exodus 33:20). In the New Earth, the barrier is removed.
2.  **The Requirement for this Privilege:**
    *   Jesus said, "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8).
    *   **RBF Connection:** Only those who have allowed Christ to cleanse the soul temple of all defilement can endure the presence of a holy God. The work of **sanctification** prepares us for this face-to-face communion. We are fitted for heaven by receiving the life of Christ now.
3.  **The Sanctuary Fulfilled:** The purpose of the Sanctuary was "that I may dwell among them" (Exodus 25:8). Finally, the tabernacle of God is with men, and no veil separates them.

### Q8. How perfect will be their knowledge of God?

**"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known." 1 Corinthians 13:12.**

**Answer:**

Our current understanding of God is limited by our fallen minds and the barrier of sin.

1.  **No More Mysteries:** Today, we struggle to understand why God allows suffering or how His providence works. We see "darkly" (dimly). In the New Earth, the mysteries of grace will be unfolded. We will see that every trial was necessary for our character development.
2.  **Intellectual and Spiritual Growth:** We will know Him "as we are known"—meaning an intimate, transparent relationship. This does not mean we become omniscient, but that our relationship with Him will be unclouded by doubt or misconception.

**[ILL] illustration:** Looking at a beautiful landscape through a dirty, cracked window is frustrating. You can see colors and shapes, but the details are lost. When the window is opened, you see the reality in high definition. Faith is looking through the glass; the New Earth is opening the window.

### Q9. Whom will they be like?

**"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is." 1 John 3:2.**

**Answer:**

God’s plan is not just to bring us to a new place, but to make us into new people.

1.  **Restoration of the Image of God:** Man was made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26). Sin defaced that image. Salvation restores it.
2.  **The Process of Beholding:**
    *   We become like what we worship. "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image" (2 Corinthians 3:18).
    *   If we behold Jesus now by faith, we are changed into His likeness spiritually (character). When we see Him then in person, we will be changed into His likeness physically (glorified bodies).
3.  **Character Perfection:** To be "like Him" means to be loving, patient, kind, and holy. This work begins *now* through the indwelling Spirit and is consummated at His coming.

**[ILL] illustration:** A son often grows up to look and act exactly like his father. People say, "He is the spitting image of his dad." In the New Earth, the universe will look at the redeemed and see the character traits of their Heavenly Father reflected in them.

### Q10. From what problems will the saints be forever delivered?

**"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." Revelation 21:4.**

**Answer:**

The "former things" are the history of rebellion under Satan.

1.  **Freedom from Fear:** We will never again fear sickness, loss, rejection, or failure.
2.  **Freedom from the Struggle with Sin:**
    *   **RBF Connection:** The most painful part of the Christian life now is the battle against the flesh and the temptations of Satan (Romans 7:24). In the New Earth, the internal war is over. Our natures will be fully glorified, meaning we will no longer even *desire* sin. Doing right will be as natural as breathing.
3.  **Security:** We are delivered from the very possibility of falling again, for "affliction shall not rise up the second time" (Nahum 1:9).

---

### Q11. Who will dwell with the Redeemed?

**"He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." Verse 3.**

**Answer:**

The definition of Heaven is the presence of God.

1.  **Immanuel (God with Us):** The promise of Matthew 1:23 is fulfilled eternally. God does not just visit; He dwells (tabernacles) with men.
2.  **The Center of the Universe:** By moving His throne to the earth (Revelation 22:3), God makes this world—once the dark blot of the universe—the center of His government. It becomes the capital city of the cosmos.
3.  **A Personal God:** The text emphasizes "God himself." We do not interact merely with angels or intermediaries, but with the Creator.

### Q12. How long will they possess this glorious future kingdom?

**"But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever." Daniel 7:18.**

**Answer:**

The prophecy of Daniel 7 outlines the rise of earthly powers (lion, bear, leopard, terrible beast) and the persecuting "little horn." But the outcome is certain.

1.  **The Judgment Favors the Saints:** The "judgment was given to the saints of the most High" (Daniel 7:22). God vindicates His people who were oppressed and accused by Satan.
2.  **An Everlasting Possession:** Unlike earthly kingdoms (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome) which rise and fall, the Kingdom of Glory has no end. It is not subject to conquest or decay.
3.  **The Inheritance:** Jesus said, "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth" (Matthew 5:5). This inheritance is permanent.

---

### Q13. How long will they reign with Christ?

**"And they shall reign for ever and ever." Revelation 22:5.**

**Answer:**

The study concludes with the concept of eternal dominion.

1.  **Kings and Priests:** The redeemed are not merely subjects; they are granted a role in the administration of the universe. "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne" (Revelation 3:21).
2.  **Eternity:** The human mind cannot fully grasp "forever and ever." It means that after millions of years, life has only just begun.
3.  **The Final Harmony:** The Great Controversy ends. The questions regarding God’s law and character are settled. The universe is secure in love.

**[ILL] illustration:** A story ends with "And they lived happily ever after." In human fiction, this is a fantasy. In God’s reality, it is the absolute truth. The pain of the past 6,000 years will eventually seem like "but a moment" (2 Corinthians 4:17) compared to the eternal weight of glory that follows.

---
**Summary Application:**
The conflict ends in victory, but the victory is found only in Christ. To be part of that "finished" work in the New Earth, we must allow Him to "finish" His work in our hearts today (Philippians 1:6). We must accept His finished sacrifice (Justification) and yield to His finishing work of character building (Sanctification).
