### Q1. By what figure does the Bible represent death?

**“But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are
asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.” 1 Thess. 4:13 (1
Cor. 15:18, 20; John 11:11-14).**

**Answer:**

The Bible consistently represents death as a **sleep**. This is not merely a
poetic metaphor but a precise theological description of the condition of man
between death and the resurrection.

- **A State of Unconsciousness:** Just as a sleeping person is unaware of the
  passage of time or the events occurring around them, the dead are unconscious.
  They are not suffering in a burning hell, nor are they floating in a
  disembodied bliss in heaven; they are resting.
- **Temporary Duration:** Sleep implies an awakening. If death were the final
  end, it would be annihilation. If it were the gateway to immediate
  immortality, the Bible would call it a "departure" or "promotion." Instead, it
  is called sleep because it is a temporary pause waiting for the morning of the
  resurrection.
- **The Christian’s Hope:** Paul writes this so believers "sorrow not, even as
  others which have no hope." The world fears death as a dark, unknown abyss.
  The Christian views it as a rest in Jesus, awaiting the call of the
  Life-giver.

**Theological Terms:**

- **Intermediate State:** The period between a person’s physical death and their
  bodily resurrection.
- **Conditional Immortality:** The biblical teaching that man is not naturally
  immortal (only God is, 1 Timothy 6:16), but that immortality is a gift
  bestowed upon the righteous at the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:53–54).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a hardworking laborer who toils under the hot
sun all day. When evening comes, he lays down to sleep. He knows nothing of the
night passing; whether it storms or is calm, he is unaware. The next moment of
his consciousness is the morning sun waking him up. So it is with the Christian.
He closes his eyes in death, resting from his labors in the assurance of Christ,
and the very next instant (to his consciousness) is the face of Jesus at the
resurrection morning.

### Q2. Where do the dead sleep?

**“And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake.” Dan.
12:2.**

**Answer:**

The dead sleep in the "dust of the earth." This points us back to the creation
account and the nature of man.

- **The Reverse of Creation:** In Genesis 2:7, God formed man of the dust of the
  ground and breathed into him the breath of life, and man _became_ a living
  soul. Death is the reversal of this process: the breath (spirit) returns to
  God who gave it, and the body returns to dust (Ecclesiastes 12:7).
- **No Disembodied Existence:** The Bible does not teach that the "soul" flies
  away to another realm. The "soul" is the person, which ceases to function when
  the combination of dust and breath is broken. Therefore, the person sleeps in
  the grave.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary service, the blood was shed
  in the outer court (representing the earth). We live and die here in the
  "outer court." Christ, our High Priest, is currently ministering in the
  heavenly sanctuary. We wait in the dust until He completes His work of
  atonement and comes out to bless His people.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you possess a wooden box held together by nails, you
have a box. If you pull the nails out and set the wood aside, where is the box?
It does not exist in a "box heaven." The materials exist, but the box is gone
until the maker reassembles it. So it is with man: take away God’s spark of
life, and the living soul ceases to be until God reconstructs him at the
resurrection.

---

### Q3. How long will they sleep there?

**“So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall
not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.” Job 14:12.**

**Answer:**

The sleep of death lasts until the end of world history, described here as "till
the heavens be no more."

- **The Timing of the Resurrection:** This text refutes the idea that
  individuals go to their reward immediately at death. They "rise not" until a
  specific cosmic event. This event corresponds to the Second Coming of Christ,
  when the atmospheric heavens depart "as a scroll when it is rolled together"
  (Revelation 6:14).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** This waiting period highlights that our salvation
  depends entirely on Christ, not on our own natural power to live on. We are
  dependent on His promise to return. We rest in the grave, trusting that His
  righteousness has covered us and that He will not forget us.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A deposit in a bank vault remains there until the owner
comes to claim it. It does not move itself. We are God’s "jewels" (Malachi
3:17), committed to the safekeeping of the grave until the Owner returns to
claim His treasure.

### Q4. What must take place before Job could expect to awake?

**“If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will
wait, till my change come.” Job 14:14.**

**Answer:**

Job speaks of waiting for his "change." This refers to the transformation that
occurs at the resurrection.

- **The Great Change:** Paul describes this change in 1 Corinthians 15:51–52:
  "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed... for the trumpet shall
  sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible." This change is from
  mortality to immortality, from corruption to incorruption.
- **The Appointed Time:** God has a set time for the judgment and the
  resurrection. It is not haphazard.
- **Sanctuary Connection - The Investigative Judgment:** While Job waits in the
  grave, his record is being examined in the heavenly sanctuary (Daniel 7:9–10).
  This is why there is a wait. God vindicates the character of His saints before
  the universe before He raises them from the dead.

---

### Q5. Where does he wait?

**“If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.” Job
17:13.**

**Answer:**

Job clearly identifies his location during death: the **grave** (Hebrew:
_Sheol_).

- **A House of Darkness:** The grave is described not as a palace of light nor a
  pit of fire, but as a bed in darkness. It is a place of rest and silence.
- **Universal Destination:** In the Old Testament, _Sheol_ is the destination of
  all the dead, both righteous and wicked, where they wait for judgment. It is
  simply the realm of the dead.
- **Comfort in Truth:** While "darkness" sounds gloomy, for the weary pilgrim,
  it is a place of undisturbed rest, free from the pain, cancer, heartache, and
  toil of this life.

---

### Q6. While in this condition, what does one know of those he has left behind?

**“His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but
he perceiveth it not of them.” Job 14:21.**

**Answer:**

This verse provides conclusive evidence that the dead are disconnected from
earthly events.

- **Merciful Ignorance:** If a righteous mother dies and goes immediately to
  heaven, how could she be happy looking down and seeing her children suffering,
  sinning, or being abused? Heaven would not be heaven if the inhabitants were
  forced to watch the tragedy of sin unfold on earth.
- **Against Spiritualism:** This truth protects us from the deceptions of
  spiritualism. If the dead "know not" what their sons are doing, then any
  "spirit" claiming to be a dead relative and bringing messages to the living is
  a deception (a fallen angel/demon), not the actual person (Isaiah 8:19–20).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you are under deep anesthesia for surgery, the
doctors could be playing music, your family could be weeping in the waiting
room, or a storm could be raging outside. You know none of it. You are "safe"
from the trauma of the surgery because you are unconscious. Death is God’s
anesthesia against the suffering of history until He heals the universe.

### Q7. What becomes of man's thoughts at death?

**“His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his
thoughts perish.” Ps. 146:4.**

**Answer:**

When the biological mechanism stops, the mental process stops.

- **No Thinking Without the Body:** The Bible connects the mind with the living
  organism. When the breath (spirit) leaves and the body turns to dust, the
  "thoughts perish."
- **Identity is Preserved by God:** While the thoughts cease, the character and
  identity of the person are preserved in the mind of God, recorded in the books
  of heaven.
- **Definition - "Spirit" (Ruach):** The Bible word for "breath" here is
  _ruach_. It means wind, breath, or life energy. It is the power of God that
  animates the body. It is not a thinking, conscious entity capable of existing
  apart from the body.

---

### Q8. Do the dead know anything?

**“For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything,
neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.” Eccl.
9:5.**

**Answer:**

This is the most explicit statement in Scripture regarding the state of the
dead.

- **Total Unconsciousness:** "The dead know not anything." This leaves no room
  for a conscious soul hovering over the body or dwelling in purgatory.
- **The Importance of "Now":** "The living know that they shall die." We have a
  time of probation _now_. Sanctification—the work of a lifetime—must happen
  while we are alive. We cannot develop character in the grave.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Since we cannot work, repent, or believe after
  death, we must lay hold of Christ's righteousness today. "Today if ye will
  hear his voice, harden not your hearts" (Hebrews 3:15).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A broken computer cannot process data. The electricity
(breath) may still exist in the wall outlet, and the hardware (dust) sits on the
desk, but until they are combined and functional, there is no "computing"
happening. The dead know nothing because the union of body and spirit has been
broken.

---

### Q9. What part, if any, do they take in earthly things?

**“Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither
have they any more a portion forever in any thing that is done under the sun.”
Ecc. 9:6.**

**Answer:**

The dead are completely removed from human affairs.

- **Emotions Cease:** Love, hatred, and envy are functions of the mind and
  heart. Since thoughts have perished (Ps 146:4), these emotions also cease.
- **No "Hauntings":** The dead do not return to help their loved ones or to seek
  revenge on their enemies. They have no portion in anything "under the sun."
- **Protection from Deception:** Satan's first lie was "Ye shall not surely die"
  (Genesis 3:4). By making people believe the dead are actually alive, he opens
  the door to spiritism. Knowing the Bible truth protects the believer from
  these lying wonders.

---

### Q10. What does the psalmist say about the dead praising the Lord?

**“The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.” Ps.
115:17.**

**Answer:**

If the righteous went directly to heaven, their primary occupation would be
praising the Lord (Revelation 19:1). The fact that David says they "praise not
the Lord" proves they are not in heaven.

- **"Silence":** The grave is a place of silence.
- **The Glory of God:** God is not glorified by the false doctrine that the dead
  are already rewarded. He is glorified by the truth that He is the Resurrecting
  One who will conquer the grave itself.

---

### Q11. How much does one know of God when dead?

**“For in death there is no remembrance of thee.” Ps. 6:5.**

**Answer:**

This reinforces the previous texts. The relationship with God, on the human
side, is suspended during death.

- **God Remembers Us:** While the dead do not remember God (because they are
  unconscious), God remembers them. This is the comfort of the believer.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** We are engraved on the palms of His hands (Isaiah
  49:16) and on the breastplate of our High Priest. Even while we sleep in the
  dust, our names are before the Father through the intercession of Jesus.

---

### Q12. But are not the righteous dead in heaven?

**“For David is not ascended into the heavens.” Acts 2:34.**

**Answer:**

The apostle Peter, preaching under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit at
Pentecost, declares plainly that King David—a man after God's own heart—is not
in heaven.

- **The Argument:** Peter argues that David is dead and buried, and his
  sepulcher remains. He uses this to prove that the prophecy of resurrection
  applied to _Jesus_, not David. If David were already in heaven, Peter’s
  argument would collapse.
- **Exceptions:** The Bible records a few special exceptions of people who were
  translated (Enoch, Elijah) or raised (Moses). These are "types" or pledges of
  the coming resurrection, but the vast majority of saints, like David, sleep
  until the Second Coming.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a king prepares a great banquet for his victory
celebration, the guests do not enter one by one weeks before the party starts.
They wait until the victory is won and the doors are opened for everyone at
once. Hebrews 11:39–40 tells us the heroes of faith have not yet received the
promise, "God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us
should not be made perfect." We all go in together.

---

### Q13. If the dead cannot praise God, what must take place to enable them to do so?

**“Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake
and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the
earth shall cast out the dead.” Isa. 26:19.**

**Answer:**

The prerequisite for the dead to praise God again is the **resurrection**.

- **"Awake and Sing":** The song of praise begins only after the awakening.
- **Christ’s Victory:** The phrase "together with my dead body" points to the
  union of the believer with Christ. Because He rose, we shall rise. His
  resurrection is the guarantee of ours.
- **The Earth Casts Out:** The grave cannot hold its prey when the Author of
  Life commands it to open.

---

### Q14. What was the only thing with which David would be satisfied?

**“As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied,
when I awake, with thy likeness.” Ps. 17:15.**

**Answer:**

David’s satisfaction was not in death itself, but in the awakening from death to
see God’s face.

- **Beholding in Righteousness:** Notice the condition—"in righteousness." Only
  those clothed in the righteousness of Christ can behold the face of God and
  live. This righteousness is received by faith now, so we may possess it then.
- **When I Awake:** David did not expect to see God's likeness immediately upon
  dying, but upon waking up.
- **Sanctification's Goal:** To awake with His likeness means that the work of
  restoring the image of God in man is completed. The character is sealed, and
  the body is glorified.

---

### Q15. If there should never be an awakening of the dead, what would be the result?

**“For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: And if Christ be not
raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are
fallen asleep in Christ are perished.” 1 Cor. 15:16-18.**

**Answer:**

This is a crucial logical argument by the Apostle Paul.

- **The Necessity of Resurrection:** If the soul were naturally immortal and
  went to heaven at death, the resurrection would be unnecessary. Paul says that
  without the resurrection, the dead are "perished."
- **Vain Faith:** The entire Christian faith rests on the literal, bodily
  resurrection of Jesus and His people. If there is no resurrection, there is no
  victory over death, and sin has won.
- **Victory in Christ:** But Christ _is_ risen! Therefore, death is not a
  permanent perishing, but a sleep from which He can wake us.

**Definition - "Perished":** In this context, to cease to exist forever with no
hope of life. Paul says this is the fate of the believer _if_ there is no
resurrection.

---

### Q16. When does the resurrection of the righteous take place?

**“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise
first.” 1 Thess. 4:16 (1 Cor. 15:23).**

**Answer:**

The resurrection happens at the literal, visible **Second Coming of Jesus**.

- **The Sequence:**
  1.  The Lord descends.
  2.  The Trumpet sounds.
  3.  The Dead in Christ rise _first_ (before the living are caught up).
- **Sanctuary Climax:** This event marks the end of Christ’s high priestly
  ministry. He takes off the priestly robes, puts on the Kingly robes, and comes
  to gather His subjects.
- **Comfort:** This is the "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13). We do not sorrow as
  those who have no hope, because we know exactly when and how we will see our
  loved ones again. We will meet them and the Lord in the air.

**[ILL] Illustration:** The sleep of death shortens the waiting time for the
believer. Adam has been dead for nearly 6,000 years, yet to him, it will seem
but a moment between closing his eyes on a world of sin and opening them to see
the Second Coming of the "Seed of the woman" who crushed the serpent's head. The
next tick of the clock for the dead is the Trumpet of God.
