## Slide 1 – Q1: Waiting for Power
- **Question:** Just prior to His ascension to heaven, what did Jesus tell His disciples to await?
- **Key Text:** Luke 24:49 – “And, behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Promise)
- **The Command to Tarry:**
  - Before the Great Commission could be undertaken, the disciples had to wait.
  - Human zeal, organization, and effort are insufficient without God’s direct power.
- **The Promise of the Father:**
  - This refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit (John 14:16, 26).
  - Jesus was ascending to the heavenly sanctuary to begin His work as High Priest; His first act of mediation was pouring out the Spirit.
- **Endued with Power:**
  - "Endued" means to be clothed.
  - Just as earthly priests were clothed in holy garments to minister (Exodus 28:2), believers must be clothed with spiritual power and Christ’s character to minister to the world.
- **Dependence on Christ:**
  - The power is not generated from within; it must come from "on high."

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Machine Without Power:**
  - Imagine a heavy, complex machine with gears and levers designed for great work.
  - Without a power source, it sits motionless regardless of human effort to push or pull it.
  - The disciples were like this machine—structured for a purpose—but they needed the "electricity" of the Holy Spirit to function.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Baptism of the Spirit
- **Question:** With what did He say they would soon be baptized?
- **Key Text:** Acts 1:5 – “Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Immersion and Cleansing)
- **Symbol vs. Reality:**
  - John the Baptist used water (symbol), but Jesus brings the Spirit (reality/life).
- **Meaning of Baptism:**
  - To be "baptized" means to be fully immersed or submerged.
  - The Spirit is not a light influence but a presence that completely surrounds and fills the believer (Ephesians 5:18).
- **Cleansing Fire:**
  - This is a baptism of fire (Matthew 3:11) that burns up the dross of sin and selfishness.
  - It purifies the heart so Christ can dwell within.
- **Justification and Sanctification:**
  - This power writes the law of God upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
  - It enables an obedience that is impossible for the natural man.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Sealed Bottle:**
  - An empty, sealed bottle thrown into the ocean is surrounded by water but remains dry inside.
  - If the stopper is removed, the water rushes in and fills it.
  - Many Christians are surrounded by truth but remain dry because the "stopper" of self and sin blocks the Spirit.
  - Spirit baptism fills the empty vessel.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Power for Witnessing
- **Question:** For what important work was this baptism to prepare them?
- **Key Text:** Acts 1:8 – “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Witnessing & Character)
- **Power to Witness:**
  - The Spirit is not for self-exaltation or excitement, but for testimony.
  - A witness speaks from personal knowledge; the Spirit gives a personal experience with Jesus.
- **Righteousness by Faith in Action:**
  - True witnessing is a life transformed by grace.
  - When the world sees victory over temper, pride, and selfishness, they see the power of the Gospel (Matthew 5:16).
- **Global Scope:**
  - The work begins at home ("Jerusalem") and extends to the whole world (Revelation 14:6).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Lawyer vs. The Witness:**
  - In court, a lawyer argues doctrine or logic.
  - The case turns on the witness who says, "I saw this happen."
  - The Holy Spirit changes us from lawyers arguing religion into witnesses who say, "I was a slave to sin, but Christ set me free."

## Slide 10 – Q4: Results of the Outpouring (Part 1)
- **Question:** Following the outpouring of the Spirit, what preaching results followed?
- **Key Text:** Acts 2:37-41 – “Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said,... Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins... Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Results of the Outpouring (Part 2)
- **Additional Key Texts:**
  - Acts 5:12-14 – “And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people;...and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.”
  - Acts 6:7 – “And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Conviction & Obedience)
- **Conviction of Sin:**
  - The Spirit "pricks the heart," revealing the sinner’s condition before God’s law (Romans 7:7).
- **Steps to Salvation:**
  - **Repentance:** Genuine sorrow for sin and turning away (2 Corinthians 7:10).
  - **Baptism:** Public confession and death to the old life.
  - **Remission:** God canceling the debt of sin through Christ’s blood.
- **Obedience to the Faith:**
  - Even "priests" (those deep in tradition/legalism) became "obedient."
  - The Gospel leads to obedience, not lawlessness (Romans 3:31).

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Sleeping Man:**
  - You can lecture a sleeping person all night with no result.
  - But a loud cry of "Fire!" wakes them instantly.
  - Human logic is like whispering to the dead; the Holy Spirit is the awakening cry that rouses the conscience to action.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Persecution and the Gospel
- **Question:** How did persecution affect the preaching of the gospel?
- **Key Text:** Acts 8:1-4 – “And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles... Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Scattered Seeds)
- **Overruling Malice:**
  - Satan tried to crush the church, but God used the pressure to spread the truth.
- **The Blood of Seed:**
  - Persecution scattered believers like seeds in the wind; refugees became missionaries.
- **Priesthood of Believers:**
  - The apostles stayed in Jerusalem; the *laity* went preaching.
  - Every soul born of the Spirit is called to be a light bearer, not just the ordained ministry.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration
- **Blowing on the Campfire:**
  - If you blow on a campfire to extinguish it, you often send sparks flying into dry grass.
  - Instead of putting the fire out, you start new fires everywhere.
  - Persecution was the "breath" that spread the fire of the Gospel.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Prophecy Fulfilled
- **Question:** What Old Testament prophecy was fulfilled at the time of the outpouring of the Spirit?
- **Key Text:** Acts 2:14-18 – “But Peter... said,... This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; And It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.” (See Joel 2:28-29).

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Joel's Prophecy)
- **Anchored in Scripture:**
  - Peter confirms the New Testament experience is based on Old Testament revelation.
- **"All Flesh":**
  - The Spirit is available to all believers—sons, daughters, servants—not just a select few.
- **Prophetic Guidance:**
  - The "spirit of prophecy" is a mark of God's church in the last days.
  - God guides His people through visions and dreams as the end approaches.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Former and Latter Rain
- **Question:** What expressions in Joel's prophecy indicate a double fulfillment of this outpouring?
- **Key Text:** Joel 2:23 – “Be glad then, ye children of Zion... for He hath given you the former rain moderately, and He will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Spiritual Growth)
- **The Agricultural Cycle:**
  - **Former Rain (Seed-time/Pentecost):** Germinates the seed. Represents conversion and early sanctification.
  - **Latter Rain (Harvest/End Time):** Ripens the grain. Represents the final outpouring to prepare God's people for the Second Coming.
- **Character Perfection:**
  - We need the "ripening" of character—the reproduction of Christ’s image—before the harvest (Mark 4:28-29).
  - Without the Latter Rain, the work of grace cannot be finished in the soul.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Withered Harvest:**
  - A farmer can plant good seed in good soil.
  - But if no rain falls in the final weeks to swell the grain, the harvest is useless.
  - We may have the "seed" of truth, but we need the "Latter Rain" to mature our characters for heaven.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Praying for the Rain
- **Question:** In the time of the latter rain, for what are we told to pray?
- **Key Text:** Zechariah 10:1 – “Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the field.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Active Faith)
- **Ask in Faith:**
  - We must not wait idly; we must ask for the promise (Ezekiel 36:37).
  - We must plead for power to overcome every defect of character.
- **Sanctuary Context:**
  - The Investigative Judgment is in progress.
  - As the High Priest cleanses the sanctuary, the Spirit cleanses the soul temple.
- **Individual Experience:**
  - Rain is promised to "everyone grass."
  - Each believer must have a personal connection with Christ; one cannot absorb moisture for another.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Becalmed Ship:**
  - Sailors cannot create wind for a ship stuck at sea.
  - But they can raise the sails and set the rigging.
  - Prayer and obedience are "raising the sails" so we are ready when the Latter Rain comes.

## Slide 25 – Q9: The Loud Cry
- **Question:** How is the closing gospel work under the outpouring of the Spirit described by John the revelator?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 18:1 – “After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with His glory.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points (Glory and Character)
- **The Loud Cry:**
  - This angel strengthens the Three Angels' Messages (Rev 14) for a final, mighty movement.
- **Lightened with Glory:**
  - God’s glory is His character (Exodus 33-34: Love, Justice, Mercy).
  - The earth will be illuminated by the revelation of God’s character seen in His people.
- **Righteousness by Faith Demonstrated:**
  - The world will see a people who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus (Rev 14:12) effectively.

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Message on Babylon
- **Question:** What is the message of this angel?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 18:2 – “And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every unclean and hateful bird.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points (Apostasy Exposed)
- **Babylon Identified:**
  - Religious systems that mix truth with error and rely on works or state power.
- **Progressive Fall:**
  - "Fallen, is fallen" implies a decline.
  - Rejecting the First Angel's message (Gospel/Judgment) leads to darkness.
  - The structure becomes a "habitation of devils" (spiritualism).
- **The Final Controversy:**
  - Humanity will be divided into two camps: those following the Lamb and those in Babylon.

## Slide 29 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Condemned Building:**
  - An old building may look impressive on the outside.
  - But if the foundation is rotting and termites are eating the beams, it is unsafe.
  - This angel warns that the structure of worldly religion is spiritually condemned and about to collapse.

## Slide 30 – Q11: The Call to Separate
- **Question:** What did Peter on the day of Pentecost tell his hearers to do?
- **Key Text:** Acts 2:40 – “And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.”

## Slide 31 – Q11: Key Points (Sanctification)
- **"Save Yourselves":**
  - While Christ saves, we must choose to flee to Him.
- **Untoward Generation:**
  - "Untoward" means crooked or perverse.
  - The world's maxims and fashions are contrary to God's law.
- **Practical Sanctification:**
  - To be saved, one must step out of line with the world.
  - We must leave behind habits and sins that characterize the ungodly.

## Slide 32 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Sinking Ship:**
  - When a captain yells, "Save yourselves! Get to the lifeboats!" he isn't telling passengers to swim to shore on their own strength.
  - He is commanding them to take the action of leaving the sinking vessel to enter the safety provided.

## Slide 33 – Q12: The Final Appeal
- **Question:** What similar call and appeal will be made under the final outpouring of the Holy Spirit?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 18:4-5 – “And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.”

## Slide 34 – Q12: Key Points (Final Separation)
- **"My People":**
  - God has true children within the confused systems of Babylon.
  - The Latter Rain empowers the call to bring them out.
- **Partaking of Sins:**
  - We must separate spiritually. Remaining in Babylon makes us responsible for her sins.
- **Sanctuary and Judgment:**
  - "Sins reached unto heaven" implies the investigative judgment is concluding.
  - God is making the final separation; sin must be blotted out, or the sinner will be blotted out.

## Slide 35 – Q12: Illustration
- **Lot in Sodom:**
  - Lot lived in Sodom, but before the fire fell, angels pulled him out.
  - He had to leave his home and associations to be saved.
  - Revelation 18 is the angel's hand grasping us, urging us to leave the sins of the world before the final judgment.
