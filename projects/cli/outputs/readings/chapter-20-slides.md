## Slide 1 – Title: Baptism, Repentance, and the Law
- **A Scriptural Study on the Commission, the Covenant, and the Cure for Sin**

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Great Commission
- **Question:** What commission did Christ give to His disciples?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 28:19 – “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (The Three Steps)
- Before His ascension to the heavenly sanctuary, Christ gave the church its marching orders involving three steps:
- **1. Teaching (Making Disciples):**
  - The gospel must first reach the mind and heart.
  - The word "teach" implies making a learner or follower.
- **2. Baptizing:**
  - This is the public sign of entrance into the covenant of grace.
  - It is done in the singular "name" of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, signifying adoption into the family of God.
- **3. Instruction:**
  - Teaching the believer to observe all commanded things (Matthew 28:20).

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Soldier’s Enlistment:**
  - Imagine a soldier enlisting in an army.
  - First, he must understand the cause (**Teaching**).
  - Then, he puts on the uniform and takes the oath (**Baptism**).
  - Finally, he undergoes training to learn the discipline of the service (**Ongoing Instruction**).
- **Lesson:** One cannot be a soldier of the Cross without enlisting publicly under the banner of Prince Emmanuel.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Prerequisite to Baptism
- **Question:** Before one is baptized, what is it necessary for him to do?
- **Key Text:** Acts 2:38 – “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized everyone of you.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Repentance)
- **Not a Magic Ritual:**
  - Baptism is not a mechanical washing away of sin; it is an outward sign of an inward change.
  - Without repentance, immersion is simply a bath.
- **True Repentance:**
  - It involves sorrow for sin and a turning away from it.
  - Proverbs 28:13 – “He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.”
  - It is a decided choice to abandon old ways that are out of harmony with God.

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Object of Repentance
- **Question:** Toward whom must men repent?
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:21 – “Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Two Movements of the Soul)
- **1. Repentance toward God:**
  - We repent toward the Father because He is the Lawgiver.
  - When a law is broken, the citizen must answer to the government that established it.
- **2. Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ:**
  - The Law condemns but cannot save. We must look to Jesus, the Saviour, who paid the penalty.
- **Summary:**
  - We repent toward the Lawgiver (God) for breaking His law.
  - We have faith in the Redeemer (Jesus) who covers the breach with His blood.

---

## Slide 9 – Q4: Reason for Repentance
- **Question:** Why should one repent toward God?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points (Sin and Character)
- **Falling Short:**
  - Every human has failed to meet the standard of God's character.
  - The "glory of God" is His character (Exodus 33:18–19), which is transcribed in His law.
- **The Definition of Sin:**
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
  - Because we have violated the constitution of the universe, we are under the sentence of death unless rescued.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Reckless Driver:**
  - If a man drives recklessly and crashes into a neighbor’s house, he has offended the neighbor.
  - However, he has also broken the law of the state.
  - He needs the neighbor’s forgiveness (reconciliation), but he also stands guilty before the judge (the law).
- **Lesson:** Sin is a crime against the government of Heaven, requiring repentance toward God.

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Law’s Effect
- **Question:** What effect does the law have upon sinners in conversion?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:9 – “For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (The Mirror)
- **The Function of the Law:**
  - The moral law acts as a mirror (James 1:23–25).
- **Paul’s Experience:**
  - **"Alive without the law":** He felt spiritually secure and self-righteous before understanding the Law's depth.
  - **"Sin revived":** When the Spirit applied the commandment, he saw the active, deadly nature of sin in his heart.
  - **"I died":** His self-confidence was shattered. This death to self-righteousness is the first step toward true life in Christ.

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: Necessity of Death
- **Question:** Why is it necessary for one to die in the sense here represented?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:6 – “Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)
- **End of the Old Life:**
  - The gospel is not a modification of the old life but the end of it.
  - The "old man"—the carnal nature—must be crucified.
- **Victory Over Sin:**
  - The purpose of this death is that "the body of sin might be destroyed."
  - Romans 6:14 – “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”
  - God breaks the power of enslaved habits so we do not serve sin.

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: Living Again
- **Question:** If one thus dies, how is he to live again?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:8 – “Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points (Resurrection Life)
- **A Present Reality:**
  - Having surrendered the life of selfishness to the grave, the believer lives by the power of Christ’s life.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me...”
- **Union with Him:**
  - We live *with* Him in constant communion and dependence.
  - It is living by the power of His resurrection today.

---

## Slide 18 – Q8: Burial
- **Question:** If one is dead with Christ, what should be done with him?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in newness of life.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points (The Symbolism)
- **Burial:**
  - Spiritual death to sin demands a spiritual burial.
  - The water represents the grave.
- **Resurrection:**
  - Coming up out of the water symbolizes the resurrection to "newness of life."
- **Sanctification:**
  - This new life is a walk of obedience powered by the Holy Spirit.

---

## Slide 20 – Q8: Illustration
- **Buried Alive:**
  - We do not bury people alive. If a person is buried, it is understood they are dead.
- **Spiritual Application:**
  - Baptism has no meaning if the candidate is still "alive" to the love of the world and sin.
  - We must die to self *before* we are buried in the water.

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Mode of Baptism
- **Question:** How is one to be buried in baptism?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:5 – “For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.”

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Likeness of Death)
- **Matching the Meaning:**
  - The mode must fit the theology.
  - **Likeness of Death:** Only total immersion symbolizes a burial in a tomb. Sprinkling or pouring does not resemble a burial.
  - **Likeness of Resurrection:** Rising from the watery grave pictures Christ rising from the tomb.
- **Definition:**
  - The Greek word *baptizo* means to dip, plunge, or immerse.

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: Purpose of Baptism
- **Question:** For what purpose is one baptized?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 2:12 – “Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead.”

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (Faith in God’s Work)
- **An Act of Faith:**
  - Baptism is not merely removing dirt (1 Peter 3:21), but the answer of a good conscience.
- **Trusting the Operation of God:**
  - The believer trusts that just as God raised Jesus from the dead, He will raise this soul from the death of sin.
- **Accepting the Atonement:**
  - It is a public testimony accepting Christ's death as our substitute and His life as our power.

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: Putting on Christ
- **Question:** When baptized into Christ, what does one put on?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:27 – “For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (The Robe of Righteousness)
- **Union with Jesus:**
  - Baptism is the formal entry into union with Christ.
- **Justification (Imputed Righteousness):**
  - We are covered by His merits; the Father sees the perfection of His Son.
- **Sanctification (Imparted Righteousness):**
  - We put on His character, humility, and love in our daily walk.
  - The believer now bears the family name of heaven.

---

## Slide 27 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Wedding Garment:**
  - In the parable of the wedding feast (Matthew 22:11–12), the king provided a garment for every guest.
  - To refuse it was an insult.
- **Application:**
  - In baptism, we publicly put on the wedding garment of Christ’s righteousness.
  - We hide our own "filthy rags" of sin and selfishness.

---

## Slide 28 – Q12: The Eunuch’s Request
- **Question:** What question did the eunuch ask after Philip had preached unto him Jesus?
- **Key Text:** Acts 8:36 – “And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?”

---

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (Immediate Response)
- **Identifying with the Messiah:**
  - After understanding Isaiah 53, the eunuch recognized Jesus and immediately desired to identify with Him.
- **The Seal:**
  - Baptism should plainly follow the acceptance of the gospel.
  - It is not joining a social club, but sealing the believer to the Saviour they have found.

---

## Slide 30 – Q13: The Condition
- **Question:** What reply did Philip make?
- **Key Text:** Acts 8:37 – “And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.”

---

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points (Belief)
- **The Crucial Condition:**
  - One must **believe with all the heart**.
  - It is not enough to mentally agree with a creed; the will and affections must be engaged.
- **Implications for Infant Baptism:**
  - An infant cannot believe or repent.
  - Biblical baptism is reserved for those of an age of accountability who can make a conscious decision for Christ.

---

## Slide 32 – Q14: The Method Demonstrated
- **Question:** In administering the ordinance, where did Philip take the candidate?
- **Key Text:** Acts 8:38 – “And they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.”

---

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points (Down Into the Water)
- **Geographical Precision:**
  - **"Down into the water":** If sprinkling were sufficient, Philip could have simply brought water in a cup.
  - The fact that both men entered the water is strong evidence for immersion as the apostolic mode.
- **"Up out of the water":**
  - Verse 39 confirms they came up out of the water, completing the symbol of burial and resurrection.

---

## Slide 34 – Q15: One Baptism
- **Question:** How many modes of baptism are recognized in the Bible?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 4:5 – “One Lord, one faith, one baptism.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points (Uniformity of Truth)
- **Only One Valid Baptism:**
  - Paul declares there is only one "baptism."
  - Given the Greek meaning of *baptizo* and the early church context, this is the immersion of a repentant believer.
- **Human Inventions:**
  - Other modes (sprinkling, pouring) are human additions that obscure the biblical symbolism of death, burial, and resurrection.

---

## Slide 36 – Q16: Pentecost Result
- **Question:** How many were added to the church on the day of Pentecost?
- **Key Text:** Acts 2:41 – “Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points (Door to the Church)
- **Glad Reception:**
  - Three thousand people made a decision and "gladly received" the gospel.
- **Adding to the Body:**
  - Baptism is the door into the visible church.
  - While we are not saved *by* the church, the saved are added *to* the church to serve and grow together.

---

## Slide 38 – Q17: The Workforce
- **Question:** How many disciples were together on that occasion to engage in the work?
- **Key Text:** Acts 1:15 – “And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said (the number of names together were about a hundred and twenty).”

---

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points (Corporate Work)
- **Logistics of Baptism:**
  - With 120 disciples and the twelve apostles, there were ample hands to baptize 3,000 people in one day.
- **Priesthood of Believers:**
  - This highlights the corporate work of the body.
  - 1 Peter 2:9 – “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people...”

---

## Slide 40 – Q18: Urgency
- **Question:** Should one wait long after conversion before being baptized?
- **Key Text:** Acts 22:16 – “And now why tarriest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q18: Key Points (No Delay)
- **Why Tarry?**
  - Once a person believes and repents, there is no virtue in delay.
- **"Wash Away Thy Sins":**
  - Only the blood of Jesus removes guilt (1 John 1:7).
  - Baptism is the public, formal acceptance ("signing the deed") of that cleansing.
- **Calling on the Lord:**
  - It indicates a prayer for a clear conscience (1 Peter 3:21).

---

## Slide 42 – Q19: The Order of Salvation
- **Question:** What is necessary before baptism?
- **Key Text:** Mark 16:16 – “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.”

---

## Slide 43 – Q19: Key Points (Believe -> Baptize)
- **The Master's Order:**
  - **1. Believe**
  - **2. Be Baptized**
  - **3. Be Saved**
- **Implication:**
  - One cannot reverse this order (e.g., baptizing an infant before they believe).
  - The refusal to believe brings condemnation, showing faith is the saving instrument, while baptism is the test of obedience.

---

## Slide 44 – Q20: The Jailer’s Household
- **Question:** After the release of Paul and Silas from jail, how many of the jailer's family submitted to baptism?
- **Key Text:** Acts 16:33 – “And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.”

---

## Slide 45 – Q20: Key Points (Mutual Washing)
- **"All His":**
  - The entire household was baptized.
- **Immediate Action:**
  - It was done "straightway" (immediately), even at midnight.
- **Symbolism:**
  - The jailer washed the apostles' physical wounds (stripes).
  - The apostles washed the jailer’s spiritual wounds through baptism.

---

## Slide 46 – Q21: Preaching to All
- **Question:** To how many of them had Paul and Silas preached?
- **Key Text:** Acts 16:32 – “And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.”

---

## Slide 47 – Q21: Key Points (Hearing the Word)
- **Understanding is Key:**
  - Paul preached to **all** in the house.
  - This implies everyone present was old enough to listen and process the "word of the Lord."
  - Romans 10:17 – “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”

---

## Slide 48 – Q22: Believing Truth
- **Question:** How many of them believed the truth that was preached?
- **Key Text:** Acts 16:34 – “And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.”

---

## Slide 49 – Q22: Key Points (Household of Believers)
- **No Infants:**
  - The record states the jailer believed "with all his house."
  - Since infants cannot "believe in God" or "rejoice" in truth, this instance does not support infant baptism.
  - It was a household of believers who heard, accepted, and were baptized.

---

## Slide 50 – Q23: Post-Baptism Focus
- **Question:** After baptism, what should one do?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:1 – “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.”

---

## Slide 51 – Q23: Key Points (Sanctuary and Intercession)
- **The Heavenly Focus:**
  - Baptism is the starting line. Having "risen with Christ," the focus shifts to the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Christ is at the "right hand of God" interceding for us.
- **Cooperation:**
  - As Christ ministers in the sanctuary above to blot out sins, we on earth cooperate by overcoming sin through His grace.
  - We leave the lowlands of sin to breathe the atmosphere of heaven.

---

## Slide 52 – Q24: Knowledge of Sin
- **Question:** By what does one gain a knowledge of sin?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:7 – “I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”

---

## Slide 53 – Q24: Key Points (The Law and the Gospel)
- **The Connection:**
  - Why baptism? Because we have sinned.
  - How do we know we sinned? Because of the Law.
- **Conviction:**
  - The Law defines the boundaries (e.g., "Thou shalt not covet").
  - Without the Law, there is no conviction; without conviction, no need for a Saviour; without a Saviour, baptism is meaningless.
  - The Law points us to the water of baptism for cleansing.

---

## Slide 54 – Q25: Entry of Death
- **Question:** What brought death into the world?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:12 – “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”

---

## Slide 55 – Q25: Key Points (The Wages of Sin)
- **Adam's Transgression:**
  - Sin and death entered through Adam.
  - Every human is born with a fallen nature and eventually chooses to sin.
- **The Remedy:**
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
  - Baptism acknowledges the death we deserve (burial) and accepts the life we do not deserve (resurrection).

---

## Slide 56 – Q26: Reign of Death
- **Question:** Did death reign all the time between Adam and Moses?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:13, 14 – “For until the law, sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses...”

---

## Slide 57 – Q26: Key Points (Eternal Law)
- **Paul’s Logic:**
  - 1. Death is the result of sin.
  - 2. Sin is not imputed (charged) if there is no law.
  - 3. People died between Adam and Moses.
  - 4. Therefore, God's law existed *before* Sinai.
- **Conclusion:**
  - The Law that convinces us of sin today is the same Law that governed the universe from the beginning.
  - It drives us to the Cross for the cleansing blood of Christ.

---

## Slide 58 – Q26: Illustration
- **Gravity:**
  - Gravity existed before Isaac Newton wrote the formula. Men fell from cliffs long before the law was written in a book.
- **God’s Government:**
  - Similarly, God's moral law existed in His government long before He wrote it on stone for Moses.
  - This eternal standard reveals our need for the Saviour.
