## Slide 1 – Q1: Loving Life and Seeing Good Days
- **Question:** What must we do, among other things, if we would love life, and see good days?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:10 – “For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Restraint and Purity)
- **Guardianship of Speech:**
  - To enjoy peace in Christ, Scripture commands strict guardianship over our words.
  - This instruction touches the core of Christian character.
- **Refraining from Evil:**
  - Implies conscious, Spirit-empowered restraint.
  - The natural heart is prone to criticism and gossip.
  - Through the indwelling Christ, we must check these impulses (Psalm 141:3 – “Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.”).
- **No Guile:**
  - Guile refers to deceit, cunning, or hypocrisy.
  - The 144,000 are noted for this purity: “And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.” (Revelation 14:5).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Bit and the Rudder:**
  - James compares the tongue to a bit in a horse’s mouth or a rudder on a ship (James 3:3–5).
  - Though small, the rudder directs the entire course of the vessel.
  - **Lesson:** If the rudder is set toward “evil,” life steers into storms. If the Holy Spirit controls the rudder, life is steered into the harbor of “good days.”

## Slide 4 – Q2: Corrupt Communication
- **Question:** What words has Paul left on record concerning corrupt communication, foolish talking and jesting?
- **Key Text 1:** Ephesians 4:29 – “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.”
- **Key Text 2:** Ephesians 5:4 – “Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Purity of Speech)
- **Corrupt Communication:**
  - Implies something rotten or putrid (vulgarity, gossip).
  - Such words grieve the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:30).
- **Foolish Talking & Jesting:**
  - Senseless chatter that brings no glory to God.
  - Coarse humor or making light of sacred things.
- **The Remedy – Sanctification:**
  - Sanctification includes the cleansing of our vocabulary.
  - When the heart is filled with gratitude ("giving of thanks"), there is no room for corruption.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Filtered Stream:**
  - Imagine a stream flowing from a mountain spring.
  - If the source is pure, it brings life; if poisoned, it brings death.
  - **Lesson:** Our heart is the spring; our mouth is the stream. We cannot allow the “poison” of the world to mix with the water of life we are called to share.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Idle Words
- **Question:** What did the Saviour say about idle words?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:36 – “But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Judgment and Atonement)
- **Solemn Warning:**
  - This verse points to the **Investigative Judgment**—the review of lives in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - God reviews not only crimes but wasted opportunities (idle/useless words).
- **The Need for Atonement:**
  - This drives us to the foot of the cross.
  - We have all spoken idle words and need **Justification** (righteousness by faith).
  - We need Christ’s blood to blot out the record and His Spirit to fill our mouths today.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Tape Recorder:**
  - Imagine a recording device around your neck capturing every syllable for a week.
  - Would you be comfortable playing it back for a room full of people?
  - **Lesson:** In the judgment, the universe listens. Only the blood of Jesus can wash that tape clean.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Keeping the Soul
- **Question:** From what does he who keeps his mouth and tongue, keep his soul?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 21:23 – “Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from troubles.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Preservation)
- **Prevention of Trouble:**
  - Much human suffering (strife, broken friendships) stems from hasty words.
  - Guarding the tongue spares the soul from guilt and anxiety.
- **A Fruit of the Spirit:**
  - This is not just willpower; it is "temperance" or self-control (Galatians 5:23).
  - When we abide in Christ, He stands as a sentinel at the door of our lips.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Silence and Wisdom
- **Question:** How is he who holds his peace, under certain circumstances, regarded by people of good sense?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 17:28 – “Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (The Wisdom of Restraint)
- **Silence as Wisdom:**
  - To speak requires knowledge; to listen requires wisdom.
  - Silence prevents exposing one's own folly.
- **Christ’s Example:**
  - When falsely accused, Jesus “answered nothing” (Matthew 27:12).
  - His silence testified to a character at rest in the Father’s will.
- **Application:** When provoked or uninformed, the most Christ-like action is often to close the lips.

## Slide 14 – Q6: Influence of Kind Words
- **Question:** What influence have kind words and a wholesome tongue upon others?
- **Key Text 1:** Proverbs 15:1 – “A soft answer turneth away wrath.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Healing and Grace)
- **The Soft Answer:**
  - Breaks the power of wrath.

- **Tree of Life:**
  - A wholesome tongue feeds and heals (Revelation 22:2).
  - It is a channel for **Imparted Righteousness**—Christ’s love flowing through us to others.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration
- **Oil on Water:**
  - Sailors used to pour oil on rough, turbulent waters to calm them.
  - **Lesson:** A soft answer is like oil on the turbulent waters of an argument; it smoothes the surface and brings peace.

- **Question:** What is the effect of grievous words?
- **Key Text 1:** Proverbs 15:1 – “Grievous words stir up anger.”
- **Key Text 2:** Proverbs 12:18 – “There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Destruction)
- **Stirring Up Anger:**
  - Harsh, critical words act as fuel for conflict.
- **Piercings of a Sword:**
  - Sarcasm and belittling remarks inflict invisible, long-lasting wounds.
- **Heart Condition:**
  - A piercing tongue reveals a heart not yet softened by grace.
  - We cannot love God while stabbing our brother with words (1 John 4:20).

## Slide 19 – Q8: Truth vs. Falsehood
- **Question:** Contrast the abiding future of the truthful, with the brief continuance of such as speak falsely?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 12:19 – “The lip of truth shall be established forever; but a lying tongue is but for a moment.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Eternity vs. Moment)
- **Established Forever:**
  - Truth stands the test of time and investigation.
  - Speakers of truth build on the Rock.
- **Lying is Temporary:**
  - Lies require more lies to sustain them and eventually collapse.
  - In the final judgment, all lies are exposed.
  - All liars have their part in the second death (Revelation 21:8).

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Index of the Heart
- **Question:** Are words a sure index of the heart?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:34 – “For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)
- **The Index:**
  - Just as a thermometer reveals temperature, words reveal the soul's condition.
- **The Remedy:**
  - Behavior modification (fixing words) is insufficient.
  - We need the **New Heart** of the New Covenant (Ezekiel 36:26 – “A new heart also will I give you...”).
  - When Christ dwells within by faith, words naturally become Christ-like.

## Slide 23 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Bucket in the Well:**
  - If you drop a bucket into a well, what comes up is exactly what is down there.
  - You cannot bring fresh water from a salt-water well.
  - **Lesson:** When life “bumps” us, what spills out? If Christ is in the heart, grace spills out.

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Perfect Man
- **Question:** What is said of the man who offends not in word?
- **Key Text:** James 3:2 – “If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Maturity in Christ)
- **Christian Perfection:**
  - Refers to maturity and a heart fully surrendered to the Spirit.
- **The Master Key:**
  - The tongue is the hardest member to tame.
  - Victory here implies spiritual strength to “bridle” (control) every other passion.
- **Victory is Possible:**
  - This verse is a promise: by God’s grace, we can reach a stage where we do not stumble in word.

## Slide 26 – Q11: Unbecoming Language
- **Question:** What is said of the professed Christian whose language is unbecoming?
- **Key Text:** James 1:26 – “If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, ... this man's religion is vain.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points (Vain Religion)
- **Empty Profession:**
  - "Vain" means useless or profitless.
  - Outward religious forms (Sabbath keeping, tithe paying) do not save if speech remains slanderous or deceitful.
- **The Bridle:**
  - Our nature needs the restraint of the Holy Spirit.
  - Without it, religion is merely a form of godliness without power (2 Timothy 3:5).

## Slide 28 – Q12: Words in the Judgment
- **Question:** Will our words have weight in the judgment?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:37 – “For by thy words thou shalt be condemned, and by thy words thou shalt be justified.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (Evidence of Faith)
- **Evidence, Not Merit:**
  - We are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8), not by speech.
  - However, words testify whether our faith is genuine.
- **Sanctuary Reality:**
  - Our words serve as external proof of our internal state in the heavenly judgment.
  - They show if we were truly united with Christ.
  - This calls for repentance and dependence on Christ’s intercession.

## Slide 30 – Q13: Life and Death
- **Question:** By these forcible scriptures, what startling truth is established?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 18:21 – “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points (The Power of Choice)
- **Power of Death:**
  - Words can kill reputation, hope, and enthusiasm.
  - The "accuser of the brethren" (Revelation 12:10) uses human tongues for his work.
- **Power of Life:**
  - Words can point sinners to the Savior and bring comfort.
- **The Choice:**
  - Every time we speak, we choose which power to unleash (Deuteronomy 30:19).

## Slide 32 – Q14: The Constant Prayer
- **Question:** What should be the constant prayer of each heart?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 19:14 – “Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points (Living Coram Deo)
- **Inner and Outer Harmony:**
  - The prayer covers both outward words and inward thoughts.
  - The standard is what is acceptable in "Thy sight" (God's view).
- **Redeemer & Strength:**
  - **Redeemer:** His blood forgives past sin (Justification).
  - **Strength:** His power keeps us from future sin (Sanctification).
  - This is **Righteousness by Faith**: depending on God to produce what is pleasing to Him.

## Slide 34 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Watchman:**
  - In ancient cities, a watchman stood at the gate to inspect everyone entering or leaving.
  - **Lesson:** We should install a “watchman” of prayer at the gate of our lips, asking God to approve every word before it is allowed to pass.
