### Q1. What is the natural condition of the human family?
"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Romans 3:23. See Eph. 2:1-3.

**Answer:**
The Scriptures present a humbling diagnosis of the human condition. Since the fall of Adam, the natural heart has been alienated from its Creator.
*   **Universal Need:** The text does not say "some" or "the worst of us," but "all." Every member of the human family, regardless of heritage or education, begins life separated from the holiness of God.
*   **Coming Short:** The phrase "come short" implies a target that has been missed. The "glory of God" represents His perfect character of love and His holy law. In our natural state, we lack the moral power to reflect His image.
*   **Nature of Sin:** Ephesians 2:1–3 describes this condition as being "dead in trespasses and sins." A dead man cannot revive himself; he needs a source of life from outside himself. This is the "carnal mind," which is naturally self-centered rather than God-centered.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Sin:** Missing the mark of God’s perfect standard; lawlessness (1 John 3:4).
    *   **Depravity:** The corruption of human nature that renders man unable to save himself or please God without divine grace.

[ILL] Imagine an archer trying to shoot an arrow at the sun. One archer may be stronger and shoot higher than another, but both fall infinitely short of the target. So it is with human morality; one person may be "better" than another by human standards, but all fall short of the infinite purity of God.

***

### Q2. Who alone will be permitted to see God?
"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God." Matthew 5:8.

**Answer:**
God is the source of all life and purity; sin cannot exist in His presence any more than darkness can exist in the presence of the sun.
*   **The Requirement:** To dwell in God's presence requires a character that is in harmony with His. This is not merely an external washing, but a purity of the "heart"—the seat of motives, desires, and the will.
*   **Sanctuary Typology:** In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest had to be ceremonially clean to enter the Most Holy Place. In the heavenly reality, Christ is preparing a people who will have the law of God written in their hearts (Hebrews 8:10), cleansed from all defilement.
*   **A Transformation:** Since we established in the previous question that we are naturally impure, a radical change must occur to make us "pure in heart." This points to the necessity of the New Birth.

[ILL] You can take a pig from the mire, wash it with the finest soap, and tie a ribbon around its neck. It looks clean on the outside. But turn it loose, and it will return to the mud, because it still has the nature of a pig. To keep it clean, you would need to give it the nature of a lamb. So it is with man; outward reform is not enough—we need a new nature.

### Q3. Can man by his own exertions change his condition?
"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil." Jeremiah 13:23.

**Answer:**
Here is the boundary of human ability. We can change our location, our profession, or our appearance, but we cannot change our nature.
*   **The Impossibility of Self-Salvation:** Just as a leopard cannot will his spots away, a sinner cannot will away his guilt or his propensity to sin. No amount of penance, pilgrimage, or human resolve can cleanse the stain of sin from the soul.
*   **The Trap of Legalism:** Trying to keep the law of God without a changed heart is impossible (Romans 8:7). It leads only to frustration or hypocrisy.
*   **The Need for a Saviour:** This verse is not meant to discourage us, but to drive us to Christ. Once we admit, "I cannot," we are ready to hear God say, "I can."

[ILL] A man drowning in quicksand cannot lift himself out by pulling on his own bootstraps. The harder he struggles, the deeper he sinks. He needs a solid Rock to stand on and a hand reaching down from above to pull him out. Christ is that Rock and that Hand.

***

### Q4. How, then, can one be brought to God?
"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God." 1 Peter 3:18.

**Answer:**
Since man cannot go to God, God came to man. This is the heart of the Gospel.
*   **The Great Exchange:** Christ, the "Just" (Righteous One), took the place of the "unjust" (us). He paid the penalty that the broken law demanded so that the sinner could be set free (Isaiah 53:5).
*   **Reconciliation:** The purpose of Christ's suffering was not just to forgive us, but to *bring us to God*. It bridges the chasm caused by sin.
*   **One Way:** There is no other bridge. Only the One who is fully God and fully man could lay His hand upon both and bring them together (1 Timothy 2:5).

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation by which God and man are brought into oneness through the life, death, and priestly ministry of Jesus Christ.

[ILL] Imagine a great canyon separating two cliffs. On one side is sinful humanity; on the other is a Holy God. We cannot jump across; the distance is too great. The Cross of Calvary is the bridge laid across that abyss. Christ walked across it to fetch us, and now He carries us back to the Father.

***

### Q5. What progress can one make in coming to God without the help of Christ?
"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing." John 15:5.

**Answer:**
This verse destroys all human pride.
*   **Absolute Dependence:** The branch does not have life in itself; it only has life as long as it is connected to the trunk. The moment the connection is severed, the branch begins to wither.
*   **"Nothing":** Jesus did not say, "Without me you can do only a little," or "Without me you will have a hard time." He said, "Without me ye can do *nothing*." We cannot produce a single genuine fruit of the Spirit—no true love, no true patience, no true victory over sin—apart from His indwelling power.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** This is the secret of the Christian life. It is not our work plus Christ's work; it is Christ's life flowing through us, producing the fruit of obedience.

[ILL] Consider a light bulb. It has the potential to shine, but in itself, it is cold and dark. It cannot say, "I will try harder to shine." It must be screwed into the socket where the electrical current flows. The Christian is the bulb; Christ is the current. Without the connection, there is only darkness.

***

### Q6. When one is "in Christ," what has he become?
"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new." 2 Corinthians 5:17.

**Answer:**
Being "in Christ" results in a total transformation, not merely an improvement.
*   **A New Creation:** The same creative power that spoke the world into existence (Genesis 1) speaks spiritual life into the dead soul.
*   **The Passing of the Old:** The old motives of selfishness, pride, love of the world, and sinful habits are dethroned. They may still tempt, but they no longer dominate the life because a new King is on the throne.
*   **All Things New:** The convert has new tastes, new desires, and new goals. The Bible, once boring, becomes precious. Prayer, once a burden, becomes a delight. The commandments, once a restriction, become a hedge of protection.

[ILL] A caterpillar crawls in the dirt, consuming leaves, bound to the earth. But when it undergoes metamorphosis, it emerges as a butterfly. It does not just crawl better; it flies. It is a "new creature." The born-again Christian is no longer a spiritual caterpillar but has been given wings of faith to rise above the world.

***

### Q7. What must take place before one can become a "new creature?"
"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died." Romans 7:9.

**Answer:**
Before we can appreciate the remedy, we must feel the disease.
*   **The Function of the Law:** The Apostle Paul (Saul) once felt spiritually "alive" and self-righteous because he looked only at the letter of the law. But when the Spirit revealed the spiritual depth of the commandment (e.g., "Thou shall not covet"), he realized he was a sinner through and through.
*   **Conviction:** "Sin revived" means he recognized the true hideousness of his condition.
*   **Spiritual Death:** "I died" means his self-confidence shattered. He realized his own righteousness was "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6). This "death" to self-reliance is the prerequisite for being born again.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Conviction of Sin:** The work of the Holy Spirit using the Law to show a person their guilt and need for a Saviour (John 16:8).

***

### Q8. Unto what had Paul died?
"How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?" Romans 6:2.

**Answer:**
The death Paul experienced was a death to **sin**.
*   **A Change of Masters:** You cannot be alive to sin and alive to God at the same time. To be "dead to sin" means that sin no longer has the right to command you.
*   **Impossibility of Compromise:** It is a contradiction for a believer to say they are saved by Christ while willfully continuing to live in rebellion against Him. The Gospel saves us *from* sin, not *in* sin (Matthew 1:21).

[ILL] If a man dies, he no longer responds to stimuli. You can insult him, offer him whiskey, or temp him with money, but he does not respond. He is dead. In the same way, the Christian reckons himself "dead" to the temptations of the old life (Romans 6:11).

***

### Q9. By what did sin slay Paul?
"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me." Romans 7:11.

**Answer:**
Sin is a deceiver and a murderer.
*   **The Deception:** Sin presents itself as freedom, pleasure, and gain. It deceived Eve in Eden ("Ye shall not surely die"), and it deceives us today.
*   **The Weapon:** Sin used the commandment to condemn Paul. The Law, which was ordained to life (if kept perfectly), became a death sentence because Paul had broken it. The broken law demands the life of the sinner.

***

### Q10. Then what gives sin its strength to kill?
"The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law." 1 Corinthians 15:56.

**Answer:**
The law gives sin its definition and its condemning power.
*   **The Mirror:** Without the law, we would not fully understand what sin is (Romans 3:20). The law points out the defect.
*   **The Condemnation:** Because the law is holy and unchangeable, it cannot overlook transgression. It demands righteousness. This "strength" of the law drives us to despair of our own efforts and flee to Christ, who alone has satisfied the law's demands and can write that law in our hearts.

***

### Q11. By what forcible words did the Saviour show the importance of the new birth, or conversion?
"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." John 3:3.

**Answer:**
Jesus leaves no room for optional neutrality.
*   **"Verily, Verily":** This implies absolute certainty and solemnity.
*   **Essential Nature:** The New Birth is not for a special class of "super-Christians." It is the gateway for *anyone* who wishes to see God's kingdom.
*   **Why?** Because the Kingdom of God is a spiritual kingdom. A carnal, natural man would be miserable in heaven, where self is nothing and God is all. We must be born into that spiritual life now to enjoy it then.

[ILL] A fish cannot live on dry land, and a bird cannot live underwater. They belong to different kingdoms of nature. For a human (born of flesh) to live in heaven (the kingdom of Spirit), he must receive a new nature suitable for that environment.

***

### Q12. By what means is the second birth effected?
"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever." 1 Peter 1:23. "Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit..." 1 Peter 1:22.

**Answer:**
The agents of regeneration are the **Word of God** and the **Holy Spirit**.
*   **The Seed:** The Word (Scripture) is the seed. When received into the mind and believed, it imparts the life of God.
*   **The Agent:** The Holy Spirit takes that Word and applies it to the heart, creating new motives and power to obey.
*   **The Result:** "Obeying the truth." True conversion always results in a life of obedience, not through legalism, but through the "unfeigned love" planted by the Spirit.

***

### Q13. Can we fully understand this process?
"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit." John 3:8.

**Answer:**
The *manner* of the new birth is a mystery, but the *reality* of it is visible.
*   **Invisible Power:** We cannot see the wind, nor do we know exactly where it starts. We cannot explain the exact moment or mechanism by which God changes a human soul from hating righteousness to loving it.
*   **Visible Effects:** While we cannot see the wind, we see the trees bow and the ships move. Similarly, we see the effects of the Spirit: the drunkard becomes sober, the thief becomes honest, the proud become humble.

***

### Q14. Can one be born of the Spirit, and still do the works of the flesh?
"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." John 3:6 (Rom. 8:5).

**Answer:**
No. Jesus draws a sharp line of distinction.
*   **Two Natures:** There is the "flesh" (the old, selfish, sinful nature) and the "Spirit" (the new, Christ-centered nature). They are distinct.
*   **Like Produces Like:** An apple tree produces apples; a thorn bush produces thorns. A man born of the flesh produces fleshly works. A man born of the Spirit produces spiritual fruit.
*   **The Test:** If a person claims to be "born again" but their life is characterized by the habitual works of the flesh, their profession is false.

***

### Q15. Do these two conditions harmonize?
"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would." Galatians 5:17.

**Answer:**
There is no truce between the flesh and the Spirit. They are at war.
*   **The Conflict:** The Christian life involves a battle. The old nature battles for supremacy, but the Spirit wars against it.
*   **The Victory:** While the conflict exists, the believer is not a helpless victim. Through the Spirit, we are to crucify the flesh (Galatians 5:24). We cannot serve two masters.

***

### Q16. What are the works of the flesh?
"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like." Galatians 5:19-21.

**Answer:**
Paul provides a catalogue of sins that spring from the unrenewed heart.
*   **Sensual Sins:** Adultery, uncleanness, drunkenness.
*   **Spiritual Sins:** Idolatry, witchcraft, heresy.
*   **Relational Sins:** Hatred, wrath, strife, envy. Note that bad temper ("wrath") and divisiveness ("variance") are classed right alongside murder and adultery. These are all fruit of the self-centered life.

***

### Q17. What are the works of the Spirit?
"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." Galatians 5:22-23.

**Answer:**
When Christ dwells within, His character is revealed.
*   **Fruit, not Works:** Notice the shift from "works" (plural, implying human effort and fragmentation) to "fruit" (singular, implying a natural, unified growth).
*   **Character of God:** These nine attributes describe the character of Jesus. To have the Spirit is to become like Jesus.
*   **Temperance:** This includes self-control in all things—appetite, passion, and speech.

[ILL] A machine produces "works" with noise and clatter. A tree produces "fruit" silently and naturally, simply by abiding in the sun and rain. When we abide in Christ (the Sun of Righteousness), these virtues grow naturally in our lives.

***

### Q18. When a man has been "born again," what will he do?
"If ye know that He is righteous, ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of Him." 1 John 2:29.

**Answer:**
The proof of the New Birth is righteous living.
*   **Doing Righteousness:** Genuine faith always works by love (Galatians 5:6). It is not enough to *say* we know Him; we must walk as He walked.
*   **Source of Action:** We do not do righteousness *to be* born again; we do righteousness *because* we are born again. The action follows the life.

***

### Q19. What is righteousness?
"My tongue shall speak of Thy word: for all Thy commandments are righteousness." Psalm 119:172.

**Answer:**
The Bible defines righteousness by the standard of God’s law.
*   **The Standard:** The Ten Commandments are the transcript of God's character. Since God is righteous, His law is righteousness.
*   **The Connection:** If the New Birth leads us to "do righteousness" (Q18), and the commandments are righteousness (Q19), then the New Birth leads us to keep God's commandments.
*   **Sanctification:** This is the work of the Holy Spirit writing the law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10), empowering the believer to love and obey God's statutes—not to earn salvation, but as the fruit of it.

***

### Q20. How, then, will he that is born of God regard sin?
"Whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death." (Rom. 6:21). "Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good." (Rom. 12:9). "Wherefore laying aside all malice... As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word..." (1 Peter 2:1, 2).

**Answer:**
The born-again soul has a new attitude toward sin:
1.  **Shame:** He looks back on past sins not with longing, but with shame and regret.
2.  **Abhorrence:** He does not merely avoid sin because of the punishment; he hates it because it is evil and because it crucified his Lord.
3.  **Growth:** Like a newborn baby craves milk, the new Christian craves the Word of God to grow in holiness.
*   **Sanctification:** This is a progressive work. We "lay aside" the old and "desire" the new, earnestly striving to advance in the way of holiness.

***

### Q21. How did Paul obtain deliverance from the law of sin at conversion?
"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Romans 8:2.

**Answer:**
Deliverance comes through a higher power.
*   **Two Laws:**
    1.  **The Law of Sin and Death:** The gravitational pull of our fallen nature dragging us downward into sin.
    2.  **The Law of the Spirit of Life:** The power of the Holy Spirit lifting us upward into the life of Christ.
*   **The Victory:** The Spirit's power is stronger than the flesh's power. When we submit to Christ, the "law of the Spirit" breaks the shackles of the "law of sin."

[ILL] Gravity is a law that pulls everything downward. A bird, however, can fly upward, not by abolishing gravity, but by using the higher laws of aerodynamics and life. As long as the bird uses its wings, it overcomes the pull of earth. The "Law of the Spirit" is the wind beneath our wings, allowing us to rise above the downward pull of our sinful nature.

***

### Q22. When thus made free from the law of sin and death, in what condition is an individual?
"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Romans 8:1.

**Answer:**
*   **No Condemnation:** This is **Justification**. The believer is declared righteous in the courts of heaven. The guilt of the past is wiped away.
*   **The Condition:** This promise is for those "in Christ Jesus."
*   **The Evidence:** Those who are in Christ "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Justification (freedom from guilt) and Sanctification (freedom from the power of sin) always go together.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Justification:** God’s gracious act of declaring a repentant sinner righteous, pardoning their sins and imputing Christ’s righteousness to their account.

***

### Q23. To what kind of life does the new birth raise one?
"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 6:11.

**Answer:**
*   **Alive to God:** The Christian life is responsive to God. When He speaks, we hear. When He leads, we follow.
*   **Reckoning:** This is an act of faith. We count it as a settled fact that our old life is dead and our new life belongs to Jesus. We live today as citizens of heaven.

***

### Q24. If really born of God, what will one manifest?
"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God." 1 John 4:7.

**Answer:**
*   **Love:** This is the badge of discipleship (John 13:35). It is not merely human affection, but *agape*—divine, self-sacrificing love.
*   **The Source:** Since "God is love," becoming a partaker of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) inevitably produces love in the human heart. A bitter, hateful, or unforgiving Christian is a contradiction in terms.

***

### Q25. What victory is gained by those who are born again?
"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." 1 John 5:4.

**Answer:**
The New Birth is the beginning of a victorious life.
*   **Overcoming the World:** The "world" represents the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (1 John 2:16). The born-again believer is not conquered by these things; he conquers them through Christ.
*   **The Victory is Faith:** We do not overcome by our own willpower, but by faith in the One who has already overcome the world (John 16:33). Faith lays hold of Christ's power and makes it our own.
*   **The Promise:** In the final judgment, the promises of Revelation are given "to him that overcometh" (Revelation 3:21). Through the New Birth and the indwelling Christ, this victory is assured.
