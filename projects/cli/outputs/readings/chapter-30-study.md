### Q1. By what are men sanctified?

**“Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” John 17:17.**

**Answer:** Sanctification is the process by which the Holy Spirit transforms
the character of the believer into the likeness of Christ. According to the
prayer of Jesus, the instrument used for this transformation is **the truth**
found in God’s Word.

- **The Source of Holiness:** We cannot sanctify ourselves by human effort or
  social reform. Holiness is an attribute of God, imparted to us as we receive
  His Word into our hearts (1 Thessalonians 2:13).
- **The Role of Truth:** Error and falsehood darken the mind and enslave the
  soul to sin. Truth—specifically the truth about God’s character of love and
  His law—liberates the mind and purifies the affections (John 8:32).
- **A Progressive Work:** Sanctification is not the work of a moment; it is the
  work of a lifetime. As we learn more truth from the Bible, we are called to
  advance in holiness.

**Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the believer is
  set apart for holy use and gradually made holy in character, resulting in
  obedience to God’s law (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23).

### Q2. Would God have all men come to the knowledge of the truth?

**“Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the
truth.” 1 Tim. 2:4.**

**Answer:** God’s desire for humanity is universally benevolent. He does not
predestinate any soul to be lost; rather, He has provided an atonement
sufficient for the entire world.

- **The Divine Will:** God’s "will" here expresses His deep desire and
  provision. He has done everything possible, short of violating free will, to
  bring every person to salvation (2 Peter 3:9).
- **Knowledge and Salvation:** Salvation is inextricably linked to the
  "knowledge of the truth." We cannot be saved in willful ignorance. To be saved
  from sin (which is a lie), we must embrace the truth as it is in Jesus.

---

### Q3. After receiving a knowledge of the truth, what must one do to be sanctified?

**“God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of
the Spirit and belief of the truth.” 2 Thess. 2:13.**

**Answer:** Knowing the truth intellectually is not enough. It must be combined
with two essential elements:

1.  **Sanctification of the Spirit:** The Holy Spirit must apply the truth to
    the heart. The Spirit convinces us of sin and righteousness (John 16:8) and
    empowers the will to yield to God.
2.  **Belief of the Truth:** This "belief" is more than mental assent; it is
    saving faith. It is a "faith that works by love" (Galatians 5:6). We must
    personally accept the truth as God’s message to _us_.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:** We are chosen for salvation not because
of our own merits, but through the work of the Spirit and our faith in Christ.
The Spirit brings the righteousness of Christ and imparts it to the believer,
making the truth a living reality in the life.

---

### Q4. And what is necessary besides believing it?

**“Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience.” 1 Peter 1:2.**

**Answer:** True faith always leads to obedience. The text shows the goal of
election and sanctification is "unto obedience."

- **The Fruit of Faith:** Faith is the root; obedience is the fruit. If a person
  claims to believe the truth but persists in willful disobedience to God’s law,
  their faith is dead (James 2:17–20).
- **The Power to Obey:** This obedience is not a legalistic attempt to earn
  heaven. It is the result of the "sanctification of the Spirit." When the
  Spirit writes the law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10), obedience becomes the
  natural outflow of a new nature.

**[ILL]** A blueprint is necessary to build a house, but possessing the
blueprint does not build the walls. You must follow the blueprint. Similarly,
knowing Bible truth is the blueprint for a holy life, but "obedience" is the
actual building of that life through the power of the Spirit.

---

### Q5. What effect does obedience to the truth have?

**“Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit.”
1 Peter 1:22.**

**Answer:** Obedience to the truth, empowered by the Spirit, results in the
purification of the soul.

- **Practical Purity:** Sin is an impurity of the soul. When we obey the
  truth—by repenting of sin and walking in God's commandments—the defilement of
  sin is washed away by the blood of Christ and the power of the Spirit (1 John
  1:7–9).
- **Preparation for Heaven:** Nothing that defiles can enter the city of God
  (Revelation 21:27). Therefore, this purifying process is the essential
  preparation for living in God's presence.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the sanctuary had to be cleansed of the
  record of sin on the Day of Atonement, so must our "soul temples" be cleansed
  of the love and practice of sin before Christ returns.

---

### Q6. How must worship be rendered to God, that it may be acceptable?

**“God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in
truth.” John 4:24.**

**Answer:** True worship requires a balance of two elements:

1.  **In Spirit:** Worship must spring from a heart renewed by the Holy Spirit.
    It must be sincere, emotional, and alive, not merely a cold form or ritual.
2.  **In Truth:** Worship must align with God’s revealed will in Scripture. Zeal
    without knowledge can lead to fanaticism or idolatry (Romans 10:2).

**Key Point:** We cannot worship God "in truth" while knowingly violating His
commandments (such as the Sabbath), nor can we worship Him "in spirit" if our
hearts are full of pride or bitterness.

---

### Q7. How should the truth ever be cherished?

**“Buy the truth, and sell it not.” Prov. 23:23.**

**Answer:** Truth is presented as a commodity of infinite value that requires a
transaction.

- **Buying the Truth:** We do not buy truth with money, but we "pay" for it by
  sacrificing our pride, our preconceived opinions, our worldly popularity, and
  sometimes our convenience. We must be willing to give up everything to possess
  Christ, who is the Truth (Philippians 3:7–8).
- **Selling It Not:** Once we have found Bible truth, we must never compromise
  it for gain, status, or peace with the world. To "sell" the truth is to
  abandon one's conscience for temporary advantage.

**[ILL]** Imagine a man who finds a cure for a deadly disease in a rare herb. He
must travel far and climb high mountains to get it ("buy it"). Once he has it,
no amount of money should tempt him to trade it away ("sell it"), for without
it, he dies. The truth is that cure for the soul.

---

### Q8. Is there in the Bible what may be called "present truth?

**“Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these
things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.” 2 Peter
1:12.**

**Answer:** Yes. While all Scripture is inspired, "present truth" refers to that
portion of God's Word that has a special application to a specific time and
generation.

- **Timeliness:** God sends messages adapted to the needs and crises of His
  people in every age.
- **Testing Truths:** These messages often serve as a test of loyalty. Accepting
  the general truths of the past is easy; accepting the _present_ truth that
  requires action _now_ is the test of faith.

**Definition:**

- **Present Truth:** A specific message from God applicable to the current time,
  designed to prepare His people for the next event in salvation history.

---

### Q9. What was the special message to be proclaimed in Noah's day?

**“And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth
is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the
earth. Make thee an ark of gopher wood.” Gen. 6:13, 14.**

**Answer:** The "present truth" for Noah’s generation was a warning of coming
judgment (the Flood) and a provision for escape (the Ark).

- It was not enough for the antediluvians to believe in God generally, or to
  follow the religion of their father Adam. They had to believe the _specific_
  message of the Flood and enter the Ark to be saved.

---

### Q10. Did Noah build the ark? and why?

**“By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with
fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the
world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.” Heb. 11:7.**

**Answer:** Noah built the ark because he believed God’s warning about "things
not seen as yet" (rain and flood).

- **Righteousness by Faith:** Notice that Noah is called an "heir of
  righteousness which is by faith." His boat-building was not a work of human
  merit to _earn_ salvation; it was the outward action produced by his inward
  faith.
- **Faith Works:** Had Noah claimed to have faith but refused to build the ark,
  he would have drowned. True faith always produces action corresponding to the
  message.

---

### Q11. How many were saved in the ark?

**“The long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.” 1 Peter
3:20.**

**Answer:** Only eight people were saved. This teaches a solemn lesson: the
majority is often wrong when it comes to present truth.

- **The Remnant:** In every age, it is usually a "little flock" that accepts the
  advanced light of truth (Luke 12:32).
- **Popularity is No Test:** We cannot judge the truth of a message by the
  number of people accepting it. The masses in Noah's day were wrong; the few
  who followed God's specific instruction were right.

---

### Q12. What special message was given to Jonah for the people of Nineveh?

**“So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the Lord...
And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said,
Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.” Jonah 3:3, 4.**

**Answer:** The present truth for Nineveh was a time-bound warning: judgment is
coming in forty days. It was a call to immediate repentance based on a specific
prophetic time period.

---

### Q13. What saved the people from the predicted overthrow?

**“So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on
sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.” “And God saw
their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil,
that He had said He would do unto them; and He did it not.” Jonah 3:5, 10.**

**Answer:** Two things saved them:

1.  **Belief:** They "believed God."
2.  **Action:** They "turned from their evil way."

This illustrates that God's threats of judgment are often conditional. He
desires mercy, not destruction. Their acceptance of the "present truth" (the
warning) led to a change of behavior, which averted the disaster.

---

### Q14. What was the special mission of John the Baptist?

**“There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a
witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through Him might believe.”
John 1:6, 7.**

**Answer:** John the Baptist was the forerunner of the Messiah. His "present
truth" message was to identify Jesus of Nazareth as the Lamb of God and to
prepare the people’s hearts to receive Him.

---

### Q15. What answer did he return to those who asked him about his mission?

**“He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make straight the
way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.” John 1:23.**

**Answer:** John identified his work as the fulfillment of prophecy (Isaiah
40:3).

- **Making Straight the Way:** This meant calling people to repentance
  (straightening out the crookedness of sin) so that the King of Glory could
  enter their lives.
- **Preparation:** Present truth is always a preparing message. John prepared
  the way for the First Advent; God has a message to prepare the way for the
  Second Advent.

---

### Q16. John's baptism was something new and startling to his generation. What did those do for themselves who rejected his doctrine?

**“But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves,
being not baptized of him.” Luke 7:30.**

**Answer:** By rejecting the messenger God sent (John) and his specific message
(baptism of repentance), the religious leaders "rejected the counsel of God
against themselves."

- **Consequence:** By rejecting the _forerunner_, they unprepared themselves to
  receive the _King_. Rejecting present truth blinds the spiritual eyesight to
  greater truths.

---

### Q17. And what did those do who were baptized of John?

**“And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being
baptized with the baptism of John.” Luke 7:29.**

**Answer:** The common people "justified God."

- **Justifying God:** This means they declared God to be right and themselves to
  be wrong. This is the essence of true repentance. They acknowledged the truth
  of the message and submitted to the requirements of the gospel.

---

### Q18. Did the reputed people of God receive Christ when He came?

**“He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.” John 1:11.**

**Answer:** Tragically, no. The very nation that held the Scriptures and the
prophecies regarding the Messiah failed to recognize Him when He appeared. Being
a member of the visible church is not a guarantee of salvation if the heart is
closed to truth.

---

### Q19. What reason did they give for not doing so?

**“We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from
whence He is.” John 9:29.**

**Answer:** They pitted _past_ truth against _present_ truth.

- They claimed to believe Moses (truth of the past) as an excuse to reject Jesus
  (truth of the present).
- **The Lesson:** Satan often uses established tradition and the memory of past
  leaders to prevent people from advancing in the light God is revealing _now_.

---

### Q20. What did the people say when Christ referred to how their fathers slew the prophets?

**“If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the prophets.” Matt. 23:30.**

**Answer:** They claimed they would have acted differently than their ancestors.

- **Self-Deception:** They honored the dead prophets with tombs and monuments
  while plotting to kill the Living Prophet (Jesus). It is easy to honor truth
  that is centuries old; it is much harder to honor truth that reproves our
  current sins.

---

### Q21. What was the result of the Jews' not accepting Christ?

**“And when He was come near, He beheld the city, and wept over it, saying, If
thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong
unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.” Luke 19:41, 42.**

**Answer:** The result was total blindness and eventual destruction.

- **"This Thy Day":** They had a specific time of visitation—their "present
  truth" moment. Because they let it pass, the truth became "hid from their
  eyes."
- **Judgment:** This rejection led to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, a
  type of the final destruction of the world at the end of time.

---

### Q22. Is there to be a special message and work for the last generation?

**“Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of
man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made
ruler over his house- hold, to give them meat in due season?” Matt. 24:44, 45.**

**Answer:** Yes. Just as in the days of Noah and John the Baptist, God has a
special message for the time just before Christ returns.

- **Meat in Due Season:** This refers to spiritual food (doctrine/truth)
  appropriate for the specific time. The "meat" for the last days is the message
  that prepares a people for the Second Coming.

---

### Q23. What is pronounced upon those who are found doing such work?

**“Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when He cometh shall find so doing.”
Matt. 24:46.**

**Answer:** A special blessing is pronounced on those who are awake, watching,
and spreading the warning message. They are the "faithful and wise" servants.

---

### Q24. What will be the burden of that proclamation?

**“Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments
of God, and the faith of Jesus.” Rev. 14:12.**

**Answer:** The "present truth" for the last days is the **Three Angels'
Messages** of Revelation 14, culminating in verse 12. This message produces a
people with three distinct characteristics:

1.  **Patience:** Enduring faith amidst persecution and delay.
2.  **Keep the Commandments of God:** A restoration of obedience to all ten
    commandments, including the Sabbath, which points to the Creator.
3.  **The Faith of Jesus:** Not just faith _in_ Jesus, but the very quality of
    faith _of_ Jesus. This is the Righteousness by Faith that enables the
    believer to keep the law.

**Sanctuary Connection:** Revelation 11:19 opens the Most Holy Place in heaven,
where the Ark of the Covenant (containing the Ten Commandments) is seen. The
final message directs the world's attention to the law inside the heavenly ark
and the interceding High Priest who ministers there.

---

### Q25. How earnestly is this work to be prosecuted?

**“And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and
compel them to come in; that my house may be filled.” Luke 14:23.**

**Answer:** The work is to be done with extreme urgency and love.

- **"Compel them":** This does not mean using force, but using the "compelling"
  power of love, logic, and the Word of God. It implies an intense earnestness,
  knowing the time is short and the stakes are eternal life or death.
- **The Final Call:** God wants His house filled. He is holding back the winds
  of strife until the message of present truth has gone to "every nation,
  kindred, tongue, and people" (Revelation 14:6).

**[ILL]** If a dam is about to break and flood a town (like Noah's flood), you
do not whisper the warning. You run, you shout, you knock on doors, you "compel"
people to leave their possessions and flee to high ground. This is the spirit of
the present truth message for this generation.
