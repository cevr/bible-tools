### Q1. State the Lord's purpose concerning the law.

“The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the law and make it honorable." Isa. 42:21.

**Answer:**
The prophet Isaiah reveals that the coming Messiah would not diminish the law of God, but rather "magnify" it. To understand this, we must look at the relationship between God and His law.

1.  **The Character of God:** The verse states God does this "for His righteousness' sake." The law is a transcript of God’s own character. Since God is unchanging (Malachi 3:6), His law, which defines righteousness (Psalm 119:172), must also be unchanging.
2.  **The Meaning of "Magnify":** To magnify does not mean to make something larger than it really is (like a distortion), but to reveal its hidden detail, breadth, and glory. Christ came to show that the commandment is "exceeding broad" (Psalm 119:96).
3.  **Restoring Honor:** Through the traditions of men and the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, the law had been misrepresented as a burden or a ladder for earning salvation. Christ came to strip away these human burdens and reveal the law as a "law of liberty" (James 2:12) and a fence of protection for God's people.

*   **Definition:** **The Law of God**: The Ten Commandments; the eternal moral standard reflecting God’s character of love, justice, and holiness (Exodus 20:1-17; Romans 7:12).

**The Microscope:** If you look at a diamond with the naked eye, it looks beautiful. If you place it under a microscope (magnify it), you do not change the diamond, nor do you create a new stone. You simply reveal the depth, precision, and flawlessness that was already there but unseen. Christ’s life was the microscope that revealed the spiritual depth and beauty of God's law.

### Q2. Why was it necessary to magnify the law?

“It is time for thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void thy law." Ps. 119:126.

**Answer:**
The Psalmist calls for divine intervention because humanity has "made void" the law.

1.  **Rebellion and Neglect:** To make "void" means to treat as empty, null, or non-binding. In the history of Israel—and indeed all humanity—men have tried to set aside God's requirements to follow their own inclinations (Romans 8:7).
2.  **The Necessity of Intervention:** When the law is voided, the moral standard collapses, and sin (which is the transgression of the law, 1 John 3:4) abounds. God must "work" to restore the authority of His government.
3.  **The Great Controversy:** Satan’s primary attack in the Great Controversy is against the law of God. He claims it cannot be kept or that it restricts our freedom. Christ came to refute this lie by living out the law perfectly in human flesh.

*   **Definition:** **Great Controversy**: The cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty over the universe (Revelation 12:7-9).

### Q3. How was the law "made void" when Christ was on the earth?

” And He said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition." Mark 7:9 (Matt. 15:1-9).

**Answer:**
When Christ appeared, He did not find the religious leaders keeping the law too strictly; He found them evading it through "tradition."

1.  **Replacing God with Self:** The Pharisees had created loopholes to avoid the plain duties of the law. In the context of Mark 7, they used a tradition called "Corban" to excuse themselves from caring for their elderly parents (honoring father and mother), claiming their money was dedicated to the temple instead.
2.  **Vain Worship:** Jesus declared that worship based on human commandments is "in vain" (Matthew 15:9).
3.  **The Danger of Tradition:** Whenever church tradition, culture, or political expediency is elevated above the "Thus saith the Lord," the law of God is effectively made void. This is a warning to the church in every age.

**The Painted Window:** Imagine a window meant to let in sunlight (God's Truth). If men paint over the glass with intricate designs and their own pictures (Traditions), the window may look colorful, but it no longer functions to let in the light. The room remains dark. Christ came to scrape away the paint so the clear light of the Law could shine again.

### Q4. What was Christ's attitude toward the law?

” Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill." Matt. 5:17.

**Answer:**
Christ explicitly denies any intention to abolish the moral law.

1.  **Destroy vs. Fulfill:** The word "fulfill" (*pleroo* in Greek) means to "fill to the full," or to "fill up." It is the opposite of "empty" or "destroy."
2.  **Living Example:** Christ fulfilled the law by obeying it perfectly. He filled it full of meaning. Just as a baptismal vow is "fulfilled" when it is kept, not when it is deleted, the law is fulfilled when lived out in obedience.
3.  **Prophetic Fulfillment:** He also fulfilled the predictions of the "prophets" regarding the Messiah. He was the substance that the ceremonial shadows pointed toward (Colossians 2:17). While the ceremonial laws (sacrifices) met their fulfillment and end at the cross, the moral law (Ten Commandments) was established forever.

*   **Definition:** **Ceremonial Law**: The temporary system of types, sacrifices, and festivals pointing forward to Christ’s death (Hebrews 10:1). **Moral Law**: The eternal Ten Commandments revealing God's will for human conduct (Exodus 20).

[ILL]
**The Architect's Blueprint:** When a builder constructs a house according to a blueprint, he "fulfills" the plan. He does not tear up the blueprint and say, "I have destroyed it." No, by following it perfectly, he makes the plan a reality. Jesus came to make the blueprint of righteousness a reality in human life.

### Q5. How did He then proceed to magnify the law before His hearers?

"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment; but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment." Matt. 5:21, 22. (See also 1 John 3:15.)

**Answer:**
Jesus magnified the law by moving from the outward act to the inward motive.

1.  **The Spirituality of the Law:** Paul writes, "The law is spiritual" (Romans 7:14). It is not satisfied by merely refraining from stabbing someone.
2.  **The Root of Murder:** Jesus taught that unjust anger, hatred, and contempt ("Raca," or calling someone worthless) are the seeds of murder. In the eyes of God, who looks on the heart (1 Samuel 16:7), harboring hatred is a violation of the sixth commandment.
3.  **The Need for a New Heart:** Because the law requires purity in the inward parts, human effort alone cannot keep it. This drives us to Christ for a new heart—this is the promise of the New Covenant: "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).

***

### Q6. What did He say of the seventh commandment?

"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, That whoever looketh on a woman to lust after her had committed adultery with her already in his heart." Matt. 5:27, 28.

**Answer:**
Here, the microscope is applied to the seventh commandment, revealing that God desires purity of thought as well as action.

1.  **Sin Begins in the Mind:** James tells us that lust conceives and brings forth sin (James 1:15). Christ shows that the commandment is broken the moment the will consents to the sin, even if the physical opportunity is lacking.
2.  **The Standard of Judgment:** God will bring "every secret thing" into judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14). This magnification of the law reveals our utter bankruptcy. We may appear righteous to men, but we are sinners before God.
3.  **Sanctification:** This high standard shows that true sanctification is not just behavior modification; it is the cleansing of the soul temple by the indwelling Spirit of God.

*   **Definition:** **Sanctification**: The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in the believer, imparting Christ's life to overcome sin and produce the fruit of holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

[ILL]
**The Weed:** If you only cut the top off a weed (outward sin), it will grow back because the root remains. To have a perfect lawn, you must pull the weed up by the root (inward lust). Christ’s magnification of the law targets the root of sin.

***

### Q7. Did Christ Himself keep the commandments?

“I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love." John 15:10.

**Answer:**
Yes, Christ was the only human being to ever keep the law perfectly.

1.  **The Sinless One:** Scripture testifies that He "was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). He never had a rebellious thought or an impure motive.
2.  **The Foundation of Our Salvation:** Why is this important? Because Christ is "The Lord Our Righteousness" (Jeremiah 23:6).
    *   **Imputed Righteousness:** His perfect life is credited to our account when we believe (Justification).
    *   **Imparted Righteousness:** His victorious life is given to us to live *through* us by the Holy Spirit (Sanctification).
3.  **Our Example:** Christ proved that humanity, connected to Divinity, can obey God. He invites us to "abide" in His love, so that we too may keep the commandments (John 14:15).

***

### Q8. How long did He say the law would last?

” For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Matt. 5:18.

**Answer:**
The law is as enduring as the heavens and the earth.

1.  **Jot and Tittle:** The "jot" was the smallest Hebrew letter (yod), and the "tittle" was a tiny stroke distinguishing one letter from another. Jesus emphasized that not even the smallest detail of the moral law would be altered.
2.  **Immutable Nature:** Since the law is the foundation of God's government, it cannot change. If the law could be changed to accommodate man's fallen state, God would be admitting His law was imperfect.
3.  **Till All Be Fulfilled:** This phrase parallels "till heaven and earth pass." As long as we are in this world, the definition of sin remains. The law points out sin; until sin is eternally destroyed and the new earth is created, the law stands as the standard.

### Q9. Why did Christ come to earth?

“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom. 8:3, 4.

**Answer:**
This passage is the heart of the gospel and the plan of salvation.

1.  **What the Law Could Not Do:** The law is like a mirror (James 1:23-25). It can show you the dirt on your face (sin), but it has no soap or water to wash it off. It commands righteousness but gives no power to the sinner to perform it. It was "weak through the flesh" because our fallen nature cannot obey it.
2.  **Condemning Sin in the Flesh:** Christ took upon Himself our nature—"the likeness of sinful flesh"—yet without sinning. By conquering temptation in a human body, He broke the power of sin. He "condemned" sin—served it an eviction notice.
3.  **The Result - Righteousness by Faith:** Note the purpose: "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled *in* us."
    *   It is not just fulfilled *for* us (justification), though that is the foundation.
    *   It is fulfilled *in* us (sanctification) as we walk by the Spirit.
    *   God’s plan is to restore us to obedience. The law is no longer an enemy condemning us, but a delight written on the heart.

*   **Definition:** **Justification**: God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ’s merits (Romans 3:24). **Imputed Righteousness**: Christ's credit given to us. **Imparted Righteousness**: Christ's life lived in us.

### Q10. In order to accomplish this, what was it necessary for Christ to do?

” For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." Rom. 5:6.

**Answer:**
It was necessary for Christ to die as a substitute.

1.  **Without Strength:** We were powerless to save ourselves or to pay the penalty for our past sins.
2.  **The Penalty Paid:** The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). The broken law demanded the life of the transgressor. Jesus stepped in and paid that debt.
3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner brought a lamb to the altar. He laid his hands on it, confessing his sin (transferring guilt), and then the lamb was slain. Christ is the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29) who took our guilt and died our death in the outer court (this earth), so that we might live.

*   **Definition:** **Atonement**: The work by which God and man are reconciled (brought back into oneness). It involves the sacrifice on the Cross and Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.

***

### Q11. But if the law could have been abolished, would not that have released men from condemnation?

“Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression." Rom. 4:15.

**Answer:**
This is a logical argument proving the perpetuity of the law.

1.  **The Definition of Sin:** "Sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). If the law is abolished, there is no transgression. If there is no transgression, there is no sin.
2.  **No Need for a Savior:** If there is no sin, there is no need for a Savior to die. If God could have simply abrogated (cancelled) the Ten Commandments, He could have saved humanity without the suffering of the Cross.
3.  **The Cost of the Cross:** The fact that Christ *did* die proves that the law could not be changed. The penalty had to be paid. The Cross is the greatest evidence in the universe that the Law of God is immutable, holy, just, and good.

**NOTE.** - It is plain that if the law of God demanded the death of Christ, and had power to slay Him (Gal. 3:13), the law must still live, even after cursing the Son of God in our behalf. Then by yielding His life to the demands of the law, He magnified it in His death as well as in His life.

[ILL]
**The Governor and the Criminal:** Suppose a criminal is sentenced to death. If the Governor wants to save him, he cannot simply burn the law book that defines murder. If he did, he would create anarchy. Instead, if the Governor himself stepped down and took the penalty for the criminal, the law would be upheld (magnified) as just, while the criminal would be saved by grace. This is what Christ did at Calvary.
