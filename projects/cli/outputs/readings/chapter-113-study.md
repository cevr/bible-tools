### Q1. In what way did Christ suffer for the unjust?

“For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He
might bring us to God, being put to death In the flesh, but quickened by the
Spirit.” (1 Peter 3:18)

**Answer:**

Here is the foundation of the plan of salvation: the substitutionary
**atonement** of Jesus Christ.

1.  **The Exchange:** The text presents a divine exchange. Christ is the "Just"
    (the Righteous One), and we are the "unjust" (the law-breakers). He took the
    penalty that belonged to us—death—so that we might receive the reward that
    belongs to Him—life and access to the Father.
    - **Definition:** _Atonement:_ The work by which God and man are reconciled
      (brought back into agreement and oneness) through Christ’s sacrifice and
      priestly ministry (Romans 5:11).
    - **Definition:** _Justification:_ The legal act where God declares a
      repentant sinner righteous, not because of their own works, but because
      Christ’s perfect history is credited to them (Romans 3:24–26).

2.  **Suffering for Sin:** Christ did not suffer merely as a martyr; He suffered
    "for sins." On the cross, He became the Sin-Bearer (2 Corinthians 5:21),
    feeling the crushing weight of the world’s transgression and the hiding of
    His Father's face. This corresponds to the **Altar of Sacrifice** in the
    earthly sanctuary service, where the innocent lamb died for the guilty
    sinner.

3.  **Bringing Us to God:** The purpose of this suffering is relational. Sin
    caused a separation between man and God (Isaiah 59:2). Christ acts as the
    Bridge-Builder. Through faith in His blood, the barrier is removed, and the
    believer is restored to communion with the Father.

4.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot bring ourselves to God. We cannot
    climb the mountain of God’s holiness with our own ropes of good works. We
    must be _brought_ by Another. Faith lays hold of Christ, and He carries us
    into the presence of the Father.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a debtor thrown into a deep, dark prison for a
debt he could never pay in a thousand lifetimes. The judge is legally bound to
keep him there. Then, a wealthy Prince steps in, pays the entire debt with his
own fortune, and opens the cell door. The Prince does not merely pay the money;
he takes the ex-prisoner by the hand and leads him into the King’s palace,
introducing him as a friend. Christ paid our debt (death) to bring us out of the
prison of condemnation and into the throne room of God.

### Q2. By what was He quickened, or made alive?

“Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.” (1 Peter 3:18)

**Answer:**

The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the guarantee of our own resurrection and
the source of our power to live a holy life today.

1.  **Put to Death in the Flesh:** Christ was truly human. He took upon Himself
    our nature, "the seed of Abraham" (Hebrews 2:16), and in that human nature,
    He truly died. He did not fake death; His heart ceased to beat. This proves
    the reality of the price paid for the broken law.

2.  **Quickened by the Spirit:** The word "quickened" means "made alive." Who
    raised Jesus? The Scripture attributes the resurrection to the power of God
    through the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:11). This demonstrates the unity of the
    Godhead in the work of redemption.

3.  **Practical Application:** The same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead
    dwells in the believer. This is the secret to **Sanctification**. We are
    "dead in trespasses and sins" (Ephesians 2:1), but the Spirit quickens us to
    a new spiritual life.
    - **Definition:** _Sanctification:_ The ongoing process where the Holy
      Spirit imparts the life of Christ to the believer, transforming their
      character and enabling them to overcome sin (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

4.  **Power to Overcome:** If the Spirit has power to bring a dead body back to
    life, He certainly has the power to bring a dead, sinful habit to an end in
    your life. There is no sin too deep that the resurrection power of the
    Spirit cannot conquer it.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A dry, withered seed has no power in itself. You can
command it to grow, but it remains dormant. However, when placed in the soil and
touched by rain and sun (symbols of the Spirit), a mysterious life-force is
triggered. It bursts through the hard shell and pushes through the heavy earth
to become a fruitful plant. We are that seed; the Holy Spirit is the life-force
that "quickens" us to bear the fruit of righteousness.

### Q3. By what did He preach to the spirits in prison?

“By which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison.” (1 Peter 3:19)

**Answer:**

This verse is often misunderstood to mean that Jesus went to a burning hell or a
holding place for the dead to preach to ghosts. However, let us look at the
grammar and the context of Scripture carefully.

1.  **"By Which":** This phrase refers back to the previous verse: "the Spirit."
    It was _by the Holy Spirit_ that Christ preached. Christ is the Word, but
    the Spirit is the agency of communication to the prophets (1 Peter 1:11).

2.  **The Agency of Preaching:** Christ has been working for man’s salvation
    since the fall of Adam. He did not preach personally in the flesh to the
    antediluvians (people before the Flood), but He preached to them through His
    representative, Noah, who was inspired by the Holy Spirit. Noah is called a
    "preacher of righteousness" (2 Peter 2:5).

3.  **Scriptural Consistency:** The Bible clearly teaches that "the dead know
    not anything" (Ecclesiastes 9:5) and that "it is appointed unto men once to
    die, but after this the judgment" (Hebrews 9:27). There is no second chance
    after death. Therefore, this preaching must have happened while these people
    were still alive.

4.  **The Warning:** God always warns before He destroys (Amos 3:7). Through the
    Spirit, Christ gave the people of Noah’s day a 120-year warning to repent.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If the President of a country sends an ambassador to a
foreign nation to deliver a message, and the ambassador speaks the President's
words, we say, "The President told them..." even though the President was not
physically there. The President spoke _by_ or _through_ the ambassador.
Similarly, Christ preached to the lost generation of Noah's day _by_ the Spirit,
speaking _through_ Noah.

### Q4. What did the Saviour say He had been anointed to do?

“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the
gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at
liberty them that are bruised.” (Luke 4:18)

**Answer:**

Here, Jesus defines the "prison" mentioned in Peter’s epistle. He uses the
language of Isaiah 61:1 to describe His mission.

1.  **Identifying the Captives:** Christ did not come to open literal jails
    (like John the Baptist’s prison cell). He came to open the spiritual prison
    house of Satan. Every sinner is a captive of the enemy.
    - **Definition:** _Spirits in Prison:_ Living men and women who are bound by
      the chains of sinful habits, ignorance, and condemnation.

2.  **The Gospel as Liberation:** The "Gospel" is not just good news about a
    future heaven; it is the "power of God" (Romans 1:16) to break chains now.
    - **Righteousness by Faith:** Many Christians feel they are "forgiven" but
      still bound to sin. This is a half-gospel. Christ came to "preach
      deliverance." This means He provides the power to stop sinning. He sets
      the captive free from the _power_ of sin, not just the guilt.

3.  **Healing and Sight:** Sin blinds us to the character of God and breaks the
    heart with sorrow. The work of the High Priest is to apply the "eye salve"
    (Revelation 3:18) so we can see truth, and to bind up the wounds caused by
    transgression.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a man chained to a heavy iron ball. He tries to
run but can only drag himself a few inches. A compassionate king comes and says,
"I forgive you for being slow." That is kind, but it doesn't solve the problem.
The man needs the chain cut! Christ’s gospel is the bolt-cutter. He forgives the
past (justification) and cuts the chain of the present habit (sanctification),
setting the prisoner at liberty to run the race of faith.

### Q5. By whom is a man taken into bondage?

“For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.” (2 Peter
2:19)

**Answer:**

This verse establishes the legal and spiritual reality of mastership.

1.  **The Law of Bondage:** You serve whoever you obey (Romans 6:16). If a man
    obeys his appetite, he is a slave to appetite. If he obeys his temper, he is
    a slave to anger. If he obeys the promptings of the Holy Spirit, he is a
    servant of God (which is true freedom).

2.  **Overcome vs. Overcomer:** The Bible creates a binary distinction. You are
    either "overcome" by sin, or you are an "overcomer" through Christ.
    - To be "overcome" is to be in the "prison" of sin.
    - To "overcome" is the promise of the Revelation: "To him that overcometh
      will I grant to sit with Me in my throne" (Revelation 3:21).

3.  **The Lie of Liberty:** The context of 2 Peter 2 speaks of false teachers
    who promise liberty while they themselves are servants of corruption. There
    is a dangerous teaching that says, "You can sin and still be saved; you are
    free from the law." But Peter argues that if you are sinning, you are not
    free; you are in bondage.

4.  **The Way Out:** To stop being a slave to Satan, we must change masters. We
    must surrender the will entirely to Christ. "Yield yourselves unto God...
    and your members as instruments of righteousness" (Romans 6:13).

**[ILL] Illustration:** In the ancient world, if an army was defeated in battle,
the soldiers became the property (slaves) of the victor. They lost their rights
and had to do the bidding of their conqueror. When we yield to temptation, we
surrender our territory to Satan, and he claims us as his property. Only Christ,
the Stronger One (Luke 11:21–22), can invade that territory and win us back.

### Q6. Under what is one thus sold into bondage?

“For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.” (Rom.
7:14)

**Answer:**

Here Paul describes the condition of the natural human heart—the "prison" from
the inside out.

1.  **The Nature of the Law:** The law is "spiritual," "holy," "just," and
    "good" (Romans 7:12). It is a transcript of God's character. It cannot be
    changed or lowered to meet our fallen standard. It detects the thoughts and
    intents of the heart.

2.  **The Nature of Man:** Man is "carnal" (fleshly). Because of the Fall, our
    natural bent is toward selfishness and away from God.
    - **Definition:** _Carnal:_ The state of the unrenewed mind, which is
      "enmity against God" and "not subject to the law of God" (Romans 8:7).

3.  **"Sold Under Sin":** This phrase uses the language of the slave market. We
    are born into a world where the currency is sin, and our nature is sold into
    slavery. We cannot buy our own freedom because we are bankrupt.

4.  **The Desperate Need:** This condition highlights why salvation _must_ be by
    faith and grace. A slave cannot free himself. He needs a Redeemer (a
    Kinsman-Redeemer) to pay the price.
    - **Sanctuary Connection:** In the Levitical law, if a man sold himself into
      slavery, a near kinsman could redeem him (Leviticus 25:47–49). Christ
      became our "Near Kinsman" (by taking human flesh) to pay the price and
      redeem us from being "sold under sin."

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a mirror (the Law). You look into it and see
dirt on your face (Sin). You might hate the mirror for showing the dirt, or you
might try to break the mirror. But the mirror is "holy and good"—it tells the
truth. The mirror cannot wash your face. You are "sold" to the dirt until you go
to the water and soap (Christ and His cleansing grace). The law points out the
prison; Christ opens the door.

### Q7. When did the Spirit of God preach to these "spirits in prison," who were disobedient?

“Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in
the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing.” (1 Peter 3:20)

**Answer:**

This verse unlocks the mystery of the passage by providing the **timeframe**.

1.  **"When":** The preaching did not happen when Christ died on the cross; it
    happened "when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah."
    - The "spirits in prison" are the people who were "disobedient" during
      Noah’s time.
    - They were in the "prison" of sin (bondage to the flesh).
    - Christ (by the Spirit) preached to them _then_, while they were still
      alive and had a chance to repent.

2.  **The Longsuffering of God:** God waited. He gave them 120 years (Genesis
    6:3). This shows God's immense patience. He does not delight in the death of
    the wicked (Ezekiel 33:11).

3.  **While the Ark was Preparing:** This was a time of **Probation**.
    - **Definition:** _Probation:_ A period of testing where a choice can be
      made.
    - Just as there was a specific time to enter the ark before the door was
      shut, we are living in a time of probation today. Christ is currently
      preparing a place for us (John 14:1–3) in the heavenly sanctuary. When His
      work of atonement is finished, the door of mercy will close, just as the
      door of the ark closed.

4.  **The Parallel:** As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the
    days of the Son of man (Luke 17:26). Today, the Spirit is preaching to
    "spirits in prison" (modern sinners bound by the world) through God's
    remnant people and the Three Angels' Messages, inviting them into the safety
    of Christ before the end comes.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Suppose a man is on death row (prison). The Governor
sends a messenger with a pardon, urging him to sign it before the execution
date. The man mocks the messenger and rips up the pardon. Later, the man is
executed. Could we say the Governor tried to save the "spirit in prison"? Yes.
Did he try to save him after he was dead? No. The offer was made while the
"longsuffering waited."

### Q8. Did the Spirit of God try to deliver the captives of sin in the days of Noah?

“And the Lord said, My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also
is flesh; yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.” (Gen. 6:3)

**Answer:**

The Spirit's work is to strive with the hearts of men, calling them out of the
darkness of sin.

1.  **Striving with Man:** The Hebrew implies a contention, a struggle, or a
    ruling. The Holy Spirit battles against our carnal nature (Galatians 5:17).
    He convicts of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8). This "striving"
    is the preaching mentioned in 1 Peter 3.

2.  **"He Also is Flesh":** God recognized the frailty and stubbornness of the
    antediluvians. They were "flesh"—totally given over to their lower nature.
    Yet, God did not abandon them immediately.

3.  **The Limit of Mercy:** "My Spirit shall not always strive." This is a
    solemn warning. There is a limit to divine patience—not because God stops
    loving, but because the human heart becomes so hardened (seared) that it can
    no longer hear the Spirit's voice.
    - **The Unpardonable Sin:** To persistently reject the "striving" of the
      Spirit is to commit the unpardonable sin (Matthew 12:31–32), because you
      cut off the very line of communication by which God saves you.

4.  **Christ in the Old Testament:** As the Note indicates, Christ has always
    been the Mediator. He was the "Angel of the Lord" in the wilderness (Exodus
    23:20–23; 1 Corinthians 10:1–4). It was the Spirit of Christ in Noah that
    pleaded with the antediluvians.

5.  **Sanctuary Application:** We are living in the antitypical Day of
    Atonement. The Spirit is striving with the world today. We must not harden
    our hearts (Hebrews 3:15). We must allow the Spirit to break the "prison" of
    our bad habits and worldly attachments now, while the Ark of safety is still
    open.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Consider a warning siren at a beach where a hurricane is
approaching. The siren blows (the Spirit strives). The lifeguard (the
preacher/Noah) shouts through a megaphone. The people are enjoying the water
(the pleasures of sin) and ignore the sound. Eventually, the siren stops, not
because the danger is gone, but because the storm has arrived and the time for
evacuation is over. We must heed the Spirit while He strives.
