## Slide 1 – Q1: Abel vs. Cain
- Question: Why was Abel's sacrifice more acceptable to God than Cain’s?
- Key Text: Hebrews 11:4 – “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Faith & Understanding)
- **The Blood vs. The Fruit**
  - Cain brought the "fruit of the ground" (Genesis 4:3), representing human works with no blood, and thus no confession of sin.
  - Abel brought a slain lamb (Genesis 4:4), acknowledging that “without shedding of blood is no remission.” (Hebrews 9:22).
- **Faith in the Substitute**
  - Abel had faith in the promised Seed who would bruise the serpent’s head (Genesis 3:15 – “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”).
  - He understood he could only be accepted through the death of a Substitute.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Righteousness by Faith vs. Works**
  - This is the earliest biblical illustration of this doctrine.
  - Cain sought to approach God through his own culture and effort (works).
  - Abel approached God through the merit of the innocent victim (faith in Christ).

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Debt and the Check**
  - Imagine two men owing a debt they cannot pay.
  - One man brings handmade crafts to the bank, saying, "Look how hard I worked." The banker refuses; crafts are not legal tender.
  - The second man brings a check signed by a wealthy benefactor. He did no work for it, but he trusts the signature. The bank accepts it.
  - Cain brought "crafts" (works); Abel brought the "check" signed in the blood of the Lamb.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Pointing Forward
- Question: To what did his sacrifice point forward?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 1:18-20 – “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points
- **The Lamb of God**
  - The lamb represented Jesus: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” (John 1:29).
- **Foreordained**
  - The plan of salvation was not an afterthought. It is the "everlasting covenant" (Hebrews 13:20) made before the foundation of the world.
- **Redemption**
  - Redemption means "buying back."
  - Christ’s blood is the price paid to release us from the condemnation of the law: “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us...” (Galatians 3:13).

## Slide 7 – Q3: What Abel Obtained
- Question: By his sacrifice, what did Abel obtain?
- Key Text: Hebrews 11:4 – “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous...”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Justification)
- **Definition of Justification**
  - It is the legal declaration by God that a sinner is righteous, not because of deeds, but because Christ's righteousness is imputed.
  - Romans 4:5 – “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”
- **Imputed Righteousness**
  - Abel was a sinner in need of a Savior.
  - He was accounted righteous only because he laid hold of Christ.
- **The Witness**
  - God accepts the sinner who comes covered in the merit of Jesus.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Abraham’s Worship
- Question: With what sacrifice did God command Abraham to worship Him?
- Key Text: Genesis 15:9-10 – “And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points
- **Ratifying the Covenant**
  - Passing between cut animals was a solemn way of sealing a covenant (Jeremiah 34:18).
  - God confirmed His promise to give Abraham the land and a Seed (Christ).
- **Total Surrender and Obedience**
  - Faith is not merely abstract belief; true faith acts.
  - James 2:17 – “Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.”
  - Abraham’s obedience was the fruit of his faith.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Jacob’s Faith
- Question: How did Jacob manifest his faith in the promised Redeemer?
- Key Text: Genesis 46:1 – “And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points
- **Continuity of Faith**
  - The religion of the patriarchs was the religion of the cross.
  - From Abel to Jacob, the faithful line was preserved through the sacrificial system teaching a Substitute.
- **Seeking Guidance**
  - Jacob sought God’s covering and guidance through the appointed means of worship—the blood of the covenant.

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Sanctuary Command

## Slide 22 – Q10: Second Apartment Contents
- Question: What was contained in the second apartment, or the most holy place?
- Key Text: Hebrews 9:3-4 – “And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all; Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant.”

  - God satisfies the law's demands through Christ so mercy can be extended.
