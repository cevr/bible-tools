### Q1. Did our Saviour abolish anything on the cross?

**“Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances." Eph. 2:15.**

**Answer:**
Yes, Christ abolished a specific system of laws, but it is crucial to identify which one. The Apostle Paul specifies that it was the "law of commandments contained in **ordinances**." This refers to the ceremonial system—the Levitical types, shadows, sacrifices, and ritual requirements given to Israel to point forward to the Messiah.

1.  **The Nature of the "Enmity":** Paul calls this ceremonial law the "enmity" (or source of hostility) because it created a sharp division—a "middle wall of partition"—between the Jewish people and the Gentile world. The rigid requirements regarding circumcision, temple rituals, and ceremonial washings made it impossible for Gentiles to fellowship fully with Jews.
2.  **Abolished by Fulfillment:** This system was a "shadow of things to come" (Colossians 2:17). When the body (Christ) appeared, the shadow was no longer necessary. By dying on the cross, Jesus fulfilled the symbolic meaning of every animal sacrifice. The veil of the temple was rent (Matthew 27:51), signifying that the earthly ritual system was at an end.
3.  **Distinction from the Moral Law:** We must distinguish between the *Ceremonial Law* (which was temporary, remedial, and pointed to Christ) and the *Moral Law* (the Ten Commandments, which are eternal). Christ abolished the types and shadows because He is the substance; He did not abolish the standard of righteousness.

**Definitions:**
*   **Ceremonial Law:** The regulations regarding the earthly sanctuary, priesthood, and sacrifices (Hebrews 9:1–10). It was a teaching tool until Christ came.
*   **Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man. In the Old Testament, this was symbolized by animal blood; in the New Testament, it is accomplished by the blood of Christ (Leviticus 17:11; Romans 5:11).

Imagine a blueprint for a magnificent building. While the building is under construction, the blueprint is essential. But once the building is finished, you don't live in the paper blueprint; you live in the building. The ceremonial law was the blueprint (the shadow); Christ is the building (the reality). Once the reality is here, the blueprint is set aside, but the laws of physics (gravity, structure) that hold the building up (representing the Moral Law) remain in force.

### Q2. What did He Himself say about the law?

**“Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill." Matt. 5:17.**

**Answer:**
Christ is the author of the Law, and in His Sermon on the Mount, He clarifies His relationship to it.

1.  **Not to Destroy:** The word "destroy" means to dissolve, overthrow, or annul. Jesus explicitly warns us *not to think* that He came to do this. The plan of salvation does not remove the government of God; it restores man to harmony with it.
2.  **To Fulfill:** The word "fulfill" (Greek *pleroo*) means "to fill up," "to make full," or "to fully preach/exemplify." Christ fulfilled the law in two ways:
    *   **Prophetically:** He met the requirements of the messianic predictions in the "prophets."
    *   **Morally:** He lived out the Ten Commandments perfectly. He showed the spiritual depth of the law—that it reaches the thoughts and intents of the heart, not just outward actions (Matthew 5:21–22, 27–28).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Because Christ fulfilled the law perfectly, He offers His perfect life to us. This is **Justification**—God crediting Christ’s obedience to our account. He did not fulfill it so that we could go on breaking it; He fulfilled it to provide the power for us to walk in His steps (Romans 8:3–4).

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** The legal act where God declares a repentant sinner righteous based solely on the merits of Jesus Christ, not on the sinner's works (Romans 3:24–28).

### Q3. How long did He say the law would endure?

**“For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Matt. 5:18 (Luke 16:17).**

**Answer:**
The moral law is as enduring as God's throne. Jesus uses the strongest possible language to affirm its permanence.

1.  **Till Heaven and Earth Pass:** As long as we are living on this earth, the law of God remains in effect. It is the transcript of God's character—holy, unchangeable, and eternal.
2.  **Jot and Tittle:** The "jot" was the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet (yod), and the "tittle" was a tiny stroke that distinguished one letter from another. Jesus teaches that not even the smallest detail of God's moral standard will be altered by His mission.
3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the Ten Commandments were placed *inside* the Ark of the Covenant, beneath the Mercy Seat (Exodus 25:16, 21). In the heavenly sanctuary, John the Revelator saw the "ark of his testament" (Revelation 11:19). The law is the foundation of God's government in heaven and earth; therefore, the gospel does not void it but establishes it (Romans 3:31).

[ILL]
If a man is convicted of a crime and the governor grants him a pardon, does that pardon abolish the law against the crime? No. The pardon frees the man from the penalty, but the law against the crime remains on the books so that society can function. Similarly, grace saves the sinner, but it does not abolish the law that defines sin.

### Q4. What did Paul say of the law of God?

**“Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." Rom. 7:12.**

**Answer:**
Far from being an "enmity" or a yoke of bondage, the Moral Law is described by Paul with three distinct attributes:

1.  **Holy:** It comes from a holy God and requires holiness (separation from sin) in His people (1 Peter 1:15–16).
2.  **Just:** It is equitable and fair. It demands nothing that is not right. It is the standard of the Great Judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:13–14).
3.  **Good:** It is designed for man's happiness and protection. Like a guardrail on a cliff, it is not there to restrict freedom, but to preserve life (Deuteronomy 6:24).

Paul argues here that the problem is not the law; the problem is *sin* and the *carnal nature*. The law acts as a mirror to show us the dirt on our faces (James 1:23–25), but the mirror is not the enemy—the dirt is.

### Q5. How did he regard it?

**“For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." Rom. 7:22.**

**Answer:**
This verse highlights the difference between the unrenewed heart and the heart converted by the Holy Spirit.

1.  **The Inward Man:** This refers to the new nature born of the Spirit. The carnal (fleshly) mind is at enmity with God and cannot be subject to His law (Romans 8:7). However, when a person is born again, the "stony heart" of rebellion is removed, and a "heart of flesh" is given (Ezekiel 36:26).
2.  **Delight:** To the true believer, God's commandments are not a burden but a joy. The Psalmist wrote, "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart" (Psalm 40:8). This was Christ's experience, and it becomes the experience of every Christian who abides in Him.
3.  **Sanctification:** This process—where the law is written on the heart and lived out in the life—is called sanctification. It is the work of a lifetime where, through the Holy Spirit, the believer is transformed into the image of Christ.

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God's grace by which the believer is cleansed from sin and made holy in character, resulting in obedience to God's will (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

### Q6. What does one show by keeping the commandments?

**“For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not grievous." 1 John 5:3.**

**Answer:**
Obedience is the natural fruit and proof of love.

1.  **Love as the Motive:** True obedience is never legalism (trying to earn salvation by works). It is a response to being loved and saved. Jesus said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).
2.  **Not Grievous:** The commandments are only "grievous" (heavy/burdensome) to those who love sin. To the one who loves God, His commands are the path of life. When we are walking in the Spirit, we do not fulfill the lust of the flesh (Galatians 5:16).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot keep the commandments in our own strength. We need **Imparted Righteousness**—Christ living His life through us. As we surrender daily, He works in us "both to will and to do of his good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13).

[ILL]
A woman who marries a man she does not love finds his requests annoying and burdensome. But if she loves him deeply, doing things that please him is a joy, not a duty. The "marriage" to Christ (Romans 7:4) makes obedience a labor of love.

### Q7. Does sin still exist?

**“If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." 1 John 1:8.**

**Answer:**
The Bible is clear that sin is a present reality in the world and a constant danger to the believer.

1.  **Universal Condition:** "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23).
2.  **The Need for a Saviour:** If sin were not real, we would not need a Saviour or a High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary to advocate for us. The fact that we need forgiveness implies that sin exists.
3.  **Ongoing Battle:** While believers can have victory over sin, the presence of a sinful nature and a sinful world means we must remain vigilant.

### Q8. Could there be sin now, if Christ abolished the law?

**“For until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law." Rom. 5:13.**

**Answer:**
This is a crucial logical and theological point: **Law and Sin stand or fall together.**

1.  **The Definition of Sin:** The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4).
2.  **No Law = No Sin:** If the moral law was abolished at the cross, then there is no longer any standard to measure righteousness. If there is no speed limit, you cannot get a speeding ticket. If God abolished the Ten Commandments, then murder, theft, and idolatry are no longer "sin" in a legal sense.
3.  **The Conclusion:** Since we know sin still exists (people still need a Saviour), the Law that defines sin *must* still exist. The fact that men are sinners proves the law is in force.

### Q9. What was made possible by abolishing the law of commandments contained in ordinances?

**“That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world; but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us." Eph. 2:12-14.**

**Answer:**
The abolition of the *ceremonial* system had a glorious purpose: the unification of humanity in Christ.

1.  **Access for All:** Under the old ceremonial system, Gentiles were restricted from the inner courts of the temple. They were "aliens" and "strangers." By fulfilling these types, Christ removed the barriers. Now, anyone—Jew or Gentile—can approach the Father directly through the name of Jesus.
2.  **The Middle Wall:** This refers to the physical wall in the Jewish temple courts that separated the Court of the Gentiles from the inner sanctuary. Christ spiritually demolished this wall.
3.  **One New Man:** The gospel brings people of all nations into one spiritual family. We are no longer saved by becoming Jewish in ritual, but by becoming Christian in faith.

**Sanctuary Truth:**
We now have a "High Priest," not of the order of Aaron (Levitical), but of Melchizedek (Hebrews 7:11–22). His ministry is in the heavenly sanctuary, open to all who come by faith (Hebrews 4:14–16).

### Q10. What was the chief thing that separated the Jews and the Gentiles?

**“And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them." Acts 11:2, 3.**

**Answer:**
The separation was primarily based on ceremonial rituals and the "traditions of the elders" regarding purity.

1.  **Ritual Separation:** The Jews believed that associating with Gentiles, and specifically eating with them, rendered them ceremonially unclean. This was a major barrier to the spread of the Gospel.
2.  **The Vision of Peter:** God had to give Peter a vision (Acts 10) to show him that "God is no respecter of persons" and that no human being should be called "common or unclean" simply because they are a Gentile.
3.  **Clarification:** The issue here was not the health laws of the Bible (clean vs. unclean meats, Leviticus 11), which are based on physiology and health, but rather the *ceremonial defilement* associated with uncircumcised people. Christ abolished the ritual segregation, enabling the church to be a global movement.

### Q11. Was circumcision done away in Christ?

**“For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any- thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." Gal. 6:15.**

**Answer:**
Yes, the physical rite of circumcision, which was the entrance sign into the Old Covenant, is no longer of value in the New Covenant.

1.  **A New Sign:** In the New Testament, the sign of entrance is baptism (Colossians 2:11–12), which represents the burial of the old life and resurrection to newness of life.
2.  **A New Creature:** What matters to God is not a mark in the flesh, but a transformation of the character. This is the "circumcision of the heart" (Romans 2:29).
3.  **Regeneration:** To be a "new creature" (or new creation) is the essence of the gospel. It means the old, selfish nature is replaced by the life of Christ. "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new" (2 Corinthians 5:17).

### Q12. After circumcision and the ordinances connected with it lost their force, what still remained of the utmost importance?

**“Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God." 1 Cor. 7:19.**

**Answer:**
This verse provides the definitive summary of the entire study. Paul explicitly contrasts the ritual law (circumcision) with the moral law (commandments of God).

1.  **Ritual Law is "Nothing":** In terms of salvation or standing with God, the ceremonial ordinances (circumcision, sacrifices, feast days) are now nothing. They have passed away.
2.  **Moral Law Remains:** In contrast, "the keeping of the commandments of God" remains vital. The abolishing of the one did not affect the standing of the other.
3.  **The Conclusion of the Matter:**
    *   We are saved by **Grace** through **Faith** alone (Ephesians 2:8).
    *   But true faith establishes the **Law** (Romans 3:31).
    *   God’s people in the last days are identified by this dual characteristic: "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that **keep the commandments of God**, and the **faith of Jesus**" (Revelation 14:12).

[ILL]
Consider a scaffolding and a house. The ceremonial law was the scaffolding used to build the house of faith. When the house (Christ’s work) was completed, the scaffolding was taken down. But the foundation (the Moral Law) remains. If you tear down the foundation, the house collapses. Christ removed the scaffolding, but He strengthened the foundation.
