## Slide 1 – Q1: The Time of the End

- **Question:** According to the words of the angel to Daniel, when might the
  world look for an increase of knowledge?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 12:4 – “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal
  the book, even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and
  knowledge shall be increased.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Unsealing the Prophecy

- **The Sealing of the Book:**
  - The angel Gabriel instructed Daniel to seal the prophecies, particularly
    regarding the long timelines and sanctuary service.
  - These truths were to remain obscured until the "Time of the End."
- **Running To and Fro:**
  - In Hebrew idiom, this does not mean mere tourism.
  - It implies diligent, intense scrutiny of the Scriptures to understand truth.
  - Amos 8:12 – “And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even
    to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and
    shall not find it.”
- **Comparing Scripture:**
  - True Bible students turn pages back and forth, comparing scripture with
    scripture.
  - Isaiah 28:10 – “For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
    upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:”

## Slide 3 – Q1: A Twofold Increase

- **Prophetic Knowledge:**
  - Since the end of the 18th century (1798), the book of Daniel has been
    opened.
  - Truths regarding the sanctuary, the judgment, and the return of Christ have
    been restored.
- **General Knowledge:**
  - God lifted the suppression of His Word.
  - This correlated with an awakening of the human mind in science and industry
    to facilitate the Gospel.
- **Definition:**
  - **Time of the End:** A specific period beginning in 1798, following the
    1260-year papal supremacy, leading to the Second Coming.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Sealed Orders:**
  - Imagine a ship captain given a sealed envelope marked: "Do not open until
    you reach the Cape of Good Hope."
  - While in the Atlantic, the contents are a mystery.
  - Once the ship reaches the coordinate, the seal is broken.
  - The instructions become "present truth" vital for the next leg of the
    journey.
- **Application:**
  - God reserved special light for the final generation to navigate the perils
    of the last days.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Period of Persecution

- **Question:** Under the Roman power, how long were the saints to be
  persecuted?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 11:35 – “And some of them of understanding shall fall, to
  try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end:
  because it is yet for a time appointed.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Purpose of Trials

- **The Refinery:**
  - God allows trials "to try them, and to purge, and to make them white."
  - **Purging:** Removing the dross of sin.
  - **Making White:** A symbol of the righteousness of saints.
  - Revelation 19:8 – “And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
    linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.”
- **Limiting the Wrath:**
  - God set a "time appointed" to limit the enemy's power.
  - Matthew 24:22 – “And except those days should be shortened, there should no
    flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Righteousness by Faith in Suffering

- **We Cannot Purify Ourselves:**
  - We are cleansed by the blood of Jesus (Justification).
  - We are refined by His Spirit through the discipline of life
    (Sanctification).
- **Sanctification:**
  - God uses trials to drive us to Christ so we may partake of His holiness.
  - Hebrews 12:10 – “For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
    pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
    holiness.”
  - 1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I
    pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
    coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Silversmith:**
  - A silversmith holds silver over the hottest part of the fire.
  - He does not leave it to be destroyed but watches closely.
  - He knows the silver is refined only when he can see his own reflection
    perfectly mirrored in it.
- **Application:**
  - God keeps us in the "furnace of affliction" until the image of Jesus is
    perfectly reflected in our characters.
  - Malachi 3:3 – “And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he
    shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they
    may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: The Prophetic Calculation

- **Question:** How long, according to the prophecy, was the little horn, which
  represents the Roman power, to persecute the saints?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the Most
  High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change
  times and laws; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times
  and the dividing of time.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: 1,260 Years

- **The Calculation:**
  - **Time:** One year (360 days).
  - **Times:** Two years (720 days).
  - **Dividing of Time:** Half a year (180 days).
  - **Total:** 1,260 prophetic days.
- **The Day-Year Principle:**
  - In Bible prophecy, a day represents a literal year.
  - Numbers 14:34 – “After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
    even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even
    forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.”
  - Ezekiel 4:6 – “...I have appointed thee each day for a year.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Historical Fulfillment

- **Start Date: 538 A.D.**
  - The supremacy of the Papacy was established when the last Arian opposition
    (Ostrogoths) was removed.
- **End Date: 1798 A.D.**
  - Adding 1,260 years to 538 brings us to 1798.
  - **The Deadly Wound:** General Berthier entered Rome, took the Pope prisoner,
    and declared the political rule of the Papacy ended.
  - This marked the beginning of the "Time of the End."

## Slide 12 – Q3: Law and Righteousness

- **Changing Times and Laws:**
  - This power attempted to alter God's law, specifically the Sabbath.
- **Obedience by Faith:**
  - True righteousness leads a believer to obey God's original law through faith
    in Jesus, rather than human traditions.
  - Acts 5:29 – “Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought
    to obey God rather than men.”
  - Matthew 15:9 – “But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
    commandments of men.”

## Slide 13 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Treasure Map:**
  - If a map says "Walk 1,260 paces north to find the treasure," and you stop at
    500, you will not find it.
  - God gave a precise map of history.
  - He marked the exact years (538 to 1798).
  - When the time arrived, His people could identify their place in history and
    have confidence in the accuracy of His Word.

## Slide 14 – Q4: Explosion of Invention

- **Question:** In the line of scientific inventions, have there been any
  remarkable developments since 1798?
- **Key Quote:** “More has been done in the course of our lifetime than in all
  the previous existence of the race.” — _London Spectator_ (19th Century)

## Slide 15 – Q4: God's Providence

- **Historical Context:**
  - For thousands of years (from Abraham to Washington), travel and
    communication remained virtually unchanged (wind and horse).
- **The Sudden Change:**
  - Following 1798, the human mind was unlocked.
  - Steam, electricity, and mechanization revolutionized life.
- **Divine Timing:**
  - This was not an accident.
  - Just as prophetic knowledge was unsealed, God unsealed the secrets of nature
    to facilitate His work.

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **Candle vs. Electric Light:**
  - For millenniums, men pushed back darkness with fire (torches, lamps,
    candles).
  - Suddenly, in the scope of history, electricity banished the night.
- **Application:**
  - This physical light parallels the immense spiritual light God poured out at
    the same time to banish the darkness of error.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Timing of Inventions

- **Question:** When were some of the principal inventions brought out?
- **The Facts:**
  - Steamboat (1807), Steam Press (1811), Railroad (1825).
  - Telegraph (1837), Sewing Machine (1846), Telephone (1876).
  - Note: None of these appeared before the 1798 "Time of the End."

## Slide 18 – Q5: Tools for the Harvest

- **The Gospel Commission:**
  - The message must go to every nation, kindred, and tongue (Revelation 14:6).
  - Revelation 14:6 – “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
    having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
    earth...”
- **Purpose of Technology:**
  - **Steam Press & Digital:** To produce truth-filled literature.
  - **Transport (Rail/Air):** To move missionaries swiftly.
  - **Communication:** To warn the world instantly.
- **Stewardship:**
  - We use these tools not for vanity, but to point men to Christ our
    Righteousness.

## Slide 19 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Roman Roads:**
  - Rome built paved roads for selfish power and taxes.
  - But when Christ came, those roads became highways for the Apostles to spread
    the Gospel.
- **Modern "Roads":**
  - Today, the world builds the internet for commerce.
  - God’s people must use it as the "Roman roads" of the last days to carry the
    Three Angels' Messages.

## Slide 20 – Q6: Preceding the End

- **Question:** What has the Saviour said should precede the end?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:14 – “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be
  preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the
  end come.”

## Slide 21 – Q6: The Gospel Message

- **The Content:**
  - **Justification:** Christ has paid the penalty for sin.
  - **Sanctification:** Christ restores the law of love in the heart.
  - **The Kingdom:** Christ returns to destroy sin and reign eternally.
- **A Witness to All:**
  - Not all will be converted, but all must have a "witness"—an opportunity to
    choose.
  - This message separates the wheat from the tares.
- **Romans 1:16:**
  - “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God
    unto salvation to every one that believeth...”

## Slide 22 – Q6: Sanctuary Application

- **Christ's Work Today:**
  - The preaching of this Gospel coincides with Christ's work in the **Most Holy
    Place** of the heavenly sanctuary.
  - He is currently blotting out the sins of those who accept Him.
- **Closing of Probation:**
  - When the message is finished, probation closes, and He returns.
- **Our Responsibility:**
  - We have the knowledge (prophecy unsealed).
  - We have the means (inventions).
  - We are without excuse if we do not finish the work.

## Slide 23 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Dam:**
  - Imagine a city where a deadly dam is about to burst.
  - Authorities have knowledge of the danger and vehicles to reach the people.
  - If they sit comfortably and do not use the vehicles to warn the citizens,
    the blood of the people is on their hands.
- **Application:**
  - We possess the knowledge of Christ's coming and the technology to tell the
    world. We must go.
