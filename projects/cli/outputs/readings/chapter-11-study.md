### Q1. Is Christ set forth as a divine being in Holy Writ?

"But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows." Hebrews 1:8, 9.

**Answer:**

The Scriptures provide the most emphatic testimony regarding the nature of Jesus Christ. In this passage, the Father Himself addresses the Son as "God." This is foundational to the Christian faith and the plan of salvation.

*   **Supreme Authority:** By addressing the Son as God and establishing His throne "for ever and ever," the Father acknowledges Christ's co-equal authority and eternal nature. He is not a created being, but the Creator and King.
*   **The Character of the King:** The "sceptre" (a symbol of ruling authority) of Christ’s kingdom is "righteousness." This points us to the law of God, which is the transcript of His character. Christ does not set aside the law; He rules by it.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** The text says Christ "loved righteousness, and hated iniquity." This is the very nature He offers to impart to the believer.
    *   **Sanctification:** This is the work of the Holy Spirit to implant this same love for right-doing and hatred for sin in the heart of the believer (Ezekiel 36:26–27). We are saved to be *like* Him.
*   **Definitions:**
    *   **Divinity:** The state of being truly God; possessing the nature and attributes of Deity (omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence).
    *   **Iniquity:** Lawlessness; a violation of God’s law (1 John 3:4).

**[ILL]** A royal ambassador may speak *for* the king, but he cannot sit *on* the throne. If a subject rebels against the law, only the King has the authority to pardon the rebel or pay the debt from his own treasury. Because Jesus is God, His sacrifice is infinite and can cover the sins of the whole world.

### Q2. Did Christ exist before He was manifested in the flesh?

"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was." John 17:5.

**Answer:**

Christ was not merely a good man who was born at Bethlehem and then elevated to godhood. He existed from eternity past, sharing the glory of the Father before creation began.

*   **Pre-existence:** Jesus claims a glory that existed "before the world was." This aligns with the prophecy that His "goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting" (Micah 5:2).
*   **The Covenant of Peace:** The plan of salvation was not an afterthought. The counsel of peace was between the Father and the Son before the foundation of the world (Zechariah 6:13).
*   **The Sanctuary Connection:** In Revelation 13:8, Jesus is called "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." The provision for our salvation—the Atonement—was secured in the heart of God before sin ever entered.
*   **Implication for Faith:** Because He is eternal, He is able to give "eternal life." A created being could only offer a created life, but Christ offers the life of God Himself.

**[ILL]** Consider the sun and its rays of light. The rays flow from the sun, yet as long as the sun has existed, the light has existed. You cannot have the sun without the light. So it is with the Father and the Son; Christ is the "brightness of his glory" (Hebrews 1:3), eternally co-existent with the Father.

### Q3. By what agency was His incarnation effected?

"And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God." Luke 1:35.

**Answer:**

The miracle of the Incarnation—God becoming man—was accomplished through the direct agency of the Holy Spirit.

*   **The Holy Thing:** Jesus was born of a woman (Galatians 4:4) and took upon Himself the seed of Abraham (Hebrews 2:16), yet He was born without the stain of inherited guilt. He was a "holy thing," the Son of God, possessing a sinless nature in sinful flesh.
*   **Dependence on the Spirit:** From His conception to His resurrection, Jesus relied totally on the Holy Spirit. This sets the pattern for our Christian walk.
    *   **RBF Application:** Just as Christ was formed in Mary by the Holy Ghost, so must "Christ be formed in you" (Galatians 4:19) by the agency of the same Spirit. This is the secret of the new birth.
*   **Definition:**
    *   **Incarnation:** The act of a divine being taking on human flesh and nature.

**[ILL]** A gardener grafts a branch from a superior, fruit-bearing tree into a wild, bitter stock. The life of the good branch flows into the trunk, dominating it and producing sweet fruit. In the incarnation, the divine life was grafted into humanity, that we might partake of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).

---

### Q4. Did His incarnation annul His divinity?

"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory." 1 Timothy 3:16.

**Answer:**

No, His divinity was not lost or annulled; it was *manifested* (revealed) in the flesh. This is the "mystery of godliness."

*   **Veiled, Not Voided:** When Christ walked the earth, He veiled His divine glory in human flesh so that He could draw near to sinners without consuming them. He laid aside the *use* of His divine attributes for His own benefit, but He never ceased to be God.
*   **Justified in the Spirit:** The Holy Spirit vindicated Christ's claim to be the Son of God through His sinless life and resurrection (Romans 1:4).
*   **The Mystery of Godliness:** This phrase suggests that the secret to *our* godliness (holy living) is found in understanding *His* incarnation.
    *   **Victory over Sin:** If Jesus were only God, His victory over sin would not help us. If He were only man, He could not save us. But as the God-Man, He bridged the gulf. He showed that humanity, connected to Divinity, can keep the law of God.
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** The flesh of Christ is compared to the **veil** in the earthly sanctuary (Hebrews 10:20). Just as the Shekinah glory dwelt behind the veil, so the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in the temple of Christ’s body.

**[ILL]** Imagine a mighty King who puts on the clothes of a common laborer to work alongside his suffering people. He looks like a laborer, he sweats like a laborer, but under the shirt beats the heart of the King. His rank has not changed, only his outward manifestation.

### Q5. How does Christ Himself speak of His relation to the Father?

"I and My Father are one." John 10:30.

**Answer:**

Jesus claimed an absolute oneness with the Father. This statement led the Jews to take up stones to kill Him, because they understood correctly that He was making Himself equal with God (John 10:33).

*   **Unity of Essence:** They share the same divine nature.
*   **Unity of Authority:** To obey the Son is to obey the Father; to reject the Son is to reject the Father.
*   **Implications for Atonement:** Because They are one, the Atonement was not an angry Father punishing an innocent Son. Rather, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself" (2 Corinthians 5:19). The Father suffered with the Son.

### Q6. How does He show what He means by being "one with the Father?

"And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are." John 17:11.
NOTE: One in purpose, spirit, work etc.; and the same is true of those who have truly learned of Christ.

**Answer:**

Jesus defines this unity not merely as a mathematical oneness, but as a perfect harmony of character, purpose, and spirit. He prays that His disciples may experience this same unity.

*   **Union with Christ:** The goal of the plan of salvation is to bring the believer into the same relationship with God that Jesus holds.
    *   "I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one" (John 17:23).
*   **Sanctification:** This unity is the essence of true sanctification. It means having the "mind of Christ" (Philippians 2:5). When we submit our will to God, His thoughts become our thoughts, and His purpose becomes our purpose.
*   **Definition:**
    *   **Atonement:** Literally "At-one-ment." The condition of being at one with God.

**[ILL]** Consider a musical chord consisting of different notes. When played together perfectly, they form one harmonious sound. If one note is out of tune (sin), the harmony is broken. Christ tunes the human soul back to the pitch of heaven, so we can be "one" with the Father as He is.

### Q7. How was He manifested on the earth as a Saviour?

"And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord." Luke 2:10, 11. "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth." John 1:14.

**Answer:**

Christ was manifested as a **Saviour**, which implies that humanity is in a desperate condition from which it cannot rescue itself.

*   **Christ the Lord:** The Babe of Bethlehem is identified as "Christ" (the Anointed One/Messiah) and "Lord" (Jehovah).
*   **Grace and Truth:** These two attributes are often seen as opposing forces—Grace desires to forgive, Truth (Law) demands justice. In Christ, "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other" (Psalm 85:10).
    *   **Grace:** Unmerited favor and enabling power given to the undeserving.
    *   **Truth:** The standard of God's reality and His law (Psalm 119:142).
*   **RBF Application:** He did not come to save us *in* our sins, but *from* our sins (Matthew 1:21). He brings grace to pardon the past (Justification) and truth to guide the future (Sanctification).

### Q8. Why was He thus made known?

"Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people." Hebrews 2:17.

**Answer:**

Christ had to become fully human ("made like unto his brethren") to serve as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.

*   **The Necessity of Humanity:** To be a mediator, He must lay His hand upon both parties. As God, He touches the Father's throne; as Man, He touches the sinner's infirmity.
*   **Faithful High Priest:** He is faithful because He has walked the path of obedience in human flesh. He knows what it costs to resist temptation.
*   **Reconciliation:** This refers to the satisfaction of justice. By His death, He paid the penalty of the broken law; by His life, He provides the power to keep it.
*   **Sanctuary Truth:** Jesus is not currently on the cross; He is alive in the Heavenly Sanctuary, applying the benefits of His sacrifice to those who come to Him by faith.

**[ILL]** If you are crossing a dangerous, narrow bridge over a chasm, you want a guide who has crossed it before and knows every loose plank and slippery spot. Jesus became man to cross the bridge of life, facing every storm we face, so He could turn back and guide us safely across.

### Q9. How was He recognized by the Father while here?

"And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matthew 3:17.

**Answer:**

At His baptism, the Father publicly declared His acceptance of Christ. This is a vital truth for every believer.

*   **Acceptance of Humanity:** Jesus stood in the Jordan River representing the human race. When God said, "I am well pleased," He was accepting Jesus as the second Adam.
*   **Justification by Faith:** Because the Father is well pleased with Jesus, He is also well pleased with every repentant sinner who is "in Christ." We are "accepted in the beloved" (Ephesians 1:6).
*   **Sanctuary Type:** This corresponds to the examination of the sacrifice. The lamb had to be without blemish. The Father examined Christ's life and declared it perfect.

### Q10. How was the divinity of the Son of God shown?

**Answer:**

The Scriptures provide a five-fold witness to His divinity, proving He is able to save to the uttermost.

**1. In His creative power.**
> "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness... For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth..." Colossians 1:13-16.
> "In the beginning was the Word... All things were made by him..." John 1:1-3.

*   **Explanation:** He is the Agent of creation.
*   **Practical Application:** Creation requires omnipotence. If Christ is the Creator, He is also the **Re-creator**. Conversion is a "new creation" (2 Corinthians 5:17). Only the God who spoke light into darkness can speak righteousness into a sinful heart.

**2. By His power to perform miracles.**
> "Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth..." John 11:43, 44.

*   **Explanation:** He held power over disease, the elements, and death itself.
*   **Practical Application:** There is no habit so deadening, no sin so bound "hand and foot" around a person, that the command of Christ cannot break it.

**3. By His right to lay down His life and take it up again.**
> "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again." John 10:17.

*   **Explanation:** Jesus possessed life in Himself—"original, unborrowed, underived" (E.G. White, *Desire of Ages*). A created being cannot resurrect himself.

**4. By His being recognized as God.**
> "But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever..." Hebrews 1:7, 8.
> "...and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." Isaiah 9:6.

*   **Explanation:** The Bible explicitly gives Him the titles of Deity. "Everlasting Father" in Isaiah 9:6 refers to Him as the Author/Father of eternity, not that He is the same person as God the Father.

**5. By what He endured for a race of rebels (Substitutionary Atonement).**
> "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities..." Isaiah 53:10-12.

*   **Explanation:** A mere man could barely die for his own sins, let alone the sins of others. Only an infinite God could pay an infinite debt incurred by the transgression of the holy law.
*   **Justification:** The text says He will "justify many."
    *   **Definition of Justification:** God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is accounted righteous because of Christ’s merits (Romans 3:24).
    *   **Imputed Righteousness:** He bears our iniquities; we receive His righteousness.

### Q11. How does Paul speak of Christ's relation to the Father?

"For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." Colossians 2:9.

**Answer:**

This is one of the strongest statements of Christ's divinity in the Bible.

*   **The Fulness:** Not just a portion, an emanation, or a spark of divinity. *All* the fulness of Deity dwells in Jesus.
*   **Bodily:** This fulness dwells in His glorified human body. Even now, in the heavenly sanctuary, there is a Man on the throne who is fully God.
*   **RBF Connection:** The very next verse says, "And ye are complete in him" (Colossians 2:10).
    *   Because Christ has the *fulness* of God, and we are *in Christ*, we have access to all the power, wisdom, and righteousness we need to obey God and overcome sin. We do not need to look to philosophy, tradition, or human works.

**[ILL]** A diver in the ocean is surrounded by the fullness of the water, yet he does not contain the ocean. When we are "in Christ," we are surrounded by the fullness of the Godhead. Everything God has is available to us through Christ.

### Q12. What is our privilege in view of what this precious Saviour has done?

"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." Hebrews 4:15, 16.

**Answer:**

This is the practical climax of the doctrine of Christ’s divinity and humanity. Because He is the God-Man, we have a specific privilege: **Bold access to the Throne of Grace.**

*   **Touched with our Infirmities:** Jesus is not aloof. He feels our struggles. He knows the pull of temptation, yet He never yielded. He conquered sin in human flesh to prove it can be done.
*   **Without Sin:** This is our standard. He is not only our Substitute (dying for us) but our Example (living out the law within us).
*   **Two Gifts at the Throne:**
    1.  **Mercy:** This is forgiveness for past sins (Justification). It deals with the guilt of sin.
    2.  **Grace to Help:** This is power for the present struggle (Sanctification). It deals with the power of sin.
*   **"Time of Need":** This is the moment of temptation. We must come to the throne *before* we fall, claiming His victory.

**Conclusion:** The divinity of Christ is the rock upon which our faith is built. Because He is God, His blood cleanses us from all sin. Because He became man, He can empower us to live a holy life. We need not fear judgment if we are hiding in the Rock of Ages.

**[ILL]** A child who has broken a window fears to face the judge. But if the judge is his own father, who has already paid for the window, the child can come "boldly" not with arrogance, but with confidence in his father's love and provision. Christ, our Brother and our God, sits on the throne.
