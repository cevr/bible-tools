### Q1. For what purpose did Christ come into the world?

"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."-1 Tim. 1:15.

**Answer:**
The primary mission of Jesus Christ was a rescue mission. He did not come merely to teach morality or to set a good example, though He did both; He came to address a desperate emergency—the problem of sin that separated humanity from God (Isaiah 59:2).

*   **To Save, Not Condemn:** Christ’s purpose was salvation. The world was already under condemnation; He came to offer a way of escape (John 3:17).
*   **For Sinners:** The gospel is specifically for those who recognize their need. Just as a physician is for the sick (Matthew 9:12), the Saviour is for the sinner. This text encourages even the "chief" of sinners that they are not beyond the reach of His grace.
*   **The Great Controversy:** In the conflict between good and evil, Christ entered the enemy's territory (this world) to reclaim His lost possession—the human race (Luke 19:10).

**[ILL] The Lifeboat:** Imagine a ship sinking in a stormy ocean. A captain does not launch a lifeboat to teach the drowning passengers how to swim better; he launches it to pull them out of the water. We are drowning in sin; Christ is the Lifeboat who comes to pull us to safety.

### Q2. Can we obtain salvation through any other source?

"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."-Acts 4:12.

**Answer:**
The Bible presents an exclusive path to salvation. Because the problem is infinite—rebellion against the infinite God and the violation of His eternal law—only an infinite sacrifice could provide the remedy.

*   **The Unique Position of Christ:** As both fully God and fully man, Jesus is the only "ladder" connecting earth to heaven (Genesis 28:12; John 1:51). No angel, human priest, or religious system can bridge the gap caused by sin.
*   **No Human Merit:** We cannot save ourselves by good works, philosophy, or penance. Salvation is found entirely in the *Person* of Jesus Christ.
*   **Definition - Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man through the life, death, and high priestly ministry of Jesus Christ. It literally means "at-one-ment" (Romans 5:11).

**[ILL] The Key:** If you lose the key to your front door, you might try a hundred other keys, a stick, or a wire. But only the key cut by the locksmith to fit the tumblers of that specific lock will open the door. Christ is the only One who fits the requirements of the broken Law and the love of the Father; He alone unlocks heaven for us.

### Q3. From what does Christ save His people?

"Thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins"-Matt. 1:21.

**Answer:**
This is a foundational truth of the everlasting gospel. Christ’s salvation is not merely from the *penalty* of sin (hell/death), but from the *power* and *presence* of sin itself.

*   **Saved *From* Sin, Not *In* Sin:** God cannot save a man while he clings to his rebellion. To be saved means to be delivered from the practice and rule of iniquity.
*   **Justification and Sanctification:**
    *   *Justification:* He saves us from the *guilt* of past sins (Romans 3:24-25).
    *   *Sanctification:* He saves us from the *power* of sin in our daily lives (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
*   **Restoration:** The goal is to restore the image of God in man. A Saviour who only forgave but left the sinner enslaved to vice would be an incomplete Saviour. His grace is power to overcome (Romans 6:14).

**[ILL] The Doctor:** If a patient has a deadly infection, he does not want a doctor who merely gives him painkillers so he doesn't feel the death working in him. He wants a doctor who kills the infection and restores health. Jesus is the Great Physician who cures the disease of sin, not just the symptoms.

---

### Q4. In the case of the woman who washed the Saviour's feet in the house of Simon the Pharisee, what was said to her because of her act?

"And He said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."-Luke 7:50.

**Answer:**
This woman came to Jesus burdened with guilt. Her act of washing His feet was an expression of deep repentance and love.

*   **Faith as the Instrument:** It was not the washing of feet that saved her, but her faith in Jesus as the Sin-Bearer. Faith is the hand that grasps the gift of salvation (Ephesians 2:8).
*   **Justification by Faith:** In that moment, she was justified—declared righteous. Her past record of sin was wiped clean because she trusted in Christ.
*   **Peace:** The result of justification is peace with God (Romans 5:1). The war between her soul and God’s law was over; she was now on God’s side.
*   **Continued Faith:** As the note in the source material suggests, this salvation was a current reality ("thy faith *hath* saved thee"). To remain saved, she would need to continue walking in that faith, for faith is a living connection, not a one-time transaction.

**[ILL] The Pardon:** A prisoner on death row receives a governor's pardon. At that moment, he is "saved" from execution. But if he leaves the prison and immediately commits another crime, he falls under the law's condemnation again. We must walk in the liberty Christ gives us (Galatians 5:1).

---

### Q5. Who only will finally be saved?

"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved."-Matt. 24:13.

**Answer:**
While we accept Christ by faith today, the Bible teaches that the Christian life is a marathon, not a sprint.

*   **Perseverance:** Salvation is a process that begins with conversion and ends with final deliverance at Christ’s coming. We must "hold fast" the confidence we had at the beginning (Hebrews 3:14).
*   **The Danger of Drawing Back:** God takes no pleasure in those who draw back (Hebrews 10:38). The doctrine of "once saved, always saved" is not supported here; one must endure.
*   **Daily Dependence:** Enduring to the end implies a daily, moment-by-moment abiding in Christ. We are saved today if we are in Christ today.

**[ILL] The Harvest:** A farmer plants a seed. It sprouts (conversion). It grows (sanctification). But the crop is only "saved" when it is finally harvested into the barn. If a storm destroys it or it withers before harvest, the early growth is in vain. We must ripen into the full character of Christ (Mark 4:28-29).

---

### Q6. If one has had the assurance of sins forgiven, but has afterward turned from his righteousness, what will be the result?

"But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die."-Eze. 18:24.

**Answer:**
This solemn text clarifies the conditional nature of the covenant. God deals with us based on our present relationship with Him, not just our past history.

*   **The Reality of Apostasy:** It is possible for a righteous man (a justified believer) to turn away and return to a life of sin.
*   **The Sanctuary Truth:** In the earthly sanctuary, sins were transferred to the tabernacle throughout the year. They were not finally "blotted out" until the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). If a man confessed but later forsook God, his past forgiveness did not secure him; his sins would return upon his own head.
*   **Holy Living:** This underscores the necessity of *Righteousness by Faith*—a righteousness that remains and grows. God demands a heart that remains loyal.

**[ILL] The Citizenship:** An immigrant may be granted citizenship in a new country. But if that citizen later commits treason against the government, their citizenship can be revoked. We are citizens of heaven, but we must not commit treason by returning to the service of Satan.

---

### Q7. In the parable, when one who owed his lord ten thousand talents was unable to pay, at his own request what did his master do for him?

"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt."-Matt. 18:27.

**Answer:**
*   **The Impossible Debt:** Ten thousand talents represents an unpayable sum—millions of dollars in today's terms. This represents our sin debt to God. We cannot pay it; we are spiritually bankrupt.
*   **The Character of God:** The master was "moved with compassion." God delights in mercy (Micah 7:18).
*   **Full Forgiveness:** The debt was not merely reduced; it was forgiven entirely. This represents Justification—the complete cancellation of our record of sin through the blood of Christ.

---

### Q8. After receiving forgiveness for his enormous debt, what did the servant do to another who owed him but a hundred pence, and asked for mercy?

"And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and be-sought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt."-Matt. 18:29, 30.

**Answer:**
*   **The Test of Character:** The servant had received mercy (justification), but he had not been changed by it (sanctification). His heart remained hard and selfish.
*   **Inconsistency:** He was forgiven a mountain but refused to forgive a molehill. This shows that while he accepted the *benefit* of salvation, he rejected the *spirit* of the Saviour.
*   **Definition - Imparted Righteousness:** God gives us grace not just to clear our record, but to change our hearts so we treat others as He treats us. This servant lacked this imparted grace.

---

### Q9. What was then done with this unmerciful servant?

"Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, 0 thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me. Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him."-Matt. 18:32-34.

**Answer:**
*   **Revocation of Pardon:** This is a startling truth. The forgiveness previously granted was revoked. The debt returned.
*   **The Principle:** God's forgiveness is a transformational gift. If we refuse to channel God's love to others, we cut ourselves off from the Source of love. "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:26).
*   **Investigative Judgment:** This parable illustrates the investigative judgment. Our lives are reviewed to see if our faith was genuine. If the fruit of the Spirit (love, mercy) is missing, the profession of faith was vain.

---

### Q10. What application of the parable did the Saviour make?

"So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."-Matt. 18:35.

**Answer:**
*   **Heart Work:** God looks at the heart. Outward profession is not enough; there must be a "faith which worketh by love" (Galatians 5:6).
*   **Conditional Salvation:** As the note in the source text states, eternal salvation is not secured until the end. We are conditionally saved from consequences, but if we revert to the character of Satan (unforgiveness), we incur the debt again.
*   **The Lord's Prayer:** "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors" (Matthew 6:12).

**[ILL] The Pipe:** A pipe is designed to let water flow through it. If the pipe is blocked at the outlet, no fresh water can come in the inlet. If we block the flow of mercy to others, we block the flow of God's mercy to ourselves.

---

### Q11. What is the end, object, or design of faith?

"Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls"-1 Peter 1:9.

**Answer:**
*   **The Goal:** Faith is not an end in itself; it is the means to an end. The goal is the complete restoration of the soul—salvation from sin, self, and death.
*   **Soul Salvation:** This encompasses the whole person—mind, character, and eventually the body at the resurrection.

---

### Q12. Does one receive this salvation when he first believes?

"And that, knowing the time, now it is high time to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed." Rom. 13:11.

**Answer:**
*   **Already/Not Yet:** In one sense, we are saved when we believe (justification). In another sense, salvation is a future event we are approaching (glorification).
*   **Nearer:** Every day of faithful walking with Jesus brings us closer to the final deliverance from this dark world.
*   **The Blessed Hope:** We look forward to the time when the "body of this death" (Romans 7:24) will be exchanged for immortality.

---

### Q13. How is one kept, or preserved, until that salvation is given? and when is it to be revealed?

"Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."-1 Peter 1:5.

**Answer:**
*   **Kept by God's Power:** We do not keep ourselves. We are "kept" (guarded like a fortress) by God.
    *   *Definition - Sanctification:* The continuous process of being "kept" by the Holy Spirit, setting us apart for holy use and growing in grace.
*   **Through Faith:** God provides the power, but we must provide the consent (faith). We must choose to remain in the fortress.
*   **The Last Time:** The final consummation of salvation happens at the Second Coming.

**[ILL] The Anchor:** A ship in a storm is safe not because the captain holds the anchor chain, but because the anchor holds the ground. Our faith is the chain; Christ is the Anchor (Hebrews 6:19). As long as the chain is connected, we are kept.

---

### Q14. Who will receive that salvation?

"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation."-Heb. 9:28.

**Answer:**
*   **Those Who Look for Him:** This implies an attitude of expectancy and preparation. Those who love His appearing (2 Timothy 4:8) are those whose hearts are in harmony with Him.
*   **Without Sin:**
    *   *First Coming:* He came *with* sin—not His own, but bearing ours as the Lamb.
    *   *Second Coming:* He comes *apart from* sin. The sin problem has been dealt with in the heavenly sanctuary. He comes now as King of Kings to collect His people.

---

### Q15. In what condition are all men naturally?

"But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin." Gal. 3:22. "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom.3:23.

**Answer:**
*   **Universal Need:** There is no distinction. Rich or poor, educated or ignorant, all are infected with the virus of sin.
*   **"Under Sin":** This phrase implies being under the power and condemnation of sin. We are born captives (Psalm 51:5).
*   **Short of Glory:** God’s glory is His character (Exodus 33:18-19). We have fallen short of the character of love and righteousness for which we were created.

---

### Q16. What is the wages of sin?

"The wages of sin is death." Rom. 6:23.

**Answer:**
*   **Wages:** Something earned or deserved. We have "earned" death by our rebellion.
*   **Death:** This refers ultimately to the "second death" (Revelation 20:14)—eternal separation from God, the Source of life. It is not eternal torment, but the cessation of being. Sin is self-destructive; it cuts the lifeline to the Creator.

---

### Q17. What is the gift of God?

"The gift of God is eternal life." Rom. 6:23.

**Answer:**
*   **A Gift:** Eternal life cannot be earned. It is a free gift (Gr. *charisma*).
*   **Contrast:** Wages are earned; gifts are received. The most moral person cannot earn heaven, and the worst sinner is not denied the offer of the gift if they will accept it.

---

### Q18. In whom is now this gift?

"This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son." 1 John 5:11.

**Answer:**
*   **Life is in the Son:** Eternal life is not an abstract commodity God hands out; it is found *in a Person*. We have life only by having Jesus.
*   **Vine and Branches:** As a branch has life only while connected to the vine (John 15:5), we have spiritual life only while connected to Christ.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** This is the core of the message—Christ *is* our righteousness and our life. We do not have it apart from Him.

---

### Q19. How many may have this life?

"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Rev. 22: 17. "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life." 1 John 5:12.

**Answer:**
*   **Whosoever Will:** The invitation is universal. God has predestined that "whosoever believes" shall be saved. The choice lies with the individual.
*   **The Condition:** The only condition is to be "athirst"—to recognize one's need.
*   **Having the Son:** Possession of Christ is the deciding factor. It is not church membership or heritage, but a vital connection with the Son of God.

---

### Q20. How must one have Christ?

"Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?" 2 Cor. 13:5.

**Answer:**
*   **Christ in You:** Christianity is not just Christ *for* us (on the cross) or Christ *above* us (in heaven), but Christ *in* us (by the Spirit).
*   **The Mystery:** Paul calls this the "riches of the glory of this mystery... Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27).
*   **Reprobates:** Without this indwelling presence, we fail the test. We are counterfeit Christians.

**[ILL] The Glove:** A glove can do nothing by itself. But if a hand fills the glove, it can work, lift, and act. We are the glove; Christ is the hand. He must be *in* us to perform His will.

---

### Q21. How do we really have Christ in us unto eternal life?

"He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life." John 6:47.

**Answer:**
*   **Believing:** This is not mere intellectual assent (even demons believe and tremble, James 2:19). Biblical belief is a surrendering trust. It means taking God at His word and staking one's life on it.
*   **Eating His Flesh:** In context (John 6:53-63), believing is equated with eating His flesh—internalizing His word and His life until they become part of our being.

---

### Q22. What follows the reception of Christ?

"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God." Gal.2:20.

**Answer:**
*   **The Exchanged Life:** The "I" (the old selfish ego) is crucified. A new occupant takes over the residence of the heart—Christ.
*   **Living by Faith:** The Christian life is lived by the "faith *of* the Son of God." We rely on His faithfulness and His power.
*   **Victory:** Because Christ lived a victorious life, if He lives in me, He will live that same victorious life through me today. This is the secret of overcoming sin.

**[ILL] The Driver:** It is like sliding over from the driver's seat and letting Jesus take the wheel. He doesn't just give directions from the back seat; He drives the car.

---

### Q23. How are all regarded before they are quickened with Christ?

"God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ." Eph. 2:4-5.

**Answer:**
*   **Dead in Sins:** A dead man cannot help himself. He cannot "decide" to be better. He needs a resurrection.
*   **Quickened:** This Old English word means "made alive." Conversion is a spiritual resurrection from the grave of sin.
*   **Rich in Mercy:** God loved us while we were still corpses in the graveyard of sin. This proves salvation is entirely by His grace.

---

### Q24. What is this spiritual transition from death to life called?

"Being born again, not of corruptible seed; but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever." 1 Peter 1:23.

**Answer:**
*   **The New Birth:** Just as we had a physical birth to enter this world, we must have a spiritual birth to enter the Kingdom of God (John 3:3).
*   **Definition - Regeneration:** The act of God's Spirit imparting new life and a new nature to the believer (Titus 3:5).
*   **The Seed:** The agent of this birth is the "Word of God." When the Word is received into the heart by faith, it germinates and produces a new life—the life of Christ.

---

### Q25. When our first parents transgressed, what was done to prevent them from living forever in sin?

"And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever." "So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life." Gen. 3:22, 24.

**Answer:**
*   **Mercy in Disguise:** It would have been a terrible tragedy for man to become an immortal sinner. Sin entails misery. To live forever in misery would be hell.
*   **Barred Access:** God cut off access to the literal Tree of Life so that the cycle of sin and misery would have a limit (death).
*   **The Solution:** Death is the only way out of the sin problem. We must die (in Christ) to be raised to newness of life.

---

### Q26. By whom did the Lord say that Satan, the originator of sin, should be destroyed?

"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Gen. 3:15.

**Answer:**
*   **The First Gospel Promise (Protoevangelium):** Immediately after the fall, God promised a Deliverer.
*   **The Seed:** The "Seed of the woman" is Jesus Christ (Galatians 4:4).
*   **Bruised Head:** Christ would deliver a fatal blow to Satan's kingdom (the head).
*   **Bruised Heel:** Satan would wound Christ (the crucifixion), but this wound would not be final or fatal to His mission; in fact, it would be the means of His victory.

---

### Q27. For what purpose did Christ die?

"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil." Heb. 2:14.

**Answer:**
*   **Destroying the Destroyer:** Christ partook of human nature so He could die. By dying, He paid the penalty of sin, thereby breaking Satan's legal hold over the human race.
*   **The Power of Death:** Satan uses death as a terror weapon. But Christ, by rising from the dead, tore the keys of death from Satan's hand (Revelation 1:18).

---

### Q28. How early was it determined that Christ should die?

"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." Rev. 13:8.

**Answer:**
*   **The Everlasting Covenant:** The plan of salvation was not an afterthought devised when Adam sinned. The Godhead had a plan in place "before the foundation of the world" (1 Peter 1:20).
*   **Costly Grace:** Before God created a being with free will, He counted the cost and committed Himself to the sacrifice of the Son.

---

### Q29. Through whom was Abraham to receive the promise of God?

"The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will give this land." Gen. 12:7.

**Answer:**
*   **The Covenant:** God called Abraham and made a covenant with him, which included the promise of land and a posterity.
*   **Significance:** This covenant is the basis of the gospel story in the Old Testament.

---

### Q30. How far was the promise to Abraham to extend?

"And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed." Acts 3:25.

**Answer:**
*   **Universal Blessing:** The promise was not just for the Jewish nation. Through Abraham's line, a blessing would flow to every family (kindred) on earth.
*   **Gospel Mission:** This is the mandate for global evangelism.

---

### Q31. To whom does the "seed" of the Old Testament refer?

"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds,as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." Gal. 3:16.

**Answer:**
*   **Christ the Center:** Paul clarifies that the ultimate fulfillment of the covenant is not the literal nation of Israel, but the Person of Jesus Christ.
*   **One Seed:** All promises of God are "Yes" and "Amen" in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20).

---

### Q32. How did the Lord regard Abraham's faith?

"Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness." Rom. 4:3.

**Answer:**
*   **Imputed Righteousness:** This is the classic text on Justification by Faith. Abraham had no righteousness of his own to offer. He simply believed God's promise.
*   **"Counted":** God credited Christ's righteousness to Abraham's account. This shows that salvation has always been by faith, in the Old Testament as well as the New.

---

### Q33. Since man had sinned, if righteousness could come by the law, then what must we conclude?

"If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain." Gal. 2:21.

**Answer:**
*   **The Law Cannot Save:** The Law is a mirror; it shows us the dirt on our face (sin), but it is not soap—it cannot wash it off (Romans 3:20).
*   **The Necessity of the Cross:** If we could save ourselves by obeying the commandments, Jesus did not need to die. The fact that He died proves that human obedience to the law could never justify a sinner.
*   **Law and Gospel:** The Law points us to the Gospel (our need). The Gospel empowers us to keep the Law (our gratitude and new nature).

---

### Q34. Why have all been reckoned under sin?

"But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Christ Jesus might be given to them that believe." Gal. 3:22.

**Answer:**
*   **Level Ground:** God declares everyone a sinner so that He can offer salvation to everyone on the same basis—faith in Christ. No one can brag; no one need despair.

---

### Q35. What does Christ become to the true believer?

"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me." John 14:6.

**Answer:**
*   **The Way:** Without Him, there is no going.
*   **The Truth:** Without Him, there is no knowing.
*   **The Life:** Without Him, there is no living.
*   **Access:** He is our Mediator in the Heavenly Sanctuary, the only avenue by which we approach the throne of Grace.

---

### Q36. How then do all become children of God?

"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Gal. 3:26.

**Answer:**
*   **Adoption:** We are not natural-born children of God (spiritually); we are "children of wrath" by nature (Ephesians 2:3). We become children of God by adoption through faith.
*   **Family Status:** Faith brings us into the royal family.

---

### Q37. If children of God, what is our prospect?

"If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ." Rom. 8:17.

**Answer:**
*   **Inheritance:** Because Christ is the Heir of all things (Hebrews 1:2), and we are "in Christ," we share in His inheritance.
*   **The Future:** This inheritance includes the earth made new, a character free from sin, and eternal life in the presence of the Father.
*   **Suffering:** The verse (Rom 8:17) continues to say we suffer with Him that we may be glorified with Him. The path to the crown is via the cross.

**[ILL] The Prince:** A beggar adopted by the King becomes a prince. He may still have the scars of his past life, but his status has changed completely. He now has access to the treasury and the future of the Kingdom. Through Christ, we are that adopted prince.
