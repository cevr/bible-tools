## Slide 1 – Q1: The Saviour’s Desire

- **Question:** At the last Passover, what did the Saviour say to His disciples?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:15, 16 – “And He said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Type Meets Antitype

- **A Pivotal Moment:** The Passover was a prophetic symbol (type) pointing to the “Lamb of God.”
- **Transition:** Jesus was moving the focus from deliverance from Egypt to deliverance from sin.
    - John 1:29 – “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”
- **Fulfillment:** The type met the antitype (reality) at the cross. Jesus established the Lord’s Supper to commemorate the New Covenant.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
    - The Passover lamb was slain in the outer court; Jesus offered Himself in the outer court of this earth.
    - Hebrews 9:14 – “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Father’s Farewell:**
    - Imagine a father gathering his children for a final meal before a dangerous journey to save them from ruin.
    - Every word is weighty; every gesture is tender.
    - He leaves instructions and a memorial of his love.
- **Application:** This was the intense atmosphere of love in the Upper Room before the Great Sacrifice.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Spirit of the Disciples

- **Question:** What spirit was manifested by the disciples?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:25, 26 – “And He said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Two Opposing Kingdoms

- **The Dispute:** While Jesus faced the cross, the disciples argued about supremacy.
- **The Spirit of the World:** Based on self-exaltation, force, and pride (the mystery of iniquity).
    - Isaiah 14:13 – “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God...”
- **The Kingdom of Heaven:** Based on love, humility, and service.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
    - The High Priest wore garments of glory, but his role was to bear the burden of the people on his shoulders (Exodus 28:12).
    - Position in God’s house is for bearing burdens, not for tyranny.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Corporate Ladder:**
    - In the world, success means climbing up—the higher you go, the more people serve you.
- **The Ladder of Christ:**
    - In Christ’s kingdom, the ladder is inverted.
    - To be great, one must climb *down* into the valley of service.
    - The deeper you go in serving others, the higher you stand in God’s estimation.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Christ’s Position

- **Question:** What did the Saviour say of His own position?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:27 – “For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Righteousness by Faith and Service

- **Reversal of Standards:** The Creator (Colossians 1:16) deserved to be served, yet He chose to serve.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
    - Christ’s righteousness is a living character of selfless love, not just a legal status.
    - Philippians 2:7 – “But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.”
- **Sanctification Defined:**
    - Imparting the character of Christ to the believer.
    - We cannot claim His righteousness while cherishing pride.
    - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The King in the Hospital:**
    - If a powerful earthly King put on a nurse’s uniform to wash bandages and feed patients, the world would be shocked.
- **The Reality:**
    - The King of Glory did infinitely more.
    - He took on human nature to serve a rebel race.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Act of Humility

- **Question:** With such knowledge of His own power and authority, what excellent example did Christ give of His humility?
- **Key Text:** John 13:4, 5 – “He riseth from supper, and laid aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded Himself, After that He poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Symbolism of the Act

- **The Actions:**
    - **Laid aside garments:** Symbolizing laying aside heavenly glory.
    - **Girded Himself:** Taking the posture of a servant.
    - **Washed feet:** Doing the duty the disciples were too proud to do.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
    - Priests had to wash at the **Laver** before ministering in the Holy Place (Exodus 30:19–20).
    - Purity is required for communion with God.
- **Cleansing:** Water washes the body; the Word and Blood cleanse the soul.
    - Ephesians 5:26 – “That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Dusty Road:**
    - In the Orient, guests arrived with feet covered in dust from the road.
    - Washing them was a refreshing necessity.
- **The Lesson:**
    - Jesus showed that no labor is degrading if it brings comfort and relief to others.
    - True dignity serves.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Peter’s Astonishment

- **Question:** On approaching Peter, what did that disciple say?
- **Key Text:** John 13:6 – “Then cometh He to Simon Peter; and Peter saith unto Him, lord, dost thou wash my feet?”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Misunderstanding God’s Glory

- **The Incongruity:** The Master washing the servant; the Sinless One washing the sinner.
- **Peter’s Error:**
    - He thought dignity was maintained by distance.
    - He did not realize God’s glory is seen in His condescension.
    - Psalm 113:5-6 – “Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The General and the Soldier:**
    - Imagine a General dropping to his knees to polish a private soldier’s muddy boots.
    - The soldier’s instinct is to recoil: “No, sir! This is not right!”
    - **Lesson:** In God’s army, the General conquers by serving.

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Promise of Understanding

- **Question:** And what was the reply?
- **Key Text:** John 13:7 – “Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Faith vs. Sight

- **The "Hereafter":**
    - Peter could not fully grasp the spiritual meaning until after the Cross and Pentecost.
    - The washing symbolized cleansing from sin through Christ’s death.
- **The Lesson for Us:**
    - We must often submit to God’s methods before we understand His reasons.
    - Faith trusts the Master’s heart even when it cannot trace the Master’s hand.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Peter’s Refusal

- **Question:** How did Peter feel about submitting to the Saviour's proposal?
- **Key Text:** John 13:8 – “Peter saith unto Him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou has no part with Me.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Justification and Cleansing

- **False Humility:** Peter’s refusal was actually dictating terms to the Lord.
- **The Doctrine of Justification:**
    - **We are defiled:** Isaiah 64:6 – “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags...”
    - **We cannot wash ourselves:** Jeremiah 2:22 – “For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me...”
- **Submission:**
    - We must admit our need and allow Christ to do the work.
    - Without this cleansing, we have no part in Him.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Mud Pit:**
    - A man in a mud pit cannot clean himself with muddy hands.
    - He needs someone on solid ground with clean water to wash him.
    - If he refuses, saying "I am not worthy," he remains in the mud and is lost.

## Slide 21 – Q8: Peter’s Surrender

- **Question:** Learning that his salvation depended on his submission to Christ, what did Peter then wish done?
- **Key Text:** John 13:9 – “Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Desire for Holiness

- **A Loyal Heart:**
    - Peter’s refusal turned into an eager request once he understood the stakes.
- **Complete Cleansing:**
    - He wanted to be entirely surrendered and entirely cleansed.
    - Despite his faults, Peter truly desired to belong to Jesus completely.

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Bath and the Feet

- **Question:** Was this really necessary?
- **Key Text:** John 13:10 – “Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save [only] to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Two Types of Washing

- **The Bath (Regeneration):**
    - The initial cleansing of salvation (Baptism/Justification).
    - Titus 3:5 – “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration...”
- **The Foot Washing (Daily Cleansing):**
    - Believers contract the "dust" of the world daily.
    - We do not need re-baptism, but daily confession and cleansing.
    - 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Morning Shower:**
    - A person who showers in the morning is clean.
    - If they walk in sandals through a dusty street, they do not need another shower before dinner.
    - They simply need to wash their feet to be clean for the meal.

## Slide 26 – Q10: The Purpose of the Act

- **Question:** After performing the ceremony, what did Christ say had been His object?
- **Key Text:** John 13:15 – “For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: An Ordinance and Example

- **"Do as I have done":**
    - To serve regardless of status.
    - To humble self to lift others up.
    - To harbor no pride.
- **The Faith of Jesus:**
    - It is not just believing *in* Him, but living *like* Him.
    - This ordinance is a test of loyalty to His pattern of life.

## Slide 28 – Q11: The Command to Serve

- **Question:** What did He say they should therefore do to one another?
- **Key Text:** John 13:13, 14 – “Ye call Me Master and Lord, and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: The Ordinance of Humility

- **A Literal Command:** "Ye also ought to wash one another's feet."
- **Purpose in the Church:**
    - **Equality:** Rich and poor, leader and layman, serve one another.
    - **Reconciliation:** It is difficult to harbor bitterness against one whose feet you wash.
    - **Preparation:** Clears the heart before the Lord’s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:28).

## Slide 30 – Q11: Illustration

- **Iron and Fire:**
    - Cold iron is rigid and cannot be joined.
    - When heated in the fire, it becomes malleable and can be welded together.
    - The Ordinance of Humility brings hearts near the fire of Christ’s love, melting pride so we can be united.

## Slide 31 – Q12: The Blessing of Obedience

- **Question:** What promise is given to those who carry out this ordinance?
- **Key Text:** John 13:17 – “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Practical Sanctification

- **Knowing vs. Doing:**
    - Blessedness comes from the *practice* of humility, not the theory.
- **The Joy of Christ:**
    - There is freedom in letting go of pride.
    - Taking the low place brings peace; we have nothing to defend.
    - This is the joy of self-sacrificing love.

## Slide 33 – Q12: Illustration

- **Bread and Nutrition:**
    - A man may know all the nutritional facts about bread, but he will starve unless he eats it.
    - A Christian may know the doctrines of humility, but the soul starves unless it practices the acts of service Christ ordained.

## Slide 34 – Q13: The Ancient Custom

- **Question:** How was the Oriental custom of feet washing invariably conducted?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 18:4 – “Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.”

## Slide 35 – Q13: Elevating the Common

- **Hospitality & Hygiene:**
    - It was the first act of welcome for a weary traveler on dusty roads.
    - Typically performed by a servant.
- **Sacred Service:**
    - Christ took a common social custom and made it a religious ordinance.

## Slide 36 – Q14: Apostolic Practice

- **Question:** As late as A.D. 65, what was one test applied by the apostle to determine whether a widow was worthy to be taken into a certain circle?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 5:10 – “If she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.”

## Slide 37 – Q14: A Literal Observance

- **Evidence:**
    - The early church practiced feet washing literally.
    - Paul lists it alongside other practical good works like raising children.
- **Significance:**
    - It was a mark of a dedicated, humble Christian life.
    - It demonstrated a heart willing to stoop to the humblest service for the brethren.

## Slide 38 – Q15: Service to Christ

- **Question:** How does Christ regard an act performed toward the humblest of His disciples?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:40 – “And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”

## Slide 39 – Q15: The Motive for Service

- **Identification:** Jesus identifies fully with His people.
- **Ministering to the King:**
    - When we wash a brother’s feet or relieve a need, we serve the Lord.
    - This transforms a lowly duty into a high privilege.

## Slide 40 – Q15: Application (Faith & Christ’s Work)

- **The Cross:** The Ordinance points to where Jesus served us by dying.
- **The Throne:** It points to where He serves us by interceding.
- **Newness of Life:**
    - Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”
    - We are called to a life of love that seeketh not her own.
