## Slide 1 – Q1: The Principal Thing
- **Question:** What is recommended as the principal thing to gain?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 4:7 – “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Defining True Wisdom
- **Defining Wisdom:**
  - Biblical wisdom is not merely intellectual intelligence or accumulating facts.
  - It is "spiritual discernment"—seeing life from God’s perspective (1 Corinthians 2:14 – “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.”).
- **Christ Our Wisdom:**
  - To "get wisdom" is to get Christ, for He "is made unto us wisdom" (1 Corinthians 1:30 – “But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:”).
  - It means having His mind and His Spirit dwelling within.
- **The Foundation:**
  - It is the "principal" (highest priority) thing because all other gains are temporary.
  - Gaining the whole world means nothing if the soul is lost (Matthew 16:26 – “For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Ship’s Captain:**
  - Imagine a captain with a vessel possessing the fastest engines and finest sails.
  - If he lacks the compass and chart (wisdom), his speed only hastens his destruction on the rocks.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - Human talent and ability are like the engines.
  - Without the directing wisdom of God, our abilities may only lead us faster into error.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Reward of Wisdom
- **Question:** What will this acquisition bring to those who obtain it?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 4:8, 9 – “Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her. She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Grace and Glory
- **Promotion and Honor:**
  - The world seeks self-promotion, but God’s way is different: “before honor is humility” (Proverbs 15:33).
  - When we embrace God’s wisdom (often appearing as humility/service), He exalts us in due time.
- **An Ornament of Grace (Sanctification):**
  - "Grace" here refers to the beauty of character—God’s enabling power in the heart.
  - Receiving Christ’s wisdom imparts a "meek and quiet spirit," which is of great price (1 Peter 3:4 – “But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.”).
- **A Crown of Glory:**
  - This points to the final reward of the righteous: the crown of life (James 1:12 – “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.”).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration (The Great Exchange)
- **The Beggar and the Prince:**
  - If a beggar embraces a prince, his rags are starkly visible.
- **The Sinner and Wisdom:**
  - When a sinner embraces Wisdom (Christ), a "great exchange" occurs.
  - Christ takes our rags of sin and clothes us in the "ornament" of His own righteousness (Isaiah 61:10 – “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness...”).

## Slide 7 – Q3: Comparison to Earthly Riches
- **Question:** How are the things of earth to be compared to it?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 3:15 – “She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: True Value vs. Material Wealth
- **The Limits of Wealth:**
  - Gold and rubies can buy comfort, but not peace of mind, forgiveness, or entry into Heaven.
  - Material wealth cannot bribe the Judge of all the earth.
- **The Value of Truth:**
  - God’s law is better than thousands of gold and silver because it converts the soul (Psalm 19:7 – “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.”).
- **Sanctuary Insight:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, gold represented faith and love (Revelation 3:18 – “I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich...”).
  - Wisdom is this "gold tried in the fire"—a character tested and purified, the only treasure we take to heaven.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Desert Traveler:**
  - Imagine a man trapped in a burning desert who finds a bag of diamonds.
  - Though worth millions in the city, in the desert they are worthless because they cannot sustain life. He would trade them all for one cup of water.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - In the spiritual desert of this world, riches cannot save.
  - We need the Living Water of Jesus Christ, which is true wisdom.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Source of Wisdom
- **Question:** Whence comes this precious acquirement?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 2:6 – “For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Supernatural Origin
- **The Source:**
  - God is the "Father of lights" and the source of all true understanding (James 1:17 – “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights...”).
  - Wisdom is not a human invention; it is a gift.
- **Not by Human Effort:**
  - University degrees cannot generate spiritual wisdom.
  - "The world by wisdom knew not God" (1 Corinthians 1:21).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot generate our own righteousness (Justification), and we cannot generate our own wisdom.
  - We must receive it from outside ourselves—from God alone.

## Slide 12 – Q5: How to Obtain It
- **Question:** How may one obtain it?
- **Key Text:** James 1:5 – “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Conditions for Receiving
- **Acknowledging Lack:**
  - The first step is admitting we do not have wisdom.
  - "Blessed are the poor in spirit" (Matthew 5:3). Those who think they are wise are closed to guidance.
- **The Generosity of God:**
  - God gives "liberally" and "upbraideth not" (does not scold).
  - He does not mock our ignorance but delights to teach us.
- **Prayer as the Key:**
  - Prayer is the appointed means of connecting our weakness to His strength.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Loving Father:**
  - A loving father does not scold his toddler for not knowing how to walk perfectly; he extends his hands to help.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - Our Heavenly Father invites us to ask for guidance.
  - He promises to supply wisdom without making us feel small or ashamed.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Asking in Faith
- **Question:** What does this asking involve?
- **Key Text:** James 1:6, 7 – “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Faith and Surrender
- **Faith Defined:**
  - Faith is taking God at His word; it is the substance of things hoped for (Hebrews 11:1).
- **The Problem of Wavering:**
  - To "waver" is to be double-minded (James 1:8).
  - It describes a person who asks for God's will but secretly plans to follow their own desires if the path is too hard.
- **Total Surrender:**
  - Victory and insight are given to those wholly on the Lord's side (Joshua 24:15).
- **Stability:**
  - The man of faith is anchored "within the veil," resting on the immovable Rock, Christ Jesus (Hebrews 6:19).

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Beginning of Wisdom
- **Question:** What is the beginning, or first state, of wisdom?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 111:10 – “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Fear of the Lord and Obedience
- **The Fear of the Lord:**
  - Not terror, but reverential awe of God’s holiness and love.
  - Linked to the **First Angel's Message**: "Fear God, and give glory to him" (Revelation 14:7).
- **Connection to the Law:**
  - Wisdom is linked with "doing His commandments."
  - To break God's law (the Ten Commandments) is folly because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23).
- **Obedience by Faith:**
  - We do not keep the law *to become* wise or saved.
  - Because we have received Christ (Wisdom), His Spirit writes the law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10), leading to joyful obedience.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Reckless Driver:**
  - A driver who ignores traffic laws claiming he is "too wise" for them will soon crash.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - True wisdom recognizes that God's laws are made for our safety and happiness.
  - Keeping the commandments is simply walking in the path where God's blessings flow.

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Promise of Presence
- **Question:** What has the Saviour promised to those who will keep His words?
- **Key Text:** John 14:23 – “Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Indwelling and New Covenant
- **Love and Obedience:**
  - Obedience is the fruit of love, not legalism.
  - We obey *because* we are loved, not *in order* to be loved.
- **Making Their Abode:**
  - God desires to dwell in the human heart (1 Corinthians 6:19 – “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you...?”).
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - When the Father and Son dwell within, the life of Christ replaces the life of self.
  - This is the secret of victory: "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27).

## Slide 22 – Q9: The Work of the Spirit
- **Question:** What among other things, will the Spirit of God do for those who are thus favored?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 2:10 – “But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Illuminator
- **Role of the Spirit:**
  - The Spirit guides us into all truth (John 16:13). Without Him, the Bible is a sealed book.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - In the Holy Place, the **seven-branched candlestick** (the Holy Spirit) provided the only light.
  - It shone upon the **Table of Shewbread** (Word of God) and the **Altar of Incense** (Prayer).
  - Only by the Spirit’s light can we truly feed on the Word and offer acceptable prayer.
- **Revealing Deep Things:**
  - The Spirit reveals the depth of God’s love and the hideousness of sin.

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Deep Things of God
- **Question:** What is included in these "deep things?"
- **Key Text:** Psalm 92:5 – “O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Creation and Atonement
- **God's Works:**
  - The complexity of creation, from atoms to stars, reveals infinite wisdom.
- **God's Thoughts (Redemption):**
  - The deepest thought of God is the **Atonement**.
  - How could a just God forgive rebels without destroying His law? The answer is the Cross.
  - "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other" (Psalm 85:10).
- **Eternal Study:**
  - These mysteries are what angels desire to look into (1 Peter 1:12).

## Slide 26 – Q11: Knowing God's Mind
- **Question:** How far may one hope to know the mind of God regarding himself?
- **Key Text:** Romans 12:2 – “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Transformation
- **Renewing the Mind:**
  - Transformation (*metamorphosis*) changes a sinner into a saint.
  - It requires disconnecting from the world's methods and philosophies ("be not conformed").
- **Proving His Will:**
  - As we walk by faith, we "prove" (test and experience) that God's will is good.
  - We discover that His law is truly the law of liberty (James 1:25).

## Slide 28 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Dirty Window:**
  - A dirty window cannot let the sunlight in clearly.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The "renewing of the mind" is like the cleansing of the glass by the Holy Spirit.
  - Once cleansed, the light of God's will can shine through clearly.

## Slide 29 – Q12: The Evidence of Wisdom
- **Question:** How will he appear who has been thus honored of God?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 8:1 – “Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: A Shining Countenance
- **The Shining Face:**
  - Moses’ face shone after communing with God (Exodus 34:29).
  - Stephen’s face appeared "as it had been the face of an angel" (Acts 6:15).
- **Character Change:**
  - The "boldness" (hardness) of the natural face is changed into the gentleness of Christ.
  - Grace softens the features and illuminates the countenance.
- **The Witness:**
  - A peaceful face in a troubled world testifies that the believer possesses a life source the world does not know.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Two Kinds of Wisdom
- **Question:** How many kinds of wisdom are there?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 2:6, 7 – “Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world... But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Worldly vs. Divine Wisdom
- **Wisdom of This World:**
  - Human philosophy and reasoning that excludes God.
  - Based on pride and self-sufficiency.
- **Wisdom of God (Hidden Wisdom):**
  - This is the Gospel, "hidden" to the natural man because it works backwards to the world.
  - Principles: Victory through surrender, life through death, greatness through service.
- **Great Controversy Context:**
  - The conflict began with false wisdom ("Ye shall be as gods").
  - God's wisdom restores man through dependence on the Creator.

## Slide 33 – Q14: God’s View of Worldly Wisdom
- **Question:** How is worldly wisdom regarded by God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 3:19 – “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: The Foolishness of Pride
- **Limitations of Human Reason:**
  - Attempts to explain the universe without a Creator or solve sin without a Savior always fail.
- **The Trap:**
  - Human intellect, divorced from God, leads to "craftiness" and destruction.
- **Humility Needed:**
  - To enter the Kingdom, we must become as little children (Matthew 18:3).
  - We must lay aside intellectual pride to accept saving truth.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Mathematician:**
  - A man may be able to calculate the positions of the stars.
  - But if he cannot calculate the cost of his own soul, his wisdom is foolishness.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - He is like a man counting grains of sand while a tidal wave approaches.
  - True wisdom prepares for eternity.

## Slide 36 – Q15: The Character of Divine Wisdom
- **Question:** What is the character of that wisdom which comes from God?
- **Key Text:** James 3:17 – “But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.”

## Slide 37 – Q15: Application (Imparted Righteousness)
- **The Fruit of Wisdom:**
  - **First Pure:** Holiness is the foundation; no compromise with sin.
  - **Then Peaceable:** True peace follows purity (cleansing by Christ's blood).
  - **Gentle/Easy to be Intreated:** Approachable, not stubborn.
- **Full of Mercy:**
  - Practical obedience resulting in acts of kindness.
- **Conclusion:**
  - This wisdom is the **Imparted Righteousness** of Christ.
  - When we "get wisdom," we get His character reproduced in us.

## Slide 38 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Tree and its Fruit:**
  - A tree is known by its fruit.
  - Worldly wisdom produces pride, rivalry, and ambition (James 3:14–16).
  - Divine wisdom produces a life that looks like Jesus—pure, kind, and obedient.
