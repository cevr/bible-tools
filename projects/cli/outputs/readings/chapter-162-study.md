### Q1. Give Solomon's words concerning the over powering strength of envy.
"Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?" Prov. 27:4.

**Answer:**

Solomon, in his God-given wisdom, places envy in a category far more dangerous than momentary outbursts of rage. While wrath and anger are destructive, they are often like a sudden storm—fierce but passing. Envy, however, is described as something before which no one can "stand."

1.  **The Nature of Envy:** Unlike anger, which is usually a reaction to a specific offense, envy is a deep-seated condition of the heart. It is a resentment of another person’s good fortune, character, or standing. It is the spirit of Lucifer, who envied the position of the Son of God (Isaiah 14:12–14).
2.  **A Secret Destroyer:** Wrath is visible and loud; envy works in the shadows. It plots, undermines, and spreads poison silently. It is difficult to defend against because it often masquerades as concern or justice.
3.  **The Need for Divine Aid:** The question "Who is able to stand before envy?" implies that human strength is insufficient to withstand its assault. When we are the targets of envy, our only defense is the shield of faith and the protection of God (Psalm 91). When we are tempted to *feel* envy, we cannot overcome it by willpower alone; we need the indwelling Spirit of Christ to replace our selfishness with His love.

*   **Sanctification:** This is the process of the Holy Spirit cleansing the "thoughts and intents of the heart" (Hebrews 4:12). Envy is a root of bitterness that must be dug out by the grace of God, lest it defile the whole man.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a house catching fire. "Wrath" is like a sudden explosion in the kitchen—terrifying and damaging, but visible and extinguishable. "Envy," however, is like termites in the foundation. They work silently, day and night, unseen, eating away the structural integrity of the house until the entire building collapses. One requires a fire hose; the other requires a complete renewal of the structure.

### Q2. What Scripture shows the exceeding cruelty of jealousy?
"Jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame." Song of Solomon 8:6.

**Answer:**

The Scripture uses the imagery of the "grave" (Hebrew: *Sheol*) to describe the unrelenting nature of jealousy.

1.  **Inexorable as Death:** The grave never says, "It is enough" (Proverbs 30:16). It takes and does not give back. Similarly, a jealous spirit is never satisfied. It demands total possession and control, and it destroys what it cannot control.
2.  **A Consuming Fire:** The text describes it as a "vehement flame." In the context of human passion, this fire burns up reason, kindness, and sympathy. It sears the conscience.
3.  **The Contrast:** This verse in Song of Solomon is contrasting the power of **love** (which is "strong as death") with the cruelty of **jealousy**. True love seeks the good of the other; jealousy seeks only the satisfaction of self.

*   **Definition—The Heart:** In Bible terms, the "heart" is the seat of the will and affections. If the heart is fueled by the "coals of jealousy," the life will produce ashes. If fueled by the Holy Spirit, it produces the fruits of righteousness (Galatians 5:22–23).

**[ILL]**
Consider a man holding a burning coal in his hand, intending to throw it at someone else. While he waits for the chance to throw it, his own flesh is being burned and scarred. Jealousy injures the one who holds it far more than the one against whom it is directed.

### Q3. What striking illustration do we find of this?
"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous." 1 John 3:12.

**Answer:**

The story of Cain and Abel is the first visible manifestation of the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan among men. It perfectly illustrates that envy is often rooted in a hatred of righteousness.

1.  **Religious Envy:** Cain was not an atheist; he was a worshiper. However, he sought to approach God on his own terms—bringing the fruit of the ground (works of human effort) rather than the blood sacrifice (faith in the coming Redeemer) required by God (Genesis 4:3–5).
2.  **The Root of Murder:** Cain did not kill Abel because Abel wronged him. He killed him because Abel’s obedience exposed Cain’s disobedience. The light shines into the darkness, and the darkness hates it (John 3:19–20).
3.  **Justification by Faith:** Abel stands as a type of those who accept **Justification** (being declared righteous) by faith in the Lamb of God. Cain represents those who rely on their own merits. When legalism (Cain) confronts true righteousness by faith (Abel), persecution is the inevitable result (Galatians 4:29).

*   **The Lesson:** We must be careful not to despise those who are more spiritual or obedient than ourselves. Instead of envying their character, we should seek the same Source of power—Jesus Christ.

**[ILL]**
Two students take a test. One studies hard and gets an 'A' (representing a righteous life). The other refuses to study and fails. The failing student becomes angry—not at his own laziness, but at the 'A' student, because that 'A' proves that success was possible. He tears up the other student's paper to make himself feel better. This is the spirit of Cain.

### Q4. Can a man be a murderer in spirit?
"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer." 1 John 3:15.

**Answer:**

The law of God is exceeding broad; it governs not only the outward act but the inward motive. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught that the spirit of the Sixth Commandment ("Thou shalt not kill") is violated by anger and hatred (Matthew 5:21–22).

1.  **The Seed vs. The Fruit:** Murder is the fruit; hatred is the seed. They are of the same nature. God, who sees the heart (1 Samuel 16:7), judges us by what is in the heart. If the restraint of law or society were removed, hatred would eventually result in murder.
2.  **The Need for a New Heart:** This doctrine destroys all human self-righteousness. We may never have held a weapon against another, but have we held a grudge?
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** This is why we need more than forgiveness for past acts; we need the **imparted righteousness** of Christ. We need Him to live out His life of love *in* us. We cannot manufacture love for our enemies; it must be a fruit of the Spirit.

*   **Definition—Imparted Righteousness:** The life of Jesus actually lived out in the believer by the power of the Holy Spirit, enabling obedience to the law from the heart (Romans 8:4).

**[ILL]**
An acorn is not an oak tree in size, but it is an oak tree in nature. If you plant it and water it, it will produce nothing but an oak. Hatred is the acorn; murder is the tree. To God, the nature of the seed is what matters.

### Q5. Give other circumstances where men have been controlled by an envious spirit, and state the result.
"And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt." Acts 7:9. "But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming." Acts 13:45.

**Answer:**

Scripture provides a consistent record of how envy disrupts the work of God and leads to the betrayal of the innocent.

1.  **Joseph and His Brothers:**
    *   **Cause:** Jacob’s favor toward Joseph and Joseph’s God-given dreams (Genesis 37:3–11).
    *   **Result:** They committed a terrible crime against their own flesh and blood, leading to years of guilt and deception. Yet, God overruled their envy for salvation, using Joseph to save the world from famine (Genesis 50:20).
2.  **The Jews and Paul:**
    *   **Cause:** The religious leaders saw their influence waning as the multitudes flocked to hear the Gospel of grace.
    *   **Result:** "Contradicting and blaspheming." Envy led them to reject the very truth that could have saved them. They fought against the light because it threatened their pride of position.
3.  **A Warning for Us:** We are in danger of the same spirit if we feel threatened when God uses others to do a work we cannot do, or when others receive recognition we desire.

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the brothers expelled Joseph (a type of Christ) and the Jews expelled Paul (the messenger of Christ), envy leads us to expel the Holy Spirit from the soul temple.

**[ILL]**
A captain of a ship sees a younger sailor navigating with greater skill and receiving praise from the crew. Instead of rejoicing that the ship is safe, the captain sabotages the sailor's compass, risking the lives of everyone on board just to protect his own reputation. Envy risks the wreck of the church to protect the pride of the individual.

### Q6. What is the condition of things where envy reigns?
"For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. " James 3:16.

**Answer:**

James provides a diagnostic of a community or heart where envy has taken root. The result is total moral chaos.

1.  **Confusion:** God is not the author of confusion, but of peace (1 Corinthians 14:33). Envy introduces a "Babylonian" element (the word *Babel* means confusion). It twists motives, distorts words, and breaks unity.
2.  **Every Evil Work:** Envy is a "gateway sin." Once a person justifies envy, the door is open to lying (to cover it), theft (to take what is envied), malice, and hatred.
3.  **The Contrast:** James 3:17 describes the wisdom from above: pure, peaceable, gentle. This is the fruit of the Spirit. Envy is the fruit of the flesh.

*   **Definition—Babylon:** Spiritually, this represents a system of confusion, self-exaltation, and mixing the holy with the profane. Envy is the spirit of Babylon in the individual heart.

**[ILL]**
If you introduce a single drop of poison into a glass of clear water, the whole glass becomes undrinkable. You cannot say, "The poison is only in the bottom right corner." Envy is that poison; once present, it permeates "every work," tainting our prayers, our service, and our relationships.

### Q7. What effect does envy have upon its possessor?
"For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one." Job 5:2. "A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy, the rottenness of the bones." Prov. 14:30.

**Answer:**

The Bible teaches a direct connection between spiritual health and physical health—a key principle of the **Health Reform** message.

1.  **Rottenness of the Bones:** Medical science confirms that negative emotions like stress, hatred, and envy release harmful chemicals in the body, depressing the immune system and causing disease. Solomon knew this by inspiration.
2.  **Self-Destruction:** Envy does not hurt the person being envied (unless it leads to violence), but it *always* destroys the peace, happiness, and health of the envier. It is a self-inflicted wound.
3.  **A Sound Heart:** A heart at peace with God, resting in the finished work of Christ, brings life to the body. "A merry heart doeth good like a medicine" (Proverbs 17:22).

*   **Practical Application:** We cannot fully keep the laws of health (eating right, exercising) if we are harboring the toxin of envy in the soul. The Gospel healing must go deep enough to cure the temper and the disposition.

**[ILL]**
Acid creates a chemical reaction that eats through the container holding it. Envy is an acid that destroys the vessel (the human body/mind) in which it is stored.

### Q8. Show the persistency of those who are actuated by envy.
"Full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, ...who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them." Rom. 1:29-32.

**Answer:**

This passage in Romans describes the descent into a "reprobate mind" (Romans 1:28)—a mind that can no longer distinguish between right and wrong because it has persistently rejected the truth.

1.  **Full of Envy:** It becomes the defining characteristic of the life.
2.  **Knowing the Judgment:** This is the frightening part. The sinner knows God's law. They know the penalty is death (Romans 6:23). Yet, the power of sin is so strong that they continue in it.
3.  **Taking Pleasure:** Not only do they sin, but they encourage others to sin and delight in the rebellion. This is the ultimate rebellion against the government of God.

*   **The Remedy:** This state is hopeless *humanly speaking*. However, the Gospel is the "power of God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16) even for such as these, if they will turn. But the longer one stays in envy, the harder the heart becomes (Hebrews 3:13).

**[ILL]**
A man sliding down a steep, icy mountain may know there is a cliff at the bottom. He may fear the fall. But once momentum takes over, he cannot stop himself. Sin is that momentum. Only the hand of Christ, reaching down from above, can arrest the slide.

### Q9. How free from malice should the child of God be, even toward an enemy?
"Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth." Prov. 24:17. "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you." Matt. 5:44.

**Answer:**

Here is the high standard of Christian perfection—the character of God Himself.

1.  **The Negative Command:** Do not rejoice in an enemy's failure. This is the natural human reaction ("Justice is served!"), but the Christian must have the sorrow of Christ, who weeps over the lost (Luke 19:41).
2.  **The Positive Command:** Love, bless, do good, pray. This is active, not passive.
3.  **The Source of Power:** To do this requires a death to self. It is the exact opposite of the spirit of the world. This love is the evidence that we have passed from death unto life (1 John 3:14). It is the life of Jesus, who prayed for His murderers, "Father, forgive them" (Luke 23:34), manifesting in His saints.

*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot generate this love. We can only consent to let Christ love them *through* us. "The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost" (Romans 5:5).

**[ILL]**
The sandalwood tree perfumes the very axe that cuts it. Even as it is being destroyed, it gives off fragrance, not poison. This is the nature of the Christian toward their enemies.

### Q10. Will any be saved who retain the spirit of envy in the heart?
"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Gal. 5:21.

**Answer:**

The answer is a solemn "No."

1.  **Fitness for Heaven:** Heaven is not just a location; it is a state of character. The atmosphere of heaven is self-sacrificing love. A person with envy in their heart would be miserable in heaven; they would envy the angels, the redeemed, and even Christ.
2.  **The Blotting Out of Sins:** In the **Investigative Judgment**, not only must sins be forgiven, but the *character* must be cleansed. The "filthy rags" of our own righteousness must be removed, and the white raiment of Christ's character put on (Revelation 3:5; Zechariah 3:3–5).
3.  **A clear warning:** Paul says, "I tell you before." We are warned now so we may repent. There is no "envy" in the "fruit of the Spirit" (Galatians 5:22–23).

*   **Definition—Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (since 1844) where He reviews the lives of believers to see if their faith is genuine and their sins are blotted out, preparatory to His Second Coming.

**[ILL]**
A fish cannot live on dry land; its nature is suited for water. An envious man cannot live in heaven; his nature is suited for the kingdom of self (hell). God does not lock him out arbitrarily; the man has rendered himself unfit for the atmosphere of the place.

### Q11. Is this sentence just?
"But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things." Rom. 2:2.

**Answer:**

Yes, God's judgment is perfect and true.

1.  **According to Truth:** God does not judge by appearance, but by reality. He sees the damage envy does to His creation. He sees that envy is the seed of murder and rebellion.
2.  **Protecting the Universe:** If God allowed envy into the new earth, sin would rise up a second time (Nahum 1:9). To secure the eternal peace of the universe, the root of sin (selfishness/envy) must be eradicated.
3.  **The Merciful Judge:** The Judge is also the Savior. He offers to take our envious heart and give us His own heart *now*. If we refuse the cure, we cannot blame the Physician for the outcome of the disease.

**[ILL]**
If a surgeon removes a gangrenous limb to save the patient's life, is the surgeon cruel? No, he is acting according to the truth of the medical condition. God's judgment against sin is a necessary act to preserve the life of the universe.

### Q12. What is the fountain from which both good and evil spring?
"A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil." Luke 6:45.

**Answer:**

Jesus identifies the heart as the fountainhead of all conduct.

1.  **The Treasure:** The heart is a storehouse. What have we stored there? If we store resentments, jealousies, and worldly desires, that is what will come out in our words and actions.
2.  **The Transformation:** We cannot change the fruit without changing the root. We cannot stop speaking envious words simply by trying to be quiet; we must have the "evil treasure" removed and replaced with the "good treasure"—the presence of Jesus.
3.  **The New Covenant Promise:** "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). This is the promise of a new treasure.

*   **Definition—Sanctification:** It is the daily work of emptying the heart of self and filling it with the Word and Spirit of God.

**[ILL]**
If a well is poisoned, painting the pump handle will not make the water safe. You must clean out the source. Religious forms and ceremonies are like painting the pump handle. The Gospel cleans the well.

### Q13. Then why should the heart be watched closely?
"Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life." Prov. 4:23.

**Answer:**

Because the heart determines our destiny, it must be the object of our supreme care.

1.  **With All Diligence:** This implies a constant, soldier-like guard. We must watch the "avenues of the soul"—what we read, what we watch, who we listen to, and the thoughts we entertain.
2.  **The Issues of Life:** Everything we do flows from the heart. If the heart is right with God, the life will be right. If the heart is envious, the life will be destructive.
3.  **How to Keep It:** We cannot keep our own hearts; they are "deceitful above all things" (Jeremiah 17:9). To "keep" the heart means to **give** it to Christ every morning.
    *   *Prayer:* "Take my heart; for I cannot give it. It is Thy property. Keep it pure, for I cannot keep it for Thee." (Ellen G. White, *Christ's Object Lessons*, p. 159).

**[ILL]**
A city in ancient times was only as safe as its water supply. If the enemy could poison the spring, the city would fall without a battle. Our heart is the spring. Satan knows if he can drop the poison of envy into our hearts, he has captured our lives. We must let the Angel of the Lord stand guard at the spring.
