### Q1. Against what does the third angel warn?

“And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

**Answer:**

The third angel’s message represents the final, most solemn warning ever given to mortals. It is a warning against false worship and apostasy in the closing scenes of the Great Controversy.

1.  **The Object of the Warning:**
    The angel warns against three specific things:
    *   **Worshiping the Beast:** Historically identified by Protestant reformers and Adventist pioneers as the Papacy (a religious-political system, not individual believers within it), which claims authority to change God’s law (Daniel 7:25).
    *   **Worshiping his Image:** A likeness of the beast formed when Protestantism in America unites with the state to enforce religious decrees (Revelation 13:11–15).
    *   **Receiving the Mark:** The sign of allegiance to this apostate power, placed in the forehead (belief/conviction) or the hand (action/compliance) (Exodus 13:9).

2.  **The Issue is Worship:**
    The central conflict in the last days is not about politics or economics primarily, but about *worship*. Will we obey the Creator, who established His law and Sabbath, or will we obey the creature, who attempts to alter that law? (Romans 1:25; Acts 5:29).

3.  **The Wrath of God:**
    The warning carries the threat of "the wine of the wrath of God." In the Bible, God’s wrath is His settled opposition to sin and His final giving up of the rebellious to their own choices. Here, it refers to the seven last plagues, which fall after probation closes (Revelation 15:1).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a soldier on a battlefield. Two generals command opposing armies. One general demands total loyalty based on the laws of the rightful King; the other demands loyalty based on his own usurped authority. To wear the uniform (mark) of the usurper is to declare treason against the King. The third angel is like a messenger running through the camp, warning every soldier that the King is about to return, and to wear the usurper’s uniform is to share in the usurper’s defeat.

### Q2. By what power is this mark enforced on those who receive it?

“And he [the two-horned beast] causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.” (Revelation 13:16)

**Answer:**

The power described here is the "two-horned beast," identified in prophecy as the United States of America.

1.  **The Agent of Enforcement:**
    This beast rises "out of the earth" (a relatively unpopulated area) and has "two horns like a lamb" (indicating civil and religious liberty, republicanism and Protestantism) but eventually speaks "as a dragon" (Revelation 13:11). It is this power—once a haven of liberty—that eventually repudiates its principles to enforce the mark of the first beast (the Papacy).

2.  **The Method of Enforcement:**
    The text says he "causeth" all to receive the mark. This implies legal pressure, economic sanctions, and social coercion. It involves a union of church and state where religious dogmas are enforced by civil law.

3.  **Universal Application:**
    No class is exempt. "Small and great, rich and poor, free and bond." This indicates that the final test will not be limited to a specific social class or region but will be a universal test of loyalty.

**Definition:**
*   **Dragon-like voice:** The use of force, persecution, and legislative power by a nation to compel the conscience, contrary to the Spirit of Christ (Revelation 13:11; 12:17).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Consider the relationship between a hand and a glove. The first beast (the Papacy) is the hand that desires to grip the world. The second beast (apostate Protestantism in the USA) becomes the glove. The glove moves only because the hand directs it. The enforcement comes through the machinery of the state (the glove), but the principle being enforced belongs to the apostate church system (the hand).

### Q3. What will those keep, who do not receive the mark of the beast?

“Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

**Answer:**

Those who refuse the mark are identified by three distinct characteristics. This verse describes the fruit of **Righteousness by Faith**.

1.  **The Patience of the Saints:**
    The word "patience" here means endurance or steadfast perseverance. In the face of boycott, ridicule, and death decrees, they endure because their lives are hid in Christ (Colossians 3:3).

2.  **Keep the Commandments of God:**
    While the world accepts the "mark" (a man-made substitute for God's law), the remnant stands firm on *all* ten commandments, including the fourth. They do not keep them to *be* saved (legalism), but because they *are* saved (John 14:15). The law is written on their hearts by the New Covenant promise (Hebrews 8:10).

3.  **The Faith of Jesus:**
    Notice it does not merely say faith *in* Jesus, though that is included. It is the **Faith *of* Jesus**.
    *   It is the same quality of faith that Jesus exercised—a faith that trusts God even when He cannot be traced, even to the cross.
    *   It is Christ's own faith imparted to the believer. We are not saved by our struggle to believe, but by resting in His faithfulness (Galatians 2:20).

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The process by which the believer, through the Holy Spirit, becomes a partaker of the divine nature, resulting in obedience to God's law. It is "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A mirror can reflect the sun, but it cannot generate light. The saints in the last days are like mirrors. They keep the commandments not by their own power, but because they are turned fully toward Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness. His light (His faith, His character) hits them and reflects off them into a dark world. The world sees the "Faith of Jesus" reflected in their obedience.

### Q4. What day is the Sabbath?

“But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” (Exodus 20:10)

**Answer:**

1.  **Specific Identification:**
    The commandment is precise. It is not "a" seventh day (one out of seven), but "the" seventh day. In the creation week, God blessed only the seventh day (Genesis 2:2–3).

2.  **God's Authority:**
    It is the Sabbath "of the Lord thy God." It belongs to Him. It is the memorial of His creative power. To keep it is to acknowledge Him as the Creator and Owner of the universe.

3.  **No Biblical Change:**
    The Bible contains no record of God ever transferring the sanctity of the seventh day to the first day. The Sabbath remains the "sign" between God and His people that He is the one who sanctifies them (Ezekiel 20:12).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If a wealthy benefactor gives you a check signed on a specific bank, you cannot take it to a different bank and expect to receive the funds. You must go where the authority lies. God has placed His blessing and authority on the seventh day. We cannot transfer that blessing to Sunday (the first day) simply because it is more convenient or popular.

---

### Q5. What does God call the Sabbath?

“If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day.” (Isaiah 58:13)

**Answer:**

1.  **"My Holy Day":**
    God claims the Sabbath as His exclusive property. It is not "the Jewish Sabbath"; it is "My holy day."

2.  **Turning the Foot:**
    To "turn away thy foot" implies that we are treading on holy ground. Just as Moses took off his shoes at the burning bush out of reverence (Exodus 3:5), we treat the Sabbath hours with reverence because God's presence is specifically attached to time.

3.  **Relationship to Righteousness:**
    Keeping the Sabbath is an act of faith. It involves setting aside our own "pleasure" (our business, our secular pursuits) to enter into God's rest. This is a weekly lesson in justification by faith—we cease our own works to rest in what God has done (Hebrews 4:9–10).

---

### Q6. Of what day is Christ the Lord?

“Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Creator's Right:**
    Since "all things were made by him" (John 1:3), Jesus is the Creator who rested on the first Sabbath. Therefore, He is the Lord of the Sabbath day.

2.  **The True "Lord's Day":**
    John the Revelator speaks of being in the Spirit on "the Lord's Day" (Revelation 1:10). Based on Mark 2:28, the only day commanded in Scripture of which Christ claims Lordship is the seventh-day Sabbath.

3.  **Not to Abolish, but to Keep:**
    Christ did not come to destroy the law, but to fulfill it (Matthew 5:17). As Lord of the Sabbath, He cleared it from the burdensome man-made traditions of the Pharisees and restored it to its rightful place as a blessing to mankind (Mark 2:27).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If a man builds a house, he is the "lord" of that house. He has the right to say which room is the sanctuary. Jesus built the week at Creation. As the Architect, He designated the seventh room (day) as the sanctuary in time. To say another day is the Lord's day is to evict the Architect from His own design.

### Q7. What do eminent men say regarding the change of the Sabbath to the first day?

(Refer to the quotes provided in the prompt from Lyman Abbott, The Watchman, and the Protestant Episcopal Church.)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Admission of Silence:**
    The quotes provided in the lesson highlight a critical point admitted by honest scholars of various denominations: The New Testament contains **no command** to change the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.
    *   *Lyman Abbott (Congregationalist)* admits the change has "absolutely no authority in the New Testament."
    *   *The Watchman (Baptist)* admits there is "no scriptural authority."
    *   *The Episcopal Church* admits the change was done "by the authority of the church," not Scripture.

2.  **Tradition vs. Scripture:**
    This brings the believer to the Protestant principle of *Sola Scriptura* (Scripture Alone). If the Bible is the only rule of faith, then Sunday observance is a human tradition. To keep Sunday is to obey the authority of the Church (tradition) rather than the authority of God (Scripture).

**Definition:**
*   **Sola Scriptura:** The belief that the Bible is the supreme authority in all matters of doctrine and practice (Isaiah 8:20; 2 Timothy 3:16).

---

### Q8. What does the papacy set forth as the mark, or sign of its authority in commanding men under sin?

“By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of... Because by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin.” (Abridgement of Christian Doctrine, page 58)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Claim of Authority:**
    The Roman Catholic Church openly claims that the change of the Sabbath to Sunday is the "mark" or proof of its ecclesiastical power. They argue that if the Bible were the only guide, everyone would keep Saturday.

2.  **The Mark of the Beast Identified:**
    Since the "Beast" is the Papacy (the system that usurps God's place), and the Papacy claims the Sunday change as its specific mark of authority, prophecy identifies the enforced observance of Sunday as the "Mark of the Beast."

3.  **The Rival Sign:**
    God has a sign: The Sabbath (Ezekiel 20:12, 20), representing His authority as Creator.
    The Beast has a mark: Sunday, representing its authority to change God's law.
    The final conflict involves choosing between these two authorities.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
In ancient times, kings used a signet ring to seal laws. The seal contained the king's name, title, and territory. The fourth commandment contains God's seal: His Name (The Lord thy God), Title (Creator/Maker), and Territory (Heaven and earth). The Beast attempts to break this seal and replace it with a counterfeit stamp—Sunday—to show it has power over the King's law.

---

### Q9. What are several modern Sunday advocacy organizations trying to do at the present time?

**Answer:**

1.  **The Push for Legislation:**
    Various religious and political organizations are working to secure civil laws that protect Sunday as a day of rest. While often presented as "family protection" or "labor rights," the underlying goal is the legal enforcement of a religious institution.

2.  **Bridging Church and State:**
    Prophecy predicts that in the United States, church and state will bridge the gulf to enforce religious observances. We see this fulfilling as organizations lobby the government to uphold religious standards, forgetting the principles of religious liberty upon which the nation was founded.

---

### Q10. How are they described who submit to this unscriptural requirement?

**Answer:**

They are described as "worshipers of the beast and his image."

1.  **Obedience is Worship:**
    The Bible defines worship primarily as obedience. "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?" (Romans 6:16).

2.  **The Spiritual Reality:**
    When a person knows what the Bible teaches (the seventh day) but chooses to obey a human power (the first day) because of convenience, social pressure, or law, they are effectively worshiping that human power. They are placing the beast's authority above God's.

**RBF Connection:**
True worship is the surrender of the will to God. Justification by faith breaks the power of the "fear of man" and gives the believer the courage to obey God regardless of the cost.

---

### Q11. How strongly will this worship and mark be urged?

“That the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all... to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark.” (Revelation 13:15–17)

**Answer:**

The coercion will be total, escalating in two stages:

1.  **Economic Boycott (Buying and Selling):**
    Those who refuse to yield their conscience to the state-enforced Sunday law will be cut off from the economic system. They will be unable to conduct business, hold jobs, or purchase necessities. This tests whether our trust is in our bank accounts or in the Living God.

2.  **The Death Decree:**
    Finally, the "image of the beast" (the apostate Protestant civil power) will legislate that those who persist in "rebellion" (faithfulness to God's law) are worthy of death. This parallels the decree of Nebuchadnezzar against the three Hebrews in Daniel 3.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A siege. In ancient warfare, an enemy would surround a city and cut off the water and food supply to force surrender. The beast power will lay siege to the people of God, cutting off earthly support ("buying and selling"). But God has promised that for the righteous, "bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure" (Isaiah 33:16).

---

### Q12. What warning does the Lord give against the reception of this mark?

“And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Severity of the Warning:**
    This is the most fearful threatening ever addressed to mortals. It indicates that the sin of receiving the mark involves a direct, willful rejection of God's authority after the truth has been made plain.

2.  **No Neutrality:**
    The message allows for no compromise. A person cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24). One must choose the seal of God or the mark of the beast.

3.  **God's Love in Warning:**
    It is an act of mercy for God to give such a strong warning. He does not want anyone to perish. He reveals the terrible consequences so that men and women will flee to Christ for refuge while the door of probation is still open.

---

### Q13. What is this wine of God's wrath?

“And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.” (Revelation 15:1)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Seven Last Plagues:**
    The "wine of the wrath of God" is identified as the seven last plagues. These are judgments poured out on the earth after Christ finishes His intercessory work in the heavenly sanctuary.

2.  **Without Mixture:**
    Revelation 14:10 says this wine is poured out "without mixture." Hitherto, God's judgments have always been mixed with mercy. The Holy Spirit has striven with men. But when the plagues fall, the time of mercy has ended. Christ leaves the Most Holy Place, and there is no longer a Mediator to hold back the full consequences of sin.

**Definition:**
*   **Probation:** The time granted to humanity to accept the gospel and develop character. When probation closes, character is fixed forever: "He that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still" (Revelation 22:11).

---

### Q14. How extensive will be the worship of the beast?

“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life.” (Revelation 13:8)

**Answer:**

1.  **A Universal Apostasy:**
    The deception will be worldwide. The text says "all that dwell upon the earth." Boundaries of nation, culture, and language will be swept away by this confederacy of evil.

2.  **The Only Safety:**
    The only exception is the group "whose names are written in the book of life of the Lamb."
    *   This implies that our only safety against the deception of the last days is a vital, living connection with Jesus Christ.
    *   Mere intellectual knowledge of the truth will not be enough. We must be *in* Christ, covered by His righteousness (Philippians 3:9).

**RBF Connection:**
To have one's name in the Book of Life means to be a partaker of Christ's life. It is to die to self and let Christ live in us. Only the life of Christ in the believer can withstand the pressure of the beast.

---

### Q15. Will all receive this mark?

“And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.” (Revelation 15:2)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Victorious Company:**
    No! Thank God, not all will bow the knee. John sees a group standing on the sea of glass (before God's throne). They have gotten the victory.

2.  **Victory over the Mark:**
    They did not compromise. They faced the boycott, the threats, and the death decree, but they held fast to the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

3.  **Victory through Christ:**
    How did they overcome? "By the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony" (Revelation 12:11). Their victory was not a victory of human willpower, but of faith in the power of Christ to keep them from falling (Jude 24).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Like the three Hebrews in the fiery furnace (Daniel 3), this group passes through the fire of persecution but is not consumed. The form of the "Fourth" (the Son of God) is with them. The fire only burns away their bonds; it demonstrates the purity of their gold (faith).

---

### Q16. The third angel's message warns against the worship of the beast, and the reception of his mark. What follows this message?

“And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.” (Revelation 14:14)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Second Coming:**
    Immediately following the proclamation of the Three Angels' Messages and the final test of the mark of the beast, the prophet sees the Son of Man coming on a cloud. This is the literal, visible return of Jesus Christ.

2.  **The Crown and the Sickle:**
    *   **The Crown:** He comes as King of Kings to claim His kingdom.
    *   **The Sickle:** He comes as the Lord of the Harvest to reap the earth.

3.  **The Purpose of Prophecy:**
    The warning of the mark of the beast is the final message to prepare the world for this event. The message is given to ripen the harvest—to bring people to a decision so that Christ can come.

---

### Q17. What does He do at this time?

“And He that sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.” (Revelation 14:16)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Great Separation:**
    The thrusting of the sickle represents the separation of the righteous from the wicked. The "wheat" (the righteous) are gathered into God's barn, while the "grapes of wrath" (the wicked) are gathered for destruction (Revelation 14:18–19).

2.  **The Finality:**
    "The earth was reaped." This marks the end of human history as we know it. The controversy is ended. The decisions made regarding the beast and the seal of God are irrevocable.

---

### Q18. What is the reaping time, or the harvest, called?

“The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.” (Matthew 13:39)

**Answer:**

1.  **The End of the World:**
    Jesus clearly defines the harvest as the "end of the world" (or age). The conflict over the Sabbath and the mark of the beast is not a distant, theoretical issue—it is the triggering event for the end of the world.

2.  **The Importance of Preparation:**
    If the harvest is the end, then the growing season is now. We are currently determining whether we are wheat or tares.
    *   **Wheat:** Those who through faith in Jesus produce the fruit of obedience (Sanctification).
    *   **Tares:** Those who may look like wheat but have no root in Christ and yield to the world (the Beast).

**Conclusion:**
The message of the third angel is a call to be part of God's wheat—to have the character of Christ, to keep His commandments through His power, and to stand ready for the coming of the King.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A farmer waits patiently for the grain to ripen. He cannot harvest while the grain is green. God is waiting for His people to reproduce His character perfectly (Mark 4:28–29). When the test of the Mark of the Beast comes, it will reveal who has truly allowed the Holy Spirit to ripen their character into the likeness of Jesus.
