## Slide 1 – Q1: The Beast of Revelation 13

- Question: Describe the first beast of Revelation 13.
- Key Text: Revelation 13:2 – “And the beast which I saw was like unto a
  leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth
  of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great
  authority.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Identity)

- **A Composite Power**
  - This beast combines the traits of the four empires of Daniel 7:
    - Lion (Babylon)
    - Bear (Medo-Persia)
    - Leopard (Greece)
    - Terrible Beast (Pagan Rome)
- **Historical Identity**
  - Represents the **Papacy** (Ecclesiastical Rome).
  - Just as Rome absorbed the territories of previous empires, the Papacy
    absorbed their spiritual characteristics:
    - _Babylon:_ Sun worship and mysteries.
    - _Medo-Persia:_ Infallibility and state enforcement.
    - _Greece:_ Philosophy (view of the soul).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Authority & Sanctuary)

- **The Dragon’s Seat**
  - The Dragon (Pagan Rome/Satan) gave the Papacy its "seat" (capital) and
    authority.
  - Historically fulfilled when the capital moved to Constantinople, leaving
    Rome to the Bishop.
- **Sanctuary Insight**
  - The earthly sanctuary revealed Christ’s ministry.
  - The "beast" system creates a **counterfeit sanctuary**:
    - An earthly priesthood.
    - An earthly sacrifice (the mass).
    - Human forgiveness.
  - This obscures Christ’s work in the heavenly sanctuary.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Family Portrait**
  - Imagine a child with the grandfather's eyes, grandmother's nose, and
    father's chin.
  - To know the child's nature, look at the ancestors.
  - To understand the Papacy, look at the pagan empires.
  - It carries the "DNA" of Babylon (idolatry), Persia (legalism), and Greece
    (intellectualism), dressed in Christian garb.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Origin of the Papacy

- Question: From what was the papacy developed?
- Key Text: 2 Thessalonians 2:3 – “Let no man deceive you by any means; for that
  day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
  sin be revealed, the son of perdition.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Apostasy)

- **The Falling Away (_Apostasia_)**
  - The Papacy was not an external enemy; it was an internal corruption.
  - A massive departure from the simplicity of the gospel within the church.
- **The Mystery of Iniquity**
  - Already at work in Paul's day (2 Thessalonians 2:7).
  - A drift from justification by faith to justification by works and human
    hierarchy.
- **The Man of Sin**
  - Linked to the title "son of perdition" (used for Judas in John 17:12).
  - Like Judas, this system sits _among_ the disciples but betrays Christ for
    worldly power.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Root of Apostasy**
  - A "falling away" begins in the heart when we lose hold of Christ.
  - When faith in Jesus weakens, we turn to human rules and forms for security.
  - **True Religion:** Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27 – “To
    whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery
    among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory”).
  - The "falling away" replaces internal life with external forms.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Slow Leak**
  - A torpedo attack is obvious, but a slow, hidden leak is dangerous.
  - Water rises imperceptibly until the ship is swamped.
  - The "falling away" was not a sudden attack.
  - It was a slow leak of worldliness that eventually submerged the gospel
    truth.

## Slide 9 – Q3: First Evidence of Falling Away

- Question: In what was shown the first tangible evidence of "falling away" from
  the truth of God?
- **Historical Evidence (Mosheim):**
  - The adoption of heathen rites and customs.
  - Bishops increased rites to accommodate Jews and heathens.
  - They renamed pagan "mysteries" with Christian titles.
  - Heathen ceremonies were adopted into baptism and the Lord's Supper.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Syncretism)

- **Accommodation**
  - Leaders thought they could win pagans by making Christianity look like
    paganism.
  - Resulted in **Syncretism**: mixing the holy with the profane.
- **Loss of Power**
  - When the church had the Spirit (Acts 2), she needed no theatrical rites.
  - As the Spirit's power faded, elaborate ceremonies were added to compensate.
- **Righteousness by Faith vs. Ritualism**
  - The Gospel is simple: “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
    saved” (Acts 16:31).
  - The carnal mind prefers ritual because it allows man to _do_ something to
    earn merit.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Diluted Medicine**
  - Imagine a doctor mixing a bitter, life-saving cure with so much sugar water
    that it becomes useless.
  - Patients drink it gladly but do not get well.
  - The early church diluted the "bitter" pill of self-denial with the "sugar"
    of pagan pageantry.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Timing of the Apostasy

- Question: How early was this tendency manifested?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "This imitation began in the eastern provinces; but, after the time of
    Adrian [117-138 A.D.]... it was followed by the Christians who dwelt in the
    western parts..." (Mosheim).

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Second Century**
  - Corruption began almost immediately after the last apostles died.
  - Confirms Paul's warning: Acts 20:29 – “For I know this, that after my
    departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.”
- **Tradition vs. Scripture**
  - We cannot trust "Early Church Tradition" blindly.
  - The oldest traditions may be the oldest apostasies.
  - Test all things by the Bible alone (Isaiah 8:20).

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **[ILL] The River Source**
  - If you want pure water, you must go to the spring (the Bible).
  - Do not go miles downriver where the mud and pollution of tradition have
    flowed in.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Characteristic of the Papacy

- Question: What has been the great characteristic of the papacy?
- **Answer:**
  - A union of church and state.
  - A religious power dominating the civil power to further its own ends.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Church & State)

- **Two Separate Kingdoms**
  - Jesus separated the two: Matthew 22:21 – “Render therefore unto Caesar the
    things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.”
  - The Papacy obliterates this line, claiming authority over conscience and
    sword.
- **Force vs. Love**
  - God's government is based on free choice: Revelation 22:17 – “And whosoever
    will, let him take the water of life freely.”
  - The Beast's government is based on coercion.
- **Sanctification Connection**
  - True obedience comes from a new heart (Ezekiel 36:26).
  - State-enforced religion creates hypocrites, not Christians.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Marriage of Convenience**
  - Oil and water do not mix unless forced.
  - Church (spiritual) and State (political) operate on different principles.
  - When married, the State corrupts the Church, producing tyranny.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Formation of the Union

- Question: When was the union of church and state formed, from which the papacy
  grew?
- **Answer:**
  - In the reign of Constantine, 312-337 A.D.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points (Constantine)

- **The Great Compromise**
  - Constantine supposedly converted but remained High Priest of paganism.
  - Brought empire wealth and power into the church.
- **The Exchange**
  - Church gained tax exemptions and prestige.
  - State gained influence over doctrine and church councils.
  - This created the "Imperial Church."

## Slide 20 – Q7: Condition of the Bishops

- Question: What was the condition and work of most of the bishops at that time?
- **Historical Quote (Neander):**
  - "Worldly minded bishops... were often but too much inclined to travel about,
    and entangle themselves in worldly concerns."

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Hireling Spirit**
  - Leaders shifted focus from spiritual shepherding to political maneuvering.
  - Contrast with the Good Shepherd (John 10:12-13).
- **The True Minister**
  - Christ made Himself of "no reputation" (Philippians 2:7).
  - False ministers sought the reputation and power of the State.

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Bishops' Goal

- Question: What did the bishops determine to do?
- **Historical Quote (Neander):**
  - "The theocratical theory was already the prevailing one... the bishops
    voluntarily made themselves dependent on him [Constantine]..."

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Theocracy)

- **The Theocratical Error**
  - Israel was a true theocracy led by God.
  - Bishops tried to recreate this using the Emperor's sword instead of the
    Spirit.
- **Righteousness by Faith vs. Law**
  - True unity comes from the Spirit writing the law on the heart (Jeremiah
    31:33).
  - Bishops sought unity through imperial decrees (righteousness by national
    law).

## Slide 24 – Q9: The Outgrowth

- Question: What was the outgrowth of that theory among the Roman bishops?
- Key Text: 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 – “...that man of sin be revealed... who
  opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God... so that he as
  God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points (Man of Sin)

- **"Sitteth in the Temple"**
  - Not just a building, but the church (Ephesians 2:21).
  - Seats himself over the _conscience_, claiming God's prerogatives.
- **"As God"**
  - Claims to be "Vicar of the Son of God" (Representative of Christ).
  - Biblical Representative is the Holy Spirit (John 14:26).
- **Counterfeit Mediation**
  - Obscures Righteousness by Faith.
  - Inserts a human priesthood between the sinner and the Savior.
  - Blocks the way to the "throne of grace" (Hebrews 4:16).

## Slide 26 – Q10: Council of Nice

- Question: When and by whom was the Council of Nice convened?
- **Answer:**
  - The Emperor Constantine, 325 A.D.
- **Significance:**
  - Convened by the State, not the Holy Spirit.
  - Set the precedent for the State to preside over Church affairs.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Authority of Decrees

- Question: Under what authority were its decrees published?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "The decrees... were published under the imperial authority, and thus
    obtained a political importance." (Neander).

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points

- **Political Importance**
  - Dissenting from church doctrine became a crime against the state.
  - Laid the groundwork for persecution.
- **Liberty of Conscience**
  - God accepts only voluntary service (Joshua 24:15).
  - When imperial authority forces doctrine, liberty dies.

## Slide 29 – Q12: Object of the Council

- Question: What was one of the principal objects in calling that council?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "The question relating to observance of Easter... was one of the principal
    reasons for convoking the Council of Nice..." (Boyle).

## Slide 30 – Q13: The Easter Question

- Question: What was the particular question to be settled concerning Easter?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - Eastern churches: Observed the 14th day of the moon (Jewish custom).
  - Western churches (Rome, etc.): Observed Sunday only.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points

- **Quartodecimans vs. Sunday**
  - The East followed the example of the Apostle John (14th of Nisan).
  - The West (Rome) insisted on Sunday to distinguish from Judaism.
  - A battle for authority: Apostolic example vs. Roman custom.

## Slide 32 – Q14: The Decision

- Question: How was the matter finally decided?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "Easter day was fixed on the Sunday immediately following the new moon..."
    (Boyle).
- **Result:**
  - Rome won.
  - Biblical timing was discarded for a calculated Sunday.
  - Strengthened the prestige of Sunday and Roman authority.

## Slide 33 – Q15: Constantine's Reason

- Question: In his letter to the churches, urging the observance of this decree,
  what singular reason did Constantine assign for its observance?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "Let us then have nothing in common with the most hostile rabble of the
    Jews."

## Slide 34 – Q15: Key Points

- **Anti-Semitism**
  - Driving force for the change.
  - Sabbath (Saturday) was seen as "Jewish."
- **Tragic Irony**
  - Jesus was a Jew and "Lord also of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28).
  - Theology must be built on Scripture, not prejudice.

## Slide 35 – Q16: Bishop Sylvester

- Question: What did Sylvester, bishop of Rome under Constantine's reign, do by
  his "apostolic" authority, and with the approval of Constantine?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - He changed the names of the days.
  - "The name of the first day alone was changed, which he called the Lord's
    day."

## Slide 36 – Q16: Key Points

- **The "Lord's Day"**
  - Biblically, the Lord's day is the Sabbath (Isaiah 58:13 – "If thou turn away
    thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day...").
  - Sylvester presumed to transfer this title to Sunday.
- **Prophecy Fulfilled**
  - Daniel 7:25 – "And he shall speak great words against the most High... and
    think to change times and laws."

## Slide 37 – Q17: Council of Laodicea

- Question: What was decreed by the Council of Laodicea in 364 A.D.?
- **Answer:**
  - That churches should keep Sunday.
  - If they persisted in resting on the Sabbath, "let them be accursed"
    (anathema).

## Slide 38 – Q17: Key Points

- **War on the Saints**
  - The curse fulfills Revelation 13:7 ("make war with the saints").
- **Application (Faith vs. Force)**
  - True faith establishes God's law (Romans 3:31).
  - The Beast demands obedience to _man's law_.
  - The Believer's choice: Fear the council's curse, or fear God and keep His
    commandments (Ecclesiastes 12:13).
- **Sanctuary Attack**
  - An attack on the Sabbath is an attack on the Ark in the Most Holy Place.

## Slide 39 – Q18: Sunday Laws

- Question: What petition was made to the emperor by a church convention, in 401
  A.D.?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "That the public shows might be transferred from the Christian Sunday... to
    some other days of the week."

## Slide 40 – Q19: Object of Laws

- Question: What was the object of these state laws?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "That the devotion of the faithful might be free from all disturbance."

## Slide 41 – Q19: Key Points & Illustration

- **Forced Devotion**
  - The goal was to force people to be religious or appear so.
- **[ILL] The Hollow Nut**
  - You can glue a nut shell together, but you can't put the kernel back in.
  - Sunday laws created a shell of "devotion" without the kernel of the Holy
    Spirit.

## Slide 42 – Q20: Disturbed Devotion

- Question: How was their "devotion" disturbed?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "Church teachers... were, in truth, often forced to complain, that in such
    competitions the theater was vastly more frequented than the church."

## Slide 43 – Q20: Key Points

- **The Problem**
  - People preferred the theater because the church had lost the power of the
    gospel.
  - It had become a system of dry forms.
- **The Wrong Solution**
  - Instead of seeking revival (2 Chronicles 7:14), they sought legislation.
- **Spiritual Lesson**
  - You cannot legislate the heart.
  - God desires worship in "spirit and in truth" (John 4:24).

## Slide 44 – Q21: Demanding Power

- Question: When the church had received help from the state to this extent,
  what more did she demand?
- **Answer:**
  - That the civil power should be exerted to compel men to serve God as the
    church should dictate.
- **Result:**
  - The full maturation of the Beast image: a religious power wielding the
    sword.

## Slide 45 – Q22: Augustine's Teaching

- Question: What did Augustine, the father of this theory, teach concerning it?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - "Many... must often be reclaimed to their master by the rod of temporal
    suffering..."

## Slide 46 – Q22: Key Points

- **The Theology of Persecution**
  - Augustine argued that punishing heretics physically was an act of "love."
  - Logic used for the Inquisition.
- **Gospel Contrast**
  - Jesus: "My sheep hear my voice... and they follow me" (John 10:27).
  - Jesus draws men (John 12:32); He does not force them.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - Faith cannot be coerced.
  - "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness" (Romans 10:10).

## Slide 47 – Q23: The Conclusion

- Question: What is Neander's conclusion regarding this?
- **Historical Quote:**
  - Augustine's theory "contained the germ of that whole system of spiritual
    despotism... which ended in the tribunals of the inquisition."

## Slide 48 – Q23: Key Points

- **The Harvest**
  - The "germ" of compromise grew into the "Beast" of Revelation 13.
- **Warning for Today**
  - Whenever religion uses government to enforce dogma, the spirit of the Papacy
    is revived.
- **The Call**
  - "Come out of her, my people" (Revelation 18:4).
  - Come out of the _spirit_ of force and legalism.
  - Stand on religious liberty and the commandments of God (Revelation 14:12).

## Slide 49 – Q23: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Seed and the Tree**
  - An acorn contains the blueprint for a massive oak.
  - The early compromise of using state power for Sunday was the "acorn."
  - It contained the blueprint for the Inquisition.
  - Beware the "little foxes that spoil the vines" (Song of Solomon 2:15).
