### Chapter 5: Christ in All the Bible

The Bible is not merely a collection of moral codes or historical records; it is
a revelation of a Person. From the first promise of grace in Eden to the final
visions of Revelation, the central theme is the Great Controversy between good
and evil, and the work of Jesus Christ to redeem a lost race.

### Q1. Of whom does Christ Himself tell us that the Scriptures speak about?

"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are
they which testify of Me." (John 5:39)

**Answer:** The Scriptures are the map, but Christ is the treasure. In this
verse, Jesus was speaking to religious leaders who diligently memorized the text
but rejected the Person to whom the text pointed.

- **The Purpose of the Word:** The Bible was given to reveal God's character and
  His plan to save humanity. Every ceremony, genealogy, and prophecy finds its
  fulfillment in Jesus.
- **Eternal Life Defined:** Eternal life is not found in the mere intellectual
  knowledge of the Bible, but in knowing the One whom the Bible reveals (John
  17:3).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Many read the Bible as a book of rules to be kept
  by human effort (legalism). However, when we see that the Scriptures "testify
  of Me" (Christ), we realize the Bible is the story of how God provides the
  righteousness we lack. We do not search the Scriptures to prove we are good;
  we search them to find the Savior who makes us good.

**[ILL]** A man on a long journey receives a love letter from his betrothed,
including a picture of her face. If he stares at the ink and paper, analyzes the
grammar, and memorizes the sentences but refuses to look at the photo or prepare
for the wedding, he has missed the point of the letter. The Bible is God’s love
letter; its purpose is to introduce us to the Author.

### Q2. About whom did Moses and the Old Testament prophets write?

"Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him of whom Moses
in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
(John 1:45)

**Answer:** The Old Testament is not a separate religion from the New; it is the
Gospel in anticipation.

- **Moses and the Law:** The moral law (the Ten Commandments) reveals the
  perfect character of Christ, which is the standard of righteousness (Psalm
  40:8). The ceremonial law (the sacrificial system) revealed the work of Christ
  as the "Lamb of God" who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29).
- **The Prophets:** The prophets did not write merely to predict political
  events, but to focus the hope of the people on the coming Messiah who would
  restore the broken relationship between God and man.
- **One Plan of Salvation:** This verse proves that people in the Old Testament
  were saved exactly the same way we are: by faith in Jesus Christ. They looked
  forward to the Cross; we look back to it.

---

### Q3. Who revealed beforehand the death and resurrection of Christ?

"O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: ought
not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory?" (Luke
24:25, 26)

**Answer:** Jesus explains that His suffering was not an accident, but a
necessity revealed by the prophets.

- **The Necessity of Suffering:** Sin requires a cost. The "wages of sin is
  death" (Romans 6:23). For God to remain just while justifying the sinner, the
  penalty had to be paid. The prophets revealed that the Messiah would be a
  suffering Servant before He could be a conquering King.
- **The Pattern:** The path to glory is through self-denial and death to self.
  Christ paved this way for us.
- **Slow of Heart:** The disciples struggled because they wanted a political
  messiah to defeat Rome, not a spiritual Savior to defeat sin. We must guard
  against wanting a religion that gives us power and prestige rather than a
  religion that crucifies our pride and sin.

---

### Q4. Does all of Scripture tell us about Jesus?

"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the
scriptures the things concerning Himself." (Luke 24:27)

**Answer:** This suggests that Christ can be found in every part of the inspired
canon.

- **The Key to Interpretation:** We cannot correctly understand the Old
  Testament histories, the sanctuary services, or the Psalms unless we view them
  through the lens of Christ's mission.
- **Christ in the Doctrines:**
  - In the **Law**, He is our Righteousness.
  - In the **History**, He is the Deliverer.
  - In the **Prophecy**, He is the Coming King.
  - In the **Psalms**, He is the Shepherd and the Fellow-Sufferer.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** The entire Levitical system—the tabernacle, the
  priesthood, the sacrifices—was an object lesson teaching the work of Christ.
  The "outer court" represents His death on earth; the "holy places" represent
  His intercession in heaven.

### Q5. Where in the Bible is the first promise of the Redeemer?

"And the Lord God said unto the serpent, I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
shalt bruise his heel." (Genesis 3:14, 15)

**Answer:** This prophecy, known as the _Protoevangelium_ (the first Gospel), is
the foundation of the entire Bible.

- **The Enmity:** By nature, fallen man is not at enmity with Satan; we are his
  captives and naturally inclined to sin (Romans 8:7). God promises to "put
  enmity" in our hearts. This is the work of grace. It is the Holy Spirit
  creating a hatred for sin and a desire for holiness.
- **The Seed:** This refers specifically to Jesus Christ (Galatians 4:4), born
  of a woman without a human father.
- **The Bruised Heel vs. The Crushed Head:** Satan would bruise Christ's heel
  (the physical suffering and death at the cross), but this act would result in
  the crushing of the serpent's head—the definitive defeat of Satan and the
  destruction of sin's power.
- **Victory Over Sin:** This verse promises that we are not left to fight Satan
  alone. Christ has won the victory, and He implants that victory in the
  believer's heart.

**[ILL]** Imagine a person trapped in a dungeon, chained to a cruel tyrant,
having grown used to the darkness. Suddenly, a Liberator enters. He does not
merely unlock the door; he changes the prisoner's heart so that he now hates the
chains he once loved. This "enmity" against the chains is the first step of
freedom.

### Q6. In what words was this great truth explained to Abraham?

"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." (Genesis 22:18)

**Answer:**

- **The Universal Gospel:** God chose Abraham not to exclude the rest of the
  world, but to create a channel through which the Savior (the Seed) would come
  to bless _all_ nations.
- **Justification by Faith:** Abraham believed this promise, and it was "counted
  to him for righteousness" (Genesis 15:6). He looked forward to Christ just as
  we look backward to Him.
- **The Nature of the Blessing:** The blessing is not primarily material wealth,
  but the turning away of "every one of you from his iniquities" (Acts 3:26).

---

### Q7. To whom did this promised seed refer?

"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds,
as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." (Galatians 3:16)

**Answer:**

- **One Way of Salvation:** There are not many ways to God. Salvation is not
  found in a race (the Jewish people generally) or a multitude of descendants,
  but in one Person: Jesus Christ.
- **Union with Christ:** While the "Seed" is singular (Christ), believers become
  "Abraham's seed" by being baptized _into_ Christ (Galatians 3:29).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We inherit the promises not by our genealogy or
  our personal performance, but by being united with Christ by faith. When we
  are in Him, His history becomes our history; His obedience is credited as our
  obedience.

### Q8. Whom did God promise would especially guide Israel to the Promised Land?

"Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee
into the place which I have prepared." (Exodus 23:20)

**Answer:**

- **The Angel of the Presence:** This "Angel" (Messenger) is not a created
  being, for God says "My name is in him" (Exodus 23:21). This is the
  pre-incarnate Christ, the "Messenger of the Covenant" (Malachi 3:1).
- **Christ's Continuous Care:** It was Jesus who led Israel through the
  wilderness. He has always been the active Shepherd of His people.
- **Keeping us in the Way:** Just as He led Israel to the earthly Canaan, Christ
  leads His church today toward the heavenly Canaan. He keeps us "in the
  way"—the way of obedience and faith.

### Q9. Who was the Rock that went with them?

"And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual
Rock that followed [literally, 'went with'] them: and that Rock was Christ." (1
Corinthians 10:4)

**Answer:**

- **The Source of Life:** In the dry wilderness, water flowed from the smitten
  rock (Exodus 17:6). Paul reveals this was a type of Christ. He was "smitten"
  by God and afflicted (Isaiah 53:4) so that the water of life (the Holy Spirit)
  could flow to dying sinners.
- **Spiritual Sustenance:** The Israelites physically drank from the rock, but
  believers spiritually drink of Christ's life.
- **Definition - Sanctification:** This "drinking" represents the daily intake
  of Christ's grace and Spirit, which sanctifies us (makes us holy) and sustains
  our spiritual life against the heat of temptation.

**[ILL]** A diver deep in the ocean relies entirely on the air line connected to
the surface. If the line is cut, life ends. The Christian is in the "deep
waters" of a sinful world. Christ is the Rock, and faith is the air line through
which His life flows into us moment by moment.

### Q10. Where was the promised Saviour to be born?

"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of
Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be Ruler in
Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." (Micah 5:2)

**Answer:**

- **Divine Credentials:** This prophecy, written hundreds of years before
  Christ's birth, specifies the exact location (Bethlehem). This validates Jesus
  of Nazareth as the true Messiah.
- **The Deity of Christ:** The text states His goings forth are "from
  everlasting." Jesus did not begin to exist at Bethlehem. He is the eternal Son
  of God who stepped into time and space.
- **Humility:** He chose a "little" town and a humble manger. The King of Glory
  humbled Himself to reach the lowest of humanity.

---

### Q11. In what Old Testament prophecy are the life, suffering, and death of Christ foretold?

In the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah.

**Answer:** Isaiah 53 is often called the "Gospel in the Old Testament."

- **Vicarious Atonement:** The central theme is substitution. "He was wounded
  for _our_ transgressions, he was bruised for _our_ iniquities" (v. 5).
  - **Definition - Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man through the
    sacrifice of Jesus, which satisfies the claims of the law.
- **The Great Exchange:** We give Him our sins; He gives us His righteousness.
  "With his stripes we are healed" (v. 5). This healing includes both the
  forgiveness of sin (Justification) and the power to live a new life
  (Sanctification).
- **Christ's Character:** He is described as a lamb brought to the slaughter,
  yet opening not His mouth (v. 7). This meekness under persecution is the
  character He imparts to His followers.

---

### Q12. Which passage of Scripture foretold the price of Christ's betrayal?

"So they weighed for My price thirty pieces of silver." (Zechariah 11:12)

**Answer:**

- **Precision of Prophecy:** Zechariah predicted the exact amount paid to Judas
  Iscariot (Matthew 26:15).
- **The Price of a Slave:** Thirty pieces of silver was the price of a slave in
  Israel (Exodus 21:32). The Creator of the universe was valued by His own
  people at the price of a common bondservant. This demonstrates the depth of
  His humiliation for our sake.

---

### Q13. Christ's dying words were written a thousand years before His death. Where are they found?

"My God, My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1). "Into Thy hands I
commit My spirit." (Psalm 31:5)

**Answer:**

- **The Experience of Separation:** Psalm 22 depicts the crucifixion with
  graphic detail. When Jesus cried out, "Why hast Thou forsaken me?", He was
  experiencing the second death—the total separation from the Father caused by
  the weight of the world's sin. He felt the wrath of God against sin so we
  wouldn't have to.
- **The Triumph of Faith:** Even in the darkness, when He could not feel the
  Father's presence, He still cried "My God." His final words, quoting Psalm
  31:5, show perfect trust. He died a Conqueror, committing His life into the
  Father's hands.
- **Application:** In our darkest trials, when feelings fail, we must trust the
  Word of God as Jesus did.

---

### Q14. In what passage do the Psalms also foretell Christ's resurrection?

"For Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell; neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy
One to see corruption." (Psalm 16:10)

**Answer:**

- **Hell (Sheol/Hades):** In the Bible, this word often simply means "the
  grave." The prophecy promised that Christ would not remain in the grave long
  enough for his body to decay ("see corruption").
- **The Guarantee of Our Resurrection:** Because Christ conquered the grave, He
  holds the keys of death (Revelation 1:18). His resurrection is the pledge that
  those who sleep in Him will also rise (1 Corinthians 15:20).

---

### Q15. What words does Daniel use to describe Christ's receiving of His kingdom?

"I saw in the night visions, and behold, One like the Son of man came with the
clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him near
before Him. And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom..."
(Daniel 7:13-14)

**Answer:** This is a pivotal prophecy regarding the **Sanctuary** and the
**Judgment**.

- **The Direction of the Coming:** Notice that the Son of Man does not come
  _down_ to the earth here; He goes _up_ to the Ancient of Days (God the Father)
  in heaven.
- **The Investigative Judgment:** This event corresponds to the High Priest
  entering the Most Holy Place. Before Christ returns to earth as King of Kings,
  He enters the presence of the Father to complete the work of
  atonement—blotting out the sins of His people and receiving His kingdom
  (Daniel 7:9-10).
- **The Vindication:** In this judgment, Christ acts as our Advocate. He claims
  those who have overcome by His blood as His subjects. When this work is
  finished, He will receive the Kingdom and return to earth.
- **Practical Thought:** We are living in the time of this judgment. Our only
  safety is to be covered by the righteousness of Christ, so that when our names
  are considered, the Father sees only the perfection of His Son.

### Q16. How does the book of Psalms describe Christ's Second Advent?

"Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together before the
Lord; for He cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall He judge the
world, and the people with equity." (Psalm 98:8-9) "Our God shall come, and
shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very
tempestuous round about Him. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the
earth, that He may judge His people." (Psalm 50:3, 4)

**Answer:**

- **The Literal Return:** The Old Testament does not speak of a secret rapture,
  but of a visible, audible, and glorious coming. "He shall not keep silence."
- **Nature Reacts:** Creation itself, currently groaning under the curse of sin
  (Romans 8:22), rejoices at the coming of the King who will restore all things.
- **Judgment with Righteousness:** He comes to execute the judgment decided in
  the heavenly court (Daniel 7).
- **The Two Harvests:** For the rebellious, His coming is a "devouring fire"
  (glory that consumes sin). For His people, it is the day of final deliverance.
- **The Climax of Scripture:** Just as the Bible begins with God creating a
  perfect world, it ends (through Christ) with God restoring a perfect world.
  The "Seed" of Genesis 3:15 has fully crushed the serpent's head, and the
  controversy is ended.

**[ILL]** When a King returns to his loyal subjects after a long war, the ground
shakes with the marching of his armies and the shouts of victory. To the rebels,
this sound is terror; to the loyal citizens, it is the sweetest music. The Bible
teaches us how to be loyal citizens through faith in Jesus, so that His return
is our "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13).
