### Q1. What assurance is given to every believer in Christ?

**“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” John 3:16.**

**Answer:**
This verse, often called the heart of the Bible, establishes the foundation of the plan of salvation. The assurance given here is absolute: salvation is not based on our human merit or social standing, but on the finished work of God through Jesus Christ.

1.  **The Source of Salvation:** It begins with God’s love ("For God so loved"). The Father is not a harsh judge needing to be appeased by the Son; rather, the Father and Son are one in purpose to save humanity.
2.  **The Gift:** The remedy for sin was an infinite gift. In the sanctuary service of old, an innocent lamb had to die for the guilty sinner. Here, God provides the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29)—His own Son.
3.  **The Condition:** "Whosoever believeth."
    *   **Definition—Faith (Belief):** In the Bible, "believing" is not merely an intellectual agreement that Jesus exists. It is a transaction of the heart where the sinner casts their helpless soul upon Christ, trusting fully in His merits for pardon and His power for cleansing (Acts 16:31).
4.  **The Result:** "Everlasting life." This is not merely endless existence, but a quality of life connected to the Source of all life. It is the restoration of what Adam lost in Eden.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a man trapped in a burning building with no way out. A firefighter breaks through the flames, wraps the man in his own protective gear, and carries him to safety. The man is saved not because he was brave or strong, but because he trusted the firefighter enough to let himself be carried. Similarly, we are perishing in sin; Christ wraps us in His righteousness and carries us to life. Our part is to yield; His part is to save.

### Q2. What wonderful truth is revealed in the gospel message?

**“For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.” Romans 1:17.**

**Answer:**
The "gospel" (Good News) is not just a story about Jesus; it is the vehicle through which the **Righteousness of God** is revealed and given to men.

*   **Righteousness of God:** This is the core of the Righteousness by Faith message. Man has no righteousness of his own (Isaiah 64:6). Therefore, the only righteousness that can save us is God's own righteousness—His perfect character and obedience—which He offers to us.
*   **From Faith to Faith:** The Christian life is a progressive journey. We begin by faith (justification), and we continue to walk and grow by faith (sanctification).
*   **The Just Shall Live by Faith:**
    *   **Justification:** A legal declaration by God that the repentant sinner is accounted righteous because of Christ’s sacrifice.
    *   **Living by Faith:** This speaks of the daily experience. The believer does not obey God *in order* to be saved, but lives a life of obedience *because* they are saved and indwelt by Christ. The life of Jesus is reproduced in the believer by the Holy Spirit.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A deep-sea diver relies entirely on the air line connected to the ship above. As long as the connection remains open, he lives. If he tries to breathe on his own, he dies. "Living by faith" means drawing every breath of spiritual life from Jesus, our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, moment by moment.

### Q3. What was brought to light through the gospel?

**“Who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.” 2 Timothy 1:10.**

**Answer:**
The gospel solves the problem of death. Before the cross, death was an unconquered tyrant. Through Christ’s victory, the nature of death and the hope of immortality are clarified.

1.  **Death Abolished:** Christ has broken the permanent power of death. For the believer, death is now merely a "sleep" (1 Thessalonians 4:13–14) awaiting the resurrection.
2.  **Immortality to Light:** The Bible teaches that humans are mortal. We do not possess natural immortality (1 Timothy 6:16). Immortality is a gift brought to us *only* through the gospel.
3.  **The Exchange:** In the Great Controversy, Satan claimed sin leads to freedom. The gospel reveals that sin leads to death, but Christ brings life.

**Term Definition—Immortality:** The condition of being unable to die. The Bible teaches this is a gift bestowed upon the righteous at the second coming of Christ (1 Corinthians 15:53–54), not a current possession of the soul.

### Q4. How closely are righteousness and life connected?

**“In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.” Proverbs 12:28.**

**Answer:**
Scripture presents an inseparable bond between righteousness (right doing/right being) and life. You cannot have one without the other.

*   **Sin is Self-Destruction:** Sin is, by definition, separation from God, the Source of life. Therefore, the "wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23).
*   **Righteousness is Life:** True righteousness is the life of God in the soul. When a person is justified (declared righteous) and sanctified (made holy), they are reconnected to the life-flow of heaven.
*   **The Pathway:** This suggests a way of living. Righteousness by faith is not just a theory; it is a "pathway." As we walk in obedience to God’s law through the power of the Spirit, we are walking in the path of life.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Consider a train. As long as it stays on the tracks (the pathway of righteousness), it moves forward and functions as designed. If it leaves the tracks, the result is a wreck and ruin (death). The tracks are not a burden to the train; they are the condition of its effective operation and safety.

### Q5. Finding righteousness, what else do we find?

**“He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.” Proverbs 21:21.**

**Answer:**
This verse encourages an active pursuit. "Followeth after" implies hungering and thirsting (Matthew 5:6).

1.  **The Pursuit:** The Christian does not sit idly by. Empowered by grace, we actively seek to reflect Christ’s character ("righteousness") and His compassion ("mercy").
2.  **The Discovery:**
    *   **Life:** Spiritual vitality now and eternal life hereafter.
    *   **Righteousness:** We find what we seek—the very character of Christ becomes our own through the work of the Holy Spirit (imparted righteousness).
    *   **Honour:** Not worldly fame, but the honor of being called "sons of God" (1 John 3:1).

**Term Definition—Imparted Righteousness:** The work of the Holy Spirit *inside* the believer, changing their heart and empowering them to obey God's law. It follows *Imputed Righteousness* (the credit of Christ’s merits).

### Q6. Who alone can give us the grace that leads to eternal life?

**“That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.” Romans 5:21.**

**Answer:**
Only Jesus Christ serves as the channel for this saving grace. This verse presents two opposing kingdoms:

1.  **The Reign of Sin:** Sin is depicted as a tyrant king whose rule results in death. Every human being is naturally born into this kingdom.
2.  **The Reign of Grace:** Grace also reigns like a monarch. It is mightier than sin.
    *   **"Through Righteousness":** Grace does not ignore the law. It does not set aside justice. Instead, grace provides the righteousness the law demands. Christ fulfilled the law for us (life) and paid its penalty for us (death). Now, He offers His victory to us.
3.  **Sanctuary Insight:** In the earthly sanctuary, the mercy seat (grace) was placed *above* the ark containing the Ten Commandments (righteousness). This shows that grace rests upon a foundation of righteousness and leads the believer to keep the law, not break it.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a king pardons a criminal, that is an act of grace. But if the king then adopts the criminal, pays his debts, educates him, and gives him a position in the court, that is "grace reigning." God does not just forgive (pardon); He transforms us to be fit for His kingdom (reign).

### Q7. What do the Psalms declare God's commandments to be?

**“All Thy commandments are righteousness.” Psalms 119:172.**

**Answer:**
This is a crucial definition. If we want to know what "righteousness" looks like in action, we look at God's law (the Ten Commandments).

*   **The Standard:** The law is a transcript of God’s character. Since God is righteous, His law is righteous.
*   **The Impossibility for Man:** Because the law requires perfect righteousness, fallen man cannot keep it in his own strength (Romans 8:7).
*   **The Provision of Christ:** This is why we need Righteousness by Faith. We need Christ (who is the Living Law) to dwell in our hearts. When He enters, He brings the righteousness that the law requires. He fulfills the law in us (Romans 8:4).

---

### Q8. What does Jesus say that those commandments are?

**“And I know that His commandment is life everlasting.” John 12:50.**

**Answer:**
Jesus links the law directly to life. Far from being a burden or a "yoke of bondage," the commandments are the operating instructions for eternal happiness.

*   **Original Design:** In Eden, obedience to God's command was the condition of remaining in the tree of life.
*   **New Covenant:** In the New Covenant, God writes these commandments on the heart (Hebrews 8:10). When the law is internal—loved and obeyed through the Spirit—it results in life everlasting.
*   **Harmony:** You cannot be at war with the Source of Life (God) and expect to have eternal life. Harmony with His will (His commandment) is the very atmosphere of heaven.

### Q9. What does the prophet Jeremiah declare Christ to be?

**“And this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.” Jeremiah 23:6.**

**Answer:**
This represents one of the most powerful titles of Jesus in the Old Testament (*Yahweh Tsidkenu*). It is the summary of the Advent message of Righteousness by Faith.

1.  **Our Deficiency:** We have no righteousness. Our "best" deeds are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).
2.  **His Sufficiency:** He is the LORD (divine, infinite). He is Righteousness (perfect).
3.  **The Exchange:** He does not keep this righteousness to Himself; He becomes *OUR* righteousness.
    *   He takes our sin (at the cross).
    *   He gives us His righteousness (by faith).
    *   When the Father looks at the believing sinner in the judgment, He sees the perfect life of His Son.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A pauper is invited to a royal wedding but has only dirty rags. The Prince takes off His own royal robe and places it on the pauper. The pauper is now dressed suitably for the king's presence. The robe is not the pauper's weave; it is the Prince's. This is Christ covering us with His character.

### Q10. What did Christ tell us was essential to eternal life?

**“I am the way, the truth, and the life.” John 14:6.**

**Answer:**
Christ does not merely *teach* the way; He *is* the way. He does not just *tell* the truth; He *is* the truth. He does not just *give* life; He *is* the life.

*   **Exclusivity:** "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." There is no other ladder to heaven. Good works, philosophy, or ancestry cannot bridge the gap caused by sin.
*   **Personhood:** Christianity is a relationship with a Person. Righteousness is not an abstract concept; it is the presence of Jesus in the life. To possess Christ is to possess life (1 John 5:12).

### Q11. How do we receive righteousness?

**“And He said unto him, Why callest thou Me good? there is none good but One, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” Matthew 19:17.**

**Answer:**
At first glance, this answer seems to contradict salvation by faith. But Jesus was leading the rich young ruler to a deeper realization.

1.  **The Standard:** Jesus upholds the law: "Keep the commandments." The requirement for entering life has never changed—it is perfect obedience to God's law. God cannot lower His standard of righteousness to accommodate our sin.
2.  **The Problem:** The young man thought he had kept them (v. 20), but he lacked the love of God (v. 21). He was legally "correct" but spiritually dead.
3.  **The Solution (Received by Faith):** Since we have all sinned and cannot keep the commandments perfectly on our own, we must receive the "One who is good"—God in the flesh, Jesus Christ.
    *   We receive righteousness by receiving Him.
    *   When we receive Him by faith, His Spirit empowers us to truly "keep the commandments"—not just outwardly, but from a heart of love (Romans 13:10).

**Term Definition—Sanctification:** The process of being made holy. It is the result of Christ living out His life of obedience in the believer. We "keep" the law because the Lawgiver lives in us.

### Q12. How do we receive eternal life?

**“For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.” Romans 5:17.**

**Answer:**
This verse emphasizes that salvation is a transaction of **receiving**, not earning.

*   **The Two Adams:** Adam's sin ("one man's offence") brought death to all. Christ (the second Adam) brings life to all who receive Him.
*   **Receiving the Gift:** Note the phrasing—"the gift of righteousness." Righteousness is a gift we accept. We cannot manufacture it.
*   **Abundance of Grace:** God does not give just enough grace to barely scrape by; He gives an "abundance." This grace is sufficient to overcome every cultivated tendency to sin and to "reign in life" over the power of the enemy.
*   **Reigning:** We are not just survivors; we are made kings and priests. Victory over sin is promised to those who receive this gift.

### Q13. How do we obtain eternal life?

**"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." Romans 6:23.**

**Answer:**
The contrast is stark: Sin pays a wage (death), but God offers a gift (life).

1.  **The Wages:** A wage is something you earn; it is what you deserve. We have earned death by our rebellion.
2.  **The Gift:** Eternal life is unearned. It comes "through Jesus Christ our Lord." It flows from the cross where He paid the wage of sin for us.
3.  **The Experience of Transformation:** As the outline's closing quote explains, this gift changes us.
    *   **The Drawing:** Jesus said, "And I, if I be lifted up... will draw all men unto me" (John 12:32). The cross is the magnet.
    *   **Repentance:** We do not repent *in order* for God to love us; we repent because we see His love. The goodness of God leads to repentance (Romans 2:4).
    *   **Conviction:** As we look at the cross, we realize what sin did to the innocent Son of God. This breaks the heart. We see the law (the standard) and the cross (the remedy).
    *   **Reformation:** This produces true reformation—not a forced change of habits to earn heaven, but a change of heart motivated by love for the One who died for us.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A child rebels against a loving father and breaks a valuable heirloom. He expects punishment (wages). Instead, the father pays for the damage himself and embraces the child (gift). The child’s heart melts. He no longer wants to rebel; he wants to please the father who showed such mercy. This is how the "gift of God" produces a righteous life.

> **Note from "Happiness Digest" (Steps to Christ):**
> "Christ must be revealed to the sinner as the Saviour dying for the sins of the world... As the sinner beholds this love, it softens the heart, impresses the mind, and inspires contrition in the soul... They begin to comprehend something of the righteousness of Christ, and exclaim, What is sin, that it should require such a sacrifice...?"
>
> This confirms that our journey to righteousness begins with a vision of the Cross. We look, we believe, we receive, and we live.
