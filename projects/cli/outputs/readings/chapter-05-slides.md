## Slide 1 – Title Slide

# Christ in All the Bible
### Unveiling the Central Theme of Scripture

***

## Slide 2 – Introduction

- **The Central Theme:** The Bible is more than moral codes or history; it is a revelation of a Person.
- **The Great Controversy:** From Eden to Revelation, the story focuses on the conflict between good and evil.
- **The Solution:** The work of Jesus Christ to redeem a lost race.

***

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Testimony of Scripture

- **Question:** Of whom does Christ Himself tell us that the Scriptures speak about?
- **Key Text:** John 5:39 – “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.”

***

## Slide 4 – Q1: Key Points

- **Map vs. Treasure:** The Scriptures are the map, but Christ is the treasure.
- **Purpose of the Word:**
  - Given to reveal God’s character and the plan of salvation.
  - Every ceremony, genealogy, and prophecy finds fulfillment in Jesus.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We do not search Scriptures to prove we are good (legalism).
  - We search them to find the Savior who provides the righteousness we lack.
  - Eternal life is knowing the Person the book reveals (John 17:3 – “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”).

***

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Love Letter:**
  - Imagine a man receiving a love letter and a photo from his betrothed.
  - If he studies the ink and grammar but refuses to look at the photo or prepare for the wedding, he misses the point.
- **Application:**
  - The Bible is God’s love letter.
  - Its primary purpose is to introduce us to the Author.

***

## Slide 6 – Q2: Moses and the Prophets

- **Question:** About whom did Moses and the Old Testament prophets write?
- **Key Text:** John 1:45 – “Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”

***

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points

- **The Gospel in Anticipation:** The Old Testament is not a separate religion; it points to the New.
- **Moses and the Law:**
  - **Moral Law:** Reveals Christ’s perfect character (Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”).
  - **Ceremonial Law:** The sacrificial system revealed Christ as the Lamb of God (John 1:29 – “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”).
- **One Plan of Salvation:**
  - Old Testament believers were saved by faith in the coming Messiah.
  - They looked forward to the Cross; we look back to it.

***

## Slide 8 – Q3: Prophecy of Suffering

- **Question:** Who revealed beforehand the death and resurrection of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Luke 24:25, 26 – “O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory?”

***

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **The Necessity of Suffering:**
  - Sin has a cost: “The wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23).
  - For God to be just while justifying the sinner, the penalty had to be paid.
- **The Pattern:**
  - The prophets revealed the Messiah would be a Suffering Servant before being a Conquering King.
  - The path to glory is through self-denial.
- **Application:**
  - We must guard against desiring a religion of power and prestige while rejecting the religion that crucifies pride and sin.

***

## Slide 10 – Q4: Christ in All Scripture

- **Question:** Does all of Scripture tell us about Jesus?
- **Key Text:** Luke 24:27 – “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.”

***

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points & Sanctuary Connection

- **The Key to Interpretation:** We must view history, Psalms, and services through the lens of Christ’s mission.
- **Christ in the Doctrines:**
  - **Law:** He is our Righteousness.
  - **History:** He is the Deliverer.
  - **Prophecy:** He is the Coming King.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The Levitical system was an object lesson.
  - **Outer Court:** Represents His death on earth.
  - **Holy Places:** Represents His intercession in heaven.

***

## Slide 12 – Q5: The First Promise

- **Question:** Where in the Bible is the first promise of the Redeemer?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 3:14, 15 – “And the Lord God said unto the serpent, I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”

***

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Protoevangelium (First Gospel):**
  - **Enmity as Grace:** Humans are naturally captives to sin. God puts "enmity" (hatred of sin) in our hearts by His Spirit.
  - **The Seed:** Refers specifically to Jesus Christ (Galatians 4:4).
- **The Conflict:**
  - **Bruised Heel:** Satan would cause Christ’s physical suffering and death.
  - **Crushed Head:** Christ’s death guarantees Satan’s defeat and the destruction of sin.
- **Victory:** Christ wins the victory and implants it in the believer.

***

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Dungeon Liberator:**
  - Imagine a prisoner chained to a tyrant, accustomed to the darkness.
  - A Liberator enters—not just to unlock the door, but to change the prisoner's heart.
  - The prisoner now hates the chains he once loved.
- **Lesson:** This "enmity" against our chains (sin) is the first step of freedom.

***

## Slide 15 – Q6: Promise to Abraham

- **Question:** In what words was this great truth explained to Abraham?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 22:18 – “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.”

***

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points

- **Universal Gospel:** Abraham was chosen to be a channel of blessing for *all* nations.
- **Justification by Faith:**
  - Abraham believed God, and it was counted as righteousness (Genesis 15:6 – “And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.”).
- **Nature of the Blessing:**
  - Not merely material wealth.
  - The turning away of “every one of you from his iniquities” (Acts 3:26 – “Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.”).

***

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Identity of the Seed

- **Question:** To whom did this promised seed refer?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:16 – “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.”

***

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Union with Christ)

- **One Way of Salvation:** Salvation is found in one Person: Jesus Christ.
- **Union with Christ:**
  - We become "Abraham's seed" by being baptized *into* Christ (Galatians 3:29 – “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.”).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We do not inherit promises by genealogy or personal performance.
  - When we are in Him, His history becomes our history; His obedience is credited as ours.

***

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Guide of Israel

- **Question:** Whom did God promise would especially guide Israel to the Promised Land?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 23:20 – “Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.”

***

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

  - God said, “My name is in him” (Exodus 23:21).
  - This is the pre-incarnate Christ, the “Messenger of the Covenant.”
- **Continuous Care:**
  - Jesus led Israel through the wilderness.
  - He continues to lead His church today toward the heavenly Canaan.
- **Keeping us in the Way:** He guides us in the path of obedience and faith.

***

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Spiritual Rock

- **Question:** Who was the Rock that went with them?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 10:4 – “And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.”

***

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points

- **Source of Life:**
  - The rock was smitten (Exodus 17:6) to provide water.
  - Christ was smitten (Isaiah 53:4) so the water of life could flow to sinners.
- **Spiritual Sustenance:**
  - **Sanctification:** Drinking represents the daily intake of Christ’s Spirit.
  - This sustains our spiritual life against temptation.

***

## Slide 23 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Diver’s Air Line:**
  - A diver deep in the ocean relies entirely on the air line connected to the surface.
  - If the line is cut, life ends.
- **Lesson:**
  - We live in the "deep waters" of a sinful world.
  - Christ is the Rock; faith is the air line through which His life flows to us moment by moment.

***

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Birthplace Prophecy

- **Question:** Where was the promised Saviour to be born?
- **Key Text:** Micah 5:2 – “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be Ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.”

***

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points

- **Divine Credentials:** The prophecy specified the exact location (Bethlehem) hundreds of years in advance.
- **Deity of Christ:**
  - His goings forth are “from everlasting.”
  - Jesus is the eternal Son of God who entered time and space.
- **Humility:** The King of Glory chose a “little” town and a manger to reach the lowest of humanity.

***

## Slide 26 – Q11: Prophecy of Suffering

- **Question:** In what Old Testament prophecy are the life, suffering, and death of Christ foretold?
- **Answer Reference:** In the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah.
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 53:5 – “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.”

***

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points (The Great Exchange)

- **Vicarious Atonement:**
  - Christ took our place.
  - **Atonement:** Reconciliation of God and man through Jesus, satisfying the law.
- **The Great Exchange:**
  - We give Him our sins; He gives us His righteousness.
  - “With his stripes we are healed” includes forgiveness (Justification) and power for a new life (Sanctification).
- **Character:** He was like a lamb, meek under persecution (Isaiah 53:7).

***

## Slide 28 – Q12: The Betrayal Price

- **Question:** Which passage of Scripture foretold the price of Christ's betrayal?
- **Key Text:** Zechariah 11:12 – “So they weighed for My price thirty pieces of silver.”

***

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points

- **Precision of Prophecy:** The exact amount paid to Judas was predicted (Matthew 26:15).
- **The Price of a Slave:**
  - Thirty pieces of silver was the value of a bondservant (Exodus 21:32).
  - The Creator was valued by His people at the price of a common slave.
  - This demonstrates the depth of His humiliation for us.

***

***

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Experience of Separation:**
  - Jesus experienced the "second death"—total separation from the Father due to the world's sin.
  - He bore the wrath of God so we wouldn't have to.
- **The Triumph of Faith:**
  - Even without feeling the Father’s presence, He cried “*My* God.”
  - He died a Conqueror, entrusting His life to the Father.
- **Application:** In darkness, we must trust the Word of God, not our feelings.

***

## Slide 32 – Q14: Resurrection Prophecy

- **Question:** In what passage do the Psalms also foretell Christ's resurrection?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 16:10 – “For Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell; neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption.”

***

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points

- **Hell (Sheol):** In this context, it refers to the grave.
- **Victory Over Decay:** Christ would not remain in the grave long enough for His body to decay.
- **Our Guarantee:**

***

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points (Sanctuary & Judgment)

- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - corresponds to the High Priest entering the Most Holy Place.
  - Christ blots out sins and receives His kingdom before returning.
- **Advocacy:**
  - Christ claims His people by His blood.
  - **Safety:** We must be covered by His righteousness so the Father sees only the perfection of the Son.

***

## Slide 36 – Q16: The Second Advent

- **Question:** How does the book of Psalms describe Christ's Second Advent?
- **Key Text 1:** Psalm 98:9 – “...for He cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall He judge the world, and the people with equity.”
- **Key Text 2:** Psalm 50:3 – “Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him.”

***

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points

- **Literal Return:** Not a secret rapture, but visible and audible (“shall not keep silence”).
- **Creation Reacts:** Nature rejoices at the coming King who restores all things.
- **Two Harvests:**
  - For the rebellious: A devouring fire (glory consuming sin).
  - For the loyal: The day of final deliverance.
- **Conclusion:** The "Seed" has crushed the serpent's head; the controversy ends.

***

## Slide 38 – Q16: Illustration

- **The King Returns:**
  - When a King returns after a long war, the ground shakes with marching armies.
  - To rebels, the sound is terror.
  - To loyal citizens, it is sweet music.
