## Slide 1 – Q1: Judgment Begins

- Question: Regarding the wicked, what question does Peter ask?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 4:17 – “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the
  house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that
  obey not the gospel of God?”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Investigative Judgment)

- The verse establishes a sequence in the divine plan: Judgment begins with the
  “house of God.”
- This refers to the Investigative Judgment where records are reviewed before
  the Second Coming (Daniel 7:9–10 – “I beheld till the thrones were cast down,
  and the Ancient of days did sit... the judgment was set, and the books were
  opened.”).
- The “gospel of God” is more than a theory; it is the power of God to save and
  transform (Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it
  is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth...” on to the
  Jew first, and also to the Greek.”).
- True faith brings the life into harmony with God’s law through the Spirit;
  those who reject this power have no hope in the judgment.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- Imagine a raging forest fire approaching a town.
- The only safety is inside a special fireproof shelter constructed by a master
  engineer.
- Those inside (the “house of God”) must diligently ensure the doors are sealed
  and instructions followed.
- If those inside are saved only by strictly following the shelter’s provision,
  what hope is there for the man standing outside, mocking the fire?
- He has no protection against the consuming element.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Wages of Sin

- Question: What does Paul say is the wages of sin?
- Key Text: Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is
  eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- Supporting Text: Ezekiel 18:4 – “Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of
  the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it
  shall die.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Wages vs. Gift)

- **Wages:** Something earned. A debt paid for work performed.
- The sinner works for self and Satan; the inevitable payout for this work is
  separation from God.
- God is the only Fountain of Life (Psalm 36:9 – “For with thee is the fountain
  of life: in thy light shall we see light.”).
- To separate from the Source is to die—not to live eternally in misery, but to
  cease to be.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We have no life in ourselves; we only have life by
  abiding in Christ (1 John 5:12 – “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that
  hath not the Son of God hath not life.”).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- If an employee works faithfully for a month, the employer owes them a
  paycheck.
- This payment is not a gift; it is a wage—a rightful earning.
- Similarly, the sinner earns their “paycheck” through a life of sin.
- The payment is death. God does not inflict it arbitrarily; it is the natural
  payout of the work performed.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Character of the Punishment

- Question: What will be the character of this death?
- Key Text: 2 Thessalonians 1:9 – “Who shall be punished with everlasting
  destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Destruction, Not Torment)

- The punishment is not everlasting _tormenting_, but everlasting _destruction_.
- **Duration:** The _effect_ is eternal. The destruction is final and
  irreversible.
- **Source:** It comes “from the presence of the Lord.” God is a consuming fire
  to sin (Hebrews 12:29 – “For our God is a consuming fire.”).
- **Nature:** God destroys both soul and body (Matthew 10:28 – “And fear not
  them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear
  him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”).
- Only God possesses immortality (1 Timothy 6:16 – “Who only hath immortality,
  dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto...”); man receives it
  only as a gift.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- If a house is destroyed by fire, it turns to ash.
- The fire eventually goes out once the fuel is consumed, but the destruction is
  “everlasting.”
- The house never comes back; it is gone forever.
- So it is with the wicked: they are not preserved in the fire, they are
  consumed by it.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Repent or Perish

- Question: What does the Saviour say will befall those who do not repent?
- Key Text: Luke 13:3 – “I tell you, Nay; but, except ye repent, ye shall all
  likewise perish.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Life or Death)

- Jesus draws a line: Repentance or Perishing. There is no middle ground.
- **Repentance:** A change of mind and yielding of the will to God (Acts 3:19 –
  “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out...”
  ).
- **Perish:** To be blotted from existence.
- God’s love offers an escape from perishing (John 3:16 – “For God so loved the
  world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
  should not perish, but have everlasting life.”).
- The choice is Life or Death, not Life in Bliss vs. Life in Pain.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- A man is drifting in a boat toward a massive waterfall.
- A rescue rope is thrown (the Gospel).
- If he grabs it, he is pulled to safety (Repentance/Faith).
- If he ignores it, he goes over the edge.
- He does not fall forever; he hits the bottom and is destroyed.

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Condition of Perishing

- Question: In what condition does the apostle say they shall thus perish?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 2:12 – “But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken
  and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall
  utterly perish in their own corruption.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Natural Corruption)

- Peter compares the end of the wicked to “natural brute beasts” which cease to
  exist at death.
- **Corruption:** Sin is self-destructive. Without Christ, man is left with
  nothing but decay.
- **Sanctification:** We must partake of the “divine nature” to escape
  corruption (2 Peter 1:4 – “...that by these ye might be partakers of the
  divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through
  lust.”).
- The “natural man” cannot inherit the kingdom of God; he perishes in his own
  corruption.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Comparison to the Sanctuary

- Question: To what are the wicked in their punishment compared?
- Key Text: Psalm 37:20 – “But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the
  LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they
  consume away.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Smoke and Sacrifice)

- The Psalmist uses imagery from the **Sanctuary service**.
- **Fat of Lambs:** In the sacrifice, the fat was burned on the altar until it
  was consumed.
- **Into Smoke:** It turned into smoke and vanished. It did not burn forever.
- This imagery refutes the idea of eternal conscious torment.
- The fire does its work of purification, leaving nothing but clean air.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration

- Watch a candle flame burn down.
- When the wax (the fat) is all gone, the flame flickers and dies.
- The smoke rises and disappears.
- You cannot gather that smoke back together to make a candle; it is consumed
  away.
- This is the Bible’s illustration of the end of sin.

## Slide 18 – Q7: The Result

- Question: What will be the results of this punishment?
- Key Text: Proverbs 10:25 – “As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no
  more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points (No More)

- The result is total non-existence: “the wicked is no more.”
- **The Contrast:** The righteous are established on an “everlasting
  foundation”—Christ (1 Corinthians 3:11 – “For other foundation can no man lay
  than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”).
- Because the righteous are built on Him, they share His eternity.
- The wicked built on self (sand), and the storm of judgment sweeps them away
  entirely.

## Slide 20 – Q8: Root and Branch

- Question: Will any part of them be left?
- Key Text: Malachi 4:1 – “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an
  oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and
  the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall
  leave them neither root nor branch.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points (Complete Eradication)

- **Burn as an Oven:** The earth itself becomes the furnace.
- **Stubble:** Dry straw flashes up and turns to ash instantly; it does not burn
  for ages.
- **Root and Branch:**
  - The Root: Satan (the originator).
  - The Branches: His followers (evil angels and humans).
- This signifies the complete removal of sin from the universe.
- Affliction shall not rise a second time (Nahum 1:9 – “What do ye imagine
  against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the
  second time.”).

## Slide 22 – Q9: Their Condition

- Question: What will then be their condition?
- Key Text: Obadiah 1:16 – “For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall
  all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall
  swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (As Though They Had Not Been)

- This describes total erasure: “as though they had not been.”
- If they were in eternal torture, they would very much “be.”
- They are wiped from the universe’s memory, except as a lesson on the tragedy
  of sin.
- **God’s Mercy:** It would be cruel to force beings who hate God to exist
  forever in a universe filled with His glory.
- Returning to nothingness is the just and merciful end for those who reject
  Life.

## Slide 24 – Q9: Illustration

- Think of a bad dream.
- While you are in it, it seems real and terrifying.
- When you wake up, it fades; soon it is as though it never happened.
- The nightmare of sin will be over, and the universe will wake up to eternal
  peace.

## Slide 25 – Q10: The Place of the Wicked

- Question: Where will the place of the wicked then be?
- Key Text: Psalm 37:10 – “For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be:
  yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points (The Place is Gone)

- The Psalmist invites us to search for the sinner’s “place.”
- The result: “It shall not be.”
- If hell were a permanent burning dungeon, it would be a “place.” But the Bible
  says the place itself is gone.
- **Sanctuary Truth:** The scapegoat (Satan) is sent away, and the camp is
  cleansed. The “place” of sin is purified by fire.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Location of Recompense

- Question: Where will they receive their recompense, death, which is the wages
  of sin?
- Key Text: Proverbs 11:31 – “Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the
  earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points (In the Earth)

- Hell is not a subterranean cavern or a distant spiritual dimension existing
  right now.
- The wicked are punished **“in the earth.”**
- This happens at the end of the world.
- The righteous inherit the earth made new; the wicked meet their fate on this
  earth as it is purified.

## Slide 29 – Q12: Fire from Heaven

- Question: How is this accomplished?
- Key Text: Revelation 20:9 – “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and
  compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came
  down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points (Devoured)

- This occurs after the millennium (1,000 years).
- **The Fire:** It comes down _from God out of heaven_. It is an executive
  judgment, not a permanent location.
- **The Result:** It **“devoured”** them.
- To devour means to consume completely.
- This is God’s “strange act” (Isaiah 28:21) to cleanse the universe, just as He
  once cleansed it with water.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Timing of Punishment

- Question: Do the wicked go directly to this punishment at death? If not, when
  do they receive it?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 2:9 – “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
  temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
  punished.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points (Reserved for Judgment)

- The wicked are currently **“reserved”** (held in custody) in the grave.
- **Justice:** God, the righteous Judge, does not punish before the Judgment.
- All who have died are sleeping until the resurrection—either to life or to
  damnation (John 5:28-29 – “...all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
  And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life;
  and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.”).

## Slide 33 – Q13: Illustration

- If a man commits a crime, he is held in a jail cell (reserved) until his court
  date.
- He is not sent to the penitentiary until the judge bangs the gavel and issues
  the sentence.
- So it is with God’s judgment: death is a sleep until the final sentence is
  executed.

## Slide 34 – Q14: The Earth Reserved

- Question: The earth, the sinner's "place," has been cursed with sin. To what
  is that reserved?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 3:7 – “But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the
  same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment
  and perdition of ungodly men.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: Key Points (The Lake of Fire)

- The earth itself is “kept in store” for fire.
- This earth, when wrapped in the cleansing flames of God, _is_ the lake of
  fire.
- **Perdition:** Means “destruction” or “ruin.”
- The fire brings about the final ruin of ungodly men and purifies the elements
  from the curse of sin.

## Slide 36 – Q15: Effect on the Earth

- Question: What will be the result of this fire on the earth?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 3:12 – “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day
  of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements
  shall melt with fervent heat?”

## Slide 37 – Q15: Key Points (Dissolved)

- **Dissolved:** The very structure of the cursed earth is broken down.
- **Fervent Heat:** Ensures no trace of the curse or man’s pride remains.
- **Application:** We cannot cling to this world.
- “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world” (1 John 2:15).
- If we love the world, we perish with it. If we love Christ, we have a treasure
  fire cannot touch.

## Slide 38 – Q16: The Furnace

- Question: What does our Saviour call the earth when in this condition?
- Key Text: Matthew 13:41-42 – “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and
  they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do
  iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire...”

## Slide 39 – Q16: Key Points (Purification)

- Jesus calls the earth a **“furnace of fire.”**
- **Gathering Out:** The wicked are removed so the kingdom may be pure.
- **Things that Offend:** Not just people, but sin, habits, and rebellion are
  destroyed.
- A furnace is used to purify metal; here, the dross of sin is burned away so
  the pure gold of the New Earth remains.

## Slide 40 – Q17: The New Earth

- Question: After the burning of the earth, what is to come?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 3:13 – “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for
  new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”

## Slide 41 – Q17: Key Points (Wherein Dwelleth Righteousness)

- **New Earth:** From the ashes, God re-creates a perfect home.
- **Righteousness:** No sin, rebel, or tempter will ever enter there.
- **Sanctification:** To dwell there, we must value righteousness _now_.
- Through faith in Jesus, His righteousness is imputed for our title to heaven,
  and imparted for our fitness to live there.

## Slide 42 – Q17: Illustration

- A grand old mansion has become infested with a deadly mold and rot that cannot
  be scrubbed out.
- The owner burns it down to the foundation and builds a brand new, perfect home
  on the same site.
- The old rot is gone forever; the new home is spotless.

## Slide 43 – Q18: The Righteous Shine

- Question: But where will the righteous then be found?
- Key Text: Matthew 13:43 – “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in
  the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.”

## Slide 44 – Q18: Key Points (Glorification)

- While the wicked are reduced to ashes, the righteous “shine forth.”
- This refers to the glorified bodies of the saints, reflecting Jesus’ image.
- **Victory:** The Great Controversy is ended.
- God’s people are vindicated, not by their own works, but because they are
  found in Christ.

## Slide 45 – Q19: The Inheritance

- Question: What promise of the Saviour's will at that time be verified?
- Key Text: Matthew 5:5 – “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the
  earth.”

## Slide 46 – Q19: Key Points (The Meek)

- **The Meek:** Those who have submitted their will to God and accepted the
  righteousness of Christ.
- **Inherit the Earth:** Not the old, sin-cursed earth, but the New Earth.
- The wicked schemed to possess the earth through power, but lose everything.
- The meek, who gave up all for Christ, receive the earth as an eternal
  inheritance.

## Slide 47 – Q20: The Universal Song

- Question: What universal song will be sung?
- Key Text: Revelation 5:13 – “And every creature which is in heaven, and on the
  earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in
  them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him
  that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.”

## Slide 48 – Q20: Key Points (A Clean Universe)

- **Every Creature:** Every conscious being left in the universe joins this
  song.
- If the wicked were in eternal torture, they would be screaming, not singing
  “Blessing and honor.”
- The fact that _every_ voice joins in proves the wicked are “as though they had
  not been.”
- Sin is gone. Only love and loyalty remain.
- “Affliction shall not rise up the second time” (Nahum 1:9). God is All in All.
