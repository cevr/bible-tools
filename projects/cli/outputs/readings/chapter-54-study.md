### Q1. Describe the first beast of Revelation 13.
"And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion." Revelation 13:2.

**Answer:**
The symbolism here is deep and historically significant, pointing us back to the prophecies given to Daniel.

1.  **A Composite Power:** In Daniel 7, four distinct beasts rose from the sea: a **lion** (Babylon), a **bear** (Medo-Persia), a **leopard** (Greece), and a fourth "dreadful" beast (Pagan Rome). The beast John sees in Revelation 13 is a composite of these previous empires. It possesses the body of the leopard, the feet of the bear, and the mouth of the lion.
2.  **Historical Identity:** This beast represents the **Papacy** (the system of ecclesiastical Rome). Just as the Roman Empire absorbed the territories of Babylon, Persia, and Greece, the Papacy absorbed their spiritual characteristics:
    *   *The Lion (Babylon):* Sun worship and a system of "mysteries" claiming to bridge heaven and earth.
    *   *The Bear (Medo-Persia):* The unchangeable nature of its decrees (infallibility) and the use of state power to enforce religion.
    *   *The Leopard (Greece):* The incorporation of Greek philosophy (Platonism) into Christian doctrine, changing the view of the soul and the nature of God.
3.  **The Dragon’s Seat:** Verse 2 continues, "and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority." While the dragon primarily represents Satan (Revelation 12:9), historically it represents Pagan Rome. The Papacy stepped into the power vacuum left when the Roman capital moved to Constantinople, taking the "seat" of the Caesars.

**Sanctuary Insight:** The earthly sanctuary had specific articles of furniture representing Christ's ministry. This "beast" system creates a counterfeit sanctuary: an earthly priesthood, an earthly sacrifice (the mass), and human forgiveness, obscuring Christ’s work in the heavenly sanctuary.

**[ILL] The Family Portrait:** Imagine a child who has the eyes of their grandfather, the nose of their grandmother, and the chin of their father. To know the child's nature, you look at the ancestors. Similarly, to understand the Papacy, one must look at the pagan empires that preceded it. It carries the "DNA" of Babylon (idolatry), Persia (legalism), and Greece (intellectualism), all dressed in Christian garb.

### Q2. From what was the papacy developed?
“Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition." 2 Thessalonians 2:3.

**Answer:**
The Papacy was not an external enemy that conquered the church; it was an internal corruption that grew out of it.

1.  **The Falling Away (Apostasy):** The Greek word is *apostasia*, meaning a defection or revolt. The apostle Paul warned that before Christ returned, there would be a massive departure from the simplicity of the gospel within the visible church.
2.  **The Mystery of Iniquity:** Paul stated this mystery was "already at work" in his day (2 Thessalonians 2:7). It began with the desire for preeminence among leaders and a drift from justification by faith to justification by works and ceremonies.
3.  **The Man of Sin:** This title parallels "the son of perdition," a title used elsewhere only for Judas Iscariot (John 17:12). Like Judas, this system sits *among* the disciples, claims to kiss Christ, but betrays Him for worldly power.

**Righteousness by Faith:** A "falling away" always begins in the individual heart when we lose hold of Christ. When faith in the sufficient merit of Jesus weakens, we inevitably turn to human rules, penances, and hierarchies to feel secure. True religion is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27); the "falling away" replaces this internal life with external forms.

**[ILL] The Slow Leak:** If a ship is hit by a torpedo, the danger is obvious. But if a ship has a slow, hidden leak, the water rises imperceptibly until the vessel is swamped. The "falling away" was not a sudden attack, but a slow leak of worldliness and compromise that eventually submerged the truth of the gospel.

---

### Q3. In what was shown the first tangible evidence of "falling away" from the truth of God?
The adoption of heathen rites and customs. "The bishops augmented the number of religious rites in the Christian worship, by way of accommodation to the infirmities and prejudices, both of Jews and heathens, in order to facilitate their conversion to Christianity... For this purpose, they gave the name of mysteries to the institutions of the gospel, and decorated particularly the holy sacrament with that solemn title. They used in that sacred institution, as also in that of baptism, several of the terms employed in the heathen mysteries, and proceeded so far, at length, as even to adopt some of the ceremonies of which those renowned mysteries consisted." Maclaine's Mosheim, cent. 2, part 2, chap. 4, paragraphs 2, 5.

**Answer:**
The evidence of apostasy was **syncretism**—the blending of truth and error.

1.  **Accommodation:** The church leaders believed they could win pagans by making Christianity look more like paganism. They adopted the robes, incense, processions, and terminology of the heathen cults, giving them Christian names.
2.  **Loss of Power:** When the church possessed the Spirit of God (Acts 2), she needed no theatrical rites to convert souls; the Word cut to the heart. As the Spirit's power faded (due to compromise), she increased the elaborate ceremonies to compensate.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith vs. Ritualism:** The gospel is simple: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved" (Acts 16:31). The carnal mind, however, loves ritual because it allows a person to *do* something to earn merit. The introduction of these "mysteries" shifted the focus from faith in Christ's finished work to participation in church ceremonies.

**Definition - Syncretism:** The amalgamation or attempted union of different religions, cultures, or schools of thought. In this context, mixing the holy with the profane.

**[ILL] The Diluted Medicine:** Imagine a doctor has a cure that is bitter but life-saving. To make it popular, he mixes it with so much sugar water that the chemical properties are neutralized. The patients drink it gladly, but they do not get well. The early church diluted the "bitter" pill of self-denial and repentance with the "sugar" of pagan pageantry.

### Q4. How early was this tendency manifested?
“This imitation began in the eastern provinces; but, after the time of Adrian [emperor from 117-138 A.D.] , who first introduced the mysteries among the Latin's, it was followed by the Christians who dwelt in the western parts of the empire." Ibid., para. 5.

**Answer:**
This corruption began startlingly early—almost immediately after the death of the last apostles.

1.  **The Second Century:** This quote places the shift between 117-138 A.D. This confirms Paul's warning to the Ephesian elders: "For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock" (Acts 20:29).
2.  **Tradition vs. Scripture:** This historical fact warns us against trusting "Early Church Tradition" as an infallible guide. The oldest traditions may simply be the oldest apostasies. We must test all things by the Bible alone (Isaiah 8:20), not by the practices of the second or third centuries.

**[ILL] The River Source:** If you want pure water, you must go to the spring (the Bible), not miles downriver where tributaries of mud and pollution (tradition) have flowed in.

### Q5. What has been the great characteristic of the papacy?
A union of church and state, or a religious power dominating the civil power to further its own ends.

**Answer:**
The defining mark of the Papacy is the use of **civil force** to achieve **religious goals**.

1.  **Two Separate Kingdoms:** Jesus taught, "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matthew 22:21). The Papacy obliterates this line, claiming authority over both the conscience (God's domain) and the sword (Caesar's domain).
2.  **The Principle of Force:** God's government is based on love and free choice. "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" (Revelation 22:17). The Dragon's government is based on force and coercion. When the church uses the state to punish heresy or enforce dogma, she leaves the spirit of Christ and adopts the spirit of the beast.
3.  **Sanctification Connection:** True obedience springs from a heart renewed by grace (Ezekiel 36:26). Forced obedience is merely hypocrisy. A state-enforced religion can make men hypocrites, but it cannot make them Christians.

**[ILL] The Marriage of Convenience:** Oil and water do not mix unless you force them into an emulsion, which eventually breaks down. The Church (spiritual) and the State (political) operate on different principles. When married, the Church does not purify the State; the State corrupts the Church, and the offspring is tyranny.

---

### Q6. When was the union of church and state formed, from which the papacy grew?
In the reign of Constantine, 312-337 A.D.

**Answer:**
The reign of Constantine was the turning point where the persecuted church became the persecuting church.

1.  **The Great Compromise:** Constantine supposedly converted to Christianity, but he remained the *Pontifex Maximus* (High Priest) of the pagan state religion. He brought the wealth and power of the empire into the church.
2.  **The Exchange:** The church gained tax exemptions, magnificent buildings, and political prestige. In exchange, she allowed the Emperor to preside over church councils and influence doctrine. This created the "Imperial Church," which evolved into the Papacy.

---

### Q7. What was the condition and work of most of the bishops at that time?
“Worldly minded bishops, instead of caring for the salvation of their flocks, were often but too much inclined to travel about, and entangle themselves in worldly concerns." Neander's History of the Christian Religion and Church, translated by Prof. Torrey, vol. 2, page 16.

**Answer:**
The clergy had shifted their focus from **spiritual shepherding** to **political maneuvering**.

1.  **The Hireling Spirit:** Jesus warned of the "hireling" whose heart is not with the sheep (John 10:12-13). When leadership becomes a path to political power rather than a call to sacrificial service, corruption follows.
2.  **Practical Application:** This is a warning for us today. When we become more concerned with church politics, titles, and administrative power than with the "weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith" (Matthew 23:23), we walk in the footsteps of these fallen bishops.
3.  **The Contrast:** The true Minister (Christ) "made himself of no reputation" (Philippians 2:7). The false ministers sought the reputation and power of the state.

---

### Q8. What did the bishops determine to do?
“This theocratical theory was already the prevailing one in the time of Constantine; and... the bishops voluntarily made themselves dependent on him by their disputes, and by their determination to make use of the power of the state for the furtherance of their alms." Ibid., page 132.
NOTE. - The "theocratical theory" was that of a government administered by the direct power of God.

**Answer:**
The bishops attempted to build the Kingdom of God using the weapons of man.

1.  **The Theocratical Error:** Israel was a true theocracy—God ruled directly through prophets and judges. The bishops tried to recreate this *without* the direct voice of God, substituting the Emperor's sword for the Holy Spirit's power.
2.  **The Use of the Arm of Flesh:** They made themselves dependent on Constantine to settle theological disputes (like the Arian controversy).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** True unity comes from the Spirit writing the law on the hearts of believers (Jeremiah 31:33). The bishops sought unity through imperial decrees. This is "righteousness by law" on a national scale—trying to legislate holiness.

**Definition - Theocracy:** A form of government in which God is recognized as the supreme civil ruler. Since the cross, God has established no earthly theocracy; His kingdom is "not of this world" (John 18:36).

---

### Q9. What was the outgrowth of that theory among the Roman bishops?
“Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4.

**Answer:**
The logical conclusion of the bishops' theory was the establishment of a man who would rule the world in the place of God—the **Pope**.

1.  **"Sitteth in the Temple":** This is not necessarily a literal building in Jerusalem. In the New Testament, the church is the temple (Ephesians 2:21). The Papacy seats itself *over* the conscience of the church, claiming prerogatives that belong only to God (forgiveness of sins, changing of divine law, infallibility).
2.  **"As God":** By claiming the title "Vicarius Filii Dei" (Vicar of the Son of God), the Pope claims to represent Christ fully on earth. But the Bible says the Holy Spirit is the representative of Christ (John 14:16, 26).
3.  **The Counterfeit Mediation:** This system obscures the Righteousness by Faith message by inserting a human priesthood between the sinner and the Savior. We are invited to come "boldly unto the throne of grace" (Hebrews 4:16) solely through Jesus; the "Man of Sin" blocks the way, demanding we come through him.

### Q10. When and by whom was the Council of Nice convened?
The Emperor Constantine, 325 A.D.

**Answer:**
The Council of Nicaea is a landmark event. While it addressed important theological issues (the deity of Christ), the *manner* in which it was convened was dangerous. It was called not by church leaders moved by the Holy Spirit, but by a Roman Emperor seeking political stability. It set the precedent for the State to preside over the affairs of the Church.

---

### Q11. Under what authority were its decrees published?
“The decrees... were published under the imperial authority, and thus obtained a political importance." Torrey's Neander, vol. 2, page 133.

**Answer:**
The decrees were enforced as **civil law**.

1.  **Political Importance:** Dissenting from a church doctrine became a crime against the state. This laid the groundwork for centuries of persecution.
2.  **Liberty of Conscience:** God accepts only voluntary service. "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15). When imperial authority forces doctrine, liberty of conscience dies.

---

### Q12. What was one of the principal objects in calling that council?
“The question relating to observance of Easter, which was agitated in the time of Anicetus and Polycarp, and afterward in that of Victor, was still undecided. It was one of the principal reasons for convoking the Council of Nice, being the most important subject to be considered after the Arian controversy." Boyle's Historical View of the Council of Nice, page 22, ed. of 1839.

**Answer:**
Beyond the nature of Christ, the Council sought to unify the date of the "Pasch" (Passover/Easter). This was a struggle between apostolic tradition (from John and Philip) and the rising authority of Western custom.

---

### Q13. What was the particular question to be settled concerning Easter?
“It appears that the churches of Syria and Mesopotamia continued to follow the custom of the Jews, and celebrated Easter on the fourteenth day of the moon, whether falling on Sunday or not. All the other churches observed that solemnity on Sunday only, viz., those of Rome, Italy, Africa, Lydia, Egypt, Spain, Gaul, and Britain." Ibid.

**Answer:**
The controversy was between the **Quartodecimans** (Fourteenth-day keepers) and the **Sunday-keepers**.

1.  **Eastern Custom:** Many Eastern churches, following the example of the apostle John, observed the Pasch on the 14th of Nisan (the biblical Passover date), regardless of the day of the week.
2.  **Western Custom:** Rome and the West insisted on celebrating the resurrection on a **Sunday** every year, to distinguish themselves from Judaism.
3.  **The Significance:** This was a battle for authority: Would the church follow the biblical calendar and apostolic example, or the new authority of Rome and its desire for a standardized Sunday observance?

---

### Q14. How was the matter finally decided?
“Easter day was fixed on the Sunday immediately following the new moon which was nearest after the vernal equinox." Ibid., page 23.

**Answer:**
Rome won. The biblical timing (14th of Nisan) was discarded in favor of a calculated Sunday. This decision strengthened the prestige of Sunday as a holy day and flexed the muscle of the Roman Bishop to dictate times and seasons to the universal church.

---

### Q15. In his letter to the churches, urging the observance of this decree, what singular reason did Constantine assign for its observance?
“Let us then have nothing in common with the most hostile rabble of the Jews." Ibid., page 52.

**Answer:**
**Anti-Semitism** was a driving force in the change of Christian customs.

1.  **Divorcing from Roots:** The Sabbath (Saturday) was seen as "Jewish." To separate Christianity from Judaism, Constantine and the Roman bishops pushed for Sunday observance.
2.  **Tragic Irony:** In trying to distance themselves from the "rabble of the Jews," they distanced themselves from the practice of Jesus Himself, who was a Jew and "Lord also of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28).
3.  **Doctrinal Point:** We must never build our theology on prejudice. The "law of the Lord is perfect" (Psalm 19:7), regardless of who kept it first.

---

### Q16. What did Sylvester, bishop of Rome under Constantine's reign, do by his "apostolic" authority, and with the approval of Constantine?
“That he indeed changed the names of all the days of the week into festal days; as Polydorus mentions in book 6, chapt. 5. Metaphrastes, however, relates that he retained the names of the days familiar to the Hebrews; but that the name of the first day alone was changed, which he called the Lord's day." Historia Ecclesiastica per M. Ludovicum Lucium, cent. 4, cap. 10, pages 739, 740, ed. Basilea, 1624. Library of Andover Theological Seminary.

**Answer:**
Sylvester officially designated the first day of the week as the **"Lord's Day"** (Dies Dominica).

1.  **Biblical Contrast:** In the Bible, the only day God calls "My holy day" is the Sabbath (Isaiah 58:13). Jesus said He is "Lord of the Sabbath" (Matthew 12:8). Therefore, the scriptural "Lord's Day" is the seventh day, not the first.
2.  **The Attempted Change:** Daniel 7:25 predicted a power that would "think to change times and laws." Here we see the Bishop of Rome presuming the authority to alter the calendar and the titles of the days, elevating Sunday to a sacred status not given in Scripture.

---

### Q17. What was decreed by the Council of Laodicea in 364 A.D.?
That the churches should keep the Sunday, and that if they persisted in resting on the Sabbath, "let them be accursed." See Andrew's History of the Sabbath, page 362.

**Answer:**
This council (Canon 29) marks a direct assault on the Fourth Commandment.

1.  **The Curse:** They pronounced an *anathema* (curse) on those who rested on the Bible Sabbath. This fulfills the prophecy of the Beast making "war with the saints" (Revelation 13:7).
2.  **Righteousness by Faith Application:** True faith leads to obedience to God's law (Romans 3:31). The beast power demands obedience to *man's law* over God's law. The believer must choose: Fear the "curse" of the council, or fear God and keep His commandments (Ecclesiastes 12:13)?
3.  **Sanctuary Truth:** By attacking the Sabbath, the Papacy directed its attack against the Most Holy Place, where the Ark of the Covenant resides containing the Ten Commandments.

---

### Q18. What petition was made to the emperor by a church convention, in 401 A.D.?
"That the public shows might be transferred from the Christian Sunday, and from feast days, to some other days of the week." Neander, vol. 2, page 300.

**Answer:**
The church petitioned the state for **Sunday closing laws**. They wanted the competition (the circuses and theaters) shut down on their new holy day.

---

### Q19. What was the object of these state laws?
“That the day might be devoted with less interruption to the purposes of devotion." "That the devotion of the faithful might be free from all disturbance." Ibid., pages 297, 301.

**Answer:**
The object was to force people to be religious, or at least to appear so.

**[ILL] The Hollow Nut:** You can glue the shell of a nut back together to make it look whole, but you cannot put the kernel back inside. Sunday laws created a shell of "devotion," but without the Holy Spirit, the kernel of true godliness was missing.

---

### Q20. How was their "devotion" disturbed?
“Church teachers... were, in truth, often forced to com- plain, that in such competitions the theater was vastly more frequented than the church." Ibid., page 300.

**Answer:**
This confession reveals the spiritual bankruptcy of the state church.

1.  **The Problem:** The people preferred the theater to the church. Why? Because the church had lost the power of the gospel. It had become a system of dry forms.
2.  **The Wrong Solution:** Instead of seeking revival through repentance and prayer (2 Chronicles 7:14), the leaders sought legislation to remove the competition.
3.  **Spiritual Lesson:** You cannot legislate the heart. If a man abstains from work or play on Sunday only because the police force him to, he is not worshipping God; he is obeying the state. God desires worship in "spirit and in truth" (John 4:24).

---

### Q21. When the church had received help from the state to this extent, what more did she demand?
That the civil power should be exerted to compel men to serve God as the church should dictate.

**Answer:**
Power is addictive. Once the church used the state to protect Sunday, she soon used the state to punish those who disagreed with her doctrines. This transition marks the full maturation of the **Beast** image—a religious power wielding the sword of persecution.

---

### Q22. What did Augustine, the father of this theory, teach concerning it?
“Who doubts but what it is better to be led to God by instruction, than by fear of punishment or affliction? But because the former, who will be guided only by instruction, are better, the others are still not to be neglected... But many, like bad servants, must often be reclaimed to their master by the rod of temporal suffering, ere they can attain to this highest stage of religious development." Ibid., pages 214, 215.

**Answer:**
Augustine, though a brilliant theologian in other respects, provided the fatal theological justification for persecution.

1.  **"The Rod of Temporal Suffering":** Augustine argued that it was an act of "love" to punish heretics physically to save their souls. This is the logic of the Inquisition.
2.  **The Gospel Contrast:** Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me" (John 10:27). He never said, "My sheep feel my whip and are forced to follow me." The method of Christ is attraction ("I... will draw all men," John 12:32). The method of the Beast is compulsion.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Faith that is coerced is not faith at all. "For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness" (Romans 10:10). Force cannot touch the heart; it only produces fear.

---

### Q23. What is Neander's conclusion regarding this?
“It was by Augustine, then, that a theory was proposed and founded, which, tempered though it was, in its practical application, by his own pious, philanthropic spirit, nevertheless contained the germ of that whole system of spiritual despotism, of intolerance and persecution, which ended in the tribunals of the inquisition." Ibid., page 217.
NOTE. - It was thus that the union of church and state was formed, out of which was developed "the beast" (papacy) which made "war with the saints" and overcame them.

**Answer:**
The historian correctly identifies that good intentions (a "pious spirit") coupled with wrong principles (the use of force) led to the horrors of the Dark Ages.

1.  **The Harvest:** The "germ" planted by these early compromises grew into the "Beast" of Revelation 13—a system that persecuted millions of Bible-believing Christians for 1260 years.
2.  **The Warning for Today:** We are studying this not merely to condemn the past, but to understand the principles of the Great Controversy. Whenever a religious group seeks to use the government to enforce its dogmas—whether regarding days of worship or other doctrines—the spirit of the Papacy is revived.
3.  **The Call to Come Out:** Revelation 18:4 calls God's people to "Come out of her." This means coming out of the *spirit* of Babylon (force, pride, legalism) as well as the system of Babylon. We must stand on the platform of religious liberty, Righteousness by Faith alone, and the commandments of God (Revelation 14:12).

**[ILL] The Seed and the Tree:** An acorn is small, but it contains the blueprint for a massive oak. The early compromise of using state power to enforce Sunday seemed small—a mere "acorn"—but it contained the blueprint for the Inquisition. We must be vigilant against the "little foxes that spoil the vines" (Song of Solomon 2:15).
