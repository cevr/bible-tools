## Slide 1 – Q1: The Effect of Pride

- **Question:** What will pride do for him who cherishes it?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 29:23 – “A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour
  shall uphold the humble in spirit.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Nature of the Fall)

- **A Spiritual Paradox**
  - In the world, pride pushes men upward to power; in God’s kingdom, the way up
    is down.
  - Lucifer sought to ascend but was brought down to the depths (Isaiah 14:13–14
    – “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will
    exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the most High.”).
- **Gravity and Moral Law**
  - Spiritual law acts like gravity. Pride inflates the ego and separates the
    soul from God.
  - Separation from the source of life ensures collapse (Proverbs 16:18 – “Pride
    goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Faith & Sanctuary)

- **The Barrier to Righteousness by Faith**
  - **Justification:** Requires admitting we have no merit. Pride refuses to
    admit this bankruptcy (Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of
    the glory of God;”).
  - **Sanctification:** Requires daily dependence on Christ. Pride insists on
    self-sufficiency (John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that
    abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without
    me ye can do nothing.”).
- **The Sanctuary Lesson**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner had to publicly confess over the
    victim’s head (Leviticus 4:29 – “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of
    the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt
    offering.”).
  - A proud man cannot approach the altar because he will not admit he deserves
    death.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Balloon vs. The Foundation**
  - A man tries to fill a balloon with his own breath; the larger it gets, the
    thinner and closer to bursting it becomes.
  - In contrast, a wise builder digs deep to set a foundation on the rock.
  - The higher the building, the deeper the foundation must be.
  - The Christian life is a race to the bottom, to be “rooted and grounded” in
    love (Ephesians 3:17 – “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that
    ye, being rooted and grounded in love,”).

## Slide 5 – Q2: God’s Attitude Toward Pride

- **Question:** How does the Lord regard the proud?
- **Key Text:** James 4:6 – “But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God
  resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.”
- **Key Text:** Psalm 101:5 – “Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will
  I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Grace & Atonement)

- **God in Battle Array**
  - To “resist” implies setting oneself in battle array.
  - Cherishing pride positions us as adversaries of God, aligning us with
    Satan’s principles.
- **The Condition for Grace**
  - Grace is active power to overcome sin (Titus 2:11–12 – “For the grace of God
    that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying
    ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
    godly, in this present world;”).
  - God cannot pour this power into a vessel filled with self. Humility empties
    the vessel.
- **Sanctuary Context**
  - On the Day of Atonement, the people had to afflict their souls (Leviticus
    23:29 – “For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same
    day, he shall be cut off from among his people.”).
  - We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement; it is a time for
    heart-searching, not arrogance.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **Water Flows to the Lowest Point**
  - Water bypasses high mountain peaks, leaving them barren and rocky.
  - It settles in the low valleys, making them green and fruitful.
  - **Application:** If you lift yourself up like a peak, the river of life
    flows past you. If you humble yourself like the valley, God’s power fills
    you to overflowing.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Intimacy with Jesus

- **Question:** Will Jesus dwell with the proud?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 138:6 – “Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect unto
  the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Character & Laodicea)

- **Distance of Character**
  - Jesus is “meek and lowly” (Matthew 11:29). The proud heart is self-exalting.
  - God knows the proud “afar off” because their character is far from His
    likeness.
- **The Fellowship of Suffering**
  - To dwell with Jesus, we must walk His path (Philippians 2:7 – “But made
    himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was
    made in the likeness of men:”).
  - The proud man seeks reputation; he cannot abide with the humble Nazarene.
- **The Laodicean Danger**
  - Spiritual pride is the danger of the last-day church (Revelation 3:17 –
    “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of
    nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor,
    and blind, and naked:”).
  - Pride keeps Jesus outside the door.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Magnets**
  - If you push the “north” poles of two magnets together, they repel each
    other.
  - God is holy; the proud man sets himself up as a god. Two “gods” cannot dwell
    together.
  - Only when the sinner turns around (repents) and acknowledges God’s supremacy
    can union occur.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Pride vs. True Wisdom

- **Question:** Can those who are filled with pride be truly wise?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:4 – “He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about
  questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil
  surmisings,”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Blindness & Wisdom)

- **Spiritual Blindness**
  - Pride acts as a blindfold. One may know theology but not know God, for God
    is love (1 John 4:8).
  - The Pharisees were experts, yet pride led them to crucify the Lord.
- **Strife vs. Soul Winning**
  - A proud heart seeks to win arguments rather than souls. It uses truth as a
    club rather than bread.
- **True Wisdom**
  - Wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 9:10).
  - It is practical and peaceable (James 3:17 – “But the wisdom that is from
    above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full
    of mercy and good fruits...”).

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Blind Philosopher vs. The Child**
  - A man blind from birth may argue eloquently about the physics of light.
  - A small child who can see knows more about the sunrise than the blind
    philosopher.
  - **Application:** Pride is spiritual blindness. Until the Holy Spirit applies
    “eyesalve” (Revelation 3:18), the proud man argues about the Bible but does
    not see the Savior.

## Slide 14 – Q5: The Sinfulness of Pride

- **Question:** Why should we not indulge in pride?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 21:4 – “An high look, and a proud heart, and the
  plowing of the wicked, is sin.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Law & Victory)

- **The Essence of Sin**
  - Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4). The law requires love for
    God and neighbor.
  - Pride is self-love; thus, it violates the entire law.
- **The Root of Rebellion**
  - Stealing, anger, and Sabbath-breaking all stem from placing self above God
    and others.
- **Victory over Sin (Righteousness by Faith)**
  - We cannot just trim the branches (bad habits) while leaving the root
    (pride).
  - We must ask Christ to crucify the “old man” (Romans 6:6 – “Knowing this,
    that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be
    destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.”).

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Gardener and the Weeds**
  - A gardener cuts the heads off dandelions but leaves the roots in the ground.
    Within days, the weeds return.
  - Indulging in pride while trying to stop “sinning” is like that gardener.
  - Unless the root is dug out by grace, the fruit of sin will continue to grow.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Blessing and the Proud

- **Question:** Will the Lord bless the proud?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 40:4 – “Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his
  trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (The Great Exchange)

- **The Source of Blessing**
  - The Kingdom belongs to the poor in spirit (Matthew 5:3 – “Blessed are the
    poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”).
  - Blessing is reserved for those who know they have nothing to offer God.
- **Respecting the Proud**
  - We must not envy or flatter the arrogant. God’s people are “peculiar” (1
    Peter 2:9).
- **The Exchange**
  - **Imputed Righteousness:** Accepting His record for our failures.
  - **Imparted Righteousness:** Accepting His Spirit to live in us.
  - This is impossible if we are “rich” in our own estimation.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Beggar and the Mud**
  - A wealthy king offers a beggar a golden cup filled with life-giving water.
  - The beggar is clutching a handful of mud and refuses to let go.
  - He cannot receive the blessing until he drops the mud.
  - **Application:** Pride is the mud; God’s blessing is the golden cup. We must
    let go to receive.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Sins of the Last Days

- **Question:** What will be one great sin of the last days?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:2 – “For men shall be lovers of their own selves,
  covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful,
  unholy,”
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 3:5 – “...the child shall behave himself proudly against
  the ancient, and the base against the honourable.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points (Prophecy & Authority)

- **Character of the Last Days**
  - “Lovers of their own selves” is a leading sin of the end times.
  - This is the spirit of Antichrist, who exalts himself (2 Thessalonians 2:4 –
    “Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God...”).
- **Rebellion Against Authority**
  - Behaving proudly against the “ancient” represents rejecting the **Ancient of
    Days** and His law.
- **The Final Test**
  - **God’s Seal:** Submission to the Creator’s authority (Sabbath).
  - **Mark of the Beast:** Exalting human authority above God’s.
  - Only the humble who keep the commandments (Revelation 14:12) will stand.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Days of Noah**
  - The proud antediluvians mocked the humble boat-builder.
  - They trusted in their own science and nature’s permanence. Their pride was
    their ruin.
  - **Application:** In the last days, those too proud to enter the “ark” of
    Christ and His truth will be swept away.

## Slide 23 – Q8: The World’s View

- **Question:** How are the proud generally regarded at the present time?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:15 – “And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that
  work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points (Illusion vs. Reality)

- **The Illusion of Happiness**
  - The world calls the arrogant “stars” and mistakes power for joy.
- **The Reality of the Heart**
  - Despite appearances, the wicked have no peace (Isaiah 57:21 – “There is no
    peace, saith my God, to the wicked.”).
  - Pride requires constant defense; true rest is only in Jesus (Matthew 11:28).
- **The Witness of the Church**
  - The church demonstrates true happiness through service and humility, showing
    the world the character of Christ.

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **Behind the Curtain**
  - Stage lighting makes a painted backdrop look like a solid castle.
  - Behind the curtain, it is just wood and canvas.
  - **Application:** The world calls the proud happy because they see the “stage
    lighting” of fame. God sees behind the curtain: fear, emptiness, and
    spiritual poverty.

## Slide 26 – Q9: The Fate of the Proud

- **Question:** What does the prophet say will be their fate?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 4:1 – “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as
  an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble:
  and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it
  shall leave them neither root nor branch.”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points (Judgment & Hope)

- **Stubble and Fire**
  - Stubble is dry and dead; it is instantly consumed by fire.
  - **God is a Consuming Fire:** (Hebrews 12:29). His presence is pure holiness.
  - The proud have no connection to Life; they cannot exist in His glory.
- **The Cleansing of the Universe**
  - Pride originated sin. To secure peace, pride must be blotted out.
- **The Hope (Sanctification)**
  - We must let the Spirit consume our pride _now_ (1 Corinthians 15:31 – “I
    protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die
    daily.”).
  - We must be covered in the fire-proof robe of Christ’s righteousness.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Silversmith**
  - A silversmith puts silver in the fire to burn away the dross (impurities).
  - He knows the process is complete when he can see his own reflection clearly
    in the metal.
  - **Application:** God puts us in the fire of trial to burn away pride. If we
    submit, we will reflect His image and endure forever.
