### Q1. When God was about to speak the law to Israel, of what did He tell Moses to remind them?

**“Tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and
how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself.” (Exodus
19:3, 4)**

**Answer:** Before God asked for obedience, He reminded Israel of His grace.
This implies several vital truths about the relationship between God and His
people:

1.  **Grace Precedes Law:** God did not ask Israel to keep the Ten Commandments
    _in order_ to be delivered from Egypt. He delivered them first, then gave
    the law. Salvation is always a free gift of grace; obedience is the response
    of love and gratitude (1 John 4:19).
2.  **Dependence on God:** The imagery of being borne on "eagles' wings"
    illustrates total dependence. An eaglet does not fly by its own strength
    initially; it is carried. Similarly, the believer cannot walk the path of
    righteousness by human effort alone but must be carried by divine power
    (Isaiah 40:31).
3.  **The Goal is Relationship:** God said He brought them "unto Myself." The
    purpose of the Exodus, and the purpose of the plan of salvation, is not
    merely to have a list of rules, but to restore the broken relationship
    between God and man (John 17:3).

**[ILL]** Imagine a firefighter rescuing a child from a burning building. He
does not shout instructions from the ground, saying, "If you climb down
correctly, I will save you." He climbs the ladder, grabs the child, and carries
them to safety. Only after the child is safe does the firefighter teach them
about fire safety to protect their future. So God saved Israel from slavery
before giving them the law of liberty.

### Q2. What covenant did He propose to make with them?

**“Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye
shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all the earth is
Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are
the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.” (Exodus
19:5, 6)**

**Answer:** God proposed an arrangement where Israel would be His special
representatives to the world.

- **The Condition:** "If ye will obey My voice." God’s character is one of order
  and love. To walk with Him requires walking in harmony with His law, which is
  the transcript of His character.
- **The Promise:** They were to be a "peculiar treasure" (a special property)
  and a "kingdom of priests." A priest is one who stands between God and the
  world to minister salvation. God intended Israel to evangelize the nations by
  showing the beauty of a life lived under God’s government (Deuteronomy 4:5–8).
- **The Holiness:** They were to be a "holy nation." **Sanctification** means to
  be set apart for holy use. God’s plan has always been to have a people who
  reflect His holiness in a sinful world (1 Peter 2:9).

**Definition:** **Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit
cleanses the believer from sin and sets them apart for God’s service, resulting
in a character that reflects Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:13).

---

### Q3. What is a covenant?

**“A mutual agreement of two or more persons or parties, in writing and under
seal, to do or to refrain from some act or thing; a contract.” (Webster)**

**Answer:** In the biblical sense, a covenant is a solemn bond between God and
man. However, unlike human contracts where two equals negotiate terms, a divine
covenant is initiated solely by God. He sets the terms of salvation and
blessing; man’s part is to accept those terms by faith and obedience.

Biblically, there are two main covenants discussed in regard to salvation:

1.  **The Old Covenant:** Ratified at Sinai, characterized by the people's
    promise to obey in their own strength.
2.  **The New Covenant:** Ratified by the blood of Christ, characterized by
    God's promise to write the law in the believer's heart.

**[ILL]** If a wealthy benefactor offers to pay off a poor man’s massive debt
and build him a house, asking only that the man lives responsibly in it, the
poor man does not negotiate the price. He simply accepts the agreement. God’s
covenant is His gracious offer of life and law, which we accept by faith.

---

### Q4. When Moses told the people what the Lord had proposed, what did they say?

**“And all the people answered together, and said, all that the Lord hath spoken
we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord.” (Exodus
19:7, 8)**

**Answer:** This response marks the establishment of the "Old Covenant." While
their intention was good, their understanding was flawed in two ways:

1.  **Self-Confidence:** They said, "We will do." They did not say, "We will do
    _by God's help_." They trusted in their own power to obey a law that is
    spiritual and perfect (Romans 7:14).
2.  **Ignorance of Sin:** They did not realize the depth of their own sinfulness
    or the high standard of God's righteousness. This pledge led to inevitable
    failure. Just weeks later, they broke this promise by worshipping the golden
    calf. This demonstrates that the unrenewed human heart cannot be subject to
    the law of God (Romans 8:7).

**Definition:** **Righteousness by Faith:** The truth that human beings cannot
produce righteousness (right doing) on their own. We must receive Christ’s
righteousness by faith—first imputed (credited) to cover our past, and then
imparted (given) to empower our present obedience (Philippians 3:9).

---

### Q5. In the Covenant which the Lord proposed to make with Israel, what did He say that they were to do?

**“Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant.”
(Exodus 19:5, first part)**

**Answer:** God required full allegiance to His voice. In the Bible, hearing and
obeying are often the same concept. To "keep His covenant" meant to remain
faithful to the relationship established by God, respecting the conditions He
laid down. God cannot have a covenant of peace with rebellion; therefore,
obedience is essential for the relationship to exist (Amos 3:3).

---

### Q6. What was His covenant which they were to keep as their part of the mutual agreement or covenant between Him and them?

**“And he declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform,
even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone.” (Deuteronomy
4:12, 13)**

**Answer:** It is crucial to distinguish between the _covenant agreement_ and
the _law_ itself.

- **The Law:** The Ten Commandments are the eternal standard of righteousness.
  They are the "covenant" in the sense that they are the core document or
  subject matter of the agreement.
- **The Agreement:** The "Old Covenant" was the specific arrangement where the
  people promised to keep this law to be God's people. The Law itself is holy,
  just, and good (Romans 7:12). It was not the Ten Commandments that were the
  problem with the Old Covenant; the problem was the people's inability to keep
  them without a Savior.

**[ILL]** Think of the Ten Commandments as a mirror. If your face is dirty, the
mirror shows you the dirt. The Old Covenant was like a person promising, "I will
use this mirror to clean my face," but having no water or soap. The mirror (Law)
is good, but it cannot clean you. Only the "water of life" (Christ) can cleanse.

---

### Q7. What relation did the ten commandments bear to the covenant made between God and the children of Israel?

**As seen by the last text quoted, the ten commandments were the "covenant" to
which the Lord referred, when in proposing a covenant with Israel, He said, "Now
therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall
be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:"
(Exodus 19:5)**

**Answer:** The Ten Commandments were the **basis** and **condition** of the
covenant.

- God's government is moral; therefore, His covenant with man must be based on
  moral law.
- The Ten Commandments existed before Sinai (for to sin is to transgress the
  law, 1 John 3:4, and sin existed from Adam, Romans 5:13). At Sinai, God
  codified them and made them the explicit basis of His agreement with the
  nation.
- Because the law is the transcript of God's character, it is the standard by
  which all men are judged in the sanctuary (James 2:10–12; Ecclesiastes
  12:13–14).

---

### Q8. After God had spoken His law (the "covenant which He commanded," Ex. 20:3-17), did He continue speaking to the people?

**“And He added no more. And He wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered
them unto me.” (Deuteronomy 5:22)**

**Answer:** The phrase "He added no more" is significant.

1.  **Completeness:** The Ten Commandments are a complete, perfect moral code.
    Nothing needs to be added or subtracted. They cover our duty to God (first
    four) and our duty to man (last six).
2.  **Divine Authorship:** These were the only words spoken by God's audible
    voice to the multitude and written by His own finger. This separates the
    Moral Law from the ceremonial statutes and civil judgments that Moses wrote.
3.  **Permanence:** Being written on stone signifies their unchangeable,
    enduring nature, unlike the ceremonial laws written on parchment (parchment
    decays; stone endures) (Psalm 111:7, 8).

---

### Q9. What was the nature of the instruction afterward given to Moses (Ex. 20:22, 23)?

**It was a practical application or explanation of the ten commandments, so that
the people might be able better to understand what was involved in the keeping
of them.**

**Answer:** While the Ten Commandments are the broad principles, the statutes
and judgments given to Moses (Exodus 21–23) were specific applications for the
nation of Israel at that time.

- They dealt with civil issues (servants, property).
- They dealt with ceremonial issues (altars, sacrifices).
- **Purpose:** These laws showed how the principles of the Ten Commandments
  (love to God and neighbor) applied to daily life. For example, the command
  "Thou shalt not kill" was expanded to include liability if one's ox gored a
  neighbor (Exodus 21:29). This teaches us that God cares about the practical
  details of our lives.

---

### Q10. As reported in Ex. 24:3, Moses told the people all the words of the Lord, and they promised to be obedient. What did Moses then do, that there might be no misunderstanding?

**“And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the morning,
and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve
tribes of Israel... And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the
audience of the people.” (Exodus 24:4, 7)**

**Answer:** Moses took three steps to ensure the covenant was formal and
binding:

1.  **He Wrote:** The terms were not left to memory but recorded.
2.  **He Built an Altar:** This signifies that sinful man cannot approach a holy
    God or enter a covenant without sacrifice. The altar points to Christ, the
    Lamb of God.
3.  **He Read:** The people needed to hear the terms clearly before ratifying
    them. Faith and obedience must be intelligent, based on the Word of God
    (Romans 10:17).

---

### Q11. When the people had again heard the words of the Lord, and again promised obedience (verse 7), what was done to ratify the covenant which had thus been made?

**“And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold
the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you concerning all
these words.” (Exodus 24:8). “And sprinkled both the book and all the people,
Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.”
(Hebrews 9:19, 20)**

**Answer:** The covenant was ratified (confirmed/sealed) by blood.

- **The Symbol:** In the Old Covenant, the blood of animals was used. This blood
  could not actually take away sin (Hebrews 10:4), but it served as a type or
  shadow of Christ's blood.
- **The Necessity:** "Without shedding of blood is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22).
  A covenant between sinful man and holy God requires the death of a substitute
  to cover the broken law.
- **The Application:** Sprinkling the people signified that they were formally
  entering into this binding agreement and were under the "blood
  protection"—though only symbolically.

**Definition:** **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation between God and man.
In the earthly sanctuary, this was illustrated by the daily sacrifices
(forgiveness) and the yearly Day of Atonement (cleansing).

---

### Q12. Is the covenant made at Sinai the only covenant which God made with Israel?

**“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with
the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant
that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring
them out of the land of Egypt; which My covenant they brake, although I was a
husband unto them, saith the Lord.” (Jeremiah 31:31, 32)**

**Answer:** No, God promised a "New Covenant."

- The distinction is clear: "Not according to the covenant... which they brake."
- The Old Covenant failed not because God was unfaithful ("I was a husband unto
  them"), but because the people broke their promise.
- The New Covenant is God's solution to the problem of human weakness and
  failure. It is designed to secure what the Old Covenant could not: a people
  who actually keep the law through the power of God.

---

### Q13. What comparison does God make between the two covenants?

**“But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also He is
the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been
sought for the second.” (Hebrews 8:6, 7)**

**Answer:** The New Covenant is "better" because it is based on "better
promises."

- **Old Covenant Promises:** Based on the people's promise ("We will do"). These
  were weak and faulty because human nature is weak.
- **New Covenant Promises:** Based on God's promise ("_I_ will put," "_I_ will
  write," "_I_ will forgive"). God's promises never fail (Titus 1:2).
- **The Mediator:** The Old Covenant had Moses as a mediator; the New has Jesus
  Christ, who can actually save to the uttermost (Hebrews 7:25).

**[ILL]** If you need to cross a stormy ocean, the Old Covenant is like a
rowboat you built yourself. You promise to row hard, but your strength fails.
The New Covenant is like a massive Ocean Liner piloted by the Captain. The
promise relies on the engine of the ship, not the muscles of the passenger.

---

### Q14. In what respect was the first covenant faulty?

**It must have been faulty in the very particulars wherein the second was
better, namely, in the promises, as seen by the last part of verse 6: "He
[Christ] is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better
promises."**

**Answer:** The fault was not in the Law (which is holy) nor in God (who is
faithful). The fault was in the _people_ (Hebrews 8:8 says, "For finding fault
with _them_...").

- The agreement relied on human effort.
- It produced legalism (outward compliance) or despair (realization of failure),
  but not a changed heart.
- It could not provide power to overcome sin.

---

### Q15. What are the promises of the new covenant?

**“For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after
those days, saith the Lord; I will put My laws into their mind, and write them
in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a
people... For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
more.” (Hebrews 8:10-12; Jeremiah 31:34)**

**Answer:** The New Covenant consists of four key promises from God:

1.  **Sanctification (Internalized Law):** "I will write them in their hearts."
    Instead of law on stone outside us, asking for obedience we cannot give, God
    puts the love of the law inside us. We obey because it is our nature,
    partaking of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).
2.  **Relationship:** "I will be to them a God." Personal communion.
3.  **Knowledge:** "All shall know Me." An experiential knowledge of God, not
    just intellectual.
4.  **Justification (Forgiveness):** "I will forgive their iniquity."

**Key Point:** The law in the New Covenant is the _same_ law (Ten Commandments)
as the Old. The difference is where it is written: Stone (Old) vs. Heart (New).

---

### Q16. Are these promises stated in the order of their fulfillment?

**It is evident that in Jer. 31:33, 34... those promises are not stated in the
regular order of their fulfillment; because forgiveness of sins is mentioned
last, whereas it must necessarily precede the writing of the law in the
heart...**

**Answer:** The logical order of salvation is generally:

1.  **Calling/Knowledge:** We hear the Gospel.
2.  **Justification:** We accept Christ and are forgiven ("remember sin no
    more").
3.  **Sanctification:** The Holy Spirit writes the law in our hearts
    (transformation).
4.  **Glorification:** We are physically delivered to be His people in the
    Kingdom. However, the experience is often simultaneous. When we come to
    Christ, He forgives us _and_ begins the work of transformation immediately
    (1 John 1:9).

---

### Q17. In the first covenant, to what was Israel's promise really equivalent?

**In the first covenant the people promised to make themselves righteous; for
God did not promise to help them.**

**Answer:** Their promise ("We will do") was an attempt at
**Self-Righteousness**.

- **Filthy Rags:** Isaiah 64:6 tells us that all our righteousnesses are as
  filthy rags.
- **Helplessness:** Jesus said, "Without Me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5).
- **The Remedy:** The only righteousness acceptable to God is His own
  righteousness. In the New Covenant, we stop trying to produce righteousness
  and instead receive "The Lord Our Righteousness" (Jeremiah 23:6). This is the
  core of the **Righteousness by Faith** message: Christ's perfect life is
  credited to us, and His life is lived out in us.

---

### Q18. Yet what must be done in order to have eternal life?

**“If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” (Matthew 19:17, last
part; see also Rev. 22:14)**

**Answer:** The requirement for entrance into heaven has never changed. It was
perfect obedience in Eden, it was perfect obedience at Sinai, and it is perfect
obedience today. God cannot admit sin (law-breaking) into heaven.

- **The Dilemma:** The law requires perfection, but we are sinners.
- **The Solution:** We cannot change the requirement, so God changes _us_ and
  provides the righteousness we lack through Christ. We "keep the commandments"
  not to earn heaven, but as the fruit of the life of Christ within us (Romans
  8:3–4).

---

### Q19. Then how could ancient Israel have any chance for eternal life?

**“How much more shall the blood of Christ... purge your conscience from dead
works to serve the living God? And for this cause He is the mediator of the new
testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that
were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise
of eternal inheritance.” (Hebrews 9:14, 15)**

**Answer:** Believers in the Old Testament were not saved by the Old Covenant.
They were saved by the New Covenant (the Gospel), looking _forward_ to the
cross, just as we look _back_ to it.

- **Retrospective Power:** Christ's death covered the "transgressions that were
  under the first testament."
- **Type and Antitype:** When an Israelite sinned and brought a lamb, if he had
  faith, he was looking past the animal to the coming Messiah. He was
  acknowledging, "I cannot keep the law; I need a Substitute." David understood
  this when he prayed for a "clean heart" (Psalm 51:10)—that is New Covenant
  language.

---

### Q20. How alone can the good works required by the law be manifested in the lives of men?

**See John 15:4, 5; Phil. 2:13; Eph. 2:10; Heb. 13:20, 21; 1 Cor. 15:10; Gal.
2:20.**

**Answer:** Good works are manifested only by the indwelling Christ.

- **Galatians 2:20:** "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
  I, but Christ liveth in me."
- **Philippians 2:13:** "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to
  do of His good pleasure." True obedience is not a man trying hard to look like
  Jesus; it is Jesus living His life through the man. This is the mystery of
  godliness—Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27).

**[ILL]** A glove cannot pick up a Bible. It has no life or strength. But if a
hand is inserted into the glove, the glove moves and acts. The glove gets the
credit for "holding the book," but the hand provides 100% of the power. We are
the glove; Christ is the hand.

---

### Q21. In order to have God make us "perfect in every good work to do His will," what must be our position?

**“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from
you.” (James 4:7). “Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God...” (Romans 6:13)**

**Answer:** Our part in the New Covenant is **Submission** and **Yielding**.

- We cannot cleanse ourselves, but we can choose to submit to the Cleanser.
- We cannot write the law in our hearts, but we can yield our wills to the
  Writer.
- **Victory:** Victory over sin comes when the will is surrendered to God. When
  we stop fighting in our own strength and surrender to God's strength, the
  devil flees.

---

### Q22. What is said of the law in the second, or new covenant?

**“I [the Lord] will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their
hearts.” (Jeremiah 31:33)**

**Answer:** The New Covenant does not abolish the law; it establishes it (Romans
3:31).

- If the law were abolished, there would be no standard of righteousness to
  write on the heart.
- To have the law "in the heart" means to love righteousness and hate iniquity
  (Hebrews 1:9). It means the believer obeys God because they _want_ to, not
  because they are forced to. This restores the image of God in man.

---

### Q23. Since no such promise was made in the old covenant... were not the promises of the new covenant much "better" than those of the old?

**When and how was the second covenant ratified? By the death of Christ...
(Daniel 9:27; Hebrews 9:16, 17)**

**Answer:** Yes, the promises are infinitely better because they rely on God's
power, confirmed by the blood of Christ.

- **Ratification:** A testament (will/covenant) is only valid after the death of
  the testator. Christ's death on Calvary legally ratified the New Covenant.
- **Daniel 9:27:** Prophecy predicted the Messiah would "confirm the covenant"
  in the 70th week, causing the earthly sacrifices to cease (by fulfilling
  them).

---

### Q24. Then how could the Israelites, or any people before the first advent, derive any benefit from it?

**By faith in the promised Redeemer. See Heb. 6:13, 16-20; Rom. 4:17.**

**Answer:** The "New Covenant" is essentially the "Everlasting Covenant" of
grace that has existed since the fall of man (Genesis 3:15).

- Abraham, Moses, David, and Elijah were all saved by the provisions of the New
  Covenant—by faith in the coming Messiah.
- They offered animal sacrifices as an expression of their faith in the Lamb of
  God who would ratify the covenant in the future.
- **Romans 4:** Paul uses Abraham (who lived long before Sinai) as the primary
  example of justification by faith.

---

### Q25. How and in whom was the covenant with Abraham confirmed?

**In Christ. See Heb. 6:13, 16-20; Gal. 3:17.**

**Answer:** The covenant God made with Abraham ("In thy seed shall all nations
be blessed") was confirmed in Christ, who is the "Seed" (Galatians 3:16). The
law given at Sinai 430 years later could not disannul or cancel this promise
(Galatians 3:17). The Gospel of grace is older than the legalism of Sinai.

---

### Q26. Is there anything in the second covenant that was not in the Abrahamic covenant?

**“And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
promise.” (Galatians 3:29, 6-9)**

**Answer:** No. The New Covenant is simply the ratification and fulfillment of
the covenant made with Abraham.

- **Abraham's Blessing:** Justification by faith and the promise of the Spirit
  (Galatians 3:14).
- **Our Inheritance:** We are heirs of the _same_ promise given to Abraham.
- **Continuity:** There is only one plan of salvation. From Adam to the last
  saint, all are saved by grace through faith in Christ.

---

### Q27. Then why was the covenant made at Sinai?

**The Lord was just giving His law. The promise of the Israelites to keep it
perfectly, and their failure, brought them face to face with the consequences of
violating the law of God...**

**Answer:** If salvation is by the Abrahamic promise (Grace), why add the Sinai
covenant (Law)?

1.  **Conviction of Sin:** "By the law is the knowledge of sin" (Romans 3:20).
    Israel had lost sight of God's holiness in Egypt. They needed to see the
    perfect standard to realize how far they fell short.
2.  **Schoolmaster:** The law acts as a "schoolmaster" to bring us to Christ
    (Galatians 3:24). When the people tried to keep the law and failed (Old
    Covenant experience), they were driven to despair of self. This despair is
    necessary so they would cry out for a Savior.
3.  **Demonstration:** The history of Israel under the Old Covenant is a lesson
    for the universe: Human promises and human effort, even with the best law,
    cannot produce righteousness. Only Christ can.

**Conclusion:** The Old Covenant says: "Obey and live." (We try and fail). The
New Covenant says: "Live (through Christ), and you will obey." (Christ succeeds
in us). Let us cease from our own works (Hebrews 4:10) and enter into the rest
of faith, allowing Jesus to write His law upon our hearts today.
