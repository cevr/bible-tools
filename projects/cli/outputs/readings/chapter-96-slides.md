## Slide 1 – Q1: God of the Gentiles

- **Question:** How does God regard the Gentiles? “Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also." Rom. 3:29.
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:29 – “Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Universal Salvation

- **No National Limits:** The plan of salvation is not limited by geography or genealogy. There is only one Creator, thus one God for all humanity.
- **Universal Need:** Romans 3:23 establishes that "all have sinned." Since the disease of sin is universal, the remedy (the Gospel) must be universal.
- **Universal Access:** Gentiles have the same access to God’s throne, grace, and law as the Jews.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We are not saved by heritage or church membership.
- **The Source:** God provides the righteousness of Christ to any soul—Jew or Gentile—who claims it by faith.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The King and the Famine:**
    - Imagine a great famine strikes the entire world.
    - A wealthy King opens a granary.
    - If He were only King of a certain village, only that village would eat.
    - But because He is King of the whole realm, the doors are open to everyone.
- **Application:** God is King of the whole earth; the Bread of Life is for every hungry soul.

## Slide 4 – Q2: God’s Impartiality

- **Question:** Is God partial to either Jew or Gentile? “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him." Acts 10:34, 35.
- **Key Text:** Acts 10:34-35 – “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points & Definitions

- **Divine Character:** God looks at the heart, not the outward appearance (1 Samuel 16:7 – “...for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.”).
- **"Feareth Him":** This refers to reverential trust and awe, which is the beginning of wisdom (Psalm 111:10).
- **"Worketh Righteousness":**
    - This is not legalism or earning salvation.
    - It is the outward evidence of inward faith.
    - True faith always works by love (Galatians 5:6).
- **The Judgment:** The question will not be about nationality, but: "Did you have the faith of Jesus, and did that faith produce obedience?" (Revelation 14:12).

## Slide 6 – Q3: The Rule of Conviction

- **Question:** What rule must be applied to convict anyone of sin? “For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not Imputed when there is no law." Rom. 5:13.
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:13 – “For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Function of the Law

- **The Standard:** To know our condition, we need a measurement. God's moral law is that ruler.
- **Detector of Sin:** A crooked line is only known as crooked when compared to a straight ruler (Romans 3:20).
- **Universal Application:**
    - If the Ten Commandments were only for Jews, Gentiles could not be charged with sin.
    - Since the world is guilty, the Law must be binding upon the world.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** The law is a mirror showing us the dirt (sin). It cannot wash us; it drives us to the Fountain (Christ) for cleansing.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Speeding Ticket:**
    - A man drives 80 MPH on a highway.
    - If there are no speed limit signs and no traffic laws, he cannot be ticketed.
    - If the law says "55 MPH," he is guilty.
- **Application:** The law does not make him speed, but it reveals his transgression. God's law reveals our deviation from His righteousness.

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Purpose of the Law

- **Question:** For whom is the law made? “Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, ...for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine." 1 Tim. 1:9, 10.
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 1:9-10 – “Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points & Sanctuary Connection

- **For the Lawless:** The law stands as a barrier and a judge against those in rebellion, condemning their sin.
- **For the Righteous:**
    - When justified by faith, the Holy Spirit writes the law in the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
    - The believer keeps the law not out of fear of arrest, but because they share God's nature of love.
    - The law is not an enemy to the righteous man; they are friends.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the Ark, the Law was covered by the Mercy Seat. For the repentant, Christ’s blood covers the law’s condemnation. For the unrepentant, the law demands justice.

## Slide 11 – Q5: The Gentile Condition

- **Question:** Were the Gentiles addicted to such practices? “This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles,... who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness." Eph. 4:17, 19.
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 4:17, 19 – “This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind... Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Transformation in Christ

- **The Natural State:** The "Gentiles" here represent the unregenerate world.
- **"Past Feeling":** Sin hardens the conscience until the sinner no longer feels the Spirit's conviction (1 Timothy 4:2).
- **Separation:** A Christian cannot "walk as other Gentiles" and walk with Christ simultaneously.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
    - Salvation involves crucifying the "old man."
    - It is the resurrection of a "new man" created in righteousness (Ephesians 4:24).
    - Deliverance from the *power* of sin, not just the penalty.

## Slide 13 – Q6: Rebuilding the Tabernacle

- **Question:** Speaking of how God would visit the Gentiles and take out a people for Himself, what did James say was fallen down, and would be built up again? “And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up." Acts 15, 16.
- **Key Text:** Acts 15:15-16 – “And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points

- **Tabernacle of David:** Represents the kingdom of God and true worship, which had "fallen" through apostasy and rejection of the Messiah.
- **The Rebuilding:** God rebuilds His spiritual house using "living stones"—believers from both Jewish and Gentile backgrounds (1 Peter 2:5).
- **Sanctuary Connection:** The earthly sanctuary was a type. This "building up" establishes the church as the dwelling place of the Spirit, where God's law is kept in the heart.

## Slide 15 – Q7: The Result of Restoration

- **Question:** What was to be the result of building again the tabernacle of David? “That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom My name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things." Acts 15:17.
- **Key Text:** Acts 15:17 – “That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Missional Purpose

- **Seek the Lord:** The purpose of restoring true worship is so that "the residue of men" (the rest of humanity) might find God.
- **Called by His Name:** God places His name—His character—upon His people.
- **Global Scale:** The "tabernacle" is expanded to cover the whole earth, fulfilling the Gospel commission (Matthew 28:19–20).

## Slide 17 – Q8: The Sabbath’s Origin

- **Question:** For whom was the Sabbath made? “The Sabbath was made for man." Mark 2:27.
- **Key Text:** Mark 2:27 – “And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Universal Gift

- **"Man" (Anthropos):** The Greek word refers to generic "mankind" or "humanity," not specifically Jews.
- **Timing:** Established at Creation (Genesis 2:1–3), over 2,000 years before the Jewish nation existed.
- **Purpose:** Made *for* man—for his benefit, rest, and connection with the Creator. A gift, not a burden.

## Slide 19 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Family Estate:**
    - If a father gives a beautiful estate to his first son, and that son has many descendants, the estate belongs to the family line.
    - The Sabbath was given to Adam, the father of the human race.
    - Therefore, every descendant of Adam—African, Asian, European, or Jew—inherits the blessing.
    - It is the birthright of humanity.

## Slide 20 – Q9: The Reserved Day

- **Question:** What particular day did God reserve for the Sabbath, and command man to keep? “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20:10.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:10 – “But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Lord’s Day

- **Specific:** God did not say "one day in seven," but "*The* seventh day."
- **Ownership:** It is the Sabbath "of the Lord." It belongs to Him ("My holy day" – Isaiah 58:13).
- **Conclusion:** If the Sabbath is the Lord's day, and the Lord is the God of the Gentiles (Q1), then the Sabbath is the day for Gentiles to worship their God.

## Slide 22 – Q10: The Blessing

- **Question:** What does the Lord, through Isaiah, pronounce upon those who keep the Sabbath? “Blessed is the man [any man] that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil." Isa. 56:2.
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 56:2 – “Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points

- **Universal Scope:** "The Son of Man" applies to any human being.
- **Holiness of Life:**
    - Sabbath keeping is linked to keeping one's hand from "doing any evil."
    - The Sabbath is a sign of sanctification (Exodus 31:13).
    - A person cannot truly keep the Sabbath holy while living a life of known sin.
    - It signifies the rest from the works of sin we find in Christ (Hebrews 4:3-10).

## Slide 24 – Q11: The Stranger’s Assurance

- **Question:** How does he say the stranger (Gentile) should feel when uniting with his people? “Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the Lord. speak. saying. The Lord hath utterly separated me from His people." Isa. 56:3.
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 56:3 – “Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: No Separation

- **No Caste System:** God addresses feelings of exclusion. There is no second-class citizenship in His plan.
- **Union in Christ:** Christ has "broken down the middle wall of partition" (Ephesians 2:14).
- **Equality:** In Sabbath observance, the Gentile stands on equal holy ground with the Jew.

## Slide 26 – Q12: The Covenant Promise

- **Question:** What does He say He will do for the stranger who keeps His Sabbath? “Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve Him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be His servants, everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even them will I bring to My holy mountain. and make them joyful in My house of prayer... The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will gather others to Him, beside those that are gathered unto Him." Isa. 56:6-8.
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 56:6-7 – “Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD... every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer...”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points & Application

- **The Sequence:** Join -> Serve -> Love -> Keep.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We keep the Sabbath because we love the Lord and have joined ourselves to Him. It is the outward sign of an inward relationship.
- **The Covenant:** Sabbath-keeping is equated with "taking hold of My covenant." It is the seal of allegiance.
- **The Promise:** God brings these gathered "others" to His holy mountain (the Church).

## Slide 28 – Q13: Paul at Antioch

- **Question:** What two classes did Paul once address at Antioch on the Sabbath? Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience." Acts 13:16.
- **Key Text:** Acts 13:16 – “Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Unified Worship

- **Two Groups:**
    1.  **Men of Israel:** Born Jews.
    2.  **Ye that fear God:** Gentiles who worshipped the true God.
- **Significance:** Both groups were present *on the Sabbath*. The "God-fearing" Gentiles did not have a separate service; they worshipped on the same day as the Jews.

## Slide 30 – Q14: The Church in Philippi

- **Question:** Under what conditions was the church established in the Gentile city of Philippi? "And from hence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony; and we were in that city abiding certain days. And on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither." Acts 16:12, 13.
- **Key Text:** Acts 16:13 – “And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: Apostolic Example

- **Gentile Context:** Philippi was a Gentile stronghold with no synagogue.
- **Paul's Custom:** Paul sought a place of prayer "on the Sabbath," even without a formal Jewish service.
- **The Result:** Lydia was converted, and the church was born—founded on a Sabbath prayer meeting by a river.

## Slide 32 – Q15: Paul at Corinth

- **Question:** At Corinth, what two classes assembled on the Sabbath to listen to the apostle's discourses? “And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks [Gentiles] ." Acts 18:4.
- **Key Text:** Acts 18:4 – “And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.”

## Slide 33 – Q15: Consistency

- **Mixed Audience:** In this cosmopolitan Greek city, Paul used the Sabbath to persuade both "Jews and Greeks."
- **Missed Opportunity?** If the Sabbath had been abolished, Paul lost a prime opportunity to tell the Greeks they didn't need to attend on Saturday. Instead, he utilized the Sabbath for universal instruction.

## Slide 34 – Q16: Universal Instruction

- **Question:** How long had Moses and the prophets been read in the synagogues? And how extensively were they taught? “For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day." Acts 15:21.
- **Key Text:** Acts 15:21 – “For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.”

## Slide 35 – Q16: The Bible of the Early Church

- **"Moses":** Refers to the Old Testament Scriptures.
- **Education:** The New Testament was not yet written. Early Christians, including Gentiles, learned the Gospel by hearing the OT types and prophecies explained on the Sabbath.
- **"In Every City":** The Sabbath was the great educational institution for the knowledge of God across the ancient world.

## Slide 36 – Q17: The Mixed Multitude

- **Question:** Of what two classes was the "congregation of Israel" made up? “And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle." Ex. 12:38.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 12:38 – “And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.”

## Slide 37 – Q17: Key Points

- **Not Just Ethnic:** The Exodus included Egyptians and foreigners who chose the God of Israel.
- **Church in the Wilderness:** This "mixed multitude" (Acts 7:38) proves the church has always been open to whosoever will come. They crossed the Red Sea and ate manna alongside Jacob's descendants.

## Slide 38 – Q18: Equality Before the Law

- **Question:** How were these "strangers" regarded? “One law shall be to him that is home born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you." Ex. 12:49.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 12:49 – “One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.”

## Slide 39 – Q18: Key Points

- **No Double Standard:** There was not one code for the Israelite and a looser one for the convert. Both were saved by the Passover lamb; both walked in obedience.
- **Kingdom Principle:** "One law" governs the Kingdom. There is not one Sabbath for the Jew and a different day for the Gentile.

## Slide 40 – Q19: Human Nature

- **Question:** Who murmured against Moses and Aaron after entering the wilderness? “And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness." Ex. 16:2.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:2 – “And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:”

## Slide 41 – Q19: Key Points

- **"Whole Congregation":** Includes both natural-born Israelites and the mixed multitude.
- **Unified Dissatisfaction:** They were united in lack of faith.
- **Lesson:** Human nature is the same in every race—prone to distrust God’s providence.

## Slide 42 – Q20: The Manna Test

- **Question:** How did God prove the whole congregation? “Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you: and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in My law, or no." Ex. 16:4.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:4 – “Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.”

## Slide 43 – Q20: Law Before Sinai

- **The Test:** Would they trust God to provide double on Friday and rest on Sabbath?
- **"My Law":** Proves the Sabbath law existed and was binding *before* the Ten Commandments were written on stone at Sinai.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** The test was about trust. Sabbath-keeping is a fruit of trusting God to sustain us.

## Slide 44 – Q21: The Failure

- **Question:** How did the people stand the test? “And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws?" Ex. 16:27, 28.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:27-28 – “And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?”

## Slide 45 – Q21: Key Points

- **Unbelief & Disobedience:** By going out, they showed they didn't believe God's word (that there was none) and didn't obey His command (to rest).
- **God's Response:** "How long refuse ye...?" applies to the mixed multitude and Israelites equally. God held both responsible.

## Slide 46 – Q22: The Reform

- **Question:** How did all "the people" heed this stern rebuke? “So the people rested on the seventh day." Ex. 16:30.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:30 – “So the people rested on the seventh day.”

## Slide 47 – Q22: Key Points

- **The Result:** The rebuke brought reform. "The people"—the entire mixed company—rested.
- **Lesson:** God treats Jew and Gentile alike. The Sabbath is the test of whether we will "walk in God's law or no."

## Slide 48 – Q23: Oral Instruction

- **Question:** What instruction did Moses immediately begin giving to the people?” When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statute of God, and His laws." Ex. 18:16.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 18:16 – “When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.”

## Slide 49 – Q23: Key Points

- **Before Sinai:** This occurs in Exodus 18, before the giving of the law in Exodus 20.
- **Knowledge of God:** The principles of God's government (including the Sabbath) were known to the patriarchs and taught to the mixed multitude before the mountain smoked.

## Slide 50 – Q24: The Stranger in the Commandment

- **Question:** When God gave the Sabbath commandment from Sinai, did He mention these Gentiles by name? “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates." Ex. 20:10.
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:10 – “...nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:”

## Slide 51 – Q24: Key Points

- **Explicit Command:** The Fourth Commandment uniquely lists who must rest.
- **"Thy Stranger":** God explicitly commanded that the Gentile living among them was to keep the Sabbath.
- **Universal Jurisdiction:** The command applies to the "stranger," proving the Sabbath is not a mere ceremonial Jewish sign, but a territorial and universal law of God.

## Slide 52 – Q25: Solomon’s Prayer

- **Question:** What prayer did Solomon offer at the dedication of the temple, concerning the privileges and duties of the stranger? “Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of Thy people Israel, ...when he shall come and pray toward this house, hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to Thee for; that all people of the earth may know Thy name, to fear Thee as do Thy people Israel." 1 Kings 8:41-43.
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 8:41-43 – “Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel... when he shall come and pray toward this house; Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place... that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel...”

## Slide 53 – Q25: Sanctuary & Mission

- **Missionary Purpose:** The goal of the Temple service was "that all people of the earth may know Thy name."
- **Sanctuary Truth:** The earthly sanctuary was a model. Just as the stranger could pray toward the earthly temple, Gentiles today look by faith into the Heavenly Sanctuary where Christ ministers.

## Slide 54 – Q26: The New Earth

- **Question:** When all the redeemed people of the earth shall come up to worship before God in the new earth, what day will still be recognized by them?” And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord." Isa. 66:23.
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 66:23 – “And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.”

## Slide 55 – Q26: Eden to Eden

- **Restoration:** The Sabbath was established in Eden (Genesis 2) and continues in the New Earth (Isaiah 66).
- **"All Flesh":** Confirms the universal nature. Not just Jews, but the redeemed of every nation will gather on God's holy day.
- **Conclusion:** The Sabbath unites God with His people across all ages. It is, and has always been, the Lord's Day for all mankind.

## Slide 56 – Q26: Illustration

- **The Flag:**
    - A flag represents a nation.
    - It doesn't matter if a citizen is natural-born or naturalized; they both salute the same flag.
    - The Sabbath is the "flag" of God's government (Ezekiel 20:12, 20).
    - Whether natural branches (Jews) or grafted in (Gentiles), we all salute the same King by honoring His flag—the holy Sabbath.
