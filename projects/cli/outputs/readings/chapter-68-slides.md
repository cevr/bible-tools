- **Question:** What assurance is given to every believer in Christ?
- **Key Text:** John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **The Foundation:** This verse establishes the plan of salvation based on God’s love, not human merit.
- **The Gift:** 
  - God provided the remedy: His own Son.
  - Just as a lamb died for the sinner in the ancient sanctuary, God provided the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29).
- **The Condition (Faith):**
  - Biblical belief is not just intellectual agreement.
  - It is a transaction of the heart where the sinner trusts fully in Christ’s merits for pardon (Acts 16:31).
- **The Result:** "Everlasting life"—a restoration of the life Adam lost in Eden.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Burning Building:**
  - Imagine a man trapped in a fire. A firefighter breaks in, wraps the man in protective gear, and carries him out.
  - The man is saved not by his own bravery, but because he trusted the firefighter to carry him.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - We are perishing in sin.
  - Christ wraps us in His righteousness and carries us to safety.
  - Our part is to yield; His part is to save.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Gospel Message
- **Question:** What wonderful truth is revealed in the gospel message?
- **Key Text:** Romans 1:17 – “For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Righteousness of God:**
  - We have no righteousness of our own (Isaiah 64:6).
  - The gospel reveals God’s perfect character and obedience, which He offers to us.
- **From Faith to Faith:**
  - The Christian life is a progressive journey.
  - We begin by faith (Justification) and continue to grow by faith (Sanctification).
- **Living by Faith:**
  - **Justification:** A legal declaration that the sinner is accounted righteous through Christ.
  - **Daily Experience:** We do not obey to *be* saved; we obey *because* we are saved and indwelt by Christ.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Deep-Sea Diver:**
  - A diver relies entirely on the air line connected to the ship above.
  - As long as the connection remains open, he lives. If he tries to breathe on his own, he dies.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - "Living by faith" means drawing spiritual life from Jesus, our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, moment by moment.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Life and Immortality

- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 1:10 – “Who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points
- **Death Abolished:**
  - Christ has broken the permanent power of death.
  - For the believer, death is now merely a "sleep" awaiting the resurrection (1 Thessalonians 4:13–14).
- **Immortality Brought to Light:**
  - Humans are mortal; we do not possess natural immortality (1 Timothy 6:16).
  - Immortality is a gift bestowed only through the gospel.

  - You cannot have life without righteousness.
  - **Sin:** By definition, is separation from God (the Source of life).
  - **Righteousness:** Is the life of God in the soul.
- **The Pathway:**
  - Righteousness by faith is a "pathway" of living.
  - As we walk in obedience through the Spirit, we walk in the path of life.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Train on the Tracks:**
  - As long as a train stays on the tracks, it moves forward safely.
  - If it leaves the tracks, the result is a wreck (death).
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The tracks (God’s way of righteousness) are not a burden.
  - They are the condition for effective operation and safety.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Finding Righteousness
- **Question:** Finding righteousness, what else do we find?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 21:21 – “He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

  - The Christian actively seeks to reflect Christ’s character ("righteousness") and compassion ("mercy").
- **What We Find:**
  - **Life:** Spiritual vitality now and eternal life later.
  - **Righteousness:** We find Christ’s character becoming our own.
  - **Honour:** The privilege of being called "sons of God" (1 John 3:1).
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - This is the work of the Holy Spirit *inside* the believer.
  - It changes the heart and empowers obedience to God's law.

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Source of Grace
- **Question:** Who alone can give us the grace that leads to eternal life?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:21 – “That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points
- **Two Kingdoms:**
  - **Reign of Sin:** A tyrant leading to death.
  - **Reign of Grace:** Mightier than sin; leads to life.
- **Grace Through Righteousness:**
  - Grace does not ignore the law.
  - Christ fulfilled the law (life) and paid its penalty (death), offering His victory to us.
- **Sanctuary Insight:**
  - The mercy seat (grace) rested *above* the ark containing the Commandments (righteousness).
  - Grace rests on a foundation of righteousness and leads us to keep the law.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration
- **The King's Grace:**
  - If a king pardons a criminal, that is an act of grace.
  - If the king adopts him, pays his debts, and gives him a position at court, grace is "reigning."
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - God does not just pardon; He transforms us to be fit for His kingdom.

## Slide 17 – Q7: God’s Commandments Defined
- **Question:** What do the Psalms declare God's commandments to be?
- **Key Text:** Psalms 119:172 – “My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points
- **The Standard:**
  - To see "righteousness" in action, look at the Ten Commandments.
  - The law is a transcript of God’s righteous character.
- **The Human Problem:**
  - Fallen man cannot keep this perfect law in his own strength (Romans 8:7).
- **The Divine Solution:**
  - We need Christ (the Living Law) to dwell in our hearts.
  - When He enters, He brings the righteousness the law requires (Romans 8:4).

## Slide 19 – Q8: Jesus on the Commandments
- **Question:** What does Jesus say that those commandments are?
- **Key Text:** John 12:50 – “And I know that His commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

  - In Eden, obedience was the condition for access to the tree of life.
- **New Covenant:**
  - God writes the law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
  - When the law is loved and obeyed through the Spirit, it results in life.
- **Harmony:**
  - We cannot be at war with God (the Source of Life) and expect to have eternal life.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Name of Christ
- **Question:** What does the prophet Jeremiah declare Christ to be?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 23:6 – “In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points
- **Our Deficiency:**
  - Our "best" deeds are like filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).
- **His Sufficiency:**
  - He is the LORD (Divine) and He is Righteousness (Perfect).
- **The Great Exchange:**
  - He takes our sin at the cross.
  - He gives us His righteousness by faith.
  - In the judgment, the Father sees the perfect life of His Son covering the believer.

## Slide 23 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Royal Robe:**
  - A pauper invites himself to a royal wedding but has only dirty rags.
  - The Prince places His own royal robe on the pauper.
  - The pauper is now dressed for the King's presence.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The robe is the Prince’s, not the pauper’s.
  - Christ covers us with His character so we may stand before God.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Essential to Eternal Life
- **Question:** What did Christ tell us was essential to eternal life?
- **Key Text:** John 14:6 – “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points
- **Christ IS the Way:**
  - He does not just teach the way; He is the Way.
  - He does not just give life; He is the Life.
- **Exclusivity:**
  - No human philosophy, ancestry, or good works can bridge the gap of sin.
- **Relationship:**
  - Righteousness is not an abstract concept.
  - To possess Christ is to possess life (1 John 5:12).

## Slide 26 – Q11: Receiving Righteousness
- **Question:** How do we receive righteousness?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 19:17 – “And He said unto him, Why callest thou Me good? there is none good but One, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points
- **The Standard Remains:**
  - Jesus confirms that entering life requires keeping the commandments.
  - God cannot lower His standard of righteousness.
- **The Solution:**
  - We have all sinned and cannot keep the law perfectly on our own.
  - We must receive the "One who is good"—Jesus.
  - **Sanctification:** When we receive Him by faith, His Spirit empowers us to keep the commandments from a heart of love (Romans 13:10).

## Slide 28 – Q12: Receiving Eternal Life
- **Question:** How do we receive eternal life?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:17 – “For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points
- **A Gift to Receive:**
  - Salvation is a transaction of receiving, not earning.
  - It is the "gift of righteousness."
- **Abundance of Grace:**
  - God gives grace sufficient to overcome every tendency to sin.
- **Reigning in Life:**
  - Through Christ (the second Adam), believers are not just survivors.
  - We are made kings and priests to reign over the power of sin.

## Slide 30 – Q13: Obtaining Eternal Life
- **Question:** How do we obtain eternal life?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points
- **Wages vs. Gift:**
  - **Wage:** What we have earned (death).
  - **Gift:** What God offers through Christ (life).
- **Transformation:**
  - The gift changes the receiver.
  - Seeing Christ's sacrifice softens the heart and leads to repentance.
  - We do not repent to earn love; we repent because we see His love (Romans 2:4).

## Slide 32 – Q13: Illustration
- **The Rebellious Child:**
  - A child breaks a valuable heirloom and expects punishment (wages).
  - The father pays for the damage and embraces the child (gift).
  - The child’s heart melts; he no longer wants to rebel, but desires to please the father.
- **The Lesson:**
  - This is how the "gift of God" produces a righteous life.

## Slide 33 – Q13: Application (Steps to Christ)
- **The Power of the Cross:**
  - "Christ must be revealed to the sinner as the Saviour dying for the sins of the world."
  - Beholding His love inspires contrition and repentance.
