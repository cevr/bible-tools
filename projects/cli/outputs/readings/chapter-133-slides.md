## Slide 1 – Q1: The Purpose of Promises
- **Question:** For what were the precious promises of the word written?
- **Key Text:** Romans 15:4 – “For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **Handbook of Salvation:** The Bible is not merely ancient history; it is designed for our present spiritual survival.
- **Character of God:** We study the history of God’s dealings—trials, failures, and deliverances—to understand His character.
- **Source of Hope:** By seeing how God delivered His people in the past, we gain hope for our own deliverance.
- **Divine Nature:** Through the promises, we partake of the divine nature.
  - 2 Peter 1:4 – “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”
- **Comfort in Battle:** The Christian walk is a battle against the flesh. The Word provides the endurance needed to continue until the end.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Hiker in the Dark:**
  - Imagine a hiker in a treacherous mountain pass at night.
  - Without a light or map, he would despair and stop.
  - **Application:** Scripture is the map and the lantern.
  - Psalm 119:105 – “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”
  - The stories of those who walked before us give us the patience to keep moving forward.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The God of Patience
- **Question:** What is the Father Himself called?
- **Key Text:** Romans 15:5 – “Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points
- **God’s Character:** Patience originates in God’s nature.
  - Exodus 34:6 – “And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.”
- **Imputed Righteousness (Justification):** Because God is patient, He holds back immediate judgment to give us time to repent (2 Peter 3:9). He accepts us in Christ.
- **Imparted Righteousness (Sanctification):** By beholding the God of patience, we are changed into His image.
  - 2 Corinthians 3:18 – “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”
- **Sanctuary Connection:** Our High Priest bears with the ignorance of the people, working to bring them to perfection before the final judgment.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Master Artist:**
  - An apprentice makes clumsy strokes and mistakes on the canvas.
  - The Master does not throw the canvas away in anger.
  - He patiently corrects the student’s hand until the student learns the Master’s touch.
  - **Lesson:** God is the patient Master working to reproduce the image of Jesus in us.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Command to Be Patient
- **Question:** Is patience enjoined upon us in Holy Writ?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 5:14 – “Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.”
- **Key Text:** Luke 21:19 – “In your patience possess ye your souls.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points
- **Self-Control:** "Possess ye your souls" implies self-mastery through the Holy Spirit. Losing patience means handing control to the lower nature or the enemy.
- **Toward "All" Men:** We must be patient not just with friends, but with the irritating, the unjust, and enemies of truth.
- **Victory over Temper:** A "quick temper" is not a personality trait to be excused; it is a sin to be overcome.
- **Sanctification Defined:**
  - Sanctification is the work of grace cleansing the believer from sin and resulting in obedience.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The City Gatekeeper:**
  - A city under siege must keep its gates barred.
  - If the gates are flung open in panic or rage, the enemy rushes in.
  - **Lesson:** Patience is the gatekeeper of the soul.
  - When we "possess our souls," we keep the gates barred against temptations to anger and retaliation.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Patience vs. Hasty Spirit
- **Question:** What contrast in drawn between the patient and the hasty spirit?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 14:29 – “He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding; but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points
- **Hasty of Spirit:** This is impulsiveness—reacting without consulting God. It "exalteth folly" (puts stupidity on display).
- **Slow to Wrath:** This shows "great understanding." The patient person realizes that reacting in anger serves Satan's purpose in the Great Controversy.
- **The Law of Love:** A hasty spirit violates the law of love.
  - 1 Corinthians 13:4 – “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.”
- **The Response of Faith:** The believer claims Christ's power to pause, pray, and respond with the Spirit of Jesus.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Spark and the Fire:**
  - A small spark lands in dry grass.
  - If stomped out immediately (patience), no damage is done.
  - If the wind catches it (hasty spirit), it becomes a destructive wildfire.
  - **Lesson:** A hasty word often starts a fire that cannot be easily put out.
  - James 3:5 – “Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Examples of Patience
- **Question:** What worthy persons did James refer to, while dwelling on patience?
- **Key Text:** James 5:10 – “Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.”
- **Key Text:** James 5:11 – “Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points
- **The Prophets:** They were often persecuted and ignored, yet they patiently continued to speak the truth.
- **Job’s Experience:** Job represents a test of motives in the Great Controversy.
  - Satan claimed Job served God only for blessings (selfishness).
  - Job lost everything yet maintained his trust.
  - Job 13:15 – “Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.”
- **Suffering and Glory:** True patience is only revealed when things go wrong. There are no "fair-weather" Christians who are truly patient.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration
- **Coal into Diamond:**
  - A diamond is merely a piece of coal that has endured extreme pressure and heat.
  - **Lesson:** The prophets and Job are spiritual diamonds.
  - The pressure of their trials did not crush them; it crystallized their character into something precious.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Waiting for Christ
- **Question:** For what glorious event are the children of God bidden patiently to wait?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 3:5 – “And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.”
- **Key Text:** James 5:7 – “Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points
- **The Husbandman (Farmer):** We cannot rush the harvest. We must wait for the "early rain" (conversion) and "latter rain" (final Spirit outpouring).
- **Stablish Your Hearts:** To be "stablished" means to be rooted in truth for the end times.
  - 2 Peter 1:12 – “Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.”
- **Sanctuary Application:** We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
  - While Jesus finishes His work in the Most Holy Place, we must patiently afflict our souls and put away sin.
  - Hebrews 9:28 – “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Foundation:**
  - When a builder pours concrete, he must wait for it to cure.
  - If he builds while it is wet, the structure collapses.
  - **Lesson:** God is "curing" our characters—settling us into the truth—so we can stand in the final storm.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Rewards of Endurance
- **Question:** What good things are spoken of those who endure?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 10:22 – “And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.”
- **Key Text:** James 1:12 – “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points
- **Endurance to the End:** Salvation is for those who finish the race. We must rely on Christ continually.
- **The Crown of Life:** The reward is the "crown of righteousness" for those who loved His appearing.
  - 2 Timothy 4:8 – “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”
- **Happiness in Trial:** The "blessing" is a purified character that can stand in God's presence.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Righteousness by Faith:** The believer has no righteousness of their own but trusts wholly in Christ.
- **Imputed & Imparted:**
  - Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.”
  - Christ’s righteousness is imputed for pardon and imparted for power to obey.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Marathon Runner:**
  - A runner may be exhausted and in pain during the race.
  - Yet, there is a joy and "blessedness" in crossing the finish line.
  - The endurance itself yields the victory that spectators never know.

## Slide 23 – Q8: The Purpose of Trials
- **Question:** What does the trying of faith work?
- **Key Text:** James 1:3 – “Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.”
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:3 – “And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points
- **Faith Muscles:** Faith grows strong only when resistance is applied.
- **Tribulation (Threshing):** The word comes from *tribulum*, a threshing sledge used to separate wheat from chaff.
  - God uses trials to separate the chaff of selfishness and pride from our character.
- **Patience (Hypomone):** Meaning "abiding under." The ability to remain steadfast under a heavy load.
- **Preparation:** This character is essential for those who will stand during the final events (Revelation 15:8).

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration
- **Iron and the Fire:**
  - Cold iron is hard and brittle.
  - When placed in the fire, it becomes soft and pliable.
  - The blacksmith can then shape it into a useful tool.
  - **Lesson:** Trials are the fire that makes us pliable in the hands of the Creator.

## Slide 26 – Q9: The Patience of the Saints
- **Question:** What will be one of the characteristic traits of those who shall prepare for the second coming of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points
- **Mark of the Remnant:** This verse describes the people living just before the harvest (Second Coming).
- **Keeping the Commandments:** Not just in theory, but in practice. Their lives are in harmony with God's law through Christ's power.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.”
- **The Faith OF Jesus:** They possess the same quality of trust and dependence that Jesus had.
- **Victory over Sin:** This group vindicates God’s law, proving that grace can produce obedience even in the last days.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Reflection:**
  - A reflection in a pool of water is only clear when the water is perfectly still.
  - If the water is agitated or muddy, the image is distorted.
  - **Lesson:** The "patience of the saints" describes a people so calm and settled in truth that they perfectly reflect Jesus to the world.

## Slide 29 – Q10: The Believer's Attitude
- **Question:** What should be the language of every heart?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 130:5 – “I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points
- **Soul Waiting:** An intense longing, like a watchman waiting for the morning (Psalm 130:6).
- **Hope in the Word:** Feelings fluctuate; God’s Word does not.
  - Isaiah 40:8 – “The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.”
- **Practical Obedience:** In every decision or delay, we ask: "What has God promised?" and move forward in obedience.

## Slide 31 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Ship in the Storm:**
  - Passengers may be terrified by the waves.
