### Q1. In his mention of the "little horn," what does the prophet say that power should think to do?

**Scripture:**
"And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time." (Daniel 7:25)

**Answer:**
The prophet Daniel here unmasks the activities of a power known in prophecy as the "little horn." Based on the historicist interpretation of prophecy—which views these symbols as covering the span of history from Babylon to the Second Coming—this power represents the religious-political system that grew out of the Roman Empire (the Papacy).

There are three primary characteristics highlighted in this text regarding this power's relationship to God and His people:

1.  **Speaking Against the Most High:** It claims prerogatives that belong only to God.
2.  **Persecuting the Saints:** It attempts to force the conscience through civil power ("wearing out the saints").
3.  **Thinking to Change Times and Laws:** This is a direct assault on the government of God.

**The Attack on the Law:**
The text says this power will "think" to change times and laws. It cannot actually change God’s law, for the law is as eternal as God’s character (Psalm 111:7–8; Matthew 5:18), but it would *attempt* to do so in the minds and practices of men.

*   **Which Law?** The text refers to the moral law, the Ten Commandments. Ceremonial laws regarding sacrifices met their fulfillment in Christ (Colossians 2:14–17), but the moral law remains the standard of righteousness.
*   **"Times":** The only commandment dealing with time is the fourth: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8–11). This commandment identifies the Creator and the memorial of His creative power.
*   **The Implication:** By attempting to shift the solemnity of the Sabbath from the seventh day (Saturday) to the first day (Sunday), this power sets its authority above Scripture.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
Understanding this prophecy is vital for the experience of **Righteousness by Faith**.
*   **Definition:** Righteousness by Faith is the experience where the believer, having been justified (declared righteous) by Christ's blood, is now empowered by His Spirit to live in obedience to God’s law (Romans 3:31; 8:4).
*   True faith always leads to obedience (Romans 1:5). If a power claims we can ignore a commandment of God (the Sabbath) and substitute a tradition of man, it is teaching **righteousness by works**—the idea that human authority or tradition can grant holiness.
*   To keep the Sabbath as God commanded is an act of faith; it acknowledges God as the supreme Lawgiver and Creator. To keep a substitute day is to acknowledge the authority of the church over the Word of God.

**Sanctuary Insight:**
In the earthly sanctuary, the Ten Commandments were placed inside the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place (Exodus 25:16, 21). This illustrates that the law is the foundation of God’s throne and government. When the "little horn" attacks the law, it is attacking the very foundation of God's sanctuary and His rule over the universe.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a builder has a master blueprint from the architect. If a foreman comes along and changes the measurements on the blueprint, he is "thinking to change" the design. He cannot change the architect's original mind, but he can cause the workers to build a crooked house. God’s Law is the blueprint of His character. The "little horn" has altered the blueprint in the minds of millions, leading them to build a spiritual house on the sand of human tradition rather than the rock of God’s Word.

### Q2. What does Paul say the "man of sin" should do?

**Scripture:**
“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.” (2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4)

**Answer:**
The Apostle Paul, writing centuries after Daniel, describes the same apostate power using the titles "man of sin" and "son of perdition." Paul warns the early church that before Christ returns, a great "falling away" (apostasy) must occur within the church itself.

**Key Characteristics:**

1.  **The Falling Away (Apostasy):** This was not an attack from outside pagan forces, but a corruption from within. It is a gradual drift from the purity of the gospel to a religion of forms, ceremonies, and human hierarchy.
2.  **Exalting Himself Above God:** How does a human power do this?
    *   By claiming titles that belong to Christ (e.g., "Holy Father," "Head of the Church").
    *   By claiming the power to forgive sins (a prerogative of God alone—Mark 2:7).
    *   By instituting laws that contradict God’s laws (changing the Sabbath).
3.  **Sitting in the Temple:**
    *   **Sanctuary Connection:** The "temple" here refers to the church (the spiritual temple, see 1 Corinthians 3:16). By "sitting" in this position, this power usurps the place of the Holy Spirit and Christ.
    *   Instead of directing people to the **High Priest in the Heavenly Sanctuary** (Jesus) for forgiveness and mediation (1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 8:1–2), this system directs people to earthly priests and human mediators. This obscures Christ's ministry.

**The Definition of Sin:**
The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). Therefore, the "Man of Sin" is the "Man of Lawlessness." By setting aside the Law of God—specifically the Sabbath commandment—this power promotes lawlessness under the guise of religion.

**Victory in Christ:**
This prophecy warns us against the spirit of self-exaltation. The essence of sin is pride—putting "I" in the place of God (Isaiah 14:12–14).
*   **Justification:** We are saved only when we humble ourselves, admitting we are bankrupt, and accepting Christ's righteousness by faith (Luke 18:13–14).
*   **Sanctification:** We grow in holiness only by submitting daily to God's will.
*   The "man of sin" represents the opposite spirit: human pride and self-sufficiency. To resist this power, we must have the law of God written in our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Hebrews 10:16).

**[ILL]**
Suppose a Vice President enters the President's office, sits in his chair, and begins signing executive orders that contradict the President's existing laws. Even if he wears the President's suit, he is a usurper. The "man of sin" has seated himself in the church, issuing commands (like Sunday sacredness) that contradict the King of Kings. True subjects of the King will check the original Law Book (the Bible) and obey the rightful Ruler.

### Q3. What power has attempted to change the law of God?

**Historical Evidence:**
*   **Question** - "Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept?"
*   **Answer** - "Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is not scriptural authority." — *Doctrinal Catechism* (Catholic), page 174.

**Answer:**
The prophecy of Daniel 7 and Paul's warning in 2 Thessalonians find their historical fulfillment in the Papacy (the Roman Catholic Church system). As the provided catechism quote freely admits, this power claims the authority to change Biblical observances without Scriptural warrant.

**Key Points of the Admission:**
1.  **Admission of Substitution:** The church admits openly that it substituted Sunday (the first day) for Saturday (the seventh day).
2.  **Admission of Lack of Scripture:** The citation explicitly states there is "not scriptural authority" for this change.
3.  **The Claim of Power:** The change of the Sabbath is presented as the "mark" or proof of the church's ecclesiastical authority.

**The Theological Conflict:**
This issue goes far deeper than just a day of the week; it is a question of **authority**.
*   **Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone):** Protestantism was built on the belief that the Bible is the only rule of faith and practice (Isaiah 8:20; 2 Timothy 3:16).
*   **Tradition over Scripture:** By keeping Sunday, one accepts the authority of the church *over* the Bible. By keeping the seventh-day Sabbath, one accepts the authority of God *as revealed* in the Bible.

**Righteousness by Faith and Obedience:**
Why does this matter for the believer seeking righteousness?
*   **Legalism vs. Love:** Keeping the Sabbath is not an attempt to "earn" heaven (legalism). It is a response of love to the Creator who saved us (John 14:15).
*   **Rest in Christ:** The Sabbath is a sign of the "rest" we have in Jesus (Hebrews 4:9–10). Just as God finished His work of creation and rested, Jesus finished His work of redemption on the cross and rested in the tomb over the Sabbath.
*   **Sanctification:** God says the Sabbath is a sign "that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you" (Exodus 31:13). It reminds us that we cannot make ourselves holy; only God can do that.

**The Great Controversy:**
The final conflict in the Great Controversy will center on worship (Revelation 14:7, 9). Will we worship the Creator, who made "heaven, and earth, and the sea" (referenced in the Sabbath commandment), or will we yield to the "beast" power that changed God's law? The call of the Third Angel is to return to the "commandments of God and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).

Imagine you receive a letter claiming to be from your father, giving you specific instructions on how to manage the family estate. However, a stranger tells you, "Your father wrote that, but I have the authority to cross out his lines and write my own. You must listen to me, not the letter." Honoring your father means following his written word, not the stranger's edits. Keeping the Bible Sabbath is honoring our Heavenly Father's original, unchangeable letter of love.
