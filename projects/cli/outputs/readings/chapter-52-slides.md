## Slide 1 – Q1: The Third Angel’s Warning
- Question: Against whose worship are the dwellers of earth warned by the third angel?
- Key Text: Revelation 14:9 – “And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **A Solemn Warning:**
  - This is the most serious warning in the entire Bible, focused on the central conflict of the last days: worship.
- **The Object of Worship:**
  - Worship is an act of allegiance.
  - Worshipping the beast aligns a person with a system that opposes God’s government and law.
- **The Wrath of God:**
  - Defined as judgment unmixed with mercy (Revelation 14:10 – “The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation...” ).
  - It is the final justice upon those who stubbornly refuse salvation.
- **No Neutral Ground:**
  - Every person will face a decision: receive the seal of God (Revelation 7:2 – “...having the seal of the living God”) or the mark of the beast.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Danger Sign:**
  - Imagine a bridge washed away on a dark mountain road.
  - A man stands waving a red lantern and shouting frantically, not out of anger, but out of a desperate desire to save drivers from death.
  - Similarly, the Third Angel’s message, though stern and loud, is a message of love.
  - God is striving to save humanity from the fatal consequences of false worship.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Beast from the Sea
- Question: What beast had been seen coming up out of the sea?
- Key Text: Revelation 13:1 – “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points
- **Origin:**
  - The “sea” represents multitudes, nations, and tongues (Revelation 17:15 – “The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.”).
  - This power rises from a densely populated area (Europe).
- **Identity:**
  - Historicist prophecy identifies this as the Papacy (Roman Church-State), rising after the fall of pagan Rome.
  - It absorbs characteristics of previous empires: Babylon (lion), Medo-Persia (bear), Greece (leopard), and Rome (dragon) (Daniel 7).
- **Blasphemy:**
  - Biblically defined as a man claiming to be God (John 10:33) or claiming power to forgive sins (Mark 2:7).
  - This power claims prerogatives belonging only to Christ.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Sanctuary Connection
- **The High Priest:**
  - The earthly sanctuary had a High Priest who interceded for the people.
  - The beast power diverts attention from the true High Priest in heaven (Jesus) to an earthly priesthood.
- **Obscuring Christ’s Ministry:**
  - By setting up a human mediation system, this power obscures the “daily” ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary (Daniel 8:11–12).

## Slide 7 – Q3: Power to Make War
- Question: What power was given to this beast?
- Key Text: Revelation 13:7 – “And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points
- **War with the Saints:**
  - This describes the 1260-year period (Daniel 7:25; Revelation 12:14) often called the “Dark Ages.”
  - Millions were persecuted for holding to the Bible alone.
- **Universal Authority:**
  - The text indicates global influence over “all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.”
  - During its supremacy, this power dictated the conscience of the civilized world.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Application (Force vs. Love)
- **True Christianity:**
  - Jesus never uses force to compel conscience.
  - John 12:47 – “And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.”
- **The Spirit of Christ:**
  - God wins the heart by love, not the sword (Jeremiah 31:3 – “...Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.”).
  - Any system using force to enforce worship operates contrary to the Spirit of Jesus.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Result of Persecution
- Question: What was the result of his overcoming the saints?
- Key Text: Revelation 13:8 – “And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points
- **Universal Worship:**
  - Almost the entire world aligns with this power.
  - The only exception: those written in the Book of Life.
- **The Book of Life:**
  - The registry in the heavenly sanctuary of those who accepted Jesus (Philippians 4:3; Revelation 3:5).
- **The Lamb Slain:**
  - The plan of salvation was established before creation (1 Peter 1:19–20).
  - The “Lamb slain” refers to Christ’s atonement—His blood covers the sinner and cleanses the record of sin.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Anchor:**
  - A ship in a storm is safe only if its anchor holds in the bedrock.
  - The world is the storm; the Beast offers a false harbor.
  - Believers are those whose anchor is cast “within the veil” (Hebrews 6:19), held secure by the Slain Lamb.
  - If your name is in the Book of Life, you are anchored in Christ.

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Woman and the Martyrs
- Question: What did the "mother of harlots" do to the saints?
- Key Text: Revelation 17:6 – “And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points
- **Symbolism of the Woman:**
  - A pure woman represents God’s true church (Jeremiah 6:2).
  - A harlot represents an apostate church that has left Christ to ally with earthly kings.
- **Drunken with Blood:**
  - Describes the terrible extent of persecution.
  - The apostate church became intoxicated with the power to destroy those who upheld the truth.
- **The Martyrs:**
  - Those who “loved not their lives unto the death” (Revelation 12:11).
  - Their blood witnesses that obedience to God is more precious than life.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Spiritual Intoxication
- Question: And what did she succeed in accomplishing by her course?
- Key Text: Revelation 17:2 – “The inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points
- **The Wine of Babylon:**
  - Represents false doctrines that confuse the mind and impair spiritual judgment.
- **Spiritual Fornication:**
  - Occurs when the church seeks the support of the state to enforce her decrees.
  - Instead of trusting the Holy Spirit, the church relies on civil power.
- **Note:**
  - The beast of Revelation 13 and the woman of Revelation 17 represent the same Roman Church system—one emphasizing the political power, the other the ecclesiastical apostasy.

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Beast from the Earth
- Question: What other beast was seen to arise after the one last described?
- Key Text: Revelation 13:11 – “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points
- **Timing:**
  - Arises as the first beast receives its deadly wound (circa 1798 AD).
- **Out of the Earth:**
  - Unlike the sea (crowds), the “earth” represents a new, sparsely populated territory.
  - Prophecy identifies this as the **United States of America**.
- **Lamb-like Horns:**
  - Indicates youth, innocence, and a lack of kingly crowns (a republic).
  - Represents principles of civil and religious liberty.
- **Spake as a Dragon:**
  - Predicts a change in character: eventually using legislative power to speak with intolerance.

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Image to the Beast
- Question: What is the two-horned beast to do?
- Key Text: Revelation 13:14 – “Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword, and did live.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points
- **What is an Image?**
  - An image is a likeness or copy.
  - The first beast was a church clothed with civil power.
  - An “image” is a similar system: Protestantism seeking state aid to enforce religious observances.
- **Restoring Authority:**
  - By creating this image, the second beast heals the influence of the first.
  - It brings back the methods of the Dark Ages under a modern guise.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Mark of the Beast
- Question: What will the two horned beast require all under its jurisdiction to receive?
- Key Text: Revelation 13:16 – “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points
- **The Mark:**
  - A sign of allegiance to the beast’s authority.
- **The Forehead:**
  - Represents the mind, intellect, and conscience.
  - Received by those intellectually convinced or deceived by the system.
- **The Hand:**
  - Represents labor and action.
  - Received by those who comply for convenience, business, or fear, regardless of belief.
- **Universal:**
  - No class is exempt (“small and great, rich and poor”).

## Slide 23 – Q9: Application (Heart vs. Force)
- **The Seal vs. The Mark:**
  - God seals His people in the forehead (Revelation 7:3), representing a conviction of truth.
  - God never seals in the hand; He does not want forced obedience.
- **The Enemy’s Tactic:**
  - Satan is satisfied with the “hand” (forced compliance) if he cannot capture the heart.
  - True Righteousness by Faith involves a heart yielded to God in love.

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Economic Boycott
- Question: What will be the result?
- Key Text: Revelation 13:17 – “And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points
- **The Penalty:**
  - Refusing the mark results in an economic boycott (unable to buy or sell).
- **Total Dependence:**
  - Believers are thrown entirely upon God’s providence.
- **God’s Promise:**
  - As He fed Elijah and the Israelites, He will sustain His people.
  - Isaiah 33:16 – “He shall dwell on high... bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Bird on the Branch:**
  - A bird sleeping on a branch does not worry if the branch breaks.
  - Its trust is not in the branch, but in its own wings.
  - The Christian’s trust is not in the “branch” of the world’s economy.
  - Our trust is in the “wings” of the Almighty (Psalm 91:4 – “He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust...”).

## Slide 27 – Q11: The Death Decree
- Question: How much power is to be given to the image of the beast?
- Key Text: Revelation 13:15 – “And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points
- **Speaking and Causing:**
  - A nation “speaks” through laws/legislation.
  - A nation “causes” through executive/police power.
- **Escalation:**
  - The boycott escalates to a death decree.
  - This mirrors the intolerance of the past.
- **The Final Test:**
  - The ultimate test of faith: Do we love life more than we love Jesus? (Matthew 16:25).

## Slide 29 – Q12: The Patience of the Saints
- Question: After uttering His warning by the third angel against all this, what does God offer instead, as that which will manifest the patience of the saints?
- Key Text: Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points
- **Characteristics of the Remnant:**
  - **Commandment Keeping:** They uphold God’s law while the world follows the beast.
  - **Faith of Jesus:** They possess the same quality of trust and dependence on the Father that Jesus had.
- **Contrast:**
  - This group stands in stark contrast to those worshipping the beast.

## Slide 31 – Q12: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Justification & Sanctification:**
  - We are saved by the faith *of* Jesus.
  - That faith works in us to produce obedience to the Commandments.
- **Not Legalism:**
  - We do not keep commandments *to get* saved.
  - We keep them because we *are* saved, and Christ lives out His law within us (Galatians 2:20).

## Slide 32 – Q13: The Commandments of God
- Question: What does the Bible set forth as the "commandments of God?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 4:12, 13 – “And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire;... and He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points
- **The Ten Commandments:**
  - Identified as God's "Covenant."
  - Spoken by God Himself out of the fire.
- **Moral Law:**
  - These are not temporary ceremonial rules.
  - They are the eternal moral law, written on stone to signify durability, and now written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).

## Slide 34 – Q14: The Complete Law
- Question: Were these ten commandments the complete law of God?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 5:22 – “These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire... with a great voice; and He added no more. And He wrote them in two tables of stone.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: Key Points
- **"He Added No More":**
  - The Ten Commandments are a complete summary of duty to God and man.
- **Distinct from Ceremonial Law:**
  - God spoke the Ten audibly and wrote them Himself.
  - Moses wrote the ceremonial laws (sacrifices/festivals) which pointed forward to Christ.
  - The moral law remains the standard of righteousness.

## Slide 36 – Q15: The Definition of Sin
- Question: Why should the law of God be obeyed?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.”

## Slide 37 – Q15: Key Points
- **The Detector of Sin:**
  - Without the law, we have no knowledge of what sin is (Romans 3:20).
- **The Gospel Connection:**
  - If there is no law, there is no sin.
  - If there is no sin, there is no need for a Savior.
  - Abolishing the law would abolish the Gospel.
  - Jesus came to save His people *from* their sins (Matthew 1:21).

## Slide 38 – Q15: Application (Christ in the Heart)
- **Fulfilling the Law:**
  - We cannot obey in our own strength; the carnal mind is hostile to God (Romans 8:7).
  - Only when Christ dwells in the heart by faith can the “righteousness of the law” be fulfilled in us (Romans 8:4).

## Slide 39 – Q16: The Unity of the Law
- Question: How much of the law should one keep to be called a commandment keeper?
- Key Text: James 2:10 – “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.”

## Slide 40 – Q16: Key Points
- **A Unified Whole:**
  - God’s law is not a list of separate rules, but a reflection of His character.
  - Breaking one commandment breaks the principle of love and rebels against the Lawgiver.
- **The Test Point:**
  - In the last days, the test may come on one specific point (the Sabbath/4th Commandment).
  - Yielding on one point surrenders God’s authority to the beast’s authority.

## Slide 41 – Q16: Illustration
- **The Broken Chain:**
  - If a heavy weight hangs by a chain of ten links, how many must break for the weight to fall?
  - Only one.
  - Even if nine links are strong, if one breaks, the connection is severed.
  - So it is with our connection to God’s will.

## Slide 42 – Q17: The Authority of the Lawgiver
- Question: How does the apostle illustrate his meaning in this statement?
- Key Text: James 2:11 – “For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.”

## Slide 43 – Q17: Key Points
- **"For He That Said":**
  - We obey because of the Authority behind the law—God Himself.
- **The Worship Issue:**
  - If we accept the Beast’s modification of the law (Sunday), we respect the beast above God.
  - The controversy of the last generation centers on the commandments of God versus the traditions of men.

## Slide 44 – Q18: The Remnant Persecuted
- Question: Why will the remnant church be persecuted?
- Key Text: Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points
- **Marks of the Remnant:**
  1.  **Keep the Commandments:** They restore the law, including the Sabbath.
  2.  **Testimony of Jesus:** Defined in Revelation 19:10 as "the spirit of prophecy."
- **Reason for Wrath:**
  - The world cannot tolerate a group that refuses to bow to human tradition.
  - The life of Christ in His saints is a constant rebuke to sin.
  - We must obey God rather than men (Acts 5:29).

## Slide 46 – Conclusion: Victory
- **The Outcome:**
  - Though the war is fierce, the victory is assured.
- **The Sea of Glass:**
  - The saints are seen standing on the sea of glass (Revelation 15:2).
  - They have gotten the victory over the beast, his image, and his mark.
- **Through Faith:**
  - Through the "Faith of Jesus," we are more than conquerors.
