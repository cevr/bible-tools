## Slide 1 – Q1: The Law and Salvation

- Question: What positive statement does the apostle make concerning the law?
- Key Text: Romans 3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Limit of Human Effort

- **The Impossibility of Self-Salvation**
  - The “deeds of the law” refer to human attempts to obey commandments in one's own strength to earn acceptance.
  - Fallen nature cannot produce the righteousness God requires.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **Definition of Justification**
  - A legal term meaning God declares a sinner “not guilty.”
  - It involves the forgiveness of sins and the imputation (crediting) of Christ’s perfect life to the believer.
  - Romans 4:5 – “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Sanctuary & Righteousness by Faith

- **The Purpose of the Law**
  - The law was not designed to be a savior.
  - **Sanctuary Insight:** The Ten Commandments were inside the Ark, covered by the Mercy Seat.
  - The law demanded perfection; only the blood on the Mercy Seat (Christ’s sacrifice) could intervene for the sinner.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - Romans 3:20 destroys the foundation of legalism.
  - We must look away from our imperfect deeds to the perfect merit of Jesus Christ.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Mirror and the Soap**
  - Imagine a man with a dirty face standing before a mirror.
  - The mirror faithfully reveals the dirt, but it cannot wash the face.
  - If the man rubs his face on the mirror, he does not get clean; he only smudges the glass.
  - **Application:** The law is the mirror—it reveals the defect. It points us to the soap and water, which is Jesus. We are washed by the Savior, not the mirror.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Function of the Law

- Question: What does the law do?
- Key Text: Romans 7:7 – “What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”
- Key Text: Romans 3:20 (last clause) – “...for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points – Diagnosis and Conviction

- **The Definition of Sin**
  - The law acts as the diagnostic standard.
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **Conviction of Sin**
  - The Holy Spirit uses the law to convict the conscience, reaching the thoughts and intents of the heart.
  - Hebrews 4:12 – “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points – The Schoolmaster & Sanctuary

- **The Schoolmaster**
  - By revealing our inability to meet God’s standard, the law drives us to Christ.
  - Galatians 3:24 – “Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”
- **Sanctuary Connection**
  - In the sanctuary service, the sinner had to realize he was guilty *before* he brought a lamb to the altar.
  - Knowledge of guilt (law) is the prerequisite for seeking atonement (gospel).

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Plumb Line**
  - Builders use a plumb line to see if a wall is straight.
  - If the wall is crooked, the plumb line hangs silently, testifying to the crookedness. It does not fix the wall.
  - **Application:** The law is God’s plumb line (Amos 7:7–8). It shows where our character is “crooked” so we may seek the Master Builder to restore us.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Universal Jurisdiction

- Question: Will the law do this work for others besides the Jews?
- Key Text: Romans 3:19 – “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points – Guilt and Judgment

- **Universal Guilt**
  - The jurisdiction of the moral law extends to every human being.
  - Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”
- **Stopping the Mouth**
  - In the courtroom of God, the law silences human pride. No one can claim, “I am a good person,” when faced with God’s standard.
- **The Standard of Judgment**
  - God’s government is based on His law; it is the standard in the judgment.
  - Ecclesiastes 12:13–14 – “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **Gravity**
  - Gravity is a universal law. It operates the same for everyone, regardless of nationality.
  - If you step off a cliff, you cannot argue with gravity.
  - **Application:** The Ten Commandments are the moral gravity of the universe. They apply to every soul, proving that the whole world needs a Savior (John 3:16).

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Character of the Law

- Question: What is the nature of God's law?
- Key Text: Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points – Nature and Harmony

- **Holy, Just, and Good**
  - **Holy:** Demands purity.
  - **Just:** Fair and equitable.
  - **Good:** Designed for our happiness.
  - Deuteronomy 10:13 – “To keep the commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?”
- **The Harmony of Law and Gospel**
  - God cannot abolish the law, for it is a transcript of His character.
  - The Gospel brings man back into harmony with the law.
- **The Problem is Us**
  - The conflict exists because our nature is fallen, not because the law is bad.
  - Romans 7:14 – “For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Key Points – Sanctification

- **Defined**
  - Sanctification is the work of grace to make the believer holy.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”
- **Sympathy with the Law**
  - The “carnal mind” hates the law, but the renewed mind delights in it.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
  - Psalm 119:97 – “O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.”

## Slide 15 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Mold and the Metal**
  - Consider a perfect mold used for casting statues.
  - If you pour cold, hard rock into it, it will not take the shape.
  - The problem is not the mold; the problem is the material.
  - **Application:** The law is the perfect mold. We are the hard hearts. We need the fire of the Holy Spirit to melt us so we can reflect the image of Jesus.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Justification by Grace

- Question: How, then, can man be justified?
- Key Text: Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 17 – Q5: Key Points – Grace and Redemption

- **Freely by His Grace**
  - Grace is unmerited favor and power given to the undeserving.
  - We do not pay for it; it was costly to Christ.
- **Redemption (Ransom)**
  - We were slaves to sin; Christ paid the ransom with His blood.
  - 1 Peter 1:18–19 – “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things... But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: Key Points – The Great Exchange

- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - Christ took our sins (which He did not commit) and died our death.
  - In exchange, He offers us His righteousness (which we did not earn) so we can have His life.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”
- **The Sanctuary Type**
  - The sinner confessed sin over the lamb; the sin was transferred, and the lamb died in the sinner's place.
  - John 1:29 – “...Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”

## Slide 19 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Judge and the Benefactor**
  - A man owes a debt he can never pay. The judge is about to pass sentence.
  - A wealthy benefactor pays the debt in full and hands the receipt to the judge.
  - The judge declares the man free.
  - **Application:** The man is not free because *he* had the money, but because *another* paid his price. This is justification by grace.

## Slide 20 – Q6: Grace and Obedience

- Question: But does the fact that we are subjects of God's grace, give us license to sin?
- Key Text: Romans 6:15–16 – “What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”

## Slide 21 – Q6: Key Points – True Freedom

- **Under Law vs. Under Grace**
  - Being “under grace” is not a license to disobey; it is the power to obey.
  - Sin shall not have dominion over the believer.
  - Romans 6:14 – “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”
- **Servants of Obedience**
  - Faith involves yielding the will.
  - When we accept Christ, we change masters—from rebellion to the service of King Jesus.

## Slide 22 – Q6: Key Points – The New Covenant

- **Imputed and Imparted Righteousness**
  - Grace forgives the past (Justification) and transforms the present (Sanctification).
- **Written in the Heart**
  - Under the New Covenant, God writes the law in our hearts.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”
  - John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”

## Slide 23 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Pardoned Prisoner**
  - If a governor pardons a prisoner from death row, does that give him the right to commit murder again? No!
  - The pardon expects him to live as a law-abiding citizen.
  - **Application:** Gratitude to the Savior should make the Christian the most law-abiding citizen of all. Grace produces obedience, not rebellion.

## Slide 24 – Q7: The Walk of the Spirit

- Question: How must those walk who would be free from condemnation?
- Key Text: Romans 8:1 – “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 25 – Q7: Key Points – In Christ

- **Condition of Safety**
  - We are safe from judgment only while “abiding” in Christ.
  - John 15:4 – “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.”
- **Victory Over Sin**
  - Those “in Christ” have a new direction of life.
  - Romans 8:2 – “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.”

## Slide 26 – Q7: Application – The Antitypical Day

- **Sanctuary Application**
  - We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
  - While Jesus cleanses the sanctuary above, we are to walk in the Spirit below.
  - We are called to put away sin and follow the Lamb.
  - Revelation 14:5 – “And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.”

## Slide 27 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Two Travelers**
  - One traveler walks toward a cliff (the flesh/death); the other toward a city of light (the Spirit/life).
  - If the one walking toward the city stumbles, he gets up and continues toward the city. His direction is set.
  - **Application:** “No condemnation” belongs to the one whose face is set toward Christ and who is moving, by the Spirit's power, away from the life of sin.
