## Slide 1 – Title Slide

- **Bible Study: Temperance and the Christian Life**
- **Theme:** Righteousness, Self-Control, and Victory in Christ
- **Basis:** A Biblical Exploration of the Fruit of the Spirit

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: Temperance as a Fruit

- **Question:** With what does the apostle Paul class temperance?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:22, 23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Definition & Source)

- **The Climax of the List:** Paul places **temperance** at the climax of the fruit of the Spirit.
- **Definition:** Temperance (Greek: *egkrateia*) is self-control exercised by the believer over their entire being.
  - It includes total abstinence from harmful things and moderate use of good things.
- **A Fruit, Not a Root:** We do not exercise self-control to earn salvation (legalism).
  - We exercise it because we are indwelt by the Spirit (sanctification).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** The carnal nature is powerless on its own.
  - Romans 7:14 – “For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.”
  - True temperance is the life of Christ—who overcame appetite in the wilderness—manifested in the believer.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Harmony with Law

- **No Condemnation:** The text says, "against such there is no law."
- **Written on the Heart:** When the Spirit writes God's law on the heart, the believer naturally desires to live healthfully.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.”
- **Conclusion:** The law condemns sin, but it has no condemnation for the life lived in the Spirit.

---

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Wild Horse:**
  - Imagine a wild horse representing our natural appetites and passions.
  - A "rope of sand" (human will) cannot hold it; it will break free.
  - But if the **Master Horseman (Christ)** takes the reins, the horse is controlled.
- **The Lesson:** The horse is not destroyed, but disciplined. Temperance is our faculties controlled by the Spirit of God.

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Striving for the Mastery

- **Question:** What does the same apostle say of those who strive for the mastery?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 9:25 – “And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points (Victory & Grace)

- **Temperate in *All* Things:**
  - Victory involves regulating diet, sleep, work, and thought.
  - A clouded mind cannot clearly discern God's will.
- **The Incorruptible Crown:** If athletes deny themselves for a fading wreath, we should do more for eternal life.
  - 1 Peter 1:4 – “To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.”
- **Victory through Grace:** We strive not in human strength, but with God's energy.
  - Colossians 1:29 – “Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.”
- **Sanctification:** The Holy Spirit sets us apart, bringing every habit into obedience to Christ.

---

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Musician:**
  - A professional musician will not risk damaging their hearing with loud noise or their fingers with rough labor before a concert.
  - They protect their instrument for the performance.
- **The Lesson:** Our bodies are the "temple of the Holy Ghost" (1 Corinthians 6:19). We practice temperance to protect the instrument for God's service.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Paul’s Personal Discipline

- **Question:** In running the Christian race, what did Paul say he did in order to be successful?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 9:27 – “But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Subjection & Safety)

- **"Keep Under My Body":** Paul took decisive action against carnal desires.
  - 1 Peter 2:11 – “Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.”
- **The Danger of Being a Castaway:**
  - Even Paul knew that if his lower nature ruled, he could be disqualified.
  - Salvation is maintained by a living faith that produces obedience; we are not "once saved, always saved" regardless of lifestyle.
- **Practical Application:** A clogged stomach often leads to a clogged brain. We must subject our appetites to God's laws to maintain spiritual clarity.

---

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Ship's Captain:**
  - The Captain (Conscience/Will) must command the Crew (Body/Appetites).
  - If the crew mutinies, gets drunk, and ignores the captain, the ship crashes.
- **The Lesson:** By God's grace, we must keep the "crew" in subjection so the ship can reach the harbor of Heaven.

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Effect of Intemperance

- **Question:** What is the effect of intemperance?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 23:29, 30 – “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points (Wreckage of Sin)

- **Physical Destruction:** "Redness of eyes" and "wounds without cause" indicate physical deterioration and accidents.
- **Mental Ruin:** "Babbling" shows the degradation of the intellect and human dignity.
- **Social Strife:** "Contentions" arise as alcohol removes inhibitions and patience.
- **God's Protection:** God warns us against this to preserve our happiness.
  - Sin always brings "woe."
  - God's law is a hedge of protection.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Kings and Strong Drink

- **Question:** Why were kings prohibited the use of strong drink?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 31:4, 5 – “It is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink; lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Leadership & Judgment)

- **Forgetting the Law:** Intoxication causes moral amnesia; the distinction between right and wrong is lost.
- **Perverting Judgment:** A chemically altered mind cannot weigh evidence or make righteous decisions.
- **Spiritual Application:** Believers are called to a royal priesthood.
  - Revelation 1:6 – “And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.”
  - We need clear minds to discern spiritual truth and resist the devil.

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: Priests and Holiness

- **Question:** Why were priests not allowed to use intoxicating drink?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 10:8-10 – “And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation... that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points (Sanctuary & Atonement)

- **Discernment:** Alcohol blurs the line between the sacred and the common.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
  - Hebrews 8:1 – “We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.”
  - Just as earthly priests had to be sober to enter the tabernacle, we must be sober to cooperate with Christ's work of cleansing.
- **Call to Holiness:**
  - 1 Peter 1:16 – “Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.”
  - A benumbed brain makes holiness impossible, as the Spirit communicates through the mind.

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Surgeon:**
  - A surgeon performing a delicate heart operation requires steady hands and a clear mind.
  - Taking a drug that dulls the senses would endanger the patient's life.
- **The Lesson:** We are in a life-or-death spiritual warfare. We cannot afford to dull our spiritual senses with intemperance.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: Daniel’s Refusal

- **Question:** Why did Daniel and his companions refuse to drink of the wine of the king of Babylon?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 1:8 – “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank.”

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Purpose & Faith)

- **"Purposed in his Heart":** True temperance is a decision of the will before temptation strikes.
- **Defilement:** The food was likely unclean or offered to idols; the wine was fermented.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Daniel trusted the God of Israel rather than compromising with pagan culture.
  - His obedience was the fruit of his faith.
  - Titus 2:14 – “Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Fish Against the Current:**
  - A dead fish floats downstream with the current.
  - It takes a **live fish** to swim against the current.
- **The Lesson:** Daniel was alive to God. While others drifted with Babylon's customs, Daniel swam against the flow because God's life was in him.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Test Proposed

- **Question:** After protesting against the use of the stimulants offered them, what did they request?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 1:12 – “Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days: and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Natural Law)

- **Pulse and Water:**
  - "Pulse" refers to plant-based foods (vegetables, grains).
  - Water was the original drink provided by God.
  - Genesis 1:29 – “And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed... and every tree... to you it shall be for meat.”
- **The Principle:** They chose the diet that creates the best blood and clearest brain, rejecting stimulants.
- **Faith:** They trusted that God's natural laws would outperform the king's luxuries in just ten days.

---

## Slide 24 – Q9: The Results

- **Question:** At the end of the ten days' test, how did these Hebrews appear?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 1:15 – “And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points (Health & Blessing)

- **Physical Health:** They appeared healthier ("fairer") and better nourished ("fatter") than the others.
- **Superiority of Nature:** A simple diet gives sustained strength, whereas stimulants produce a temporary high followed by a crash.
- **God's Blessing:** God honored their obedience.
  - 1 Samuel 2:30 – “...for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q10: Superior Wisdom

- **Question:** At the end of three years... how many in the realm were found equal in learning to these abstainers?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 1:20 – “And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points (Mind & Spirit)

- **Ten Times Better:** Their minds were clear, memories retentive, and perceptions sharp.
- **Connection to Wisdom:**
  - Proverbs 9:10 – “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.”
  - Temperance kept their connection with the Source of wisdom open.
- **Witness:** Their lifestyle became a witness to the heathen king of God's superiority.

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Window:**
  - A dusty, dirty window lets in very little light.
  - A clean, clear window lets the sunlight flood the room.
- **The Lesson:** The Holy Spirit is the light; our brain is the window. Temperance keeps the window clean so God's light can shine in.

---

## Slide 29 – Q11: Paul’s Advice to Timothy

- **Question:** Did not Paul recommend the use of wine under certain conditions?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 5:23 – “Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thine often infirmities.”

---

## Slide 30 – Q11: Key Points (Medicinal Context)

- **Medicinal Use:** Paul prescribed a remedy for a specific physical ailment, not a beverage for pleasure.
- **Two Kinds of Wine:** Scripture uses "wine" (*yayin* / *oinos*) for both:
  1.  **Unfermented:** Pure grape juice (a blessing).
  2.  **Fermented:** Alcoholic juice (a mocker).
- **Consistency:** Paul would not contradict his own teaching against drunkenness.
  - Ephesians 5:18 – “And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.”
  - It is reasonable to conclude he recommended unfermented juice (a stomach tonic) or a strictly medicinal application.

---

## Slide 31 – Q12: The First Kind of Wine

- **Question:** How is the first kind spoken of?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 32:14 – “...and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q12: Key Points (The Blessing)

- **"Pure Blood of the Grape":** This is the fresh, unfermented juice as it comes from the fruit.
- **A Blessing:**
  - Isaiah 65:8 – “Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it...”
- **Symbolism:** Pure juice represents the sinless blood of Christ. Fermentation represents corruption (leaven) and cannot symbolize the Savior.

---

## Slide 33 – Q13: The Second Kind of Wine

- **Question:** How is the second kind represented?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 23:31, 32 – “Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q13: Key Points (The Serpent)

- **Signs of Fermentation:** "Moveth itself" and "red" describe the chemical process of fermentation.
- **The Nature of Alcohol:** It "biteth like a serpent."
  - This connects alcohol to the Serpent (Satan).
  - It promises pleasure but delivers death.
- **Deception:** Like the serpent in Eden, alcohol deceives the user into feeling strong while they are becoming weak.

---

## Slide 35 – Q14: Associates of Drunkenness

- **Question:** With what other low debaucheries is drunkenness more or less associated?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:19-21 – “Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness... murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like.”

---

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points (The Flesh)

- **The Chain of Sin:**
  - Drunkenness is linked with **sexual immorality** (lowered inhibitions).
  - It is linked with **violence** (wrath, strife).
- **The Carnal Nature:** These are "works of the flesh."
  - No human resolution can cleanse these; only the blood of Christ can.
  - A believer cannot willfully walk in these works and claim to be led by the Spirit.

---

## Slide 37 – Q15: Entrance to the Kingdom

- **Question:** Can a drunkard enter the kingdom of God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 6:10 – “Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.”

---

## Slide 38 – Q15: Application (Hope & Transformation)

- **The Warning:** Heaven is a place of perfect purity; a character warped by self-indulgence cannot exist there.
- **The Good News (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - 1 Corinthians 6:11 – “**And such were some of you**: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”
- **Deliverance:**
  - **Justification:** Forgiveness of past sins for Christ's sake.
  - **Sanctification:** The power to live a new, holy life.
  - The Gospel does not just forgive the drunkard; it delivers him.

---

## Slide 39 – Q16: The Church’s Duty

- **Question:** How, then, should a Christian regard one who persists in drunkenness?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 5:11 – “But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard...”

---

## Slide 40 – Q16: Key Points (Discipline & Love)

- **"Called a Brother":** This applies to those within the church who persist in open sin.
- **Separation:** We are "not to keep company" to protect the church from the leaven of sin (1 Cor 5:6).
- **Love's Purpose:** Discipline is intended to help the sinner realize their need.
  - We point them to the High Priest who can save "to the uttermost."
  - Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q16: Illustration

- **The Quarantine:**
  - If a man has a contagious, deadly disease, we quarantine him.
  - This is not hate; it is to stop the spread and focus on the cure.
- **The Lesson:** Sin is the most deadly disease. We must not treat it lightly, but seek the cure found only in Christ.
