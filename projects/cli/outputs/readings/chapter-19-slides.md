## Slide 1 – Q1: The Human Condition
- **Question:** What is the natural condition of the human family?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”
- **Additional Text:** Ephesians 2:1 – “And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;” (See also vv. 2-3).

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **A Humbling Diagnosis:** Since the fall of Adam, the natural heart is alienated from its Creator.
- **Universal Need:**
  - The text applies to “all,” not just the worst of us.
  - Regardless of heritage or education, every human begins life separated from God’s holiness.
- **"Coming Short":**
  - We have missed the target of God’s glory (His character of love and holy law).
  - We lack the moral power to reflect His image.
- **Dead in Sin:**
  - As described in Ephesians 2:1, we are spiritually "dead."
  - A dead man cannot revive himself; he needs a source of life from outside.
- **Definitions:**
  - **Sin:** Lawlessness; missing the mark of God’s perfect standard (1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”).
  - **Depravity:** Corruption of nature rendering man unable to save himself.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Archer and the Sun:**
  - Imagine two archers trying to shoot an arrow at the sun.
  - One may be stronger and shoot higher than the other.
  - However, both fall infinitely short of the target.
- **Application:**
  - One person may be "better" by human standards.
  - Yet, all fall short of the infinite purity of God.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Seeing God
- **Question:** Who alone will be permitted to see God?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:8 – “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Purity & Sanctuary)
- **The Requirement:**
  - Sin cannot exist in God’s presence.
  - To dwell with Him requires a character in harmony with His.
  - This is a purity of the “heart”—the seat of motives and will.
- **Sanctuary Typology:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest had to be clean to enter the Most Holy Place.
  - In the heavenly reality, Christ is preparing a people cleansed from all defilement.
  - God promises to write His law in their hearts (Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”).
- **The Necessity:** Because we are naturally impure (Q1), we require a radical change—the New Birth.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Pig and the Lamb:**
  - You can wash a pig and tie a ribbon around its neck.
  - It looks clean, but let it go, and it returns to the mud because it has the nature of a pig.
  - To keep it clean, it would need the nature of a lamb.
- **Application:**
  - Outward reform is not enough.
  - We need a new nature to truly remain pure.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Human Ability
- **Question:** Can man by his own exertions change his condition?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 13:23 – “Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points
- **The Boundary of Ability:**
  - We can change our location or profession, but not our nature.
  - A sinner cannot "will away" guilt or the propensity to sin.
- **The Trap of Legalism:**
  - Trying to keep the law without a changed heart is impossible.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **The Purpose of Inability:**
  - This truth drives us to Christ.
  - When we admit "I cannot," we are ready for God to say "I can."

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Quicksand:**
  - A man drowning in quicksand cannot lift himself out by his own bootstraps.
  - The harder he struggles, the deeper he sinks.
  - He needs a solid Rock and a hand from above.
  - Christ is that Rock and that Hand.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Brought to God
- **Question:** How, then, can one be brought to God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:18 – “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (The Atonement)
- **The Great Exchange:**
  - Christ (the Just) took the place of us (the unjust).
  - He paid the penalty demanded by the broken law (Isaiah 53:5 – “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities...”).
- **Reconciliation:**
  - The goal is not just forgiveness, but to *bring us to God*.
  - Christ bridges the chasm caused by sin.
- **One Mediator:**
  - Only the One who is fully God and fully man could bridge this gap (1 Timothy 2:5 – “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;”).

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Canyon Bridge:**
  - Imagine a great canyon separating sinful humanity from a Holy God.
  - We cannot jump across; the distance is too great.
  - The Cross is the bridge laid across the abyss.
  - Christ crossed it to fetch us and carries us back to the Father.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Progress Without Christ
- **Question:** What progress can one make in coming to God without the help of Christ?
- **Key Text:** John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Absolute Dependence:**
  - A branch only has life while connected to the trunk.
  - If the connection is severed, the branch withers.
- **The Meaning of "Nothing":**
  - Jesus did not say we can do "a little."
  - We cannot produce a single genuine fruit of the Spirit apart from His power.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - This is the secret of the Christian life.
  - It is not our work *plus* Christ's work.
  - It is Christ’s life flowing *through* us, producing obedience.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Light Bulb:**
  - A light bulb has the potential to shine but is dark in itself.
  - It cannot "try harder" to shine; it must be connected to the power source.
  - The Christian is the bulb; Christ is the current.
  - Without the connection, there is only darkness.

## Slide 16 – Q6: In Christ
- **Question:** When one is "in Christ," what has he become?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points
- **A New Creation:**
  - God speaks spiritual life into the dead soul just as He spoke the world into existence.
- **Passing of the Old:**
  - Selfishness, pride, and sinful habits are dethroned.
  - A new King is on the throne of the heart.
- **All Things New:**
  - New tastes, desires, and goals.
  - The Bible becomes precious; prayer becomes a delight.
  - The commandments become a protection rather than a restriction.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Butterfly:**
  - A caterpillar crawls in dirt, consuming leaves, bound to the earth.
  - Through metamorphosis, it becomes a butterfly—a "new creature."
  - It doesn't just crawl better; it flies.
  - The believer is given wings of faith to rise above the world.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Before the New Creation
- **Question:** What must take place before one can become a "new creature?"
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:9 – “For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Conviction)
- **The Function of the Law:**
  - Paul felt "alive" (self-righteous) when looking only at the letter of the law.
  - When the Spirit revealed the spiritual depth (e.g., covetousness), he saw his true condition.
- **"Sin Revived" and "I Died":**
  - He recognized the hideousness of his sin.
  - His self-confidence shattered ("I died").
  - We must realize our own righteousness is "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6) before we can be born again.
- **Definition:**
  - **Conviction of Sin:** The Spirit using the Law to show guilt and the need for a Saviour (John 16:8).

## Slide 21 – Q8: Dying to Sin
- **Question:** Unto what had Paul died?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:2 – “God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points
- **A Change of Masters:**
  - One cannot be alive to sin and alive to God simultaneously.
  - "Dead to sin" means sin no longer has the right to command us.
- **No Compromise:**
  - The Gospel saves us *from* sin, not *in* sin (Matthew 1:21 – “...for he shall save his people from their sins.”).
  - It is a contradiction to claim salvation while willfully rebelling.

## Slide 23 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Dead Man:**
  - If a man dies, he no longer responds to stimuli.
  - You can insult him or tempt him, but he does not respond.
  - The Christian reckons himself "dead" to the temptations of the old life (Romans 6:11).

## Slide 24 – Q9: Slayed by Sin
- **Question:** By what did sin slay Paul?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:11 – “For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points
- **Sin as Deceiver:**
  - Sin presents itself as freedom and pleasure.
  - It deceived Eve (“Ye shall not surely die”) and deceives us today.
- **The Weapon:**
  - Sin used the commandment to condemn Paul.
  - The Law is ordained to life (if kept), but becomes a death sentence to the breaker.
  - The broken law demands the life of the sinner.

## Slide 26 – Q10: Strength of Sin
- **Question:** Then what gives sin its strength to kill?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:56 – “The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points
- **The Mirror of the Law:**
  - Without the law, we would not fully define or understand sin (Romans 3:20 – “...for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”).
- **Condemnation:**
  - Because the law is holy, it cannot overlook transgression.
  - This "strength" drives us to despair of self-effort.
  - It forces us to flee to Christ, who satisfied the law’s demands.

## Slide 28 – Q11: Importance of New Birth
- **Question:** By what forcible words did the Saviour show the importance of the new birth, or conversion?
- **Key Text:** John 3:3 – “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Key Points
- **Absolute Certainty:**
  - "Verily, verily" implies solemn truth.
  - No optional neutrality.
- **Essential for All:**
  - Not just for a special class of believers.
  - It is the gateway for *anyone* to see God's Kingdom.
- **Spiritual Kingdom:**
  - Heaven is a place where God is all.
  - A carnal, selfish nature would be miserable there.
  - We must be born into spiritual life now to enjoy it then.

## Slide 30 – Q11: Illustration
- **Two Kingdoms:**
  - A fish cannot live on dry land; a bird cannot live underwater.
  - They belong to different kingdoms of nature.
  - For a human (flesh) to live in heaven (Spirit), he must receive a new nature suitable for that environment.

## Slide 31 – Q12: Means of the Second Birth
- **Question:** By what means is the second birth effected?
- **Key Texts:**
  - 1 Peter 1:23 – “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.”
  - 1 Peter 1:22 – “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren...”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Key Points
- **The Seed (Word):**
  - The Scripture is the seed.
  - When believed, it imparts the life of God.
- **The Agent (Spirit):**
  - The Holy Spirit applies the Word to the heart.
  - He creates new motives and power.
- **The Result (Obedience):**
  - True conversion results in "obeying the truth."
  - This is obedience born of "unfeigned love," not legalism.

## Slide 33 – Q13: Understanding the Process
- **Question:** Can we fully understand this process?
- **Key Text:** John 3:8 – “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is everyone that is born of the Spirit.”

## Slide 34 – Q13: Key Points
- **The Mystery:**
  - We cannot explain the exact mechanism of how God changes a soul.
  - It is an invisible power, like the wind.
- **Visible Effects:**
  - We cannot see the wind, but we see trees bow and ships move.
  - We see the effects of the Spirit: the drunkard becomes sober, the proud become humble.
  - The *reality* is visible, even if the *manner* is a mystery.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Flesh vs. Spirit
- **Question:** Can one be born of the Spirit, and still do the works of the flesh?
- **Key Text:** John 3:6 – “That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” (See also Romans 8:5).

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points
- **A Sharp Distinction:**
  - "Flesh" (old, selfish nature) and "Spirit" (new, Christ-centered nature) are distinct.
- **Like Produces Like:**
  - An apple tree produces apples; a thorn bush produces thorns.
  - A man born of the Spirit produces spiritual fruit.
- **The Test:**
  - If a life is characterized by habitual works of the flesh, the profession of being "born again" is false.

## Slide 37 – Q15: The Conflict
- **Question:** Do these two conditions harmonize?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:17 – “For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.”

## Slide 38 – Q15: Key Points
- **Warfare:**
  - There is no truce between the flesh and the Spirit.
  - The old nature battles for supremacy; the Spirit wars against it.
- **Victory:**
  - The believer is not a helpless victim.
  - Through the Spirit, we are to crucify the flesh (Galatians 5:24).
  - We cannot serve two masters.

## Slide 39 – Q16: Works of the Flesh
- **Question:** What are the works of the flesh?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:19-21 – “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like...”

## Slide 40 – Q16: Key Points
- **A Catalogue of Sins:**
  - **Sensual:** Adultery, uncleanness, drunkenness.
  - **Spiritual:** Idolatry, witchcraft, heresy.
  - **Relational:** Hatred, wrath, strife, envy.
- **Note:**
  - Bad temper ("wrath") and divisiveness ("variance") are listed alongside murder and adultery.
  - All are fruit of the self-centered life.

## Slide 41 – Q17: Works of the Spirit
- **Question:** What are the works of the Spirit?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:22-23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.”

## Slide 42 – Q17: Key Points
- **Fruit vs. Works:**
  - "Works" implies effort and fragmentation; "Fruit" implies natural, unified growth.
- **Character of God:**
  - These attributes describe the character of Jesus.
  - To have the Spirit is to become like Jesus.
- **Temperance:**
  - Self-control in all things (appetite, passion, speech).

## Slide 43 – Q17: Illustration
- **Machine vs. Tree:**
  - A machine produces "works" with noise and clatter.
  - A tree produces "fruit" silently by abiding in the sun and rain.
  - When we abide in Christ (the Sun of Righteousness), virtues grow naturally.

## Slide 44 – Q18: Evidence of Rebirth
- **Question:** When a man has been "born again," what will he do?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 2:29 – “If ye know that He is righteous, ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of Him.”

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points
- **Doing Righteousness:**
  - Genuine faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).
  - We must walk as He walked.
- **Source of Action:**
  - We do not do righteousness *to be* born again.
  - We do righteousness *because* we are born again.
  - The action follows the life.

## Slide 46 – Q19: Defining Righteousness
- **Question:** What is righteousness?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 119:172 – “My tongue shall speak of Thy word: for all Thy commandments are righteousness.”

## Slide 47 – Q19: Key Points (Law & Gospel)
- **The Standard:**
  - God’s law (the commandments) is the transcript of His character.
  - Since God is righteous, His law is righteousness.
- **The Connection:**
  - Since the New Birth leads us to "do righteousness" (Q18)...
  - And the commandments "are righteousness" (Q19)...
  - Then the New Birth leads us to keep God's commandments.
- **Sanctification:**
  - The Spirit writes the law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
  - Obedience is the fruit of salvation, not the root.

## Slide 48 – Q20: Attitude Toward Sin
- **Question:** How, then, will he that is born of God regard sin?
- **Key Text 1:** Romans 6:21 – “What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.”
- **Key Text 2:** Romans 12:9 – “Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.”

## Slide 49 – Q20: Additional Text & Key Points
- **Additional Text:** 1 Peter 2:2 – “As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:”
- **A New Attitude:**
  - **Shame:** Looking back on past sins with regret, not longing.
  - **Abhorrence:** Hating sin because it is evil and crucified our Lord.
  - **Growth:** Craving the Word like a baby craves milk.
- **Sanctification:** A progressive work of "laying aside" the old and "desiring" the new.

## Slide 50 – Q21: Deliverance
- **Question:** How did Paul obtain deliverance from the law of sin at conversion?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:2 – “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.”

## Slide 51 – Q21: Key Points
- **Two Laws:**
  1. **Law of Sin and Death:** The gravitational pull of our fallen nature.
  2. **Law of the Spirit of Life:** The power of the Spirit lifting us into Christ's life.
- **The Victory:**
  - The Spirit's power is stronger than the flesh.
  - Submission to Christ breaks the shackles of sin.

## Slide 52 – Q21: Illustration
- **Gravity and Flight:**
  - Gravity pulls everything downward.
  - A bird flies, not by abolishing gravity, but by using the higher laws of aerodynamics and life.
  - The "Law of the Spirit" is the wind beneath our wings, overcoming the downward pull of nature.

## Slide 53 – Q22: Condition of Freedom
- **Question:** When thus made free from the law of sin and death, in what condition is an individual?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:1 – “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 54 – Q22: Key Points (Justification)
- **No Condemnation:**
  - This is **Justification**: declared righteous in heaven's courts.
  - Past guilt is wiped away.
- **The Evidence:**
  - Those in Christ "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
  - Justification (freedom from guilt) and Sanctification (freedom from the power of sin) go together.

## Slide 55 – Q23: A New Life
- **Question:** To what kind of life does the new birth raise one?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:11 – “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 56 – Q23: Key Points
- **Alive to God:**
  - The Christian life is responsive to God.
  - When He speaks, we hear; when He leads, we follow.
- **Reckoning (Faith):**
  - We count it as a settled fact that the old life is dead.
  - We live today as citizens of heaven.

## Slide 57 – Q24: Manifestation of Life
- **Question:** If really born of God, what will one manifest?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 4:7 – “Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.”

## Slide 58 – Q24: Key Points
- **Love:**
  - The badge of discipleship (John 13:35).
  - This is *agape*: divine, self-sacrificing love.
- **The Source:**
  - "God is love."
  - Partaking of the divine nature inevitably produces love.
  - A hateful Christian is a contradiction in terms.

## Slide 59 – Q25: Victory
- **Question:** What victory is gained by those who are born again?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 5:4 – “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”

## Slide 60 – Q25: Key Points
- **Overcoming the World:**
  - The "world" includes the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life (1 John 2:16).
  - The believer conquers these through Christ.
- **The Victory is Faith:**
  - Not willpower, but faith in the One who has already overcome (John 16:33).
  - Faith lays hold of Christ’s power.
- **The Promise:**
  - Revelation promises eternal life "to him that overcometh" (Revelation 3:21).
  - Through the New Birth, this victory is assured.
