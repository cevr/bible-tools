- **Key Text:** Proverbs 10:4 – “He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.”
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 13:4 – “The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Law of Sowing and Reaping**
  - God has ordained that effort precedes reward.
  - God gives the increase, but man must prepare the ground.
  - Galatians 6:7 – “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”
- **Spiritual Fatness**
  - Being "fat" in Scripture implies health, prosperity, and nourishment (Psalm 92:14).
  - Diligent prayer and study result in a robust spiritual constitution.
- **Cooperation with God**
  - We are “labourers together with God” (1 Corinthians 3:9).
  - He provides the soil, seed, and rain (grace); we provide the tillage (faith and obedience).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Water Wheel**
  - Consider a water wheel at a mill.
  - The river provides all the power (representing God’s grace).
  - The wheel must be positioned correctly and maintained diligently to catch the current.

  - **Lesson:** We must diligently position ourselves in the stream of God’s power.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Sluggard’s Condition

- **Question:** What is said of the man of opposite characteristics?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 10:4 – “He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.”
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 13:4 – “The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.”

  - Represents the lukewarm condition—knowing truth but not living it.
  - Revelation 3:15–16 – “I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.”
- **Desire without Effort**
  - Many desire the crown of life but refuse the cross of self-denial.
  - They want victory without the surrender of the will.
- **Spiritual Poverty**
  - This poverty is a lack of "gold tried in the fire"—faith and love (Revelation 3:18).
  - The sluggard procrastinates duties and makes excuses (Proverbs 26:13).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Fruit Tree**
  - A man may stand by a fruit tree earnestly desiring an apple.
  - Unless he stretches forth his hand or climbs the ladder, he goes hungry.
  - **Lesson:** Wishing to be righteous does not make one righteous.
  - We must "strive to enter in at the strait gate" (Luke 13:24), laying hold of Christ’s strength by faith.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Social Distinction and Liberty

- **Question:** What social distinction is shown between the diligent man and the slothful one?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 12:24 – “The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Self-Mastery leads to Liberty**
  - The man who rules his own passions by God's grace is free.
  - He is not a slave to circumstances or appetites.
- **Sloth leads to Slavery**

  - John 8:34 – “Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.”
  - The slothful Christian eventually falls under the tyranny of old habits.
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection**
  - True liberty is found in the law of God (James 1:25).
  - When Christ writes the Law in our hearts (New Covenant), we obey out of love.
  - This is the highest form of "bearing rule"—ruling oneself through the Spirit.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Prodigal Son**
  - As long as the son demanded "freedom" to live riotously and lazily, he became a slave feeding pigs.
  - When he returned to his Father’s house to serve, he was restored to dignity.
  - **Lesson:** True diligence in the Father’s house brings royal dignity; slothful rebellion brings slavery.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Honor for the Diligent

- **Question:** What honor awaits the diligent man of business?

  - Daniel 6:4 – “Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful...”
- **The Heavenly Sanctuary Application**
  - If diligence fits a man to stand before earthly kings, spiritual diligence fits us to stand before the King of Kings.
  - 1 Peter 2:9 – “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people...”
- **Christ’s Example**
  - Jesus was diligent in the carpenter’s shop before His public ministry.
  - Faithful in "least," and therefore faithful in "much" (Luke 16:10).

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 11:28 – “And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **God Uses Active Men**
  - God rarely calls the idle to high holy office.
  - Moses was tending sheep; Gideon was threshing wheat; Elisha was plowing.
  - Peter and John were mending nets when called.
- **Capacity for Service**
  - Industry develops "spiritual muscles" to bear burdens.
  - God looks for those who can carry the "charge" of His church without fainting.

  - Industry must be sanctified by the Spirit, or it may serve selfish ambition.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **Steering the Ship**
  - A ship that is moving forward can be steered by the rudder.
  - A ship sitting dead in the water cannot be turned.
  - **Lesson:** God can steer an active, industrious person into the right path, but it is difficult to guide someone who is not moving at all.

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Dwelling Place

- **Question:** May we estimate a man's thrift by the condition of his dwelling?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 10:18 – “By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Body Temple**
  - Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19).
  - Slothfulness in health reform (diet, exercise, rest) causes the "building" to decay, hindering service.
- **The Character Structure**
  - Character is built brick by brick through daily habits.
  - If we are idle in repentance, the "roof" drops through, allowing temptation to rot the soul.
- **Maintenance is Required**

- **Key Text:** Proverbs 24:31 – “And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Natural State of the Heart**
  - Since the Fall, the ground produces thorns naturally (Genesis 3:18).
  - The human heart naturally produces pride and selfishness; we need only neglect it for sin to grow.
- **The Broken Wall**
  - Walls protected vineyards; spiritually, God's Law and truth protect us.
  - Slothfulness in doctrine breaks down the wall, allowing error and vice to enter.
- **Sanctification**
  - This is the work of the spiritual gardener.
  - Justification plants us in grace; Sanctification is the daily weeding and pruning by Christ’s power.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Unattended Garden**
  - A beautiful flower garden left unattended for two years becomes a weed patch.
  - The gardener does not create the life in the flowers (only God does).

  - 2 Corinthians 13:5 – “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves...”
- **Learning from Others**
  - The failures of Israel were written “for our admonition” (1 Corinthians 10:11).
  - We should look at the results of half-hearted religion and choose to be wholehearted.
- **The Investigative Judgment**
  - God is also looking and considering well; He is inspecting the vineyard of our lives.
  - Now is the time to cooperate with Jesus to clear the ground.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **Righteousness by Faith in Daily Life**
  - Christ’s righteousness is a living principle, not just a Sabbath cloak.
  - The life of Christ in the heart makes a man a better employee and citizen.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration

- **Jesus the Carpenter**
  - Jesus spent the majority of His life working as a craftsman, not preaching.
  - By making perfect yokes and tables, He was "serving the Lord."
  - **Lesson:** He sanctified daily labor, glorifying the Father in the workshop as much as in the healing ministry.

## Slide 28 – Q10: The Danger of Negligence

- **Question:** What sentence is pronounced against the man who is unfaithful in God's work?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 48:10 – “Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.”

## Slide 29 – Q10: Key Points

- **The Stakes are High**

  - Describes the character of those who meet the Lord (Revelation 14:5; Ephesians 5:27).
- **The Work of Atonement**
  - In the antitypical Day of Atonement, Jesus is cleansing the Heavenly Sanctuary.
  - Like ancient Israel (Leviticus 16), we are to afflict our souls and put away sin.
- **How is this Possible?**
  - Impossible by human effort alone.
  - We are found "without spot" only when washed in the blood of the Lamb (Justification) and kept by His indwelling life (Sanctification).
  - John 15:4 – “Abide in me, and I in you...”

## Slide 33 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Bride**
  - A bride checks her dress for the slightest stain or wrinkle before the wedding.

- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - This diligence is the "work of faith" (1 Thessalonians 1:3).
  - We are not working *for* salvation, but working *out* salvation because God works in us (Philippians 2:12-13).

## Slide 36 – Q12: Illustration

- **Entering the Harbor**
