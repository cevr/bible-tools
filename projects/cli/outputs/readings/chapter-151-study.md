# Chapter 151: Vows

### Q1. Does God require that we shall fulfill our promises?
"When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee." (Deuteronomy 23:21)

**Answer:**
Yes, God views the making of a vow as a solemn act of worship and integrity. When the Bible speaks of a **vow**, it refers to a voluntary, serious promise made to God to perform some service, abstain from some behavior, or offer a specific gift (Leviticus 27:2).

1.  **The Nature of God’s Requirement:** The text states God will "surely require it." This is not because God is a harsh taskmaster, but because He is a God of truth (Deuteronomy 32:4). Our relationship with Him is based on a covenant (an agreement), and faithfulness is the foundation of that relationship.
2.  **Sin and Omission:** Failing to keep a promise to God is classified here as "sin." In the New Testament, James echoes this principle: "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin" (James 4:17).
3.  **Empowerment to Obey:** Under the banner of **Righteousness by Faith**, we understand that God's biddings are His enablings. If God requires us to keep a vow, He is ready to supply the grace and strength to fulfill it (Philippians 2:13). We do not vow in our own strength, like Peter who failed, but we vow in dependence upon Christ.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Vow:** A solemn promise or pledge made voluntarily to God.
    *   **Sin:** Transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) or failing to live by faith and integrity (Romans 14:23).

[ILL] **The Cheque:** If you write a cheque to pay a debt, your signature is your bond. If the bank account is empty, the signature is worthless. When we make a vow to God, we are signing our name to a promise. However, the "funds" to keep that promise must come from the Bank of Heaven—the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit. We must not sign checks that we do not intend to cash through faith in Christ.

### Q2. Does a partial fulfillment meet His requirements?
"If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth." (Numbers 30:2)

**Answer:**
No, partial obedience is, in reality, disobedience. The command is to do "according to *all* that proceedeth out of his mouth."

1.  **Integrity of the Soul:** The text says a man binds his "soul with a bond." A broken vow fractures the integrity of the conscience. To offer God only a portion of what was promised is to act like Ananias and Sapphira, who kept back part of the price while pretending to give the whole (Acts 5:1–4).
2.  **The Pattern of Christ:** Jesus, our Example, fulfilled the will of the Father perfectly, not partially. He said, "I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do" (John 17:4). As Christians, we aim to reflect His complete faithfulness.
3.  **Sanctuary Truth:** In the earthly sanctuary, the priest examined the sacrifice to ensure it was whole and without blemish. A partial sacrifice was never accepted. This teaches us that God desires a whole heart and a complete surrender (Deuteronomy 6:5).

[ILL] **The Parachute:** If a skydiver packs a parachute but leaves out a few cords or cuts a few corners, the parachute is not "mostly good"—it is essentially useless. In matters of the soul and our covenant with God, "almost" saved is "wholly" lost. God desires a complete transaction, not a halfway measure.

### Q3. Why is God so very particular about promises?
Because He is faithful in performing His promises, and He wants His people to be like Him. "That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even a free will offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth." (Deuteronomy 23:23)

**Answer:**
God is particular because our character is to be modeled after His character.

1.  **God’s Nature is Faithfulness:** The Bible tells us, "He is faithful that promised" (Hebrews 10:23). The entire plan of salvation rests on the certainty that God keeps His Word. If God broke His vows, the universe would disintegrate.
2.  **Sanctification:** **Sanctification** is the process of being restored to the image of God (Colossians 3:10). If God is faithful and true, a sanctified Christian must be faithful and true. We cannot claim to be partakers of the "divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4) while being dishonest or slack in our word.
3.  **The Mouth and the Heart:** Jesus taught that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (Matthew 12:34). A careless tongue indicates a careless heart. God wants us to guard our lips because He wants to purify our hearts.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to make the believer holy in character and life, separating them from sin and setting them apart for God’s use (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

[ILL] **The Reflection:** If you look into a calm, clear lake, you see a perfect reflection of the sky. If the water is turbulent or muddy, the image is distorted. God wants our lives to be so calm and clear in truth that the world sees His faithfulness reflected in our promises.

### Q4. What does He call those who are slack in paying their vows?
"When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for He hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed." (Ecclesiastes 5:4)

**Answer:**
Scripture uses strong language here, calling the unfaithful person a "fool."

1.  **The Danger of Delay:** The text says "defer not" (do not delay). Procrastination in spiritual matters is dangerous because it hardens the heart. When the Holy Spirit prompts a commitment and we delay, the impression fades, and the heart becomes less sensitive (Hebrews 3:7–8).
2.  **The Definition of a Fool:** In the Bible, a "fool" is not someone with low intelligence, but someone who is morally deficient and disregards God's authority (Psalm 14:1). To make a promise to the King of the Universe and treat it lightly is an act of supreme folly.
3.  **The Judgment:** We must remember that "every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment" (Matthew 12:36). Broken vows remain on the record books of heaven until they are repented of or fulfilled.

[ILL] **The Unpaid Bill:** If a man buys goods on credit and promises to pay next week, but continually puts it off, he eventually loses his credit and his good name. He is foolish to think the merchant has forgotten. God keeps perfect books. To delay payment of our vows is to treat God as if He is forgetful or irrelevant.

### Q5. Will God excuse vows that are made without duly considering whether or not we can perform them?
"Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?" (Ecclesiastes 5:5, 6)

**Answer:**
No, God does not accept the excuse that a vow was a mistake or an "error" after the fact.

1.  **The Angel in the Text:** The mention of "the angel" likely refers to the recording angel who notes our words, or the priest (messenger) in the sanctuary service. We are acting in the presence of heavenly agencies. We cannot simply say, "Oops, I didn't mean it."
2.  **Rash Vows:** This passage warns against emotionalism—making high-pressure promises without counting the cost (Luke 14:28). True religion is not just emotional impulse; it is a calm, settled principle.
3.  **Peter’s Example:** Peter vowed, "I will lay down my life for thy sake" (John 13:37), but he did not know his own weakness. He failed because he trusted his own strength.
4.  **The Remedy:** If we have made a rash vow, we must not simply ignore it. We must bring it to God, confess our rashness, and seek His grace to either fulfill it or find a resolution that honors Him.

[ILL] **The Wedding Vow:** A marriage vow is a serious contract. A spouse cannot simply say a few years later, "I didn't realize it would be this hard, so it was just an error." The commitment remains. So it is with our covenant vows to God (baptism, service, stewardship). We must treat them with the gravity of a marriage covenant.

### Q6. What will God do for us, if we are faithful in fulfilling our promises?
"Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the Most High: And call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me." (Psalm 50:14, 15)

**Answer:**
God promises deliverance and a relationship of mutual glory.

1.  **The Cycle of Blessing:**
    *   We offer thanksgiving and keep our vows (obedience/faithfulness).
    *   We call upon Him in trouble (prayer).
    *   He delivers us (salvation/answer).
    *   We glorify Him (witness).
2.  **Confidence in Prayer:** "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much" (James 5:16). When we knowingly cherish broken vows or unconfessed sin, it hinders our prayers (Psalm 66:18). Faithfulness clears the channel of communication between the soul and the Sanctuary above.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Fulfilling vows is not a way to *earn* deliverance, but it is the condition of heart that allows us to *receive* it. We do not pay vows to buy God's favor; we pay them because we have received His grace.

[ILL] **The Open Pipe:** Prayer is like water flowing through a pipe. If the pipe is clogged with debris (broken promises, unconfessed sin, dishonesty), the water cannot flow freely. Clearing the debris (paying our vows) doesn't create the water, but it allows the water of God's blessing to flow through us again.

### Q7. Is it wise to consider beforehand whether we are able to perform our vows?
"It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry." (Proverbs 20:25)

**Answer:**
Yes, it is essential to consider our ability and intent *before* vowing.

1.  **"Devouring the Holy":** This phrase refers to taking something that should be dedicated to God (like tithe or offerings) and using it for personal use.
2.  **The Order of Operations:** The text warns against acting first ("devouring") and thinking later ("making inquiry"). A wise builder counts the cost before laying the foundation (Luke 14:28–30).
3.  **Sanctified Reason:** God gave us reasoning powers. We should not be swept away by the excitement of a meeting or peer pressure to make pledges we cannot keep. A vow should be a deliberate act of the will, surrendered to the Holy Spirit.

[ILL] **Buying on Impulse:** Many people fall into debt because they buy an expensive item on impulse, only checking their bank balance afterwards. In spiritual life, this is a "snare." We must examine our hearts and resources in the light of God’s Spirit before we pledge, so that our "Yes" may be "Yes."

### Q8. Is it not better not to vow?
"Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God: let all that be round about Him bring presents unto Him that ought to be feared." (Psalm 76:11)

**Answer:**
While we must be cautious, we should not avoid vows altogether. The text commands: "Vow, and pay."

1.  **The Necessity of Commitment:** The Christian life begins with a vow—the baptismal covenant. To refuse to vow is to refuse to commit to God. A life without commitment is a life without direction.
2.  **Covenant Relationship:** God enters into covenants with His people. He vows to be our God; we vow to be His people (Jeremiah 31:33).
3.  **Healthy Vows:** A healthy spiritual life involves specific commitments—to pray, to study, to return tithe, to keep the Sabbath. These vows serve as anchors for the soul.
4.  **Dependence:** The secret is vowing *in Christ.* "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13). We vow not in our power, but in reliance on His promise to sustain us.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Covenant:** A binding agreement between two parties. In Scripture, God sets the terms, and man accepts them by faith and obedience.

[ILL] **The Anchor:** A ship carries an anchor not to weigh it down, but to keep it from drifting onto the rocks during a storm. A vow to God is an anchor. When the storms of temptation come, the memory of our solemn promise helps hold us steady in the truth.

### Q9. What did Jacob do after the Lord had appeared unto him?
"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the Lord be my God: And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee." (Genesis 28:20–22)

**Answer:**
Jacob responded to God's visitation with a specific vow of allegiance and stewardship.

1.  **Context:** Jacob had just seen the vision of the ladder reaching from earth to heaven—a symbol of Christ, the Mediator (John 1:51). His vow was a response to God's grace.
2.  **The Content of the Vow:**
    *   **Relationship:** "The Lord shall be my God."
    *   **Worship:** Establishing "God's house" (Bethel).
    *   **Tithing:** "I will surely give the tenth unto thee."
3.  **Significance of Tithe:** Jacob recognized, long before the Levitical law, that tithing was an acknowledgment of God’s sovereignty. He understood that he was a steward, not an owner.

[ILL] **The Junior Partner:** Imagine a wealthy business owner takes a young, penniless man and says, "I will fund your journey, protect you, and make you wealthy." The young man replies, "If you do this, I will be loyal to you and return 10% of the profits to the firm." This is not buying the owner's favor; it is acknowledging who really owns the capital.

### Q10. Did the Lord forget Jacob's vow?
"And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob... I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto Me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred." (Genesis 31:11–13)

**Answer:**
No, God did not forget. Twenty years later, He reminded Jacob of the vow made at Bethel.

1.  **God’s Memory:** God keeps track of our commitments even when we are distracted by the cares of life (as Jacob was with Laban's sheep).
2.  **The "God of Bethel":** God identified Himself by the place where the vow was made. He values the moments we commit to Him.
3.  **The Call to Return:** God reminded Jacob of the vow to call him out of a difficult situation and bring him back to the promised land. Often, God brings our past promises to mind to lead us to a new stage of our spiritual journey.

---

### Q11. And did Jacob keep his promise?
"Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went." (Genesis 35:2, 3)

**Answer:**
Yes, Jacob eventually fulfilled his vow, but it required a spiritual reformation first.

1.  **Preparation for Worship:** Before going to Bethel ("House of God") to pay the vow, Jacob commanded a cleansing. Idols had to be buried; garments had to be changed.
2.  **Sanctuary Lesson:** This parallels the service of the sanctuary—one must be cleansed before approaching the altar. We cannot bring our vows to God while clinging to "strange gods" (idols of the heart, worldliness, pride).
3.  **Revival:** Keeping the vow sparked a revival in Jacob's entire family. Faithfulness in the father saved the household.

[ILL] **Clean Hands:** You would not present a precious gift to a King with hands covered in mud. Jacob understood that to present his vow to God, the "mud" of idolatry and sin had to be washed away. Repentance prepares us to serve God acceptably.

### Q12. Is the Lord particular as to what we vow to Him?
"But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and My name is dreadful among the heathen." (Malachi 1:14)

**Answer:**
Yes, God is very particular. He rejects "corrupt" (blemished or inferior) offerings when we have the ability to give better.

1.  **The Great King:** God appeals to His majesty. He is the "Lord of Hosts." To offer Him second-best is an insult to His dignity.
2.  **The Deceiver:** The text calls the person who vows a healthy animal but swaps it for a sick one a "deceiver." This is hypocrisy—appearing religious while protecting self-interest.
3.  **The Type of Christ:** In the sacrificial system, the animal represented Jesus, the "Lamb without blemish and without spot" (1 Peter 1:19). Offering a sick or lame animal distorted the representation of Christ’s perfect sacrifice.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Lord of Hosts:** A title emphasizing God's power over all armies (angelic and earthly) and forces of nature. He is the Sovereign Ruler.

---

### Q13. What does such a vow betray in him who brings the offering? Contempt.
"And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the Lord of hosts." (Malachi 1:8)

**Answer:**
It betrays **contempt** and a lack of love.

1.  **The Human Standard:** God uses a practical argument: "Offer it to your governor." If you wouldn't give a rusty car or torn clothes to a human dignitary, why offer the "leftovers" of your time, talent, or money to God?
2.  **The Heart Issue:** The problem wasn't just the animal; it was the heart of the worshiper. They did not value God. They viewed His service as a "weariness" (Malachi 1:13).
3.  **Application:** If we give God our sleepy prayers at the very end of the day, or our tithe only after all other bills are paid, are we not offering the "lame and sick"? God deserves the "firstfruits" (Proverbs 3:9).

[ILL] **The Leftover Meal:** If you invited a guest of honor to dinner but served them the scraps left on the plates from the previous night, it would be a grave insult. Yet, we often give the world the best of our energy and give God the scraps of our life. Love dictates that we give our best to the One we love most.

---

### Q14. For what other reason has God a right to demand the best? He gives everything.
"For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold." (Hosea 2:8)

**Answer:**
God has a right to the best because He is the Source of *all* we possess.

1.  **Stewardship:** We are not owners; we are managers. The corn, wine, oil, silver, and gold belong to Him (Haggai 2:8).
2.  **Ingratitude:** In this text, Israel used God's gifts to serve Baal. We commit the same error when we use the health, intellect, and money God gives us to serve the world or satisfy our own pride.
3.  **Acknowledgment:** Vows and tithes are our tangible acknowledgment that God is our Provider.

---

### Q15. To whom do we belong?
"What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's." (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20)

**Answer:**
We belong to God by a double right: Creation and Redemption.

1.  **Bought with a Price:** That price was the blood of Jesus (1 Peter 1:18–19). Because He paid the ultimate price, He owns us entirely—body and spirit.
2.  **The Temple:** Our bodies are the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit. Just as the earthly temple was dedicated solely to holy use, our lives are to be dedicated to holy purposes.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Sanctification is simply the practical realization of this ownership. Because I am His, I yield my members as instruments of righteousness unto God (Romans 6:13).

[ILL] **The Purchase:** If you buy a house, you have the right to decide how it is decorated and who lives there. Christ has purchased the "house" of our humanity. He has the right to cast out the furniture of sin and inhabit us through His Spirit.

---

### Q16. What inducement does the Lord hold out to those who desire to comply strictly with His requirements?
"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts." (Malachi 3:10, 11)

**Answer:**
God offers a challenge and a promise: "Prove Me." He promises abundant blessing and divine protection.

1.  **The Storehouse:** Historically, this was the chambers in the temple where tithes were kept for the support of the priesthood. Today, it represents the treasury of the church for the spreading of the Gospel.
2.  **Windows of Heaven:** This imagery recalls the Flood (Genesis 7:11), but here it is a flood of blessing—spiritual power, wisdom, and material sustenance.
3.  **Rebuking the Devourer:** God promises to intervene against the forces that deplete our resources. This is God's "insurance policy" for the faithful steward.
4.  **Spiritual Blessing:** While material needs are included, the greatest blessing is the outpouring of the Spirit. No amount of money can buy the peace of God and the assurance of His presence.

### Q17. If God should not grant us prosperity, what should we do?
"Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation." (Habakkuk 3:17, 18)

**Answer:**
We should maintain our faith and joy in God, regardless of circumstances.

1.  **True Faith:** This is one of the highest expressions of faith in Scripture. It answers Satan's accusation against Job: "Doth Job fear God for nought?" (Job 1:9). Habakkuk declares that he loves God for *who He is*, not just for *what He gives*.
2.  **God of Salvation:** When material streams dry up, the Fountain of Salvation remains. Our joy is found in the "God of my salvation" (Jesus).
3.  **The Ultimate Vow:** The deepest vow of the Christian is to follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth (Revelation 14:4)—whether that path leads to green pastures or the valley of the shadow of death.

[ILL] **The Marriage Covenant:** A marriage vow includes the phrase "for richer, for poorer." If a spouse only stays during the "richer" times, they are a mercenary, not a partner. God calls us to a covenant love that trusts Him even when the fig tree does not blossom, knowing that He is working all things for our eternal good (Romans 8:28).
