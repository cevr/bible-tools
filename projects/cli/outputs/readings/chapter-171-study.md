### Q1. When Abraham gave Lot his choice of where to live, what did Lot choose for himself and his family?

“And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord. ...Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan.” (Genesis 13:10, 11).

**Answer:**

The choice Lot made was based on external appearance rather than spiritual safety. In analyzing this decision, we see the contrast between walking by sight and walking by faith.

1.  **Walking by Sight:** Lot "lifted up his eyes." He looked for temporal advantage—fertile land, water, and economic potential. To the natural eye, the plain looked like the "garden of the Lord" (Eden), but spiritually, it was a trap.
2.  **Neglecting the Altar:** Abraham dwelt in the rugged hills where he could maintain his altar and communion with God. Lot chose the ease of the plain. In doing so, he prioritized the physical well-being of his family over their spiritual protection.
3.  **The Danger of Prosperity:** The text notes the land was "well watered." Often, the path of least resistance and greatest financial gain is the path of greatest spiritual danger.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Faith:** Trusting in God’s word and character, acting on His promises even when they contradict visible evidence or personal gain (Hebrews 11:1).

[ILL]
**Illustration:** Imagine a man walking through a forest who sees a beautiful, brightly colored berry on a bush. It looks sweet and satisfying to the eye. However, a local guide knows it is poisonous. If the man eats based on what looks good, he dies. If he listens to the guide (faith), he lives. Lot chose the "poisonous berry" of the plain because it looked like the Garden of Eden, ignoring the hidden danger of the city's corruption.

### Q2. Where did this choice take him?

“Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.” (Genesis 13:12).

**Answer:**

Lot did not move into Sodom immediately; he merely pitched his tent *toward* it. This verse illustrates the gradual nature of compromise in the Christian life.

1.  **The Approach of Sin:** Sin rarely captures a believer instantly. It begins with a look, then a step, then a tent pitched in the direction of the world. Lot placed himself within the sphere of Sodom's influence.
2.  **Sanctification and Separation:** God calls His people to be separate from the world (2 Corinthians 6:17). Sanctification is the process of being set apart for holy use. By pitching his tent toward Sodom, Lot was reversing the process of sanctification, allowing the world's atmosphere to permeate his home.
3.  **The Slide into the City:** We later find Lot sitting in the gate of Sodom (Genesis 19:1). He moved from looking at the city to living near it, and finally to dwelling within it.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the believer is cleansed from sin, set apart for God, and transformed into the image of Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23).

[ILL]
**Illustration:** If you place a compass near a strong magnet, the needle will drift away from true north. The magnet doesn't have to touch the compass to affect it; it just needs to be close. Lot pitched his tent close to the "magnet" of Sodom, and inevitably, his family's moral compass began to drift away from God.

### Q3. What were the inhabitants of that city like?

“But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.” (Genesis 13:13).

**Answer:**

The Bible leaves no doubt regarding the moral condition of the society Lot chose to join.

1.  **Sinners Before the Lord:** Their sin was not merely a social offense; it was open rebellion against the Creator. All sin is ultimately against God (Psalm 51:4).
2.  **Exceedingly Wicked:** There are degrees of rebellion. Sodom had reached a point where their conscience was seared. They had rejected the light of nature and conscience (Romans 1:18–32).
3.  **The Environment of Rebellion:** To live voluntarily among those who hate God's law is to expose oneself to a constant spiritual battle. While Jesus associated with sinners to save them, He did not make His home in the center of their corruption to enjoy their lifestyle.

[ILL]
**Illustration:** A doctor enters a quarantine zone to treat patients with a deadly virus, but he wears protective gear and leaves when his work is done. He does not move his healthy family into the sick ward to live there permanently. Lot moved his family into the "plague ward" of sin without a mission to heal, but with a desire to profit.

### Q4. What additional description of this city is given us in the Word of God?

“Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before Me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.” (Ezekiel 16:49, 50).

**Answer:**

While Sodom is infamous for sexual immorality, the prophet Ezekiel reveals the root causes—the "soil" in which those sins grew.

1.  **The Root of Sin:** The sins listed are pride, gluttony ("fullness of bread"), and laziness ("abundance of idleness"). These are the sins of luxury and self-indulgence. When men and women have no useful labor and live only for pleasure, the door is opened to every other vice.
2.  **Neglect of the Needy:** True Righteousness by Faith always works by love (Galatians 5:6). A person justified by Christ cannot remain indifferent to the suffering of others. Sodom's selfishness was proof that they were devoid of the love of God.
3.  **Abomination:** The "haughty" spirit led to the commission of "abominations" (gross sexual perversions). God views the pride that leads to the sin as seriously as the sin itself.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** The experience where a believer, trusting wholly in Christ, receives His forgiveness (justification) and His indwelling power to obey God's law (sanctification), resulting in a life of active love and service (Philippians 3:9; Galatians 2:20).

[ILL]
**Illustration:** Stagnant water becomes a breeding ground for mosquitoes and disease. A flowing river stays clear. "Abundance of idleness" is like stagnant water in the soul; without the flow of service to God and others, the "larvae" of terrible sins begin to breed.

### Q5. How did their conduct affect Lot?

“And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds).” (2 Peter 2:7, 8).

**Answer:**

Peter identifies Lot as a "just" (righteous) man, yet his experience was one of constant torment.

1.  **Vexation of Soul:** To a heart that knows God, sin is repulsive. Lot did not enjoy the sins of Sodom, but because he remained there, his soul was "vexed" or tortured daily. He retained his justification (his standing with God), but he sacrificed his peace.
2.  **The Eye and the Ear:** The text says he was vexed by "seeing and hearing." The senses are the avenues to the soul. By beholding, we become changed (2 Corinthians 3:18). If we behold evil, we must constantly fight against being changed into its image.
3.  **The Cost of Compromise:** Although Lot was saved ("delivered"), he lost his peace, his influence, and eventually almost all his family. One may be a "righteous man" and yet make foolish choices that ruin one's happiness and usefulness.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Justification:** The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is accounted righteous, not because of their own works, but because of the merits of Jesus Christ (Romans 3:24–26).

[ILL]
**Illustration:** If a man chooses to live in a factory filled with smoke and soot, he may scrub himself clean every night (repentance), but all day long he breathes in poison and his clothes are stained. Lot lived in the "smoke" of Sodom; it made his daily walk with God incredibly difficult and painful.

### Q6. Before destroying Sodom and Gomorrah, whom did the Lord send to deliver Lot and his family?

“And there came two angels to Sodom at even.” “And the men [angels] said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou has in the city, bring them out of this place: for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.” (Genesis 19:1, 12, 13).

**Answer:**

God’s mercy precedes His judgment. Before the fire fell, messengers were sent.

1.  **The Investigative Judgment Type:** In Genesis 18, the Lord said He would go down to "see" if their sin was as great as the cry that reached heaven. This typifies the Investigative Judgment. God investigates the case before executing sentence.
2.  **Angelic Ministry:** God sends His angels to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation (Hebrews 1:14). Even in the wickedest city, God had His eye on the one faithful man.
3.  **The Invitation to Save Others:** The angels gave Lot the opportunity to save his extended family. Salvation is often a family affair; God desires the parents' faith to encompass the children (Acts 16:31).

**Term Definition:**
*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary where the lives of professed believers are reviewed before the universe, confirming who has remained in faith and is safe to save (Daniel 7:9–10; 2 Corinthians 5:10).

[ILL]
**Illustration:** Before a building is demolished by a wrecking crew, inspectors go through the rooms to ensure no one is sleeping inside. The angels were heaven's "inspectors," clearing out the righteous before the demolition of Sodom began.

### Q7. Was Lot successful in warning his married children?

“And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city, But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.” (Genesis 19:14).

**Answer:**

This is one of the saddest verses in Genesis. Lot failed to save part of his family because his witness had been compromised.

1.  **Loss of Moral Authority:** Because Lot had lived among them, traded with them, and perhaps allowed his daughters to marry men of the city, his sudden call to "holiness" and "judgment" sounded like a joke.
2.  **The Danger of "Mocking":** The sons-in-law thought he was mocking (joking), but in reality, they were mocking God's warning. To the worldly mind, the message of the Second Coming and final judgment often seems like foolishness (1 Corinthians 1:18).
3.  **Action vs. Words:** Our life speaks louder than our lips. If we live like the world, we cannot effectively warn the world of coming judgment.

[ILL]
**Illustration:** If a man who is known for playing practical jokes runs into a room shouting, "Fire! Fire!", people will likely laugh and stay seated. Lot had played with the world so long that when he finally told the truth about God's judgment, his family thought it was just another game.

### Q8. What did the angels tell Lot the next morning?

“Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city ...Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.” (Genesis 19:15-17).

**Answer:**

The command was urgent and total. There could be no hesitation.

1.  **"Lest Thou Be Consumed":** This teaches the concept of corporate guilt. If the righteous voluntarily remain with the wicked after the warning is given, they share in their plagues (Revelation 18:4).
2.  **"Look Not Behind":** This is the essence of conversion. When we come to Christ, we leave the old life behind. To look back implies a longing for the sin we are leaving (Luke 9:62).
3.  **Escape to the Mountain:** The plain represented the easy life of compromise; the mountain represented the place of safety and communion with God. The Christian life is an upward climb, away from the "plains" of worldly conformity.
4.  **Divine Urgency:** The angels actually grabbed their hands (v. 16). Salvation is by grace; God often drags us away from our destruction when our own will is weak.

[ILL]
**Illustration:** Imagine a swimmer caught in a strong current heading for a waterfall. A lifeguard throws a rope and shouts, "Grab hold and don't let go!" The swimmer cannot try to hold the rope with one hand and paddle back toward the waterfall with the other. He must commit fully to the rescue.

### Q9. What occurred next?

“Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven; and He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.” (Genesis 19:24-25).

**Answer:**

The execution of judgment followed the investigation and the warning.

1.  **Source of Judgment:** The fire came "from the Lord out of heaven." This was not a natural disaster; it was a supernatural act of divine justice.
2.  **Total Destruction:** The cities, the inhabitants, and even the vegetation were destroyed. This foreshadows the "strange act" of God at the end of time (Isaiah 28:21).
3.  **The Nature of Hell Fire:** Jude 7 tells us Sodom suffered the vengeance of "eternal fire." The cities are not burning today; the *result* was eternal. They were turned to ashes (2 Peter 2:6). This aligns with the biblical truth that the wicked are consumed and cease to exist, rather than suffering in conscious torment forever (Malachi 4:1–3).

**Term Definition:**
*   **Executive Judgment:** The final act of God in destroying sin and sinners, cleansing the universe of rebellion (Revelation 20:14–15).

[ILL]
**Illustration:** When a surgeon removes a cancerous tumor, he burns or cuts it out completely so it cannot regrow. God's judgment on Sodom was the "surgery" to remove a cancer of deep iniquity from the land of Canaan.

### Q10. Because the affections of Lot's wife were still in Sodom, what happened to her?

“But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.” (Genesis 19:26).

**Answer:**

Lot's wife provides a sobering warning about the condition of the heart.

1.  **Divided Heart:** Her body left Sodom, but her heart remained there. She loved the world more than she feared the word of God. "If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him" (1 John 2:15).
2.  **Disobedience:** The command was specific: "Look not behind thee." Her look was an act of rebellion. In the little things, our true character is revealed.
3.  **A Monument of Warning:** Jesus said, "Remember Lot's wife" (Luke 17:32). She stands as a perpetual reminder that we cannot serve God and mammon. We must be fully surrendered to Christ.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Surrender:** The act of the will where a believer gives up their own way and rights, submitting entirely to the control and Lordship of Jesus Christ (Romans 6:13).

[ILL]
**Illustration:** A ship may be pulled out of the harbor, but if the anchor is still hooked on the bottom, the ship will be ripped apart or snapped back. Lot's wife had her "anchor" hooked in the possessions and lifestyle of Sodom. When she tried to move forward, that attachment destroyed her.

### Q11. Foretelling the condition of the world just prior to His Second Advent, to what did Christ liken it?

“Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all, Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.” (Luke 17:28-30).

**Answer:**

Jesus uses the days of Lot to describe the atmosphere of the world before His return.

1.  **Absorption in the Material:** Note that the activities listed (eating, drinking, buying, building) are not inherently sinful. The sin lay in letting these temporal things crowd out God. They lived as if this world would last forever.
2.  **Suddenness of Destruction:** Destruction came "the same day" Lot went out. When the door of probation closes, the world will be unaware. They will cry "Peace and safety" just before sudden destruction comes (1 Thessalonians 5:3).
3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the angels' departure signaled the end of mercy for Sodom, when Christ finishes His work in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary, mercy will no longer plead for sinners, and the plagues will fall.

[ILL]
**Illustration:** Imagine a group of people having a picnic on a railroad track, eating and drinking, convinced that trains no longer run. The danger isn't the picnic; the danger is the location and their refusal to listen to the whistle of the oncoming train (the warning signs of the times).

### Q12. Of what great final event is the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah a pattern or type?

“And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly.” (2 Peter 2:6).

**Answer:**

Sodom is not just history; it is prophecy. It is a "type" or "ensample" (example) of the final destruction of the wicked.

1.  **Universal Judgment:** Just as fire cleansed the plain, fire will cleanse the whole earth (2 Peter 3:10).
2.  **Total Eradication of Sin:** The result was "ashes." God will not maintain a torture chamber in the universe; He will reduce sin and sinners to ashes, resulting in a clean universe (Malachi 4:3).
3.  **The Modern "Sodoms":** As noted in the lesson introduction, modern cities have become centers of vice, crime, and godlessness. The accumulation of power and population in cities makes them targets for both moral decay and, as history and prophecy suggest, physical destruction.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Type and Antitype:** A "type" is a historical event, person, or institution designed by God to foreshadow a future spiritual reality (the "antitype"). Sodom (type) points to the destruction of the world by fire (antitype).

### Q13. What is to take place under the seventh plague?

“And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.” (Revelation 16:17-19).

**Answer:**

The final curtain falls on the history of rebellion under the seventh plague.

1.  **"It is Done":** This voice comes from the "temple of heaven," from the throne. This signifies the completion of the Plan of Redemption. The intercession of Christ is finished; the Great Controversy is effectively over; now the executive judgment begins.
2.  **The Fall of the Cities:** "The cities of the nations fell." The great metropolitan centers, which have been the strongholds of human pride, commerce, and sin (Babylon), will collapse. Human engineering and safety measures will be as nothing before the power of God.
3.  **The Call to Readiness:** Since all these things—skyscrapers, financial institutions, and cities—will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought we to be? (2 Peter 3:11). Our only safety is a character built on the Rock, Jesus Christ, and a life hid in Him.

**Illustration:** The Titanic was a "floating city" deemed unsinkable by man. Yet, an iceberg tore it open, and it sank. The great cities of the world today are like the Titanic—technologically advanced and full of revelry, but they are sailing toward a collision with God's justice. The only lifeboat is Christ.
