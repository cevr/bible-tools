## Slide 1 – Q1: The Third Angel’s Warning

- **Question:** What is said of those who worship the beast and his image and
  receive his mark?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:9, 10 – “If any man worship the beast and his
  image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
  drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture
  into the cup of his indignation.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Warning and Wrath)

- **The Most Solemn Warning:**
  - This is the Bible's gravest warning, drawing a line in the sand.
  - In the final conflict, there is no neutral ground.
  - Alignment is either with God’s government (His seal/Sabbath) or the apostate
    power (mark of the beast/false worship).
- **Wrath Without Mixture:**
  - Historically, God’s judgments were mixed with mercy (e.g., the Flood).
  - This warning speaks of a time when mercy is withdrawn.
  - “Wine of the wrath of God” = direct consequences of sin when the restraining
    Spirit is fully removed.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Righteousness)

- **The Necessity of Righteousness:**
  - To stand when mercy ceases, one must be covered by the righteousness of
    Christ.
  - This is a transformative reality, not just a legal covering.
  - Revelation 14:12 describes the survivors: they "keep the commandments of
    God, and the faith of Jesus."
  - Their characters are brought into harmony with God's law through Christ's
    indwelling power.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Doctor and the Medicine:**
  - Imagine a doctor mixing medicine with syrup to make it palatable (judgment
    mixed with mercy).
  - If a patient persistently rejects the cure and chooses poison, the doctor
    eventually steps back.
  - The patient then drinks the pure, unmixed result of their own choice.
  - **Lesson:** God offers mercy during probation; unmixed wrath is the natural
    result of permanently rejecting the Cure.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Defining the Wrath of God

- **Question:** What is the wrath of God?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:1 – “And I saw another sign in heaven, great and
  marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled
  up the wrath of God.”
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:7 – “And one of the four beasts gave unto the
  seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth forever
  and ever.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **The Seven Last Plagues:**
  - Scripture defines this wrath specifically as the seven last plagues.
  - “Filled up” implies the world’s cup of iniquity is full (Genesis 15:16);
    God’s forbearance has reached its limit.
- **Vindication of God:**
  - These are not arbitrary outbursts, but the vindication of God’s law.
  - They demonstrate the true, destructive nature of sin to the universe.
- **The Need for Shelter:**
  - Just as Israel needed the blood on the doorpost, God’s people need the
    “blood of the Lamb.”
  - This shelter must be entered _before_ the plagues begin.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Dam and the Valley:**
  - A dam holds back a mighty river, protecting the valley (God’s restraining
    grace).
  - If the inhabitants demand the dam be removed, the engineers eventually step
    aside.
  - The resulting flood is the natural power of the water unleashed because
    protection was rejected.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Sanctuary Service

- **Question:** Will there be any service in the heavenly temple while these
  plagues are being poured out?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:8 – “And the temple was filled with smoke from the
  glory of God, and from His power; and no man was able to enter into the
  temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Sanctuary & Intercession)

- **End of Intercession:**
  - In the earthly type, the High Priest left the Most Holy Place when atonement
    was finished.
  - In the heavenly antitype, Christ’s ministry as High Priest ceases when the
    temple fills with smoke.
  - He steps out from between the Father and man.
- **No Man Able to Enter:**
  - Currently, the door of mercy is open (Hebrews 10:19).
  - When this event occurs, the door shuts; there is no Mediator to plead for
    pardon.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Character)

- **Standing Without an Intercessor:**
  - God's people must stand in the sight of a holy God without a Mediator during
    the plagues.
  - This requires that their sins have been blotted out.
  - Their characters must be fully solidified in Christ’s righteousness.
  - They have received the “latter rain” and are sealed against sin.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Court Case:**
  - During a trial, the defense attorney argues, offers evidence, and appeals.
  - Once the judge bangs the gavel and reads the verdict, the attorney sits
    down.
  - **Lesson:** The case is closed. We are currently in the trial phase; soon
    the gavel will fall.

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Close of Probation

- **Question:** Will probation have been closed for a period when Christ comes?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 22:11 – “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still;
  and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let
  him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.”
- **Key Text:** Revelation 22:12 – “And, behold, I come quickly.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **A Fixed Condition:**
  - The decree in Revelation 22:11 marks the “Close of Probation.”
  - Character remains fixed forever after this point.
- **Sanctification is a Present Work:**
  - We must be made holy _before_ Christ comes, not _by_ His coming.
  - His coming only fixes the character we have developed.
  - We must be “sanctified wholly” (1 Thessalonians 5:23) while the High Priest
    is still ministering.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Believers cooperate with imparted righteousness until they would rather die
    than sin.
  - Christ lives out His life fully within them.

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Potter and the Kiln:**
  - Fire does not change the shape of a clay pot; it permanently hardens the
    shape it already has.
  - If a pot is crooked when it enters the kiln, it comes out crooked and
    unchangeable.
  - **Lesson:** Now is the time of molding; the close of probation is the fire
    that fixes our shape.

## Slide 15 – Q5: The First Plague

- **Question:** What will be the first plague, and on whom will it fall?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:2 – “And the first went, and poured out his vial
  upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which
  had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Target:**
  - Specifically targets those who rejected God’s seal (Sabbath) and accepted
    the mark of the beast.
- **The Nature of the Plague:**
  - “Noisome” (foul) and “grievous” (painful).
  - Physical ailment reflects spiritual corruption.
  - Compromise with the beast power results in misery inflicted by that very
    power.
- **God’s Protection:**
  - The faithful remnant are shielded from this “noisome pestilence” (Psalm
    91:3).

## Slide 17 – Q6: Universal Worship

- **Question:** How many will worship the beast?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:8 – “And all that dwell upon the earth shall
  worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **Universal Apostasy:**
  - The world will be polarized into two camps: worship of the Creator vs.
    worship of the beast.
  - There will be no neutral, non-religious bystanders.
- **The Book of Life:**
  - Safety is found only in having one's name in the Book of Life.
  - Represents those clothed in Christ's righteousness who have confessed their
    sins.
- **Victory by Faith:**
  - Refusing to worship the beast requires the “faith of Jesus.”
  - It requires seeing Him who is invisible (Hebrews 11:27).

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **Swimming Upstream:**
  - Dead fish float downstream with the current.
  - It takes a living fish to swim against the current.
  - **Lesson:** In the last days, popular opinion will be an overwhelming
    current. Only those alive in Christ (Galatians 2:20) can swim against it.

## Slide 20 – Q7: The Second Plague

- **Question:** What will constitute the second plague?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:3 – “And the second angel poured out his vial upon
  the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died
  in the sea.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **Devastation of the Sea:**
  - The ocean turns into a coagulated, rotting substance.
- **Economic Collapse:**
  - The sea is the source of global commerce and food.
  - This plague strikes the heart of the world system the wicked trusted in.

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Third Plague

- **Question:** What will be the third plague?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:4 – “And the third angel poured out his vial upon
  the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **Fresh Water Destroyed:**
  - Strikes essential drinking water sources (rivers and springs).
  - Brings humanity to the brink of extinction.
- **Dependence on God:**
  - For the wicked: thirst.
  - For the righteous: "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure"
    (Isaiah 33:16).

## Slide 24 – Q9: Divine Justice

- **Question:** Why will the Lord give them blood to drink?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:6 – “For they have shed the blood of saints and
  prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points

- **Retributive Justice:**
  - The punishment fits the crime.
  - The wicked enacted laws to kill God’s people (Revelation 13:15).
- **Intent is Guilt:**
  - Even if they haven't physically martyred the final generation, they agreed
    with the decree to do so.
  - In God’s eyes (1 John 3:15), the intent to murder is equivalent to the act.

## Slide 26 – Q9: Illustration

- **Attempted Murder:**
  - If a man tries to shoot another but the gun jams, the law charges him with
    attempted murder.
  - The intent was there.
  - **Lesson:** The wicked fully intend to wipe out the remnant; God judges them
    based on that murderous intent.

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Fourth Plague

- **Question:** What will the fourth plague bring?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:8 – “And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon
  the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.”
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:9 – “And men were scorched with great heat.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points

- **Solar Intensity:**
  - The sun, usually a source of life, becomes an instrument of torture.
- **Rebuke to False Worship:**
  - The "mark of the beast" involves Sunday observance—a day historically linked
    to sun worship.
  - God uses the object of their false reverence to punish them.
- **No Repentance:**
  - They blaspheme God and repent not.
  - Proof that probation has closed; suffering no longer softens the heart.

## Slide 29 – Q11: The Fifth Plague

- **Question:** What will be the effect of the fifth?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:10 – “And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon
  the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed
  their tongues for pain.”

## Slide 30 – Q11: Key Points

- **Targeting Authority:**
  - Strikes the "seat" (throne) of the beast.
  - Reveals the antichrist's inability to protect its followers.
- **Supernatural Darkness:**
  - A darkness that can be felt (like Egypt).
  - Represents the spiritual darkness they chose.
- **Terror and Pain:**
  - The cumulative effect of sores, heat, and darkness causes agony.

## Slide 31 – Q12: Divine Protection

- **Question:** What promise applies at this time to those who have loved the
  truth?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 91:7 – “A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten
  thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.”
- **Key Text:** Psalm 91:10 – “There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall
  any plague come nigh thy dwelling.”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Key Points

- **Absolute Security:**
  - The child of God is safe amidst destruction.
  - Reason: They made the Most High their "habitation."
- **Abiding in Christ:**
  - Safety comes from living in constant communion with God ("Abide in me," John
    15:4).
  - The blood of Christ applied to the heart protects from the plagues.

## Slide 33 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Storm Shelter:**
  - During a hurricane, a sturdy shelter offers peace.
  - The storm destroys everything outside, but inside there is calm.
  - **Lesson:** Christ is the shelter. Those "in Christ" are safe; the wrath
    falls only on those outside.

## Slide 34 – Q13: The Sixth Plague

- **Question:** What takes place under the sixth plague?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:12 – “And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon
  the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of
  the kings of the East might be prepared.”

## Slide 35 – Q13: Key Points

- **Symbolic Euphrates:**
  - Waters represent peoples/nations (Revelation 17:15) supporting Babylon.
  - "Drying up" symbolizes the withdrawal of human support for the false
    religious system.
- **Kings of the East:**
  - Historically: Cyrus came from the east to conquer Babylon and free Israel.
  - Prophetically: Christ comes like lightning from the east (Matthew 24:27) to
    deliver His saints.
- **Armageddon:**
  - Prepares the world for the final spiritual conflict between Christ and
    Satan.

## Slide 36 – Q14: The Seventh Plague

- **Question:** When the seventh angel pours out his vial, what is heard?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:17 – “And the seventh angel poured out his vial
  into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from
  the throne, saying, It is done.”

## Slide 37 – Q14: Key Points

- **"It is Done":**
  - Marks the absolute conclusion of earth’s history of sin.
  - Mirrors Christ’s words on the cross ("It is finished").
- **Voice of Authority:**
  - Comes from the throne of God.
  - Confirms the great controversy is over and victory is won.

## Slide 38 – Q15: The Voice of God

- **Question:** Whose is this voice?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 25:30 – “The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter
  His voice from His holy habitation; He shall mightily roar upon His
  habitation; He shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all
  the inhabitants of the earth.”

## Slide 39 – Q15: Key Points

- **The Roar of the Lion:**
  - God is the "Lion of the tribe of Judah."
  - Represents the terrible majesty of God asserting authority over a rebellious
    planet.
- **Treading the Grapes:**
  - Connects to the "winepress of the wrath of God" (Revelation 14:19-20).
  - Signifies the final judgment where evil is crushed.

## Slide 40 – Q16: Physical Upheaval

- **Question:** What then takes place?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:18 – “And there were voices, and thunders, and
  lightnings; and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were
  upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.”

## Slide 41 – Q16: Key Points

- **The Great Earthquake:**
  - The physical dismantling of the earth’s surface.
  - The foundations of the earth are shaken (Isaiah 24:18-20).
- **Preparation for New Earth:**
  - Islands flee and mountains disappear (Revelation 16:20).
  - The topography of the sin-cursed earth is broken up.

## Slide 42 – Q17: The Plague of Hail

- **Question:** What accompanies the earthquake?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:21 – “And there fell upon men a great hail out of
  heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God
  because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding
  great.”

## Slide 43 – Q17: Key Points

- **The Hail of Judgment:**
  - Stones weighing a talent (approx. 75-100 lbs).
- **Law and Penalty:**
  - OT penalty for blasphemy/idolatry was stoning (Leviticus 24:16).
  - God’s law, trampled by men, now demands execution.
- **Final Hardness:**
  - Men continue to blaspheme, confirming they are beyond redemption.

## Slide 44 – Q18: The Hope of the Righteous

- **Question:** What will the people of God do in this time?
- **Key Text:** Joel 3:16 – “The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter His
  voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord
  will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.”

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points (Faith & Victory)

- **The Hope of His People:**
  - Amidst crumbling earth, the righteous are calm.
  - Their hope is not in bunkers, but in the Lord.
- **Righteousness by Faith Realized:**
  - Culmination of the gospel: human beings, sinful by nature but transformed by
    grace.
  - They stand amidst the wreck of the world, trusting wholly in the merits of
    Jesus.
  - They have "overcome by the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 12:11).

## Slide 46 – Q18: Illustration

- **The Ship and the Anchor:**
  - Passengers are terrified during a storm.
  - But if the Captain is Master of the ocean and the anchor holds firm, the
    ship is safe.
  - **Lesson:** The world is the storm; Christ is the Anchor within the veil.

## Slide 47 – Q19: Preparation

- **Question:** To prepare the people for this terrible time, what will the Lord
  send beforehand?
- **Answer:** The Third Angel's Message (Revelation 14:9-12).

## Slide 48 – Q19: Key Points

- **The Final Warning:**
  - God never executes judgment without warning.
  - This is God’s last appeal to humanity.
- **Content of the Message:**
  - Warns against false worship.
  - Reveals the true standard (Commandments of God + Faith of Jesus).
  - Prepares a people to stand when plagues fall.

## Slide 49 – Q20: The Result

- **Question:** At the expiration of this message, what will take place?
- **Answer:** The close of probation, and the seven last plagues.

## Slide 50 – Q20: Key Points

- **End of Opportunity:**
  - When the message ends, the gospel work is finished.
  - The door of the ark is shut.
- **Urgency:**
  - We live in the time of the message.
  - Soon comes the time of the result.

## Slide 51 – Q21: The Famine for the Word

- **Question:** What will then come upon those who have rejected that message?
- **Key Text:** Amos 8:11-12 – “Behold, the days come... that I will send a
  famine in the land, not a famine of bread... but of hearing the words of the
  Lord: And they shall wander from sea to sea... to seek the word of the Lord,
  and shall not find it.”

## Slide 52 – Q21: Key Points

- **Too Late:**
  - Today, the Word is accessible; then, the Spirit will be withdrawn.
  - Men will seek the Word to escape consequences (fear), not to obey
    (repentance).
- **Value the Bible Now:**
  - We must store the Word in our hearts now.
  - “Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee”
    (Psalm 119:11).

## Slide 53 – Q22: The Lord’s Response

- **Question:** When the people shall thus cry for the bread of life, what will
  the Lord say to them?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 1:24-26 – “Because I have called, and ye refused... I
  also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.”

## Slide 54 – Q22: Key Points

- **God’s Long-Suffering:**
  - God called, stretched out His hand, counseled, and reproved.
  - He did everything possible to save them.
- **The Rejection:**
  - The people “refused” and “set at nought” His love.
- **The Result:**
  - “Laughing” expresses the absurdity of creatures thinking they can live
    without the Creator.
  - God can no longer help those who have destroyed their own capacity for
    faith.

## Slide 55 – Q23: The Shut Door

- **Question:** How does the Saviour represent the condition of such?
- **Key Text:** Luke 13:25 – “When once the master of the house is risen up, and
  hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock... saying,
  Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not
  whence ye are.”

## Slide 56 – Q23: Key Points

- **"I Know You Not":**
  - Salvation is based on relationship (John 17:3).
  - Tragic phrase: they claimed to be Christians ("Lord, Lord") but never
    surrendered their will.
- **Relationship vs. Profession:**
  - They sought the kingdom, but not the King.
  - They never allowed His righteousness to replace their sinfulness.

## Slide 57 – Q23: Illustration

- **Fire Insurance:**
  - You cannot buy fire insurance for your house _after_ it has already burned
    down.
  - You cannot build a relationship with a stranger in the moment of crisis.
  - **Lesson:** We must know Jesus _now_.

## Slide 58 – Q24: Present Truth

- **Question:** Is not the third angel's message, then, an important one for
  this generation?
- **Answer:** It is the message of life and death.

## Slide 59 – Q24: Key Points

- **Present Truth:**
  - It is the "present truth" (2 Peter 1:12) for this hour.
- **The Only Preparation:**
  - The only message that prepares people to stand blameless.
  - Covered by the robe of Christ’s righteousness.
  - To ignore it is to choose the plagues; to accept it is to choose the seal of
    the living God.
