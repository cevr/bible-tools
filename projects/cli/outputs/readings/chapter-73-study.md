# Chapter 73: The Two Laws

### Q1. By what are all men to be judged at last?
**“Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil." Eccl. 12:13, 14. "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty." James 2:12.**

**Answer:**
The standard in the great judgment is the **Moral Law**—the Ten Commandments. This law is not merely a list of arbitrary rules but a transcript of God’s character and the foundation of His government.

1.  **The Standard of Judgment:** Just as a builder uses a plummet to test the straightness of a wall, God uses His law to test the character of men (Amos 7:7–8). In the judgment, our lives are compared with the perfect requirements of God's law.
2.  **The Scope:** The text says "every secret thing" will be brought into judgment. The law is spiritual; it detects not only outward actions but inner motives and thoughts (Hebrews 4:12).
3.  **The Law of Liberty:** James calls it the "law of liberty." For the sinner, the law is a yoke of bondage and condemnation. But for the believer who has been set free from the guilt and power of sin by Christ, the law becomes a delight—a guide to living freely in righteousness (Psalm 119:45).

**Definition:**
*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary where the lives of professed believers are reviewed before the universe to see who has remained in Christ and is safe to save (Daniel 7:9–10; 2 Corinthians 5:10).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a mirror. If your face is dirty, the mirror reveals the dirt, but it cannot wash it off. If you break the mirror, your face remains dirty. The law is God’s mirror (James 1:23–25). It reveals our sin (dirt) in the light of God’s holiness. We do not destroy the mirror because it tells the truth; rather, the mirror drives us to the soap and water—Christ’s cleansing blood.

### Q2. With what other law were the people of God for a time concerned, which is not to judge them?
**“Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross; and having spoiled principalities and power, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days; which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ." Col. 2:14-17.**

**Answer:**
Paul here speaks of the **Ceremonial Law**, a system of types, shadows, and ritual ordinances given to Israel to teach them the gospel until the Messiah should come.

1.  **Handwriting of Ordinances:** These were the laws regarding sacrifices, feast days, ritual washings, and the priesthood. They were "against us" in the sense that they were a witness to our debt of sin, constantly requiring payment through blood sacrifices which could not themselves take away sin (Hebrews 10:4).
2.  **Nailed to the Cross:** When Jesus died, the reality (the Antitype) met the shadow (the Type). The veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51), signifying that the sacrificial system was finished. No more lambs need to be slain, for the Lamb of God has died.
3.  **Shadow vs. Body:** A shadow is cast by a solid object. The ceremonial system (feasts, sacrificial sabbaths like Passover) was a shadow cast backward from the Cross. Now that "the body" (Christ) has come, we do not embrace the shadow, but the substance.

**Definition:**
*   **Type and Antitype:** A "type" is a divinely appointed symbol or prophetic figure (like the Passover lamb). The "antitype" is the reality that fulfills the symbol (Jesus Christ).

**[ILL]**
If you are waiting for a friend to arrive, you might look at his photograph to remember him. But when your friend walks through the door, you put the photo down and embrace him. To ignore the friend and keep staring at the photo would be an insult. The ceremonial law was the "photo" of Jesus; now that He is here, we focus on Him.

### Q3. What terms are employed, for the sake of convenience, to designate these two laws?
**“The first is called "the moral law," summarily contained in the Decalogue; the second is known as the "ceremonial or typical law" of the Jewish dispensation.**

**Answer:**
Distinguishing between these two laws is crucial for understanding the Bible, especially the writings of Paul.
*   **The Moral Law (The Decalogue):** The Ten Commandments. It is eternal, spiritual, and universal (Romans 7:7, 12). It defines sin.
*   **The Ceremonial Law:** The Levitical law. It was temporary, ritualistic, and instituted specifically to point forward to the Cross (Galatians 3:19).

Failure to distinguish these leads to confusion—some claim the Ten Commandments were abolished at the cross (confusing Moral with Ceremonial), while others try to impose feast days on Christians (confusing Ceremonial with Moral).

---

### Q4. What is the relation of the moral law to sin?
**” Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the taw." 1 John 3:4.**

**Answer:**
This is the Bible's primary definition of sin.
1.  **The Detector of Sin:** You cannot know what sin is without the law (Romans 3:20). To claim the law is done away is to claim that sin no longer exists.
2.  **The Nature of Rebellion:** Sin is not just making a mistake; it is "anomia"—lawlessness. It is a rebellion against the government of God.
3.  **The Remedy:** Because sin is the transgression of the law, the Gospel is the remedy that brings us back into harmony with the law. God does not change His law to accommodate our weakness; He changes our hearts to accommodate His law (Hebrews 8:10).

---

### Q5. How early in the history of our world was this law applicable?
**“For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived; but the woman being deceived was in the transgression." 1 Tim. 2:13, 14.**

**Answer:**
The Moral Law did not begin at Sinai with the Jews; it has existed as long as God has governed moral beings.
1.  **In Eden:** Adam and Eve were created in God's image, with the law written on their hearts.
2.  **The Proof:** Paul states that Eve was in "transgression." Since "where no law is, there is no transgression" (Romans 4:15), the law must have been binding in Eden.
3.  **Universal Obligation:** Because it predates the Jewish nation, the Moral Law is binding on all humanity, not just the Jews.

---

### Q6. Since this law was binding on man previous to his fall, what did it cover?
**His relations to God and to His fellow creatures: "Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked Him a question, tempting Him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Matt. 22:35-39.**

**Answer:**
The Ten Commandments are simply the principle of **Love** expanded into specific directions.
1.  **Two Tables:** The first four commandments define love to God (worship, loyalty, reverence, time). The last six define love to man (respect for authority, life, purity, property, truth, and contentment).
2.  **The Nature of Law:** The law is a transcript of God's character. God is Love (1 John 4:8); therefore, His law is the law of love.
3.  **RBF Connection:** We cannot manufacture this love. It is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost (Romans 5:5). True commandment-keeping is love in action, empowered by Christ.

---

### Q7. When and for what reason were laws of a ceremonial or typical nature introduced?
**They were introduced after man had sinned, and were instituted because God in mercy provided a plan of redemption or a remedial system. "And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering." Gen. 4:3, 4. "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts." Heb. 11:4.**

**Answer:**
The Ceremonial Law was a remedial system added *because* of transgression (Galatians 3:19).
1.  **Before and After Sin:** Before sin, there was no need for sacrifices, for there was no death. After sin, man needed a way to approach a holy God.
2.  **The First Gospel Preaching:** The sacrificial system was the Gospel in type. When Abel offered a lamb, he confessed, "I deserve to die for my sin, but I believe in the Coming One who will die in my place."
3.  **Cain's Error:** Cain brought fruit—the work of his own hands. This represents salvation by works. Abel brought blood—representing faith in Christ’s atonement.

**Definition:**
*   **Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man. In the Old Testament, it was typically made through animal sacrifices which pointed forward to the true Atonement made by Christ.

### Q8. How was the moral law communicated to the people at Sinai?
**“And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire... And He declared His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments." Deut. 4:12, 13.**

**Answer:**
God distinguished the Moral Law by the manner of its delivery.
1.  **Spoken by God:** God Himself spoke the Ten Commandments audibly to the entire nation.
2.  **Divine Majesty:** The mountain shook, there was fire and smoke. This emphasized the terrifying holiness of the law and the impossibility of a sinner standing before it without a Mediator (Exodus 20:18–19).

---

### Q9. How was the ceremonial law communicated to them?
**” And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, if any man of you bring an offering,..." Lev. 1:1, 2. "This is the law of the burnt offering... meat offering,... sin offering,... trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; which the Lord commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that He commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai." Lev. 7:37, 38.**

**Answer:**
In contrast, the Ceremonial Law was given privately to Moses, who then instructed the people. It dealt with the specific procedures of the sanctuary service ("burnt offering," "sin offering," etc.).

---

### Q10. On what, and by whom, was the moral law written?
**“The Lord spake unto you,... and He declared unto you... ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone." Deut. 4:12, 13.**

**Answer:**
1.  **Written by God:** The only part of the Bible written directly by the finger of God (Exodus 31:18).
2.  **Written on Stone:** Stone symbolizes permanence and durability. The Moral Law is unchangeable.
3.  **New Covenant Promise:** Under the New Covenant, God promises to take this same law and write it, not on stone, but on the "fleshy tables of the heart" (2 Corinthians 3:3; Hebrews 8:10).

---

### Q11. In what, and by whom, was the ceremonial law written?
**“And commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant." (Neh. 9:14). "And they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel." Neh. 8:1.**

**Answer:**
1.  **Written by Moses:** Moses wrote these ordinances.
2.  **Written in a Book:** These were recorded in a scroll (the "book of the law"), placed beside the ark, whereas the Ten Commandments were placed *inside* the ark (Deuteronomy 31:26).

---

### Q12. Were the ten commandments a distinct and complete law by themselves?
**“These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice; and He added no more. And He wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me" (Deut. 5:22). "And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to Me into the mount, and be there; and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written." Ex. 24:12.**

**Answer:**
The phrase "He added no more" indicates that the Decalogue is a complete, rounded unit. It is the comprehensive summary of human duty. No other laws share the same status as these ten words spoken directly by Jehovah.

---

### Q13. Was the ceremonial law composed of rules or ordinances?
**“The law of commandments, contained in ordinances." Eph. 2:15.**

**Answer:**
Yes. Paul refers to this system as the "law of commandments contained in ordinances." These were the ecclesiastical and ritual regulations governing the Jewish theocracy, which created a "middle wall of partition" between Jew and Gentile. Christ abolished this distinction, making salvation accessible to all through faith, not ritual.

---

### Q14. What is the nature of the moral law?
**“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul." Ps. 19:7.**

**Answer:**
The Moral Law is:
1.  **Perfect:** It has no flaw; it requires absolute righteousness.
2.  **Converting the Soul:** By revealing our sinfulness, the law acts as a "schoolmaster" to bring us to Christ (Galatians 3:24). It cannot save, but it points out the disease so we seek the Physician.
3.  **Holiness:** To be "sanctified" means to be brought into perfect conformity to this perfect law through the indwelling of Christ.

---

### Q15. Was perfection to be secured by the ceremonial law?
**“Which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience." Heb. 9:9.**

**Answer:**
No. The blood of bulls and goats could never take away sins (Hebrews 10:4).
*   **Ritual vs. Reality:** Eating the Passover lamb was a ritual act of obedience, but it had no power to change the heart. Only the Holy Spirit, applying the blood of the true Lamb (Jesus), can cleanse the conscience from dead works.
*   **Limitation:** The ceremonial law dealt with the external "purifying of the flesh" (Hebrews 9:13), but it could not produce internal righteousness.

---

### Q16. How did the prophet Isaiah say that Christ would treat the moral law when He should appear on earth as the great teacher?
**“The Lord is pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the Law, and make it honorable." Isa. 42:21.**

**Answer:**
Prophecy declared that the Messiah would not destroy the law, but **magnify** it.
*   To magnify means to show in larger detail, to reveal its hidden features. A microscope does not destroy a leaf; it reveals the intricate veins and structures invisible to the naked eye.
*   Christ came to show that the law is not just a cold code, but a living principle of love.

---

### Q17. How did Christ fulfill this prophecy?
**By opening before the people the deep spiritual nature of the law, living in perfect obedience to both letter and the spirit of all its requirements, and giving His life to save men from the penalty of its transgression. See Matt. 5:17-48; John 15:10; 1 Peter 2:22; Rom. 4:25.**

**Answer:**
Christ magnified the law in His Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5):
1.  **Depth:** He taught that hate is murder and lust is adultery. He moved the demands of the law from the hand to the heart.
2.  **Obedience:** Jesus is the only human who ever kept the law perfectly. His life proved that humanity, connected to divinity, can obey God.
3.  **RBF Application:** This perfect obedience (righteousness) is what He offers to us. When we accept Him, His history of law-keeping is credited to us (Justification), and His life is lived out in us (Sanctification).

---

### Q18. How long was the ceremonial law to continue?
**“Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation." Heb. 9:10.**

**Answer:**
The ceremonial system had a built-in expiration date: "the time of reformation." This refers to the coming of Christ and the establishment of the New Covenant. Once the Seed (Christ) had come, the temporary tutor was no longer needed (Galatians 3:19).

---

### Q19. When was this time of reformation?
**“But Christ being come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered in once [once for all] into the holy place [places], having obtained eternal redemption for us." Heb. 9:11, 12.**

**Answer:**
The reformation occurred when Jesus ascended to heaven to begin His ministry in the **Heavenly Sanctuary**.
*   **Shift in Priesthood:** The earthly Levitical priesthood was replaced by the Priesthood of Melchizedek (Jesus) (Hebrews 7:11–12).
*   **Shift in Sanctuary:** We no longer look to a temple in Jerusalem, but to the throne of God where Jesus pleads His blood for us.

---

### Q20. How did Christ's death affect the ceremonial law?
**“Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross." Col. 2:14. "Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances." Eph. 2:15.**

**Answer:**
The death of Christ brought the ceremonial system to a legal and spiritual end.
1.  **Nailed to the Cross:** The legal requirements for animal sacrifices and ritual feasts were satisfied and cancelled.
2.  **The Veil Torn:** When the veil in the temple tore (Mark 15:38), God signified that the earthly house was no longer His dwelling place.

**[ILL]**
When a debt is fully paid, the promissory note is cancelled or destroyed. The ceremonial law was a promissory note of the debt of sin. At the cross, Jesus paid the debt in full, and the note was nailed to the cross, marked "Paid."

---

### Q21. What was the object of the ceremonial law?
**“For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices, which they offered year by year, continually, make the comers thereunto perfect." Heb. 10:1.**

**Answer:**
Its object was to be a "shadow of good things to come." It was an educational tool (a "schoolmaster") to teach the infant church the terrible cost of sin and the way of salvation through blood. Now that the "good things" (Christ and His salvation) have come, the shadow is unnecessary.

---

### Q22. What does Paul say of the holiness and spirituality of the moral law?
**“Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good." "For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin." Rom. 7:12, 14.**

**Answer:**
Far from disparaging the Moral Law, Paul exalts it.
1.  **Character of the Law:** It is holy, just, good, and spiritual.
2.  **The Problem:** The problem lies not in the law, but in the "carnal" (fleshly) nature of man. The carnal mind is at enmity with God and cannot obey His law (Romans 8:7).
3.  **The Solution:** We need a spiritual birth. When we are born of the Spirit, we receive a nature that loves the law and delights to do God's will (Romans 7:22).

---

### Q23. How does faith in Christ affect our relation to the moral law?
**” Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the law." Rom. 3:31.**

**Answer:**
This is the heart of Righteousness by Faith.
1.  **Not Void:** Faith does not give us a license to sin (transgress the law). Grace is not permission to ignore God's government.
2.  **Established:** Faith *establishes* the law in two ways:
    *   **Forensically (Justification):** Faith accepts Christ's perfect law-keeping in our place. The law is satisfied by His life and death.
    *   **Experientially (Sanctification):** Faith invites the Holy Spirit to write the law on our hearts. The believer keeps the law, not to *be* saved, but because he *is* saved and loves his Redeemer (John 14:15).

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** God declaring the sinner righteous because of Christ.
*   **Sanctification:** God making the sinner righteous through the work of the Holy Spirit.

---

### Q24. How does dependence on the ceremonial law affect our relation to Christ?
**“Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing." Gal. 5:2.**

**Answer:**
To go back to the ceremonial law (like circumcision) as a means of salvation is to reject Christ. It is saying that His sacrifice was not enough. You cannot rely on your own works (the shadow) and Christ (the Substance) at the same time. We are saved by grace alone, through faith alone.

---

### Q25. How long does Christ say that the moral law is to endure?
**“Verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Matt. 5:18.**

**Answer:**
As long as heaven and earth exist, the Moral Law remains.
*   **Jot and Tittle:** These were the smallest markings in the Hebrew script. Jesus affirms that not even the smallest part of the Ten Commandments will be altered.
*   **Permanence:** God's law is the foundation of His throne. To abolish the law would be to abolish God's government and allow anarchy to reign in the universe.

---

### Q26. To which code of laws does the Sabbath commandment belong?
**“And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made." Gen. 2:2, 3.**

**Answer:**
The Sabbath belongs to the **Moral Law**, not the Ceremonial.
1.  **Origin:** It was established at Creation, *before* sin entered the world. Therefore, it cannot be a shadow of redemption (which came after sin). It is a memorial of Creation.
2.  **Location:** It is enshrined in the heart of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8–11).
3.  **Distinction:** While there were ceremonial "yearly sabbaths" (feast days) that were nailed to the cross (Colossians 2:16), the weekly Sabbath of the Lord remains for the people of God (Hebrews 4:9). It is the sign of God's creative power and His sanctifying power (Ezekiel 20:12).
