### Q1. What spirit should accompany prayer?

**“And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; that your
Father also which is in heaven, may forgive you your trespasses.” Mark 11:25.**

**Answer:**

Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. However, for this
channel of communication to remain open, the spirit of the suppliant must be in
harmony with the spirit of Heaven. That spirit is love and mercy.

1.  **The Condition of Acceptance:** Christ teaches that we cannot
    simultaneously hold onto the hand of God for blessing and a brother’s throat
    for vengeance. A heart filled with bitterness is spiritually clogged; the
    grace of God cannot flow into it because there is no room for it (James
    3:11–12).
2.  **The Nature of Prayer:** True prayer is not merely asking for things; it is
    communion with the Creator. God is Love (1 John 4:8). To draw near to Him
    while cherishing hatred toward His children is a moral contradiction.
3.  **Hindered Prayers:** The Psalmist declares, "If I regard iniquity in my
    heart, the Lord will not hear me" (Psalm 66:18). Unforgiveness is a
    cherished iniquity. It acts as a thick cloud preventing our prayers from
    ascending to the heavenly sanctuary where Christ ministers.

**[ILL] The Clogged Vessel:** Imagine a vessel with a narrow neck. If it is
already filled with sour, stagnant water (bitterness), you cannot pour fresh,
pure water (God’s grace) into it. The vessel must first be emptied of the old
before it can receive the new. So it is with the heart; we must pour out our
grievances before God can pour in His pardon.

### Q2. Will God pardon the unforgiving?

**“But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive
your trespasses.” Mark 11:26.**

**Answer:**

This is a solemn declaration that cuts to the root of the Great Controversy in
the human heart. It establishes that God’s forgiveness is not an arbitrary legal
act, but a transformation of the soul.

- **Definition of Pardon (Justification):** The legal act of God declaring a
  sinner righteous and releasing them from the condemnation of the law, based
  solely on the merits of Jesus Christ (Romans 3:24; Romans 8:1).
- **The Principle:** We are not saved _by_ forgiving others (works), but our
  willingness to forgive is the evidence that we have _been_ saved (fruit). If
  the Spirit of Christ dwells in us, He will produce His own character—which is
  merciful—in our lives (Galatians 5:22).
- **Rejection of Grace:** The man who refuses to forgive a fellow sinner denies
  the very principle by which he hopes to be saved. He is effectively saying, "I
  want judgment for him, but mercy for me." God cannot grant this, for He is no
  respecter of persons (Acts 10:34). To reject the spirit of forgiveness is to
  reject the Holy Spirit, the only agent of salvation.

**[ILL] The Closed Door:** A man stands inside a house with the door locked and
barred to keep his enemy out. But outside that same door stands the Physician
with the medicine to save the man’s life. As long as the man keeps the door
bolted to shut out his brother, he also shuts out the Physician. He cannot open
the door for one and keep it shut for the other.

### Q3. How should we ask for pardon?

**“And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” Matt. 6:12.**

**Answer:**

In the Lord’s Prayer, Christ instructs us to ask for mercy using a specific
measure: our own conduct toward others.

1.  **A Dangerous Prayer:** If we pray this while holding a grudge, we are
    essentially praying a curse upon ourselves. We are saying, "Lord, deal with
    me exactly as I am dealing with my neighbor." If we are harsh, exacting, and
    unforgiving, we are asking God to be harsh, exacting, and unforgiving toward
    us.
2.  **Debts and Debtors:** Sin is here represented as a _debt_—a moral
    obligation we failed to meet (obedience to God's law).
    - **Justification:** God cancels the massive debt we owe Him.
    - **Sanctification:** Having had our debt cancelled, we are constrained by
      love to cancel the small debts others owe us.
3.  **The Standard of Measurement:** "For with the same measure that ye mete
    withal it shall be measured to you again" (Luke 6:38). The believer who
    understands Righteousness by Faith knows that they have no righteousness of
    their own; they live entirely by God's charity. Therefore, they extend
    charity to others.

**[ILL] The Mirror:** This prayer acts as a mirror. Before we ask God to wash
our face, we must look in the mirror to see if our hands are clean of our
brother's blood. We cannot ask for a clean record in heaven while keeping a
dirty record of wrongs on earth.

### Q4. How many times should we forgive?

**“Then came Peter to Him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against
me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto
thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven.” Matt. 18:21, 22.**

**Answer:**

Peter, influenced by the rabbinical traditions which often limited forgiveness
to three times, thought he was being exceedingly generous by suggesting seven.
Christ’s answer reveals the infinite nature of divine love.

- **Unlimited Mercy:** "Seventy times seven" (490) is not a mathematical limit,
  but a symbol of completeness. It implies that forgiveness is not an _act_ to
  be counted, but a _state of being_ (attitude) to be maintained.
- **Prophetic Parallel:** Interestingly, the "seventy weeks" (490 years) of
  Daniel 9:24 was the period of probation allotted to the Jewish nation to
  finish their work and accept the Messiah. God is long-suffering, not willing
  that any should perish (2 Peter 3:9).
- **The Christian's Duty:** We are to forgive as long as there is a need for
  forgiveness. Love "suffers long and is kind" and "keeps no record of wrongs"
  (1 Corinthians 13:4–5, NKJV). To count offenses is a sign that we have not
  truly forgiven the previous ones.

### Q5. In what parable are we taught forgiveness?

**“Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king... Matt.
18:23-31.”**

**Answer:**

The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant is the Bible's most powerful illustration
of the relationship between God's forgiveness of us (Justification) and our
forgiveness of others (Sanctification).

1.  **The Great Debt (Sin against God):** The first servant owed 10,000 talents.
    In modern terms, this is an unpayable sum—millions of days' wages. This
    represents our sin against God’s holy Law. We are bankrupt; we have nothing
    with which to pay (Romans 3:23).
    - **The Plea:** The servant begs for patience.
    - **The Grace:** The King does not just give time; He _forgives the entire
      debt_. This is Justification by Faith—God clearing the record not because
      we paid, but because He is merciful.
2.  **The Small Debt (Sin against man):** The same servant finds a fellow
    servant who owes him 100 pence (a tiny fraction of the first debt).
    - **The Reaction:** He uses violence and legalism ("Pay me that thou
      owest"). He demands justice for his fellow man while enjoying mercy from
      God.
3.  **The Result:** The King revokes the forgiveness. This teaches a terrifying
    truth: Justification can be lost if it does not lead to Sanctification. If
    the grace of God does not soften our hearts toward others, it proves we have
    received the grace of God in vain (2 Corinthians 6:1).

**[ILL] Two Microscopes:** The unmerciful servant looked at his own debt through
the wrong end of the telescope, making it look small. He looked at his brother's
debt through a magnifying glass, making it look huge. The Gospel reverses this:
we see our own sin as the "chief of sinners" (1 Timothy 1:15) and our brother's
sin with charity.

### Q6. In dealing with the erring, what feeling should actuate us?

**“Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I
had pity on thee?” Matt. 18:33.**

**Answer:**

The motivating power of the Christian life is gratitude and compassion, flowing
from a realization of our own salvation.

- **Compassion Defined:** Literally "to suffer with." It is a deep sympathy for
  the weakness of others because we know our own weakness (Hebrews 4:15).
- **The Logic of the Gospel:** The King argues from the greater to the lesser.
  "I forgave you a mountain; can you not forgive a molehill?"
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We are saved by looking to Christ. When we look at
  Him on the cross, paying our debt, our hearts are broken and melted. From that
  melted heart, compassion flows to others. We forgive because we love Him (1
  John 4:19).

---

### Q7. In forgiving, should we be satisfied with mere formalities?

**“So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts
forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses.” Matt. 18:35.**

**Answer:**

God looks on the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). A verbal "I forgive you" while harboring
internal malice is a lie to the Holy Spirit.

1.  **Heart Work:** The New Covenant promise is, "I will put my laws into their
    mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). The law of God is the
    law of love. Therefore, true forgiveness must be a heart-work, a genuine
    release of bitterness.
2.  **The Danger of Hypocrisy:** To go through the motions of reconciliation
    while planning revenge or wishing evil is "leaven of the Pharisees" (Luke
    12:1).
3.  **Sanctuary Truth:** In the antitypical Day of Atonement, we are to afflict
    our souls and ensure every sin is blotted out. A "formal" forgiveness does
    not blot out the sin of malice from the soul-record; it retains it.

**[ILL] The Weed:** If you snap the top off a weed (formal forgiveness) but
leave the root in the ground (heart bitterness), it will grow back stronger. The
root of bitterness must be pulled out completely (Hebrews 12:15).

### Q8. How should we bestow mercy?

**“Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with
simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with
cheerfulness.” Rom. 12:8.**

**Answer:**

Paul instructs that Christian duties should not be done grudgingly or of
necessity, for "God loveth a cheerful giver" (2 Corinthians 9:7). This applies
to the giving of mercy as much as the giving of money.

- **Cheerfulness:** The Greek word implies hilarity or readiness. We should jump
  at the chance to extend mercy, just as the father ran to meet the prodigal son
  (Luke 15:20).
- **Reflecting the Father:** "Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth
  iniquity... he retaineth not his anger for ever, because _he delighteth in
  mercy_" (Micah 7:18). If we drag our feet in forgiving, we are unlike our
  Father.

### Q9. What should we do when a sin is confessed?

**“So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest
perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.” 2 Cor. 2:7.**

**Answer:**

When a wrongdoer genuinely repents and confesses, the church or the individual
believer has a duty to restore them immediately.

1.  **Forgive and Comfort:** It is not enough to simply say "you are forgiven."
    We must actively _comfort_—strengthen and encourage—the repentant one. They
    are wounded by their own sin; they need the balm of Gilead.
2.  **Preventing Despair:** Paul warns that if we are cold or stern toward a
    repentant sinner, Satan may drive them to despair ("overmuch sorrow"). We
    become agents of the Accuser if we refuse to accept the confession.
3.  **The Role of the Church:** The church is a hospital for sinners, not a
    museum for saints. When a patient is recovering, the staff encourages them;
    they do not berate them for getting sick.

**[ILL] The Lifeline:** A man falls overboard (into sin). He cries for help
(confession). Forgiveness is throwing him the rope. Comfort is pulling him into
the boat, wrapping him in a warm blanket, and giving him a hot drink. To throw
the rope but leave him shivering in the cold is not the spirit of Christ.

### Q10. In restoring the erring, what grace should we exemplify?

**“Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore
such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be
tempted.” Gal. 6:1.**

**Answer:**

Restoration is delicate work requiring the "spirit of meekness."

- **Definition of Meekness:** Strength under control; humility; absence of
  self-righteousness. It is the opposite of pride.
- **"Ye which are spiritual":** Only those led by the Holy Spirit are qualified
  to correct others. A carnal man will correct with anger or superiority, which
  only makes things worse.
- **Self-Distrust:** The verse commands us to look in the mirror ("considering
  thyself"). We are made of the same dust. If not for the grace of God, we would
  have fallen into the same, or a worse, sin. This realization destroys
  arrogance and births gentleness.

**[ILL] Setting a Bone:** The Greek word for "restore" is used for setting a
broken bone. A doctor setting a bone does not use a hammer; he uses firm but
very gentle hands to put it back in place so it can heal. Harshness only breaks
the bone further.

### Q11. Whose example are we to follow in forgiving?

**“Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel
against any: even as Christ forgave you so also do ye.” Col. 3:13.**

**Answer:**

Christ is the standard. We are not to forgive "as our neighbors do" or "as
society expects," but "as Christ forgave."

1.  **How did Christ forgive?**
    - **Freely:** He didn't wait for us to become good before He died for us
      (Romans 5:8).
    - **Completely:** He casts our sins into the depths of the sea.
    - **Sacrificially:** It cost Him His life to purchase our pardon.
    - **Initiatively:** He came to seek and save the lost; He didn't wait for
      the lost to find Him.
2.  **Imparted Righteousness:** We cannot do this in our own strength. We need
    "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27). When we submit to Him,
    He lives out His forgiving life through us.

### Q12. Did God anciently forbid grudging?

**“Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy
people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord.” Lev.
19:18.**

**Answer:**

Yes. Many assume the Old Testament is all vengeance and the New Testament is all
love, but the Law of God has always been a transcript of His character, which is
Love.

- **Definition of a Grudge:** Nursing anger; keeping a mental record of a wrong
  with the intent to bring it up later; ill-will retained in the heart.
- **"I am the LORD":** This command is backed by the authority of Jehovah. To
  hold a grudge is an act of rebellion against the sovereignty of God, who
  claims the exclusive right to judge (Romans 12:19).

---

### Q13. What says the New Testament?

**“Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned; behold, the
Judge standeth before the door.” James 5:9.**

**Answer:**

James reinforces the ancient command with an added urgency: the nearness of the
Judgment.

1.  **The Investigative Judgment:** The "Judge standeth before the door." We are
    living in the solemn time of the end. As our names come up in the heavenly
    sanctuary, do we want the Judge to see us holding grudges against our
    brethren?
2.  **Condemnation:** If we condemn others, we condemn ourselves. "For with what
    judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged" (Matthew 7:2).
3.  **Unity:** Grudging destroys the unity of the church, hindering the
    outpouring of the Latter Rain. The disciples had to put away all differences
    in the Upper Room before Pentecost could come (Acts 1:14; 2:1).

---

### Q14. Does one forgive who holds a grudge?

**Some when pretending to forgive, say: "I can forgive, but I cannot forget."
Such "hold a grudge."**

**Answer:**

True forgiveness deals with the will and the affections, not just words.

- **"Forgive but not Forget":** While humans cannot voluntarily wipe their
  memory banks like a computer, "forgetting" in the biblical sense means
  _choosing not to remember against_. It means we do not dwell on the offense,
  we do not talk about it to others, and we do not let it affect how we treat
  the offender.
- **The Divine Pattern:** God says, "I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
  remember their sin no more" (Jeremiah 31:34). If God "forgot" by simply losing
  His memory, He would cease to be omniscient. Rather, He casts the sin out of
  His consideration. It no longer stands between Him and us.
- **The Test:** If we say "I forgive," but we treat the person coldly, gossip
  about the offense, or wait for them to fail again, we have not forgiven. We
  are holding a grudge under a mask of piety.

**[ILL] The Buried Hatchet:** To forgive is to bury the hatchet. To "forgive but
not forget" is to bury the hatchet with the handle sticking out above the
ground, so you can grab it the moment you need it again.

### Q15. What petition in the Lord's prayer, is the only one to which the Master adds a comment?

**“And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.” "For if ye forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive
not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."
Matt. 6: 12, 14, 15.**

**Answer:**

Christ emphasizes this point above all others in the prayer because it is the
greatest stumbling block to salvation.

1.  **The Vital Link:** There is an inseparable link between our vertical
    relationship (with God) and our horizontal relationship (with man). You
    cannot have one without the other (1 John 4:20).
2.  **The Final Test:** In the final judgment, our treatment of "the least of
    these my brethren" is the evidence of our relationship with Christ (Matthew
    25:40).
3.  **The Good News:** This is not meant to discourage us, but to drive us to
    the Cross. If we find we have hard hearts, we must cry out, "Lord, take my
    heart, for I cannot give it. It is Thy property. Keep it pure, for I cannot
    keep it for Thee" (E.G. White, _Christ's Object Lessons_). He will replace
    our stony heart with a heart of flesh (Ezekiel 36:26), capable of true,
    Christ-like forgiveness.
