### Chapter 92: The "Sign" of Loyalty

**Theological Introduction**
In the closing scenes of the Great Controversy, the entire world is brought to a decision. It is not merely a choice between two days of the week, but between two authorities: the Creator God, who established His law as a transcript of His character, and the power that seeks to change times and laws. This study explores the "Seal of God"—the mark of His ownership and our sanctification—in contrast to the mark of the beast.

Here we see that the Sabbath is not a legalistic burden, but a "sign" that the Lord is the One who makes us holy (Ezekiel 20:12). True Sabbath-keeping is the outward evidence of an inward rest in the finished work of Christ—Righteousness by Faith.

### Q1. Against what does the third angel warn men?

**“And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)**

**Answer:**
The third angel’s message represents the final, most solemn warning given to humanity in the Bible. It warns against three specific things:
1.  **Worshiping the beast:** Giving spiritual allegiance to the apostate power described in Revelation 13.
2.  **Worshiping his image:** Aligning with the coalition of religious and civil powers that mirror the beast's intolerance.
3.  **Receiving his mark:** Accepting the sign of the beast's authority in the forehead (belief/conviction) or in the hand (compliance/actions).

This warning is necessary because God is love, and He will not allow His children to be deceived without a clear revelation of the truth. The issue here is **sovereignty**. To whom do we belong? The "mark" is a counterfeit sign of loyalty, set up in opposition to God's sign.

*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot resist this deception by our own wisdom. Only those who are "in Christ," covered by His righteousness, will have the spiritual discernment to distinguish between the true Gospel and the counterfeit.

**[ILL] The Counterfeit Bill:**
If a man wishes to deceive you with counterfeit money, he does not print a bill that looks nothing like the original. He makes it look as close to the authentic currency as possible. So Satan’s master deception is not atheism, but a false Christianity—a system that looks like the truth but lacks the power of God’s law and the Spirit’s transforming grace.

---

### Q2. How many will worship the beast?

**“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Revelation 13:8)**

**Answer:**
The deception will be nearly universal. The verse states "all that dwell upon the earth." This implies that in the final crisis, there will be only two classes:
1.  Those who follow the popular current, compromising truth for safety, tradition, or economic security.
2.  Those whose names remain in the **Book of Life** because they have maintained a vital connection with the "Lamb slain."

The majority is rarely a safe guide in spiritual matters (Matthew 7:13–14). The test will be so severe that only those who are dead to the world and alive in Christ—anchored in the Scriptures—will stand.

*   **The Lamb Slain:** Note that our security is not in our own strength, but in the "Lamb." Our names are kept in the book only by the merit of His shed blood and His intercession in the heavenly sanctuary.

---

### Q3. What will those be doing who are not worshipers of the beast?

**“Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)**

**Answer:**
This verse describes the character of God’s remnant people. They are identified by three distinct traits:
1.  **The Patience of the Saints:** The word "patience" here means endurance or steadfast perseverance (James 1:3–4). They hold on to Christ when the whole world opposes them.
2.  **Keeping the Commandments of God:** While the world claims the law is done away with or changed, this group upholds the Ten Commandments—not to be saved, but because they *are* saved and love the Lawgiver (John 14:15).
3.  **Having the Faith OF Jesus:**
    *   This is deeper than just faith *in* Jesus. It is possessing the same quality of faith that Jesus had—a complete, trusting dependence on the Father.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot keep the commandments of God without the faith of Jesus. It is His life, lived out in us by the Holy Spirit, that produces obedience. As Paul wrote, "I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" (Galatians 2:20).

**[ILL] The Anchor:**
A ship in a storm is not held safe by the captain's anxiety or effort, but by the anchor gripping the solid rock. The "Faith of Jesus" is our anchor. When the storms of the last days blow, our feelings may fluctuate, but if our faith is anchored within the veil (Hebrews 6:19), in the work of our High Priest, we shall not be moved.

### Q4. Where are the faithful ones finally found?

**“And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.” (Revelation 15:2)**

**Answer:**
They are found in the very presence of God.
*   **The Sea of Glass:** This is located before the throne of God (Revelation 4:6). This signifies that they have passed through the judgment and have been vindicated.
*   **Victory:** They are not seen as struggling victims, but as victors. They overcame the pressure to conform to the beast's system.
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** Just as the High Priest carried the blood into the Most Holy Place, Christ has brought His people into the presence of the Father. They stand there "mingled with fire," representing the purifying presence of God's glory, yet they are not consumed because they are clothed in Christ's righteousness.

---

### Q5. What do they have on their foreheads?

**“And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with Him a hundred forty and four thousand, having His Father's name written in their foreheads.” (Revelation 14:1)**

**Answer:**
They have the **Father's Name** written in their foreheads.
*   In the Bible, a name represents **character** (Exodus 34:5–7). To have God's name in the forehead means His character has been perfectly reproduced in their minds and lives.
*   **The Forehead:** This represents the intellect, the will, and the conscience. They have settled into the truth intellectually and spiritually so that they cannot be moved.
*   **Sanctification:** This is the ultimate result of the plan of salvation—the restoration of the image of God in man (Colossians 3:10).

**Definition:**
*   **Sealing:** The settling of the believer into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so they cannot be moved. It represents God’s claim of ownership.

### Q6. How many were sealed?

**“And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.” (Revelation 7:4)**

**Answer:**
The prophet hears the number 144,000. This group is a special company of believers who live through the final events of earth's history and are translated without seeing death (1 Corinthians 15:51–52; Revelation 14:3–5).
*   Whether the number is literal or symbolic of a complete spiritual Israel, the key point is their character. They are "without fault" before the throne of God.
*   They represent the "firstfruits" (Rev 14:4) of the final harvest—evidence that the Gospel has the power to produce a holy people even in a sinful world.

---

### Q7. With what were they sealed?

**“And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.” (Revelation 7:2)**

**Answer:**
They are marked with the **Seal of the Living God**.
*   A seal is a mark of authentication. In ancient times, a king’s seal on a document made it law.
*   The "Seal of the Living God" stands in direct contrast to the "Mark of the Beast." While the beast enforces a man-made sign of authority (Sunday observance), God places His seal upon those who rely on His authority alone.

**[ILL] The Wax Seal:**
When a king stamps hot wax with his signet ring, the wax takes on the exact impression of the ring—every curve and letter is transferred. God is pressing His law and His Spirit upon our hearts (the wax). If the wax is hard (a stubborn heart), it cannot receive the seal. The Holy Spirit warms the heart so it can receive the perfect impress of God's character.

---

### Q8. Where were they sealed?

**“Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.” (Revelation 7:3)**

**Answer:**
They are sealed **in their foreheads**.
*   Unlike the mark of the beast, which can be received in the hand (forced compliance/action), God’s seal is *only* in the forehead.
*   God does not value forced obedience. He wants the "service of the mind" (Romans 7:25). The seal is a voluntary acceptance of God’s authority and a love for His truth.
*   **Timing:** This sealing work takes place right before the "winds" of strife blow in full fury. It is the present work of our High Priest to prepare a people who will stand during the time of trouble.

### Q9. What does the Bible present as the object of a sign, or seal?

**“Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.” (Daniel 6:8)**

**Answer:**
The purpose of a seal or sign is to render a document **unchangeable** and valid.
*   A legal seal validates the authority of the lawgiver.
*   Without a seal or signature, a law is merely a piece of paper; with the seal, it carries the power of the government.
*   God’s law, the Ten Commandments, is the constitution of His government. It must contain a seal that identifies who the Lawgiver is and His right to command.

---

### Q10. With what is God's seal connected?

**“Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.” (Isaiah 8:16)**

**Answer:**
God’s seal is directly connected to **His Law**.
*   The prophet Isaiah connects the "testimony" and the "law."
*   If the law is binding upon God's disciples, the seal must be found within that law. If the seal is removed (as man has attempted to do by changing the law), the law loses its specific authority. The work of the final generation is to "seal the law" among the disciples—to restore the law to its rightful place in the heart and life.

**Definition:**
*   **The New Covenant:** This is not the abolition of the law, but the writing of the law upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10). The sealing is the final ratification of this covenant work in the believer.

---

### Q11. Does the first commandment show who is its author?

**“Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.” (Exodus 20:3)**

**Answer:**
No, not specifically.
*   It uses the word "Me," but does not define *who* "Me" is in a universal sense.
*   As the note in the lesson suggests, a heathen deity like Baal or Molech could claim this commandment for themselves. It asserts authority, but does not identify the Author by name, title, and territory.

---

### Q12. Does the third commandment show who is the author of the law?

**“Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain...” (Exodus 20:7)**

**Answer:**
No.
*   While it mentions "the Lord thy God," there are "gods many, and lords many" (1 Corinthians 8:5) in the world. This commandment does not distinguish the Creator from false gods who claim titles of lordship.

---

### Q13. Which commandment does point out unmistakably the Author of the law, and show His right to command?

**“For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:11)**

**Answer:**
The **Fourth Commandment** (Exodus 20:8–11) alone contains the essential elements of an official seal:
1.  **Name:** "The LORD thy God" (Jehovah).
2.  **Title:** Creator ("Made").
3.  **Territory:** "Heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is."

This commandment identifies the God of the Bible as the Creator. No other god can claim to have created the universe. Therefore, the Sabbath is the "seal" of the law—the signature of the Lawgiver. By keeping the Sabbath, the believer acknowledges the absolute authority of God as Creator and Sovereign.

*   **Note on the Change:** As the historical documents provided in the outline testify, the Roman Catholic Church admits to changing the day of worship from Saturday (the Sabbath) to Sunday. This change removes the Creator's seal and substitutes a mark of ecclesiastical authority.

---

### Q14. For what purpose is the Sabbath a sign?

**“Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.” (Ezekiel 20:12)**

**Answer:**
The Sabbath is a sign of **Sanctification**.
*   This is the heart of Righteousness by Faith. The Sabbath is not merely a memorial of creation; it is a sign that the same God who created the world is re-creating *us*.
*   **Just as God rested** after His work of creation was finished, the believer rests in the finished work of Christ for redemption.
*   We cannot sanctify ourselves. We cannot make ourselves holy. We keep the Sabbath as a sign that we trust God to make us holy.
*   A person who trusts in their own works (legalism) has not entered into God's rest (Hebrews 4:10). The true Sabbath-keeper rests in Christ’s merit, ceasing from their own attempts to earn salvation.

**[ILL] The Wedding Ring:**
A wedding ring is a sign of loyalty and belonging. It tells the world, "I belong to another." The ring doesn't *make* the person married; the vows do that. But the ring is the visible sign of that relationship. The Sabbath is the "wedding ring" of the bride of Christ, signifying her loyalty to the Creator who sanctifies her.

### Q15. How is this remnant church distinguished, while waiting for the Lord to appear on the white cloud?

**“Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)**

**Answer:**
The Remnant is distinguished by a return to primitive godliness.
*   While the world embraces a form of Christianity that dismisses the law of God, the Remnant upholds the **binding nature of the Ten Commandments**.
*   While legalists try to keep the law by human strength, the Remnant possesses the **Faith of Jesus**, which is the only power that can render acceptable obedience.
*   They stand in contrast to the "mark of the beast" by holding the "seal of God" (the Sabbath) and the character of Christ.

---

### Q16. What will be the feeling toward them?

**“And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Revelation 12:17)**

**Answer:**
The feeling will be one of **wrath and warfare**.
*   The "dragon" (Satan, working through earthly powers) hates the law of God because it detects sin. He hates the Sabbath because it points to the Creator.
*   Those who refuse to compromise will face economic sanctions (unable to buy or sell) and eventually a death decree (Revelation 13:15).
*   We must not expect popularity if we are faithful to the message of the third angel. "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution" (2 Timothy 3:12).

---

### Q17. After enduring the struggle, how will they appear before God?

**“And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.” (Revelation 14:5)**

**Answer:**
They appear **faultless**.
*   **No Guile:** This means no deceit, no hypocrisy. They are transparent and honest. Like Nathanael (John 1:47), they are sincere in heart.
*   **Without Fault:** This does not mean they never sinned, but that their sins have been blotted out in the investigative judgment. They are covered by Christ’s righteousness and have been cleansed by His Spirit.
*   **Jude 24 promise:** "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy."

---

### Q18. What will be the nature of the song they sing?

**“And they sung as it were a new song before the throne... and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.” (Revelation 14:3)**

**Answer:**
They sing a **new song** of experience.
*   A "song" in prophecy often represents a story of deliverance (like the song of Miriam at the Red Sea).
*   No one else can learn this song because no one else has passed through the specific experience of the 144,000—living without an intercessor during the time of trouble, seeing the seven last plagues fall, and standing firm by faith in God’s promise alone.
*   It is a song of absolute victory through Grace.

---

### Q19. Over what had these gotten the victory?

**“And them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name... stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb...” (Revelation 15:2, 3)**

**Answer:**
They have gained a four-fold victory:
1.  **Over the Beast:** The religious-political system.
2.  **Over his Image:** The copy of that intolerance in other lands.
3.  **Over his Mark:** The false sabbath/sign of authority.
4.  **Over the Number of his Name:** The worldly system of identification and commerce.

They sing the **Song of Moses and the Lamb**:
*   **Song of Moses:** Deliverance from earthly enemies and impossible odds (Exodus 15).
*   **Song of the Lamb:** Deliverance from sin, self, and death through the blood of Christ.

**Conclusion:**
The "Sign of Loyalty" is the Sabbath, kept by faith in the Creator. It is the outward evidence of a heart that has chosen God above tradition, convenience, or life itself. The victory is not achieved by human willpower, but by "the faith of Jesus" working in the surrendered heart. May we be found on that sea of glass!
