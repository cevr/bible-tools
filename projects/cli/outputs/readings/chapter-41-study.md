### Q1. Among the captives taken at Jerusalem and carried to Babylon, who were the most prominent?
“Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah." Dan. 1:6.

**Answer:**
The Bible highlights these four young men not merely for their royal lineage or intellectual capacity, but for their character. They were captives in a foreign land, subjected to intense pressure to conform to pagan customs, yet they stood distinct.

*   **The Remnant Principle:** Even in the midst of apostasy and captivity, God always preserves a faithful remnant. These young men represent the believer living in the "Babylon" of this world while maintaining citizenship in heaven (Philippians 3:20).
*   **Preparation for Crisis:** Their prominence began with small decisions. By purposing in their hearts not to defile themselves with the king's meat (Daniel 1:8), they laid a foundation of temperance and self-control.
    *   **Sanctification:** This is the practical work of sanctification—daily choosing God's will over the appetites of the flesh.
    *   **Health Reform:** Their physical health (the result of obeying God's natural laws) gave them mental clarity to understand God's spiritual laws.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Their ability to stand was not of themselves; it was the result of a total surrender to God. When we surrender the will to Christ, He imparts His power to us to overcome the world.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a diamond placed on a piece of black velvet. The darker the background, the more brilliant the light reflected by the diamond. In the dark spiritual atmosphere of Babylon, the character of these four Hebrews shone brightly because they reflected the light of God. A Christian’s character is most visible when the surrounding culture is darkest.

### Q2. Who was Nebuchadnezzar?
“In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it." Dan. 1:1.

**Answer:**
Nebuchadnezzar was the ruler of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the dominant world power of that time.

*   **God’s Sovereignty:** While Nebuchadnezzar thought he conquered Jerusalem by his own strength, Scripture reveals that "the Lord gave Jehoiakim... into his hand" (Daniel 1:2). God sometimes uses secular powers to discipline His people when they depart from His covenant.
*   **Babylon as a Type:** In Bible prophecy, Babylon represents confusion and a system of religion mixed with worldly power. Just as literal Babylon besieged literal Jerusalem, spiritual Babylon (false systems of worship, Revelation 17:5) attacks the true church of God.
*   **Definition:**
    *   **Type:** A person, event, or institution in the Old Testament that foreshadows a spiritual reality in the New Testament or the end times.

---

### Q3. What caused sleep to depart from Nebuchadnezzar?
“And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him." Dan. 2:1.

**Answer:**
The king was troubled by a divinely appointed dream. Though he was the most powerful man on earth, he lost his peace.

*   **The Unrest of the World:** Wealth, power, and military might cannot purchase peace of mind. "There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked" (Isaiah 57:21).
*   **The Holy Spirit’s Conviction:** God often disturbs the sleep or the conscience of men to get their attention. This "troubling" was an act of mercy to save the king and reveal the future of the world.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the sinner brings a sacrifice to the outer court, acknowledging a need, the king is brought to a place of helplessness where he must seek an answer outside of himself.

**[ILL]**
A man may own a soft bed made of the finest silk and down, yet if his conscience is uneasy or his mind troubled, the bed feels like stone. God sometimes places a "pebble" in the shoe of our comfortable lives to make us stop and ask for directions.

### Q4. When he applied to his magicians for an interpretation of his dream, what did they say?
‘The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said. There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter... And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. " Dan. 2:10, 11.

**Answer:**
The wise men of Babylon admitted two crucial things: the limit of human wisdom and the distance of their gods.

*   **The Failure of Earthly Wisdom:** The world's philosophy, astrology, and science are helpless to reveal the secrets of God or the future (1 Corinthians 3:19).
*   **A False Theology:** They claimed their gods did *not* dwell with flesh. This highlights the beauty of the true Gospel.
    *   **Incarnation:** Our God—Jesus Christ—became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14). He is "Emmanuel," God with us.
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** The heathen concept is that gods are distant and demanding. The biblical concept is that God draws near to dwell *in* His people by the Holy Spirit (Colossians 1:27), writing His law on their hearts.

---

### Q5. In his anger, what decree did the king make?
“For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon." Dan. 2:12.

**Answer:**
The king issued a universal death decree.

*   **The Wrath of the Dragon:** This foreshadows the final conflict in the Great Controversy. When the powers of this world cannot silence truth or solve their problems, they resort to force and persecution (Revelation 12:17; 13:15).
*   **No Neutral Ground:** Daniel and his friends were not present with the magicians, yet they were subject to the decree. In the final crisis, even those who quietly serve God will face the wrath of the state.

---

### Q6. To avoid suffering the consequences of the decree, what did Daniel do?
“Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation." Dan. 2:16.

**Answer:**
Daniel did not panic; he acted with "counsel and wisdom" (Daniel 2:14) and requested time, demonstrating faith that God would answer.

*   **Faith in Action:** Daniel did not yet have the answer when he went to the king. He stepped out in faith, believing that the God he served would not abandon him.
*   **The Role of Intercession:** Daniel placed himself between the wrath of the king and the lives of the wise men. In a small way, he acted as a type of Christ, who intercedes to save the perishing.

**[ILL]**
When a storm hits a ship, the fearful passengers panic, but the captain who knows the strength of his vessel remains calm. Daniel knew his God. While Babylon was in a panic, Daniel was at peace because his anchor was cast within the veil (Hebrews 6:19).

---

### Q7. After he and his three companions had prayed to God about the matter, how was the interpretation made known?
“Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision." Dan. 2:19.

**Answer:**
The secret was revealed in response to united prayer.

*   **United Prayer:** Daniel asked his companions to desire mercies of the God of heaven (Daniel 2:18). There is power when God's people unite in intercession (Matthew 18:19).
*   **Revelation, not Speculation:** The truths of the Bible are not discovered by human genius but are revealed by the Holy Spirit. "Scripture is not of any private interpretation" (2 Peter 1:20-21).
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the earthly sanctuary, the priest stood at the Golden Altar of Incense (prayer) before the veil. God spoke from the Most Holy Place. Daniel and his friends were at the altar of prayer, and God sent light from the throne.

---

### Q8. Afterward, when Daniel was brought in before the king, what question was asked him?
“Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?" Dan. 2:26.

**Answer:**
The king looked to the human agent: "Art *thou* able?"

*   **The World’s Perspective:** The world always looks to the man—the leader, the politician, the scientist.
*   **The Believer’s Reality:** The Christian knows that "in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing" (Romans 7:18). We are not able, but He is able.

---

### Q9. What humble and impressive answer did Daniel return?
“There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days." Dan. 1:28.

**Answer:**
Daniel immediately deflected the glory from himself to God.

*   **Humility:** True greatness is willing to be nothing so that God may be everything. "Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory" (Psalm 115:1).
*   **The Latter Days:** This phrase indicates that the prophecy is not just for Nebuchadnezzar’s time, but extends to the end of time ("eschatology"). It covers the sweep of history until the setting up of God’s kingdom.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Just as Daniel claimed no wisdom of his own, the believer claims no righteousness of his own. We stand before the King of the Universe only clothed in the wisdom and righteousness of Christ.

---

### Q10. What had the king seen in his dream?
“Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible." Dan. 2:31.

**Answer:**
The king saw a colossal statue of a man.

*   **Human Glory:** The image represents the kingdoms of this world as man sees them—glorious, bright, and imposing. It is a monument to human achievement.
*   **God’s View:** Later in Daniel 7, God shows these same kingdoms as ravenous beasts. Man sees the glitter; God sees the heart.

---

### Q11. Of what were the different parts of the image composed?
“This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay." Dan. 2:32, 33.

**Answer:**
The image was composed of descending metals: Gold, Silver, Brass (Bronze), Iron, and finally Iron mixed with Clay.

*   **Devolution of History:** Contrary to the theory of evolution, which suggests man is getting better and better, prophecy shows a decline in moral value (from gold to iron and clay).
*   **Increase in Strength:** While the value decreases, the hardness and military strength increase (gold is soft; iron is hard) until the final divided state.

**[ILL]**
History is like a river flowing downstream. It does not rise to higher levels of purity on its own; it flows downward, collecting the mud and debris of the ages. Only the power of God can reverse the current of the human heart.

---

### Q12. What did the king see happen to the image?
“Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces." Dan. 2:34.

**Answer:**
A stone, not of human origin, strikes the image at its feet.

*   **Without Hands:** This phrase always denotes a divine, supernatural work (see 2 Corinthians 5:1; Hebrews 9:11).
    *   **Justification:** Our salvation is "cut out without hands"—it is not of works, lest any man should boast (Ephesians 2:8-9).
*   **The Timing:** The strike happens at the *feet* (the end of time), not at the head (Babylon) or legs (Rome).

---

### Q13. What then took place?
“Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors;... and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth." Dan. 2:35.

**Answer:**
The earthly kingdoms were utterly obliterated, leaving no trace, and the Stone kingdom filled the earth.

*   **The End of Human Government:** The Kingdom of God does not exist alongside earthly regimes forever; it replaces them.
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** The "chaff of the summer threshing floors" calls to mind the judgment. John the Baptist described Jesus as One who will "thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat... but he will burn up the chaff" (Matthew 3:12).
*   **Total Cleansing:** Just as sin must be completely blotted out of the believer's life for them to be holy, sin and rebellious governments must be blotted out of the universe for peace to reign.

### Q14. Having told the dream, how did Daniel proceed to explain the head of gold?
“Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou are this head of go/d." Dan. 2:37, 38.

**Answer:**
The **Head of Gold** represents the **Babylonian Empire** (605 B.C. – 539 B.C.).

*   **Golden Splendor:** Babylon was known for its immense wealth and usage of gold in its temples and palaces. Isaiah 14:4 calls it "the golden city."
*   **God's Delegation:** Daniel reminds Nebuchadnezzar that his power was a gift from God. This is a lesson for all leaders: authority is a stewardship, and they will give an account to the true King of kings.

---

### Q15. What was to be the nature of the next kingdom after Babylon?
“After thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee." Dan. 2:39, first part.

**Answer:**
The succeeding kingdom would be "inferior" to Babylon.

*   **Historical Fact:** The Medo-Persian empire was larger in territory and stronger in military capability, but it was inferior in luxury, magnificence, and the absolute power of its kings.
*   **Definition:**
    *   **Historicism:** The method of interpreting prophecy that sees Daniel and Revelation as a continuous unfolding of history from the prophet's time until the Second Coming.

---

### Q16. Who was the last Babylonian king?
“In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom, bring about threescore and two years old." Dan. 5:30, 31; see verses 1,2.

**Answer:**
Belshazzar was the last acting king of Babylon.

*   **The Handwriting on the Wall:** Belshazzar defied God by using the holy vessels of the sanctuary for a drunken party.
*   **Investigative Judgment Type:** Belshazzar was "weighed in the balances, and art found wanting" (Daniel 5:27). This illustrates that God investigates the lives of men and nations before executing judgment. There comes a point of "probation close" when the opportunity for repentance ends.

---

### Q17. To whom was Belshazzar's kingdom given?
"Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. " Dan. 5:28.

**Answer:**
The kingdom passed to the **Medes and Persians** (represented by the Chest and Arms of Silver).

*   **Fulfillment:** This occurred in 539 B.C. when Cyrus the Great (a Persian) and his uncle Darius (a Mede) conquered Babylon.
*   **Prophetic Accuracy:** God had named Cyrus by name through the prophet Isaiah roughly 150 years before he was born (Isaiah 45:1).

---

### Q18. By what symbol is the Medo-Persian empire elsewhere represented?
“The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia." Dan. 8:20.

**Answer:**
In Daniel 8, Medo-Persia is symbolized by a **Ram with two horns**.

*   **Repeat and Enlarge:** God often repeats a prophecy using different symbols to add more detail.
    *   Daniel 2 (Image) = Political history.
    *   Daniel 7 (Beasts) = Political history + Religious persecution.
    *   Daniel 8 (Ram/Goat) = Conflict between East and West + Sanctuary cleansing.

---

### Q19. What beast was seen to come against him?
“An he-goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth... And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power." Dan. 8:5-6.

**Answer:**
A **He-Goat** (male goat) attacked the Ram.

*   **Direction:** It came from the "west" (Greece is west of Persia).
*   **Speed:** "Touched not the ground" (Dan 8:5) indicates the incredible speed of the conquest.

---

### Q20. What was the result of this contest?
“And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns... Therefore the he-goat waxed very great." Dan.8:7-8.

**Answer:**
The Goat utterly defeated the Ram. This represents the Greek conquest of the Persian Empire.

*   **Historical Fulfillment:** This was fulfilled by Alexander the Great, particularly at the Battle of Gaugamela (331 B.C.). The "great horn" being broken (v. 8) refers to the sudden death of Alexander at the height of his power.

---

### Q21. What did the goat represent?
“And the rough goat is the king of Grecia." Dan. 8:21.

**Answer:**
The Bible explicitly identifies the Goat as **Greece**.

*   **Interpreting Scripture:** We do not need to guess the meaning of the symbols; the Bible provides its own dictionary.

---

### Q22. By what is Grecia represented in the image?
“And another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth." Dan.2:39.

**Answer:**
Greece is represented by the **Belly and Thighs of Brass** (Bronze).

*   **The Brazen Kingdom:** Greek soldiers were famous for their bronze armor (helmets, breastplates, shields).
*   **Cultural Rule:** The text says it would "bear rule over all the earth." Even after the Greek empire fell politically, its culture (Hellenism), philosophy, and language ruled the world for centuries—even influencing the New Testament, which was written in Greek.

---

### Q23. What is said of the fourth kingdom?
“And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise." Dan. 2:40.

**Answer:**
The fourth kingdom, the **Legs of Iron**, represents the **Roman Empire** (168 B.C. – 476 A.D.).

*   **The Iron Monarchy:** Rome was known for its iron discipline, iron weapons, and ruthless ability to crush opposition.
*   **Crushing Power:** Just as iron breaks other metals, Rome absorbed the territories of Babylon, Persia, and Greece, dismantling their independence.

---

### Q24. Where is such a power brought to view?
“And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed." Luke 2:1.

**Answer:**
The New Testament confirms Rome as the ruling power during the time of Christ.

*   **Caesar Augustus:** The first Roman Emperor.
*   **Crucifixion:** It was a Roman governor (Pilate) who sentenced Jesus, and Roman soldiers who executed Him on a Roman cross. The "Iron" legs attempted to crush the "Stone," but in dying, the Stone conquered death.

---

### Q25. What was indicated by the mixture of clay and iron in the feet and toes?
“And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided." Dan 2:41.

**Answer:**
The feet and toes represent the **Divided Nations of Europe**.

*   **No Fifth Empire:** Unlike the previous transitions (Gold to Silver to Brass to Iron), the Iron does not give way to a new metal. It fragments. Rome was not conquered by a stronger empire; it fell apart into ten primary barbarian tribes (the ancestors of modern Europe).
*   **Iron and Clay:** This mixture implies a union of strength and weakness.
    *   **Political:** Attempts to unite Europe through royal marriages and treaties have historically failed (they "shall not cleave one to another," Dan 2:43).
    *   **Religious:** In Scripture, clay represents God's people/church (Jeremiah 18:6; Isaiah 64:8). "Miry clay" suggests a dirty or apostate church. The feet of iron and clay represent the union of Church and State—the Holy Roman Empire and the modern politico-religious landscape.

**[ILL]**
You can mix iron filings and clay powder in a bucket, but they will never fuse into a solid substance. You can force them together, but the moment stress is applied, they fall apart. So it is with human attempts to unite the world without God; there is no internal cohesion of love.

---

### Q26. What is to take place in the days of these kings?
“And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever." Dan. 2:44.

**Answer:**
During the time of the divided nations (modern history), God will intervene to establish His eternal kingdom.

*   **The Second Coming:** This is not a spiritual conversion of the world (a "spiritual kingdom" growing slowly). The Stone strikes with force and destroys the image. This points to the literal, visible return of Jesus Christ (Revelation 19:11-16).
*   **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
    *   **Justification:** We are citizens of this Kingdom *now* by faith.
    *   **Glorification:** We will be citizens of this Kingdom *literally* when He returns.
    *   To be part of that Stone Kingdom, our stony hearts must be broken now (Psalm 51:17). If we fall on the Rock (Christ) and are broken in repentance, we are saved. If the Rock falls on us in judgment, we are crushed (Matthew 21:44).

---

### Q27. Can there be any doubt regarding the fulfillment of this prophecy?
“The great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation there of sure." Dan. 2:45.

**Answer:**
The prophecy is sure.

*   **Track Record:**
    1.  Babylon (Passed)
    2.  Medo-Persia (Passed)
    3.  Greece (Passed)
    4.  Rome (Passed)
    5.  Divided Europe (Current Condition)
    6.  God's Kingdom (Next on the schedule)
*   **Assurance:** Since the first five parts of the prophecy have been fulfilled to the letter, we can have absolute confidence that the final event—the coming of Jesus—will happen just as predicted.
*   **The Blessed Hope:** We are living in the "toes" of the image. The next great event is the appearance of the Stone.

**[ILL]**
If you have a roadmap with six cities marked on a journey, and you have successfully passed the first five exactly as the map described, you do not doubt the existence of the sixth city. You prepare for arrival. We are approaching the gates of the Kingdom of God.
