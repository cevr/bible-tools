## Slide 1 – Q1: The Third Angel’s Warning

- **Question:** Against what does the third angel warn?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:9, 10 – “And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Object of Warning)

- **A Solemn Warning:**
  - This message represents the final, most solemn warning ever given to mortals regarding the closing scenes of the Great Controversy.
- **The Threefold Danger:**
  - **The Beast:** The Papacy (religious-political system), which claims authority to change God’s law (Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the most High... and think to change times and laws...”).
  - **The Image:** Formed when Protestantism in America unites with the state to enforce religious decrees (Revelation 13:11–15).
  - **The Mark:** The sign of allegiance to this apostate power, placed in the forehead (conviction) or hand (compliance).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Worship & Wrath)

- **The Central Issue is Worship:**
  - The conflict is not primarily political, but spiritual.
  - The choice: Obey the Creator (Sabbath) or obey the creature (Sunday).
  - Acts 5:29 – “Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.”
- **The Wine of God's Wrath:**
  - Refers to God's settled opposition to sin and the seven last plagues.
  - Revelation 15:1 – “And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Battlefield:**
  - Imagine a soldier on a battlefield between two armies.
  - One general (the rightful King) demands loyalty; the usurper demands loyalty based on his own authority.
  - To wear the usurper's uniform (mark) is treason.
  - **Lesson:** The Third Angel is the messenger warning the soldiers that the King is returning. To wear the usurper's mark now is to share in his defeat.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Enforcing Power

- **Question:** By what power is this mark enforced on those who receive it?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:16 – “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **The Agent:**
  - The "two-horned beast" (United States of America).
  - Rises "out of the earth" with lamb-like horns (liberty/Protestantism) but speaks as a dragon (force).
  - Revelation 13:11 – “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.”
- **The Method:**
  - He "causeth" (compels) through legal pressure and economic sanctions.
  - Represents a union of church and state enforcing religious dogmas.
- **Universal Test:**
  - No class is exempt ("small and great, rich and poor").

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **Hand and Glove:**
  - **The Hand:** The first beast (Papacy) desiring to grip the world.
  - **The Glove:** The second beast (Apostate Protestantism/Civil Power).
  - **Lesson:** The glove moves only because the hand directs it. The machinery of the state (glove) enforces the principles of the apostate church (hand).

## Slide 8 – Q3: Character of the Remnant

- **Question:** What will those keep, who do not receive the mark of the beast?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Characteristics)

- **Patience of the Saints:**
  - Steadfast perseverance. Lives hid in Christ despite boycott or death decrees (Colossians 3:3 – “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”).
- **Commandments of God:**
  - They keep *all* ten, including the fourth.
  - Obedience is not for salvation (legalism) but the fruit of salvation (John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”).
  - The law is written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”).

## Slide 10 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Faith OF Jesus:**
  - Not just faith *in* Jesus, but the **Faith *of* Jesus**.
  - It is Christ's own faith imparted to the believer.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”
- **Sanctification:**
  - Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27). The believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Mirror:**
  - A mirror cannot generate light; it only reflects the sun.
  - **Lesson:** The saints keep the commandments not by their own power, but because they are turned fully toward Jesus (Sun of Righteousness).
  - The world sees the "Faith of Jesus" reflected in their obedience.

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Identity of the Sabbath

- **Question:** What day is the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:10 – “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work...”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points

- **Specific Identification:**
  - It is not "a" seventh day, but "the" seventh day.
  - Established and blessed by God at Creation (Genesis 2:3 – “And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.”).
- **God's Authority:**
  - It is the Sabbath "of the Lord." It belongs to Him.
  - It is the "sign" between God and His people (Ezekiel 20:12 – “Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.”).

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Bank Check:**
  - If a benefactor gives you a check signed on a specific bank, you cannot cash it at a different bank.
  - **Lesson:** God placed His authority and blessing on the Seventh Day. We cannot transfer that spiritual value to Sunday simply for convenience.

## Slide 15 – Q5: God’s Name for the Day

- **Question:** What does God call the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:13 – “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable...”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points

- **"My Holy Day":**
  - The Sabbath is God's exclusive property, not merely "Jewish."
- **Reverence:**
  - "Turn away thy foot" implies treading on holy ground (Exodus 3:5).
- **Rest and Righteousness:**
  - We set aside our own "pleasure" and works to enter God's rest.
  - This is a weekly lesson in trusting God’s work rather than our own (Hebrews 4:10 – “For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.”).

## Slide 17 – Q6: Christ’s Lordship

- **Question:** Of what day is Christ the Lord?
- **Key Text:** Mark 2:28 – “Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Creator's Right:**
  - Jesus made all things (John 1:3); He is the one who rested at Creation.
- **The True Lord's Day:**
  - Revelation 1:10 mentions the "Lord's day." Mark 2:28 identifies the Sabbath as the day of which He is Lord.
- **Restored, Not Abolished:**
  - Christ did not come to destroy the law (Matthew 5:17).
  - He cleared the Sabbath of man-made burdens to restore it as a blessing (Mark 2:27).

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Architect:**
  - A man who builds a house is the "lord" of the house and designates which room is the sanctuary.
  - **Lesson:** Jesus, the Architect of time, designated the seventh day as the sanctuary in time. To choose another day is to evict the Architect from His own design.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Admissions of Change

- **Question:** What do eminent men say regarding the change of the Sabbath to the first day?
- **Source Quotes:** (Lyman Abbott, The Watchman, Episcopal Church)

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **Admission of Silence:**
  - Honest scholars admit there is **no Scriptural authority** for the change to Sunday.
  - *Lyman Abbott:* "Absolutely no authority in the New Testament."
  - *Episcopal Church:* Change made "by the authority of the church."
- **Sola Scriptura:**
  - If the Bible is the only rule of faith, Sunday observance is a human tradition.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Papacy’s Mark

- **Question:** What does the papacy set forth as the mark, or sign of its authority in commanding men under sin?
- **Key Text:** *Abridgement of Christian Doctrine* – “By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday... by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **The Claim of Authority:**
  - The Papacy claims the change of Sabbath to Sunday is the specific proof (mark) of its power to overrule Scripture.
- **The Rival Sign:**
  - **Seal of God:** The Sabbath (acknowledges Creator's authority).
  - **Mark of the Beast:** Sunday (acknowledges Church's authority).

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **The King’s Seal:**
  - A King’s seal contains Name, Title, and Territory.
  - **God’s Seal (4th Commandment):** Lord (Name), Maker (Title), Heaven and Earth (Territory).
  - **Lesson:** The Beast attempts to break this seal and replace it with a counterfeit stamp (Sunday) to show it has usurped the King’s law.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Modern Advocacy

- **Question:** What are several modern Sunday advocacy organizations trying to do at the present time?
- **Key Text:** N/A (Current Events Application)

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points

- **Push for Legislation:**
  - Organizations are lobbying for civil laws to enforce Sunday rest under the guise of "family protection" or "labor rights."
- **Bridging Church and State:**
  - This fulfills the prophecy of the "image of the beast."
  - It represents a departure from the principles of religious liberty to enforce religious dogmas through civil power.

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Nature of Submission

- **Question:** How are they described who submit to this unscriptural requirement?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:16 – “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points

- **Obedience is Worship:**
  - To know God's will (Sabbath) but obey human power (Sunday) is to worship the human power.
- **Spiritual Reality:**
  - Submission to the beast places human authority above God.
- **Victory through Faith:**
  - Justification by faith breaks the "fear of man" and empowers the believer to obey God at any cost.

## Slide 29 – Q11: The Pressure to Conform

- **Question:** How strongly will this worship and mark be urged?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:15, 17 – “And he had power to... cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark...”

## Slide 30 – Q11: Key Points

- **Two Stages of Coercion:**
  1.  **Economic Boycott:** Unable to buy or sell. A test of trust in God vs. earthly support.
  2.  **Death Decree:** Legislation declaring the faithful worthy of death (parallel to Daniel 3).
- **God’s Provision:**
  - Isaiah 33:16 – “He shall dwell on high... bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.”

## Slide 31 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Siege:**
  - Like an ancient army surrounding a city to cut off food and water to force surrender.
  - The Beast lays siege to God's people by cutting off "buying and selling."
  - **Lesson:** God's people survive not by earthly commerce, but because their "supply line" comes directly from Heaven.

## Slide 32 – Q12: The Divine Warning

- **Question:** What warning does the Lord give against the reception of this mark?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:9, 10 – “If any man worship the beast... The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture...”

## Slide 33 – Q12: Key Points

- **Severity:**
  - The most fearful threatening ever addressed to mortals.
  - Receiving the mark is a willful rejection of God's authority.
- **No Neutrality:**
  - Matthew 6:24 – “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.”
- **God’s Mercy:**
  - The warning is given to save us. God reveals the consequences so we will flee to Christ before probation closes.

## Slide 34 – Q13: The Wrath of God

- **Question:** What is this wine of God's wrath?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:1 – “And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.”

## Slide 35 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Seven Last Plagues:**
  - Judgments poured out after Christ finishes His intercessory work in the sanctuary.
- **"Without Mixture":**
  - Hitherto, judgment has been mixed with mercy.
  - When Christ leaves the Most Holy Place, mercy is no longer available to shield the rebellious.
- **Probation Closed:**
  - Revelation 22:11 – “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still...”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Extent of the Apostasy

- **Question:** How extensive will be the worship of the beast?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:8 – “And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.”

## Slide 37 – Q14: Key Points

- **Universal Deception:**
  - "All that dwell upon the earth." Boundaries of nation and culture will be swept away.
- **The Only Safety:**
  - Only those **written in the Book of Life** are safe.
  - This requires a vital connection with Christ—being covered by His righteousness (Philippians 3:9).
  - Only the life of Christ *in* the believer can withstand the pressure.

## Slide 38 – Q15: The Victors

- **Question:** Will all receive this mark?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:2 – “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark... stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.”

## Slide 39 – Q15: Key Points

- **Victory is Possible:**
  - A group stands on the sea of glass who refused to compromise.
- **Source of Victory:**
  - Revelation 12:11 – “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony...”
  - Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.”

## Slide 40 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Fiery Furnace:**
  - Like the three Hebrews in Daniel 3, the remnant pass through the fire of persecution but are not consumed.
  - **Lesson:** The "Fourth" (Son of God) walks with them. The fire only burns away their bonds and demonstrates the purity of their faith.

## Slide 41 – Q16: The Coming King

- **Question:** The third angel's message warns against the worship of the beast... What follows this message?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:14 – “And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.”

## Slide 42 – Q16: Key Points

- **The Second Coming:**
  - Immediately follows the test of the Mark of the Beast.
- **Symbols:**
  - **Golden Crown:** King of Kings coming to claim His Kingdom.
  - **Sharp Sickle:** Lord of the Harvest coming to reap the earth.
- **Purpose:**
  - The warning message is given to ripen the harvest—to bring every person to a final decision.

## Slide 43 – Q17: The Final Separation

- **Question:** What does He do at this time?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:16 – “And He that sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.”

## Slide 44 – Q17: Key Points

- **The Great Reaping:**
  - The separation of the righteous (wheat) from the wicked (grapes of wrath).
- **The Finality:**
  - "The earth was reaped." Human history ends. Decisions made regarding the seal of God and mark of the beast are irrevocable.

## Slide 45 – Q18: The Harvest

- **Question:** What is the reaping time, or the harvest, called?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 13:39 – “The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.”

## Slide 46 – Q18: Key Points

- **The End of the World:**
  - The Sabbath/Mark of the Beast conflict triggers the end.
- **Wheat vs. Tares:**
  - **Wheat:** Those who produce the fruit of obedience through faith (Sanctification).
  - **Tares:** Those with no root in Christ who yield to the world.
- **Call to Preparation:**
  - We determine now what we will be at the harvest.

## Slide 47 – Q18: Illustration

- **Ripening Grain:**
  - A farmer cannot harvest until the grain is ripe.
  - God is waiting for His people to reproduce His character (Mark 4:29 – “But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.”).
  - **Lesson:** The final test reveals who has truly allowed the Holy Spirit to ripen their character into the likeness of Jesus.
