### Q1. What is Spiritualism defined to be?
**“A belief in the frequent communication of intelligence from the world of spirits, by means of physical phenomena, commonly manifested through a person of special susceptibility, called a medium." Webster.**

**Answer:**
While the dictionary provides a secular definition, from a Biblical perspective, Spiritualism is the belief that the dead survive as conscious spirits and can communicate with the living. This belief rests on the first lie ever told to humanity by the serpent in Eden: "Ye shall not surely die" (Genesis 3:4).

This doctrine is dangerous because it bypasses the Bible—God's appointed means of communication—and relies on subjective experiences and supernatural manifestations. In the context of the **Great Controversy**, this is one of Satan's two master deceptions (the other being the error of Sunday sacredness). By convincing men that the dead are actually alive, Satan prepares the way to impersonate departed friends and loved ones, thereby leading the world into the deception of demons (Revelation 16:14).

*   **The Soul:** In Scripture, a "soul" is the union of the dust of the ground and the breath of life; it is the whole person, not a disembodied entity that flies away at death (Genesis 2:7; Ezekiel 18:4).
*   **The Danger:** If one believes the dead are in heaven watching over us, they have no defense when a "spirit" appears claiming to be a deceased relative, bringing messages that contradict God's Law.

**[ILL] The Ventriloquist:** A ventriloquist speaks through a dummy, making it appear as if the lifeless doll has a voice and personality of its own. The audience is entertained by the illusion. In Spiritualism, the "dummy" is the image or memory of the dead, but the voice speaking through it is that of a fallen angel. The dead person is asleep and silent; the power animating the manifestation is a deceiver.

### Q2. Did this doctrine exist in ancient times?
**“Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God." Lev. 19:31.**

**Answer:**
Yes, this deception is as old as rebellion itself. In ancient times, it was often called necromancy (consulting the dead). God warned Israel against it before they even entered the Promised Land.

*   **Defilement:** The text says we are "defiled" by seeking them. In the **Sanctuary** service, defilement separated a person from the congregation and from God until a sacrifice was made. Engaging with spiritualism creates a spiritual impurity that cuts off our communion with the Holy Spirit.
*   **Familiar Spirits:** This term refers to demons (fallen angels) who "familiarize" themselves with the characteristics, voice, and memories of a human being. When that human dies, the demon can perfectly impersonate them.
*   **God's Jealousy:** "I am the Lord your God." To seek counsel from the dead is an act of spiritual adultery. It is turning away from the Living God to consult with the forces of darkness.

### Q3. How does God regard sorcerers?
**“And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers." Mal. 3:5.**

**Answer:**
God regards sorcery not as a harmless curiosity, but as a capital offense against His government. Sorcery is an attempt to gain power, knowledge, or control through supernatural agencies other than God.

*   **The Judgment:** Malachi places this in the context of judgment. In the **Investigative Judgment** now going on in the heavenly sanctuary, those who cling to sorcery and spiritualism are rejecting the covering of Christ's righteousness.
*   **Swift Witness:** Christ desires to be our Advocate (1 John 2:1). However, for those who persistently align themselves with Satanic agencies, the Truth itself becomes a "swift witness" against them. We cannot have Christ as our High Priest if we are consulting His enemy.

**[ILL] The King’s Court:** If a citizen ignores the King's open court and rightful laws, preferring to make secret deals with the King's enemy to get what he wants, that citizen commits treason. Sorcery is treason against the government of Heaven.

### Q4. What does he call the sorcerers?
**“Therefore hearken not ye to... your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers; ...for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land." Jer. 27:9, 10.**

**Answer:**
God plainly calls them liars. Their ultimate goal is not to comfort, but to "remove you far from your land"—to separate God's people from their inheritance.

*   **The Nature of the Lie:** The foundational lie of spiritualism is that there is no death and that the Law of God can be disregarded with impunity.
*   **Sanctuary Truth:** Just as ancient Israel risked losing their physical land by listening to false prophets, spiritual Israel risks losing the heavenly Canaan. We are kept by the power of God through faith (1 Peter 1:5), but listening to "enchanters" erodes that faith and replaces it with presumption.

### Q5. What was the ancient law concerning witches, and those who had familiar spirits?
**“A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death." Lev. 20:27 (Deut. 18:10-13) (Ex. 22:18).**

**Answer:**
Under the theocracy of ancient Israel, where God was the civil King, witchcraft was a capital crime punishable by death. This demonstrates the extreme severity of the sin in God's eyes.

*   **Why so severe?** It was a cancer in the camp. If allowed to spread, it would lead the entire nation into demon worship (idolatry), severing the covenant relationship with God.
*   **Application Today:** While we do not live under a theocracy and do not execute civil penalties, the *spiritual* penalty remains unchanged: "The wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23). Those who cling to spiritualism cut themselves off from the Source of Life.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** The only way to escape the spiritual death penalty is through faith in Christ, who took the curse of the law upon Himself (Galatians 3:13). But we cannot embrace Christ while holding the hand of devils.

---

### Q6. With what is witchcraft classed by Paul?
**“Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies... I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Gal. 5:20, 21.**

**Answer:**
Paul classifies witchcraft as a "work of the flesh," grouping it with murder, adultery, and idolatry.

*   **Works of the Flesh:** These are the natural byproducts of the unconverted human heart. A person does not need to be a professional "medium" to have the spirit of witchcraft; the desire to control others or to seek power apart from God stems from the same root.
*   **RBF Implication:** Victory over these sins comes not by human willpower, but by the "Fruit of the Spirit" (Galatians 5:22-23). **Sanctification** is the displacement of the "works of the flesh" by the life of Christ within. A believer cannot harbor an interest in the occult and simultaneously be filled with the Holy Spirit.
*   **Inheritance:** Those who practice these things "shall not inherit." This refers to the fitness for heaven. God cannot admit rebellion into the universe a second time.

### Q7. What should one do if asked to inquire of a familiar spirit?
**“And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God?" Isa. 8:19.**

**Answer:**
The prophet Isaiah gives a rhetorical rebuke: Why would the living seek the dead? We are to direct people to the Living God.

*   **Peep and Mutter:** This refers to the indistinct, trance-like noises often made by mediums to mimic the "voices" of the dead. In contrast, God speaks clearly through His Word.
*   **The High Priest:** We have a High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, Jesus Christ, who "ever liveth to make intercession" for us (Hebrews 7:25). To bypass Him and go to a medium is an insult to His ministry. Why seek a dead ancestor who knows nothing, when we have access to the King of Kings who knows everything?

**[ILL] The Broken Cistern:** If you were dying of thirst next to a clear, rushing mountain spring, would you turn away to drink from a muddy, stagnant puddle? God is the Fountain of Living Waters (Jeremiah 2:13). Spiritualism is a broken cistern that holds no water.

---

### Q8. Is it possible to test every spirit?
**“Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God." 1 John 4:1.**

**Answer:**
Yes, it is not only possible but commanded. Blind faith is not Bible faith. The Christian is called to be discerning.

*   **Try (Test):** This word implies a careful examination, like assaying metal to see if it is gold or pyrite (fool's gold).
*   **The Standard:** We cannot test spirits by our feelings ("it felt so peaceful") or by our senses ("I saw him with my own eyes"). Senses can be deceived; feelings can be manipulated. The test must be objective.

---

### Q9. By what are we to try them?
**“To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." Isa. 8:20.**

**Answer:**
The absolute standard for testing any supernatural manifestation is the Law of God (the Ten Commandments) and the Testimony (the teaching of the prophets/Scripture).

*   **The Law:** If a spirit appears and suggests that God's Law has been changed, or that sin is not dangerous, or that we can be saved while willfully disobeying God, it is a lying spirit.
*   **No Light:** The text says there is "no light" in them—literally, no dawn. Those who follow such spirits are walking into eternal night.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** True faith does not set aside the Law (Romans 3:31). Rather, the Holy Spirit writes the Law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10). Therefore, any spirit that diminishes the authority of God's Law is the enemy of the Holy Spirit.

**Definitions:**
*   **The Law:** The transcript of God’s character; the moral standard of the universe.
*   **The Testimony:** The witness of the Holy Spirit through the prophets (Revelation 19:10).

### Q10. Should we have any confidence in signs or wonders presented by those who would try to lead us away from God?
**“And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul." Deut. 13:2, 3.**

**Answer:**
No confidence whatever. This is a crucial point: **Miracles are not a proof of truth.** Satan and his angels possess supernatural power and can perform genuine miracles (healing, calling down fire, predicting events).

*   **The Test of Doctrine:** Even if the miracle is undeniable, if the *message* leads away from obedience to the true God, the miracle worker is an agent of darkness.
*   **God Proveth You:** God allows these deceptions to test our loyalty. Do we love the sensation of the miracle more than the truth of God's Word?
*   **RBF Application:** Our standing before God is based on faith in His Word, not on sight. "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed" (John 20:29).

---

### Q11. What course should one pursue under these circumstances?
**"Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and ye shall serve Him, and cleave unto Him." Deut. 13:4.**

**Answer:**
The safety of the believer lies in strict obedience to God and a "cleaving" (holding fast) to Him.

*   **Keep His Commandments:** This is the ultimate safeguard. Spiritualism almost always leads to antinomianism (the belief that the law is abolished). Those who love God's Law have "great peace, and nothing shall offend them" (Psalm 119:165).
*   **Cleave unto Him:** This implies a relationship. We are safe not just because we know the rules, but because we know the Ruler. Through **Justification**, we are accepted by Him; through **Sanctification**, we walk with Him daily.

---

### Q12. We are directed to the "law and to the testimony," by which to try these spirits that assert to be voices from the dead. After one dies, how much does he know of what is going on among men?
**“Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them." Job 14:20, 21.**

**Answer:**
Scripture is explicit: The dead know nothing of current events on earth.

*   **State of the Dead:** Death is a sleep. The consciousness ceases. If a father dies, and his children subsequently become kings (honor) or paupers (brought low), he has no knowledge of it.
*   **The Implications:** If a "spirit" appears claiming to be your deceased father and says, "I have been watching you and I am so proud of your success," that spirit is a liar. The Bible says the real father "knoweth it not." This simple Bible truth exposes the entire system of Spiritualism as a fraud.

---

### Q13. Does he know anything, or have any memory?
**“For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten." Eccl. 9:5.**

**Answer:**
The dead "know not anything." Their mental processes have ceased.

*   **No More Reward:** This means they are not currently enjoying their reward in heaven or suffering in hell. They are in the grave (Sheol/Hades) awaiting the resurrection.
*   **Memory Forgotten:** This works two ways—the living eventually forget them, but more specifically here, the dead have no memory of their former lives while they are in the state of death. They are "asleep" in Jesus (if righteous) or simply dead (if wicked), waiting for the voice of the Son of God (John 5:28-29).

---

### Q14. What does the wise man add, that forever precludes the idea that the dead come back to earth to communicate with the living?
**“Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun." Eccl. 9:6.**

**Answer:**
Solomon adds that their emotional life—love, hatred, envy—has perished.

*   **No Portion:** They have no part, no agency, and no influence in the world "under the sun" (the land of the living) until the resurrection.
*   **Comfort:** This is actually a comforting doctrine. The righteous dead are not in heaven grieving over the sins and sorrows of their loved ones on earth. They are resting peacefully, unconscious of the passing of time. The next moment they perceive will be the face of Jesus at His Second Coming.

**[ILL] The Deep Surgery:** When a patient is put under general anesthesia for surgery, they are unconscious. They do not feel pain, they do not dream, they do not know how much time passes. When they wake up, it feels instantaneous. Death is a dreamless sleep until the Resurrection morning.

---

### Q15. Then when miracles are performed by spirits purporting to be those of our dead friends, to what may we attribute them?
**“For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty." Rev. 16:14.**

**Answer:**
We must attribute them to the "spirits of devils" (demons).

*   **The Source:** They are fallen angels (Revelation 12:9) who have studied human nature for thousands of years. They can mimic our loved ones with terrifying accuracy.
*   **The Purpose:** The goal is to gather the world to the "battle of that great day." This is the final conflict in the Great Controversy. By uniting the world under the banner of Spiritualism, Satan unites them in rebellion against God's Law.
*   **Global Deception:** Notice they go to the "kings of the earth." Spiritualism influences high-level politics and global policies, often disguised as seeking guidance from "ascended masters" or "spirit guides."

---

### Q16. What will be characteristic of "last day" apostasies from the faith?
**“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils." 1 Tim. 4:1.**

**Answer:**
The Holy Spirit explicitly warns that the "latter times" (the time we live in now) will be marked by a departure from biblical faith toward supernatural mysticism.

*   **Seducing Spirits:** The deception will not appear evil at first. It will be "seducing"—appealing to our emotions, our desire for connection, and our curiosity.
*   **Doctrines of Devils:** These are teachings that originate with Satan. The core doctrine is the immortality of the soul, which negates the need for the resurrection and minimizes the wages of sin.
*   **Departing from the Faith:** One cannot hold to the biblical faith (the Gospel of Jesus Christ) and Spiritualism simultaneously. One must eventually displace the other.

---

### Q17. How will Satan deceive the people?
**“And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light." 2 Cor. 11:14.**

**Answer:**
Satan does not usually appear as a hideous monster with horns and a pitchfork. That would deceive no one. He transforms himself into an "angel of light"—a being of glorious appearance, seemingly full of wisdom, love, and pity.

*   **The Danger:** He will likely quote Scripture (as he did in the wilderness temptation, Matthew 4:6), but he will misapply it. He will preach love, but a love that has no requirements of obedience.
*   **Discernment:** Only those who have the Law of God written in their hearts and are covered by the righteousness of Christ will be able to detect the counterfeit.

---

### Q18. What role will his agents assume before the end?
**“Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness." 2 Cor. 11:15.**

**Answer:**
Satan's human agents (false teachers, mediums, and apostate leaders) will appear as "ministers of righteousness."

*   **Wolves in Sheep's Clothing:** They may be pastors, priests, or miracle workers. They will speak of justice, peace, and brotherhood.
*   **The Test:** The test is not their title or their appearance, but their fidelity to God's Law. If they preach a gospel that excuses sin or claims the Law is void, they are agents of the enemy, regardless of how "righteous" they appear.

**[ILL] The Counterfeit Bill:** A counterfeit $100 bill is designed to look exactly like the real one. It is not printed on red paper with blue ink; it uses the correct colors and portraits. It is the *differences*—often visible only under close inspection—that reveal it is worthless. We must inspect teachings under the light of the Bible.

---

### Q19. Will Satan try to counterfeit the coming of Christ, by signs and wonders?
**“Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." Matt. 24:23, 24.**

**Answer:**
Yes. The crowning act in the great drama of deception will be Satan's attempt to impersonate Christ Himself.

*   **The Deception:** He will appear in different parts of the earth ("Lo here, lo there") as a majestic being of dazzling brightness. He will heal the sick and pronounce blessings.
*   **The Flaw:** He will not come according to Scripture (universally visible, in the clouds—Revelation 1:7). Furthermore, he will likely bless the "day of the sun" (Sunday) and declare that God's Law has been changed, contradicting the Christ of the Bible.
*   **The Very Elect:** The deception will be so overpowering to the senses that only the "elect"—those anchored in the Word—will be safe. They will not rely on what they *see*, but on what the Bible *says*.

---

### Q20. After these signs and wonders are shown, what is immediately to take place?
**“The Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming; even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish." 2 Thess. 2:8-10.**

**Answer:**
The deception will be broken by the glorious, literal return of Jesus Christ. The "brightness of His coming" will destroy the counterfeit system and the "lawless one."

*   **Spirit of His Mouth:** This represents the Truth of His Word. The lie cannot exist in the presence of the absolute Truth.
*   **Deceivableness of Unrighteousness:** Those who perish do so because they "received not the love of the truth" (v. 10). They preferred the pleasant deception of Spiritualism over the self-denying path of the Cross and obedience.
*   **Sanctuary:** At this point, Christ's intercession in the sanctuary has ceased. He returns as King of Kings to execute judgment.

---

### Q21. What will those say then, who have maintained their love for the truth?
**“And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God, we have waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation." Isa. 25:9.**

**Answer:**
This is the shout of victory from the remnant who refused to be deceived.

*   **"This is our God":** They recognize Him! Why? Because by faith they have beheld Him in the Sanctuary. They know His character. They have communed with Him through prayer and the Word. They distinguish the True Shepherd from the false christ because they know His voice (John 10:4).
*   **"We have waited":** Patience is the characteristic of the saints (Revelation 14:12). They did not run after "instant" signs and wonders; they waited for God's time.
*   **Salvation:** Their salvation is not of themselves; it is His salvation. They stand justified by His blood and sanctified by His Spirit, ready to enter eternity.

**Conclusion:**
Spiritualism is the masterpiece of Satan's deception, designed to nullify the Law of God and entrap the world. Our only safety against the "spirits of devils" is the covering of Christ, the truth of the Bible, and the knowledge that the dead sleep until the resurrection.
