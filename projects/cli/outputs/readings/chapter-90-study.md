### Chapter 90: Change of the Sabbath

This study examines the history and prophecy regarding the law of God,
specifically the fourth commandment. We explore the biblical distinction between
the commandments of God and the traditions of men, viewing history through the
lens of the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan.

### Q1. According to the prophet, what was to be Christ's attitude toward His Father's law?

**“The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the
law, and make it honorable." Isa. 42:21.**

**Answer:**

The prophet Isaiah foretold the mission of the Messiah regarding the moral law.
Far from abolishing it, Christ came to "magnify" it—to reveal its spiritual
depth, its breadth, and its binding nature upon the heart.

1.  **The Character of God:** The law is a transcript of God’s character. Since
    God is love (1 John 4:8) and righteous (Psalm 119:137), His law is the law
    of love and righteousness. Christ, being the express image of the Father,
    naturally upheld the law that reflects His own nature.
2.  **Magnifying, Not Changing:** To magnify an object (like looking through a
    lens) does not change the object; it makes the details clearer and the
    object appear larger. In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ magnified the law
    by showing that it applies not just to outward actions, but to thoughts and
    intents of the heart (Matthew 5:21–22, 27–28).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** The verse mentions "for His righteousness'
    sake."
    - **Justification:** We have broken this law and are under its condemnation.
      Christ lived a perfect life of obedience to this law to provide _imputed
      righteousness_ to the repentant sinner.
    - **Sanctification:** Through the New Covenant, Christ writes this magnified
      law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). He imparts His righteousness to us,
      empowering us to obey.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a beautiful, detailed map that guides travelers
to a safe haven. Over time, people have covered it with dust or misunderstood
its symbols. A master guide comes not to tear up the map, but to clean it, shine
a bright light on it, and explain its details so travelers can follow it safely.
Christ did not tear up the moral map (the Law); He shone the light of the Gospel
upon it so we could see the path of righteousness clearly.

### Q2. How much of the law did He uphold?

**“For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle
shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Matt. 5:18.**

**Answer:**

Jesus uses the strongest possible language to affirm the immutability
(unchangeable nature) of the Ten Commandments.

1.  **Permanence:** As long as the physical universe ("heaven and earth")
    exists, God's moral definition of right and wrong remains. The cross did not
    void the moral law; rather, it established it (Romans 3:31). If the law
    could have been changed, Christ need not have died to pay its penalty.
2.  **Jot and Tittle:** The "jot" was the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet
    (_yod_), and the "tittle" was a tiny stroke of the pen that distinguished
    one letter from another. Jesus is teaching that not even the smallest
    identifying mark of the law implies a change. This is vital when we consider
    the Sabbath, the only commandment that identifies the Creator by name and
    title.
3.  **The Standard of Judgment:** The law we are to uphold is the standard by
    which our lives are measured in the sanctuary judgment (James 2:10–12).
    However, we meet this standard not by human effort, but by faith in the
    merits of Jesus Christ.

**Definitions:**

- **Moral Law:** The Ten Commandments, defining man's duty to God and neighbor.
  Eternal.
- **Ceremonial Law:** The laws regarding sacrifices and feast days (types) which
  pointed to Christ (the antitype). These met their fulfillment at the cross
  (Colossians 2:14).

### Q3. How were those to be regarded who should break one of these commandments?

**“Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall
teach men so, he shall be least in the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 5:19.**

**Answer:**

Christ warns against the spirit of antinomianism (lawlessness). In the kingdom
of grace, there is no room for willful rebellion or the teaching that obedience
is unnecessary.

1.  **Unity of the Law:** The law is a cohesive whole. To attack one commandment
    is to attack the authority of the Lawgiver Himself. As James writes, "For
    whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is
    guilty of all" (James 2:10).
2.  **The Danger of False Teaching:** It is a serious thing to sin due to
    weakness, but it is far more dangerous to establish a _doctrine_ that
    teaches others to ignore God's requirements. This refers to religious
    leaders who claim that certain commandments (like the Sabbath) are "done
    away."
3.  **True Greatness:** In God's kingdom, greatness is measured by humility and
    obedience born of love. "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a man hangs by a chain of ten links over a cliff, how
many links must break for him to fall? Only one. It does not matter if the other
nine are strong; if the one he considers "least" breaks, the connection is
severed. So it is with God's law; breaking the Sabbath commandment severs the
connection of obedience just as surely as breaking the commandment against
theft.

### Q4. How much of the law did Christ say is suspended on the two great commandments of love?

**“On these two commandments hang ALL the law and the prophets." Matt. 22:40.**

**Answer:**

Love is not the _replacement_ for the law; it is the _foundation_ and the
_fulfillment_ of it.

1.  **The Structure of the Decalogue:**
    - **The First Great Commandment:** "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God..."
      summarizes the first four commandments (No other gods, no idols, reverence
      for His name, keeping His Sabbath).
    - **The Second Great Commandment:** "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
      thyself..." summarizes the last six commandments (Honor parents, do not
      kill, commit adultery, steal, lie, or covet).
2.  **Hanging, Not Replacing:** If you hang a coat on a hook, the hook supports
    the coat; it does not throw the coat away. The Ten Commandments "hang" on
    the principle of love. You cannot claim to love God (the principle) while
    worshipping idols or breaking His Sabbath (the specific instruction on _how_
    to love Him).
3.  **The New Covenant Experience:** God promises, "I will put my laws into
    their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). When the Holy
    Spirit pours the love of God into our hearts (Romans 5:5), the result is the
    keeping of the law, for "love is the fulfilling of the law" (Romans 13:10).

### Q5. What is said of the power represented by the "little horn?

**“And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the
saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws." Dan. 7:25.**

**Answer:**

This prophecy identifies a specific power arising out of the fourth beast (Rome)
that would attempt to alter the divine government.

1.  **Identifying the Little Horn:** In historicist prophecy, this power is
    identified as the Papacy (the Roman Church system), which arose from the
    ruins of the Roman Empire. It fits the biblical marks: it is a
    religious-political power, it persecuted God's people during the 1260 years
    (Dark Ages), and it speaks "great words" (claiming the prerogatives of God).
2.  **Changing Times and Laws:** The prophecy does not say the power _can_
    change God's law (which is impossible), but that it would _think_ to do so.
    - **Laws:** The Papacy removed the second commandment (idolatry) in their
      catechisms and split the tenth to maintain the number ten.
    - **Times:** The only commandment dealing with time is the fourth—the
      Sabbath. This power claims the authority to shift the solemnity from the
      seventh day (Saturday) to the first day (Sunday).
3.  **The Spirit of Antichrist:** This is not an attack on individual Catholic
    people, many of whom are sincere and love God. It is an exposure of a
    _system_ that places human tradition above Scripture. To change God's law is
    to put oneself in the place of God (2 Thessalonians 2:3–4).

**Definition:**

- **Little Horn:** A symbolic power in Daniel 7 representing the phase of Rome
  that exercises both political and religious authority, extending into the
  medieval period and beyond.

---

### Q6. What power claims authority to change God's law?

**The Roman Church.**

**Answer:**

The Roman Catholic Church openly admits that the change of the Sabbath is a mark
of her ecclesiastical authority.

1.  **Tradition over Scripture:** The Protestant claim of _Sola Scriptura_ ("The
    Bible and the Bible only") is challenged by the Catholic position. They
    argue that since the Bible commands the seventh day, and the Church commands
    the first, those who keep Sunday are practically acknowledging the authority
    of the Church over the Bible.
2.  **The "Mark" of Power:** In the Great Controversy, the issue is authority.
    God's sign of authority is the Sabbath (Ezekiel 20:12, 20). The Church's
    mark of authority, by their own admission, is the institution of Sunday.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a King issues a decree, and a governor changes that
decree and enforces his own version, the subjects who obey the governor are
paying homage to the governor, not the King. By keeping a day established only
by church tradition while neglecting the day established by God's direct
command, the Christian world pays homage to the authority that instituted the
change.

---

### Q7. What part of the law has this power thought to change?

**The fourth commandment.**

**Answer:**

The target of the change was specifically the Sabbath.

1.  **Why the Fourth?** The Sabbath is the "seal" of the law. A seal contains
    three elements: The Name of the Lawgiver (The Lord thy God), His Title
    (Creator/Maker), and His Territory (Heaven and Earth). The fourth
    commandment (Exodus 20:8–11) is the only one containing all three. By
    removing the Sabbath, the "seal" of the living God is removed from His law.
2.  **The Memorial of Creation:** The Sabbath stands as an eternal witness that
    God created the world in six days. Changing the Sabbath obscures the Creator
    and opens the door to idolatry and evolution.
3.  **Sanctification:** The Sabbath is a sign that God sanctifies us (Exodus
    31:13). Shifting it to a day of human appointment shifts the focus from
    God's finished work to man's tradition.

### Q8. Who first enjoined Sunday keeping by law?

**Constantine the Great.**

**Answer:**

The first recorded civil law requiring Sunday rest was issued by the Roman
Emperor Constantine in A.D. 321.

1.  **Political Compromise:** Constantine sought to unite his empire, which was
    divided between pagans (who worshipped on the "day of the sun") and
    Christians. He chose Sunday as a vehicle for unity, blending pagan symbolism
    with Christian terminology.
2.  **No Scriptural Basis:** This was a political edict, not a divine command.
    There is no record of Jesus or the apostles ever commanding a change of the
    day or seeking civil laws to enforce it.
3.  **The Shift:** This event marked a major turning point where the church
    began to rely on the power of the state to enforce religious dogmas, a union
    that eventually led to persecution.

---

### Q9. What did Constantine's law require?

**“Let all the judges and town people, and the occupation of all trades rest on
the venerable day of the sun; but let those who are situated in the country,
freely and at full liberty attend to the business of agriculture; because it
often happens that no other day is so fit for sowing corn and planting vines;
lest the critical moment being let slip, men should lose the commodities granted
by Heaven."**

**Answer:**

The text of the edict reveals its pagan nature.

1.  **"Venerable Day of the Sun":** Constantine did not call it "The Lord's Day"
    or "The Sabbath." He used the pagan title _Dies Solis_. He was a lifelong
    devotee of Sol Invictus (the Unconquered Sun).
2.  **Partial Rest:** Unlike God's command, which requires all to rest (Exodus
    20:10), Constantine allowed agricultural work to continue. This shows the
    law was based on economic and political expediency, not on the sacredness of
    the decalogue.
3.  **Infiltration:** As the note in the source text suggests, Constantine
    brought his "sun day" into the church. This paved the way for the Papacy to
    later adopt and sanctify this pagan festival, claiming it as a Christian
    institution.

### Q10. When and by what authority was Sunday first enjoined upon Christians as the Lord's day?

**Prynne says: "The seventh-day Sabbath was... solemnized by Christ, the
apostles, and primitive Christians, till the Laodicean Council did, in a manner,
quite abolish the observation of it... The Council of Laodicea [364 A.D.]...
first settled the observation of the Lord's day."**

**Answer:**

While Constantine made the civil law (A.D. 321), the church council at Laodicea
(approx. A.D. 364) provided the ecclesiastical (religious) enforcement.

1.  **The Decree:** The council commanded that Christians should not "Judaize"
    (keep the Sabbath) but should work on that day and instead honor Sunday.
2.  **The Curse:** The council pronounced an "anathema" (curse) on those who
    continued to rest on the Bible Sabbath. This fulfills the prophecy of Daniel
    7:25—a power that "thinks to change times and laws" and persecutes those who
    adhere to God's original command.
3.  **Man over God:** Here we see a group of men in a council meeting presuming
    to override the finger of God written on tablets of stone.

### Q11. But do Catholics themselves acknowledge their meddling with the Sabbath Commandment?

**They do.**

**Answer:**

The Roman Catholic Church has been remarkably consistent and honest regarding
this claim. They do not base Sunday-keeping on the Bible, but on the authority
of the Church.

1.  **The Catechisms:** As quoted in the lesson, Catholic catechisms teach that
    the Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to Sunday.
2.  **The Challenge to Protestants:** The Catholic Church rightfully asks
    Protestants: "If you follow the Bible only, why do you keep Sunday? The
    Bible says keep the seventh day." This reveals a disconnect in Protestant
    theology—claiming Scripture alone while following Catholic tradition on this
    point.
3.  **No Scriptural Authority:** The admission "a change for which there is no
    scriptural authority" is critical. It forces every believer to decide
    between the authority of God's Word and the authority of Church tradition.

---

### Q12. To whom do people really pay homage?

**“Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are to whom ye obey?" Rom. 6: 16.**

**Answer:**

Obedience is the highest form of worship. It indicates who is truly Lord of our
lives.

1.  **The Test of Loyalty:** In the Garden of Eden, the test was a tree. In the
    last days, the test involves the "seal of God" (Sabbath) versus the "mark of
    the beast" (Sunday/false worship).
2.  **Servants of Righteousness:** Paul argues in Romans 6 that we are servants
    to the one we obey. If we obey the dictates of a designated power against
    the plain Word of God, we acknowledge that power as our master.
3.  **Liberty in Christ:** True liberty is found in service to Christ. When we
    accept His justification, we are freed from the slavery of sin and human
    tradition. We obey His Sabbath not to be saved, but because we _are_ His
    servants, bought with a price.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A soldier on the battlefield cannot wear the uniform of
one army while obeying the commands of the opposing general. His obedience
reveals where his true allegiance lies. We cannot claim to be soldiers of the
Bible while obeying the "general" of tradition who opposes the Bible's commands.

### Q13. What kind of worship does the Saviour call that which is not according to God's commandments?

**“But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of
men." Matt. 15:9.**

**Answer:**

Jesus defines "vain" (useless, empty) worship as that which replaces God's
requirements with human rules.

1.  **Sincerity is Not Enough:** The Pharisees were sincere and rigorous, yet
    their worship was vain because they set aside God's law to keep their
    tradition (Mark 7:9). Cain was sincere in his offering, but he did not offer
    what God commanded (Genesis 4).
2.  **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the earthly sanctuary, Nadab and Abihu offered
    "strange fire" (Leviticus 10:1)—fire of their own making rather than what
    God commanded. Sunday sacredness is "strange fire." It is a human invention
    offered in place of the holy time God created.
3.  **True Worship:** True worship is "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24).
    Truth is found in God's Word (John 17:17). Therefore, true worship must
    align with the commandments of God.

### Q14. What was the difference between Elijah's faith, and that of the other prophets of his day?

**“Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the
Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men." 1 Kings 18:22.**

**Answer:**

Elijah's experience illustrates that truth is never determined by majority vote.

1.  **The Minority:** Elijah stood alone against 450 prophets of Baal and 400
    prophets of the groves. The visible church structure of the day (under Ahab
    and Jezebel) had completely apostatized.
2.  **Boldness:** Elijah did not seek compromise or interfaith dialogue to blend
    Yahweh worship with Baal worship. He called for a distinct separation.
3.  **Remnant Theology:** Throughout history, God has often worked through a
    small remnant who keep His commandments when the majority has turned aside.
    We must be willing to stand alone with God's Word rather than go with the
    crowd.

---

### Q15. Who was the Baal of the heathen Hebrews?

**“Baal, or Bel, the principal god of the Phoenicians, Chaldeans, and
Carthaginians, is regarded as a personification of the sun... The worship of
Baal prevailed among the Jews in the time of the prophet Elijah and earlier,"
Johnson's Universal Cyclopedia, art, Baal.**

**Answer:**

The ancient conflict involves sun worship.

1.  **Sun Worship:** Baal worship was essentially sun worship. It was the
    counterfeit religion of the ancient world, focusing on the creation (the
    sun) rather than the Creator.
2.  **The Parallel:** Just as ancient Israel was seduced into mixing the worship
    of Jehovah with the worship of Baal (the sun god), the Christian church in
    the 4th century mixed the pure gospel with the "venerable day of the sun."
    The issue is the same: Will we worship the Creator on His holy day, or adopt
    the customs of the world?
3.  **Modern Application:** While people today do not bow to statues of Baal,
    the observance of Sunday is a relic of this ancient solar worship, dressed
    in Christian garb.

---

### Q16. What appeal did Elijah make to the people?

**“How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him, "but
if Baal, then follow him." 1 Kings 18:21.**

**Answer:**

This is the call to decision for every believer.

1.  **Halting:** The word means to limp or hesitate. One cannot walk firmly with
    one foot on the pathway of truth and the other on the pathway of tradition.
    "No man can serve two masters" (Matthew 6:24).
2.  **The Choice:** The question is simple: Who is God?
    - If the Lord (Jehovah) is God, keep His Sabbath (the sign of His Lordship).
    - If Baal (or the church power that adopted his day) is God, keep Sunday.
3.  **The Final Appeal:** We are living in the antitypical day of Carmel. The
    message of the Third Angel (Revelation 14:9–12) is a call to choose between
    the commandments of God and the mark of the beast. God is calling His people
    to step out of the confusion of Babylon and stand on the solid rock of His
    Word.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A neutral gear in a car goes nowhere. You must shift
into drive to move forward. In the spiritual life, there is no neutral ground.
We are either gathering with Christ or scattering abroad. To know the truth
about the Sabbath and yet continue to observe a man-made substitute is to halt
between two opinions. God invites us to follow Him fully and find rest for our
souls.
