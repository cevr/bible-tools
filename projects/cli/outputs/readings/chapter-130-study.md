### Q1. What relation do the Father and the Son sustain to each other?

**“I and My Father are one." John 10:30.**

**Answer:** The unity between God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, is the
absolute standard and source of all true unity in the universe. This oneness is
not merely a mathematical unity, but a perfect unity of character, purpose, and
will.

- **Unity of Character:** Jesus is the "express image" of the Father’s person
  (Hebrews 1:3). When we look at Jesus—His love, His mercy, and His hatred of
  sin—we are seeing exactly what the Father is like (John 14:9).
- **Unity of Will:** Christ came not to do His own will, but the will of the
  Father who sent Him (John 6:38). There was never a moment of disagreement or
  conflict between them.
- **The Foundation of the Gospel:** Because they are one, the plan of salvation
  is the joint work of the Father and the Son. It was not the Son placating an
  angry Father, but "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself" (2
  Corinthians 5:19).

**[ILL]** Consider two musical instruments perfectly tuned to the same pitch.
When one note is struck on the first, it is in perfect harmony with the second.
They are two distinct instruments, yet they produce one united sound. So it is
with the Father and the Son; they are distinct persons, yet one in the melody of
holiness and love.

### Q2. In what did Christ ask the Father in behalf of His disciples?

**“Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given Me, that
they may be one, as We are." John 17:11.**

**Answer:** In this High Priestly prayer, offered just before His sacrifice,
Christ identifies the only power that can create true unity among believers: the
"name" of the Father.

- **Kept by the Name:** In Scripture, a name represents character (Exodus
  34:5–7). To be kept in the Father's name means to be preserved in the Father's
  character—His holiness, love, and truth.
- **The Standard of Unity:** The prayer is that believers may be one "as We
  are." This is a high calling. It means our unity must be organic and
  spiritual, not just a forced organizational agreement.
- **A Supernatural Work:** Human beings are naturally selfish and divisive. True
  unity is a supernatural result of **Sanctification**.
  - _Definition—Sanctification:_ The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to purify
    the believer's character, imparting the righteousness of Christ so that the
    believer actually becomes like Jesus in nature and conduct (1 Thessalonians
    4:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:13).

**[ILL]** If you tie two cats together by their tails and hang them over a
clothesline, you have "union," but you certainly don't have "unity." True unity
comes not from being tied together by rules or creeds, but by sharing the same
internal life and nature.

### Q3. Could the church be thus, what influence would it have on unbelievers?

**“That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that
they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that Thou has sent Me."
John 17:21.**

**Answer:** The strongest argument in favor of the gospel is a loving and
lovable Christian; the strongest argument against it is a discordant and
contentious church.

- **The Credibility of the Gospel:** Jesus links the world's ability to believe
  in His mission directly to the unity of His followers. When the church is
  divided, the world questions the power of the Gospel.
- **Union with Christ:** Notice the condition: "that they also may be one _in
  us_." We cannot be one with each other unless we are first one with Christ.
  - **Righteousness by Faith connection:** As we submit to Christ and allow His
    righteousness to be imputed (credited) to us and imparted (lived out) in us,
    our selfish pride dies. When self dies, division ceases. The closer the
    spokes of a wheel get to the hub (Christ), the closer they get to one
    another.

**[ILL]** A magnet draws many iron filings to itself. Because every filing is
holding onto the magnet, they all cling to each other. If the magnet is removed,
they fall apart. Christ is the magnet; our unity with one another depends
entirely on our contact with Him.

### Q4. What did the apostle Paul teach on this point?

**“Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye
all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye
be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment." 1 Cor.
1:10.**

**Answer:** Paul does not settle for a superficial peace where members agree to
disagree on truth. He calls for a profound unity of doctrine and judgment.

- **Speaking the Same Thing:** This refers to doctrinal unity. Truth is one; it
  does not contradict itself. The Holy Spirit is the "Spirit of Truth" (John
  16:13), and He leads the church into a unified understanding of the Word.
- **No Schisms:** The word "divisions" here implies schisms or tears in a
  garment. The church is to be seamless in its affection and belief.
- **The Mind of Christ:** How can many different people have the "same mind"?
  Only by having the "mind of Christ" (Philippians 2:5). When we all surrender
  our own opinions to the authority of the Bible, we find common ground.

**[ILL]** In an orchestra, if every musician plays whatever tune they like best,
the result is chaos (noise). But if every musician keeps their eye on the one
conductor and plays the score exactly as written, the result is a symphony
(unity). The Bible is our score, and Christ is our Conductor.

### Q5. What was a prominent cause of division in the early church?

**“For I know this, that after My departing shall grievous wolves enter in among
you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking
perverse things, to draw away disciples after them." Acts 20:29, 30.**

**Answer:** The primary cause of division is a departure from the truth of God's
Word. Unity must never be sought at the expense of truth.

- **Internal Dangers:** Paul warned that the greatest danger would not come from
  pagan persecution outside, but from corruption inside. Men would arise seeking
  a personal following ("draw away disciples after _them_") rather than pointing
  men to Christ.
- **Perverse Things:** This refers to distorted doctrines—mixing the gospel with
  philosophy, paganism, or legalism.
- **The Test of Truth:** To remain united, the church must measure every
  teaching by the law and the testimony (Isaiah 8:20). False doctrine divides;
  pure truth gathers.

---

### Q6. What did this division cause among the believers even in Paul's day?

**“For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth
[hindereth] will let, until he be taken out of the way." 2 Thess. 2:7.**

**Answer:** Even in the apostolic age, the seeds of the great apostasy were
germinating. Paul calls this the "mystery of iniquity."

- **Definition—Mystery of Iniquity:** The secret working of lawlessness
  (rebellion against God's law) within the church. It is the counterfeit of the
  "mystery of godliness" (1 Timothy 3:16). While the mystery of godliness is God
  becoming man to save us, the mystery of iniquity is man seeking to become God
  to rule us.
- **The Spirit of Antichrist:** This spirit seeks to replace the humble reliance
  on Christ's righteousness with human authority, traditions, and ceremonies. It
  began early with the intake of pagan philosophies and the desire for
  ecclesiastical power.

---

### Q7. When paganism, that which hindered the full development of this "mystery," was taken out of the way, what followed?

**“And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the
spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming." 2
Thess. 2:8.**

**Answer:** The "hinderer" or restrainer is historically understood by the early
church and Adventist pioneers to be the civil power of Pagan Rome. As long as
the Caesars ruled, the Bishop of Rome could not achieve supreme power.

- **The Transition:** When the capital of the empire moved to Constantinople,
  and the Western Roman Empire fragmented, the "hinderer" was taken out of the
  way. This created a power vacuum that the Papacy filled, inheriting the seat
  of the dragon (Revelation 13:2).
- **The Revelation of "That Wicked":** Once the restraint was gone, the system
  of the Papacy was fully revealed—a system that claimed the prerogatives of
  Christ while obscuring His work in the heavenly sanctuary.
- **Final Destruction:** This system will continue until the Second Coming,
  where it will be destroyed by the "brightness of His coming." This confirms
  the identity of this power as one that spans history from the fall of Rome to
  the end of time (Daniel 7:25).

---

### Q8. By what name is this power elsewhere called?

**“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except
there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of
perdition: who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or
that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing
himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.**

**Answer:** The apostle identifies this power as the "Man of Sin" and the "Son
of Perdition."

- **Man of Sin:** Sin is "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). This power
  is characterized by an attempt to change God's law (Daniel 7:25), specifically
  the Sabbath commandment, thereby setting itself above the Lawgiver.
- **Son of Perdition:** This title is used only for one other person in
  Scripture—Judas Iscariot (John 17:12). This indicates that this power is not
  an open enemy (like an atheist), but a _betrayer_ from within the inner circle
  of the church.
- **Sitting in the Temple:** This signifies a usurpation of Christ's High
  Priestly ministry. By setting up an earthly priesthood, the confessional, and
  the sacrifice of the mass, this power obscures the true "daily" ministry of
  Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary, diverting the eyes of men from the only
  Mediator (1 Timothy 2:5).

**[ILL]** If a vice-president enters the Oval Office, sits in the President's
chair, and begins signing laws and changing the constitution while the President
is still alive, that constitutes treason and usurpation. This is the biblical
picture of the "Man of Sin" claiming to be the Vicar (substitute) of Christ on
earth.

---

### Q9. To what does the apostle liken the church?

**“Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular." 1 Cor. 12:27.**

**Answer:** Paul uses the human body to illustrate the organic unity of the
church.

- **Living Connection:** A body is not a collection of artificial limbs strapped
  together; it is a living organism connected by a nervous system and blood
  supply.
- **Headship:** Christ is the Head (Colossians 1:18). The body must obey the
  signals from the Head. If the hand attacks the foot, it is because it is
  disconnected from the Head's control.
- **Sanctuary Application:** As our High Priest, Christ directs the work of His
  church on earth from the sanctuary in heaven. We must be sensitive to His
  leading.

---

### Q10. And being members of Christ's body, of what else do we become members?

**“So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of
another." Rom. 12:5.**

**Answer:** We belong to each other. We are not independent atoms floating in
space; we are interconnected tissue.

- **Mutual Dependence:** Just as the eye needs the hand, and the hand needs the
  feet, every believer needs the specific gifts and graces of other believers.
- **No Lone Christians:** The idea of a "solitary Christian" who has no need of
  the church body is foreign to Scripture. Separation from the body often leads
  to spiritual coldness and death.

---

### Q11. As members of one another, what is the duty of each?

**“That there should be no schism in the body: but that the members should have
the same care one for another." 1 Cor. 12:25.**

**Answer:** The duty is active, empathetic love.

- **Sympathy:** "And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it"
  (1 Cor 12:26). True Christianity destroys selfishness.
- **Practical Care:** This is not just a feeling, but practical
  assistance—bearing one another's burdens (Galatians 6:2).
- **The Cure for Schism:** Schism (division) comes from pride and self-seeking.
  When we care more for our brother's welfare than our own opinion, schism
  becomes impossible.

**[ILL]** When you accidentally hit your thumb with a hammer, the whole body
reacts. The knees buckle, the lungs gasp, the other hand grabs the injured
thumb, and the eyes tear up. The body doesn't criticize the thumb for being
clumsy; it rushes to comfort and heal it. This is how the church should treat a
struggling member.

---

### Q12. If the church is one, as the body of Christ, what should be its united aim?

**“I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the
vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long
suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavoring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace." Eph. 4:1-3.**

**Answer:** The aim is to preserve the unity that the Spirit creates, through
the exercise of humility and patience.

- **Lowliness and Meekness:** These are the character traits of Jesus (Matthew
  11:29). Pride is the mother of division; humility is the mother of unity.
- **Forbearing One Another:** This means "putting up with" the idiosyncrasies
  and faults of others without retaliation.
- **The Bond of Peace:** Unity is not something we manufacture; it is something
  we "keep." It is a gift of the Spirit. Our job is to not break the bond
  through sin and selfishness.
  - _Righteousness by Faith Connection:_ We cannot manufacture meekness. It is a
    fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23). It is the result of Christ living
    out His life in us.

### Q13. When the Lord is about to come, how will the true ministers of the gospel stand on this point?

**"Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they
sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion." Isa.
52:8.**

**Answer:** This prophecy points to the "gathering time" just before the end,
where God's true watchmen (ministers and teachers) will come into perfect
harmony regarding the truth.

- **Seeing Eye to Eye:** This implies seeing the truth from the same
  perspective—God's perspective.
- **Singing Together:** This represents the harmony of their message. They will
  not be debating minor points or preaching contradictory gospels.
- **Restoration of Zion:** This unity is a sign that the Lord is restoring His
  church to its primitive purity and power in preparation for the final harvest.

---

### Q14. What solemn message, just before the Lord's coming, will bring this unity?

**“And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man
worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his
hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... Here is the
patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the
faith of Jesus." Rev. 14:9-12.**

**Answer:** The **Third Angel's Message** is the final sifting and sealing
message that unifies the remnant people of God.

- **Separation produces Unity:** By calling people _out_ of Babylon (confusion
  and false doctrines), this message gathers a people into the unity of truth.
- **The Pillars of Unity:** This group is identified by two things:
  1.  **Keeping the Commandments of God:** They have been restored to obedience
      to the moral law, including the fourth commandment (the Sabbath), which
      the "Man of Sin" attempted to change.
  2.  **The Faith of Jesus:** This is the secret of their obedience. They do not
      just have faith _in_ Jesus, but they possess the _faith of_ Jesus—a trust
      in the Father so deep that it produces total victory over sin.
- **Justification by Faith in Verity:** This message combines the Law and the
  Gospel perfectly. It shows that we are saved by grace through faith, and that
  this genuine faith works by love to purify the soul and produce obedience
  (Galatians 5:6).

---

### Q15. When the lord comes, what will be the united cry of these faithful ones?

**“And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for
Him, and He will save us: this is the lord; we have waited for Him, we will be
glad and rejoice in His salvation." Isa. 25:9.**

**Answer:** The ultimate result of unity in truth and spirit is the shared joy
of the Second Coming.

- **"Our God":** Not "my" God, but "our" God. They have waited together,
  suffered together, labored together, and now they are glorified together.
- **Waited for Him:** This implies the "patience of the saints" mentioned in
  Revelation 14:12. They endured the delay and the persecution of the "Man of
  Sin."
- **Rejoice in His Salvation:** Their boast is not in their own works or their
  own unity, but in _His_ salvation. They ascribe all glory to the Lamb who
  redeemed them and made them kings and priests unto God.

**[ILL]** Imagine a besieged city waiting for the liberating army. When the
liberator finally breaks through the gates, the cry of joy is not from one
person, but a unified shout from the whole city. So will be the shout of the
redeemed when the King of Kings appears in the clouds of heaven.
