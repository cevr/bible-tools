### Chapter 8: Creation and Redemption

This study explores the profound link between the physical creation of the universe and the spiritual re-creation of the human soul. In the light of the **Three Angels’ Messages** (Revelation 14:6–12), we understand that the God who calls for our worship is the Creator. This truth is vital for understanding **Righteousness by Faith**: the same power that spoke worlds into existence is the only power capable of creating a clean heart in a sinner.

### Q1. What grand truth is revealed in the first verse in the Bible?

**"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Genesis 1:1.**

**Answer:**
The Bible opens with the foundational truth of all religion: God is the Creator. Before there was matter, energy, or time, there was God. This verse establishes His absolute authority over everything that exists.

*   **The Source of All Reality:** The universe did not come into being by chance or accident; it was the purposeful act of an infinite Mind.
*   **Creation _Ex Nihilo_:** God created "out of nothing" (Hebrews 11:3). He did not rearrange existing matter; He spoke, and it came to be.
*   **Implications for the Sinner:** If God is the Creator of the physical heavens and earth, He is the owner of them. This establishes His right to rule and His right to our obedience. Furthermore, if God can call light out of darkness in the physical world (Genesis 1:3), He alone can shine the light of His glory into the darkness of the human heart (2 Corinthians 4:6).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a master artist who paints a beautiful portrait. The canvas, the paint, and the image belong to the artist because he created them. The painting has no life of its own separate from what the artist gave it. In the same way, we belong to God by right of creation. We are His workmanship.

### Q2. What Bible contrast is repeatedly drawn between the true God and false gods?

**"Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. The portion of Jacob is not like them, for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is His name." Jeremiah 10:11-16. (See Jeremiah 14:22; Acts 17:22-29; Revelation 14:6-10.)**

**Answer:**
Throughout Scripture, the distinguishing mark of the true God is His creative power. False gods—whether statues of wood and stone or modern idols of self, money, or power—cannot create life.

*   **The Test of Divinity:** The prophet Jeremiah points out that any "god" who did not make the heavens will perish. Only the Life-Giver has immortality.
*   **The Call of the Final Judgment:** In Revelation 14:7, the first angel calls the world to "worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea." In the last days, the issue of worship centers on recognizing the Creator's authority versus human or satanic authority.
*   **The Portion of Jacob:** The believer’s God is "the former of all things." We do not worship a distant philosophical concept, but the personal Architect of the universe.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you were trapped in a burning building, a statue of a fireman could not save you, no matter how beautifully carved it was. It has no breath and no power. You need a living fireman with the power to act. False gods are like statues; the Creator is the living Rescuer.

### Q3. Through whom did God work in the creation of all things?

**"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made." John 1:1-3.**

**Answer:**
The active agent in Creation was Jesus Christ, "the Word." While the Father is the source, the Son is the One through whom the worlds were framed (Hebrews 1:2).

*   **The Divinity of Christ:** This text confirms that Jesus is fully God, eternal and uncreated. He was "with God" and "was God" from the beginning.
*   **The Power of the Word:** In Genesis, we read, "God said..." In John, we see that this "Word" is a Person. Jesus is the expression of the Father's thought and power.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** This is a comforting truth for the sinner. The One who died on Calvary to save you is the same One who designed the galaxies. If the Creator is your Saviour, there is no sin too strong for Him to conquer.

**Term Definition:**
*   **The Word (Logos):** A title for Jesus Christ, indicating that He is the self-expression of God’s mind and power, both in Creation and in Redemption.

### Q4. Through whom is our redemption provided?

**"But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him." Romans 5:8-9.**

**Answer:**
The Creator is the only One who could be the Redeemer. Redemption is provided through Jesus Christ alone.

*   **God’s Initiative:** Notice that God loved us "while we were yet sinners." He does not wait for us to make ourselves good before He offers salvation.
*   **Justified by His Blood:** To be *justified* means to be declared righteous by God's legal decree. Because Jesus paid the penalty for the broken Law (death), God can legally forgive the sinner who has faith in Jesus (Romans 3:26).
*   **Saved from Wrath:** "Wrath" is the inevitable result of sin—separation from God and eventual death. Christ saves us from this by taking our place.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Justification:** The act of God whereby He declares a repentant sinner to be righteous, not because of the sinner's deeds, but because of Christ's perfect life and sacrificial death credited to their account.
*   **Redemption:** Literally "buying back." The process of freeing a slave by paying a ransom. Christ's blood is the price paid to rescue us from the slavery of sin.

### Q5. What passage of Scripture speaks of the Creator as Redeemer?

**"But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and He that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine." Isaiah 43:1.**

**Answer:**
Here, God claims a double ownership over His people. He says, "I made you, and I bought you back."

*   **Personal Care:** He calls us "by name." The Creator of billions of stars knows the individual trial of every human heart.
*   **The Guarantee of Success:** Because He "formed" us, He knows how we work. He knows the specific weaknesses of our temperament and heredity. As our Redeemer, He knows exactly how to apply His grace to heal those specific flaws.
*   **No Fear:** The command "Fear not" is based on His power. If the One who made you says, "You are mine," no enemy can pluck you out of His hand (John 10:28).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A young boy once carved a toy boat. One day, it drifted away on a river and was lost. Months later, he saw his boat for sale in a store window. He emptied his piggy bank and bought it. As he held it, he said, "You are twice mine. I made you, and now I have bought you." This is what Jesus says to us.

### Q6. Which prayer of David reveals that God's redemptive work of man is a creative work?

**“Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me." Psalm 51:10.**

**Answer:**
David uses the Hebrew word *bara* (create)—the same word used in Genesis 1:1—to describe what needs to happen inside his heart.

*   **More than Repair:** David does not ask God to "improve" his old heart or "patch up" his character. He asks for a *creation*. The carnal mind is "enmity against God" (Romans 8:7) and cannot be fixed; it must be replaced by the mind of Christ.
*   **The New Birth:** This is what Jesus meant when He told Nicodemus, "Ye must be born again" (John 3:3–7). Conversion is a supernatural act of creation where God implants a new principle of life.
*   **Sanctification:** To "renew a right spirit" is the daily work of sanctification—keeping the heart in tune with God through the indwelling Spirit.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing process of being made holy. It is the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer’s life, imparting Christ’s power to overcome sin and live in obedience to God’s law.

### Q7. Where are we told that Christ, the active agent in creation, is also the head of the church?

**"For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him: and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist. And He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the preeminence." Colossians 1:16-18.**

**Answer:**
This majestic passage links the physical universe and the spiritual church under one Head: Jesus Christ.

*   **By Him All Things Consist:** The word "consist" means "to hold together." Scientists look for the force that holds the atom together; the Bible says it is the power of Christ. If He withdrew His power for a moment, the universe would disintegrate.
*   **Head of the Church:** Just as He sustains the physical laws of nature, He sustains the spiritual life of the church. The church is His "body," meaning it is the vehicle through which He works in the world today.
*   **Preeminence:** Christ must be first in everything—in the cosmos and in our individual lives. We cannot have a "little bit" of Jesus; He must be Lord of all.

**[ILL] Illustration:** The brain controls the physical body. If the connection between the head and the hand is severed, the hand becomes paralyzed and lifeless. Similarly, a Christian or a church that is disconnected from Christ (the Head) has no spiritual life or power to do good.

### Q8. What scripture clearly shows that it is God's creative power which transforms the believer?

**"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them." Ephesians 2:10.**

**Answer:**
Salvation is not something we achieve; it is something God works in us. We are His "workmanship" (Greek: *poiema*, from which we get "poem" or "masterpiece").

*   **Created Unto Good Works:** Notice the order. We are not created *by* good works, but *unto* good works. Works are the fruit, not the root, of salvation.
*   **Righteousness by Faith in Action:** This verse destroys legalism. A legalist tries to do good works to create a right standing with God. The gospel says God creates us anew in Christ, and the natural result of that new life is good works (obedience to the Law).
*   **God's Plan:** God has "ordained" (prepared beforehand) a path of obedience for us. When we walk in His commandments, we are fulfilling the design the Creator intended for humanity.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A sculptor takes a rough, jagged stone and chisels it into a beautiful statue. The stone does not shape itself; it yields to the sculptor's hand. We are the stone; God is the Sculptor. Our part is to yield and trust; His part is to shape our character.

### Q9. Who is it that keeps the stars in their places in the heavens?

**"To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth." Isaiah 40:25-26.**

**Answer:**
God challenges us to look at the stars. He directs the movements of the heavenly bodies with absolute precision.

*   **"Not One Faileth":** Because of God's strength, every star keeps its appointed path.
*   **Sovereign Power:** The "host" of heaven refers to the billions of stars. If God can manage the complexity of the cosmos, ensuring that massive suns do not collide but stay in their orbits, He is "strong in power."
*   **Application:** This verse is written to comfort Israel (see verse 27). God is asking, "If I can take care of the universe, don't you think I can take care of you?"

### Q10. What can the same Creator do for you and me?

**"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen." Jude 24-25.**

**Answer:**
This is one of the most encouraging promises in the Bible. The same power that keeps the stars from falling (Isaiah 40:26) is pledged to keep the believer from falling into sin.

*   **Able to Keep:** We often say, "I can't stop sinning." That is true; *we* can't. But He *is able*. The victory is in His ability, not ours.
*   **Faultless:** This connects to the Sanctuary service. The goal of the High Priest's work is to cleanse the people so they may stand before God's glory without fault. This implies a character fully restored to the image of God—loving what God loves and hating sin.
*   **Righteousness Imparted:** This is practical godliness. It is not just forgiveness for the past, but power for the present to live a life that brings "exceeding joy" to God.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A toddler learning to walk on a rocky path will surely fall if left alone. But if a strong father holds the child's hand, the child is safe. The child keeps from falling not by their own strength, but by the strength of the father's grip. Our "grip" is faith; His grip is omnipotence.

---

### Q11. How much of this power is available to help us in our need?

**"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him: the eyes of your understanding being en. lightened; that ye may know what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places." Ephesians 1:17-20.**

**Answer:**
Paul prays that our eyes might be opened to the magnitude of power available to us.

*   **Resurrection Power:** The standard of measurement for the power available to a Christian is the power that raised Jesus from the dead. This was the greatest display of power in history—overcoming death, hell, and the grave.
*   **To Us-ward Who Believe:** This power is directed toward us. It is not locked away in heaven; it is accessible by faith.
*   **Victory over Spiritual Death:** If God can raise a dead body to life, He can raise a soul dead in trespasses and sins (Ephesians 2:1) to a life of righteousness. There is no habit, addiction, or character flaw that can withstand resurrection power.

---

### Q12. Who sustains the universe and keeps it each moment?

**"And He [Christ] is before all things, and in Him all things hold together. " Colossians 1:17, R.V., margin.**

**Answer:**
Christ is the Sustainer. The universe is not a clock that was wound up and left to run on its own. It requires the constant, moment-by-moment exercise of divine power to exist.

*   **Dependence:** This teaches us absolute dependence. Every breath we take is a gift from Christ, even to the wicked.
*   **Spiritual Parallel:** Just as we cannot exist physically for a moment without His sustaining power, we cannot exist spiritually (remain righteous) for a moment without constant communion with Him. "Without Me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5).

### Q13. Of what great truth is the Seventh-day Sabbath a memorial and a sign?

**"But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him." 1 Corinthians 8:6.**

**Answer:**
While 1 Corinthians 8:6 establishes the truth of the One Creator God and Jesus Christ the agent of creation, the Sabbath is the specific memorial that enshrines this truth in time.

*   **Identifying the True God:** As we saw in Jeremiah 10, the true God is the Creator. The Sabbath is the "sign" or "seal" of that authority because it points back to the act of Creation.
*   **We by Him:** We exist "by Him." Keeping the Sabbath is an acknowledgment that we are not self-made gods, but creatures dependent on the Lord Jesus Christ for life and breath. It is a weekly act of surrender to His sovereignty.

---

### Q14. The Sabbath is a memorial of Creation. Is it also a sign of God's power to redeem us?

**"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God... for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day..." Exodus 20:8-11.**

**"It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed." Exodus 31:17.**

**"Moreover also I gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." Ezekiel 20:12.**

**Answer:**
Yes. The Sabbath has a dual significance: it commemorates the first creation (Genesis) and signifies the new creation (Redemption/Sanctification).

*   **Memorial of Creation (Exodus 20):** The commandment begins with "Remember" because it points backward to the finished work of Creation. By resting, we acknowledge God as the Builder of the world.
*   **Sign of Sanctification (Ezekiel 20):** The Sabbath is also a sign that "I am the Lord that sanctify them." Sanctification is the work of recreation in the heart. By resting on the Sabbath, we signify that we cannot save ourselves by our own works. We rest in the finished work of Christ.
*   **Resting in Grace:** Just as God finished Creation and rested, Christ finished Redemption on the cross and rested in the tomb over the Sabbath. The Sabbath is the perfect symbol of **Righteousness by Faith**—ceasing from our own struggles to earn salvation and trusting in God's power to make us holy.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Sign/Seal:** An external mark that indicates internal reality or ownership. The Sabbath is God's mark of authority and the believer's pledge of allegiance to the Creator.

### Q15. Why is God worthy to receive our worship, praise and honor?

**"Thou are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created." Revelation 4:11.**

**Answer:**
In the heavenly throne room, the fundamental reason given for worshiping God is His role as Creator.

*   **The Basis of Worthiness:** We do not worship God merely because He is powerful, but because He is the Source of our being. He created us "for His pleasure"—to live in love and harmony with His character.
*   **The Final Conflict:** The book of Revelation presents a conflict between worshiping the Beast (a false system of authority) and worshiping the Creator (Revelation 14:7). Acknowledging God as Creator—and keeping the Sabbath which honors Him as such—is central to the final test of loyalty.
*   **Gospel Restoration:** Redemption restores us to the purpose for which we were created: to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.

**[ILL] Illustration:** An inventor receives the patent and the credit for his invention. It would be theft to give the credit to another. When we worship, we give "glory and honor" to the One who holds the patent on life itself.

### Summary Note on Creation and the Gospel

The Bible presents Creation and Redemption as two parts of the same work. Redemption is simply "creation restored."

*   **The Danger of Evolution:** As noted in the study outline, the theory of evolution strikes at the heart of the gospel. If man gradually ascended from animals, there was no "fall" of man in Eden. If there was no fall, there is no sin. If there is no sin, there is no need for a Saviour or an Atonement. Evolution inevitably leads to the idea that man can save himself through progress.
*   **The Creative Word:** The gospel teaches that we are helpless in sin, dead in trespasses. We need the same power that said "Let there be light" to say to our hearts, "Thy sins be forgiven thee."
*   **The Witness of the Sabbath:** By keeping the seventh-day Sabbath, we testify against the theory of evolution and witness to the world that we believe in the personal, powerful God who created the world in six literal days and is able to re-create us in His image.
