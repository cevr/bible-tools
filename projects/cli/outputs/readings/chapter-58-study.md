### Q1. According to the words of the angel to Daniel, when might the world look for an increase of knowledge?

**“But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of
the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel
12:4)**

**Answer:**

The angel Gabriel instructed Daniel to seal the prophecies of his book until a
specific period known as the "time of the end." This indicates that the full
understanding of Daniel’s prophecies—particularly the long time lines and the
sanctuary service—would be obscured or suppressed until that appointed time
arrived.

1.  **The Unsealing of the Book:** The "sealing" refers to the comprehension of
    the prophecy. Once the "time of the end" began, men and women would be led
    by the Holy Spirit to study the Scriptures with renewed intensity.
2.  **Running To and Fro:** In the Hebrew idiom, to "run to and fro" (_shut_)
    implies a diligent, intense scrutiny of the Scriptures (Amos 8:12; 2
    Chronicles 16:9). It is not merely tourists traveling the globe, but Bible
    students turning the pages back and forth, comparing scripture with
    scripture (Isaiah 28:10), to understand the truth for their time.
3.  **Twofold Increase:**
    - **Prophetic Knowledge:** Since the end of the 18th century, the book of
      Daniel has been opened to human understanding. The truths regarding the
      sanctuary, the judgment, and the return of Christ have been restored.
    - **General Knowledge:** As the text implies, the lifting of the suppression
      of God's Word often correlates with an awakening of the human mind in
      science and industry, provided by God to facilitate the spreading of the
      Gospel.

_Definitions:_

- **Time of the End:** A specific period in prophecy beginning in 1798,
  following the end of the 1260-year papal supremacy, and leading up to the
  second coming of Christ (Daniel 11:35; 12:9).

**[ILL]** Imagine a captain given a sealed envelope with orders: "Do not open
until you reach the Cape of Good Hope." While the ship is in the Atlantic, the
contents are a mystery. But the moment the ship reaches the coordinate, the seal
is broken, and the instructions become "present truth" vital for the next leg of
the journey. Similarly, God reserved special light for the final generation to
navigate the perils of the last days.

### Q2. Under the Roman power, how long were the saints to be persecuted?

**“And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and
to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time
appointed.” (Daniel 11:35)**

**Answer:**

The prophecy predicts a long, dark period where God's faithful people would
suffer under a persecuting power. This period was appointed to last until the
"time of the end."

1.  **The Purpose of Trial:** The verse explains _why_ God allows His saints to
    suffer: "to try them, and to purge, and to make them white." This is the
    language of the refinery.
    - **Purging:** Removing the dross of sin and worldliness.
    - **Making White:** A symbol of the righteousness of saints (Revelation
      19:8).
2.  **Righteousness by Faith in Suffering:** We cannot purify ourselves. We are
    cleansed by the blood of Jesus (Justification) and refined by His Spirit
    through the discipline of life (Sanctification). God uses trials not to
    destroy us, but to drive us to Christ, so that we may partake of His
    holiness (Hebrews 12:10).
3.  **The Limit of Satan's Wrath:** God set a "time appointed." He limits the
    power of the enemy. He promised that for the elect's sake, those days would
    be shortened (Matthew 24:22), preventing the total extinction of His church.

_Definitions:_

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the believer is
  separated from sin and made holy in character, empowered by the indwelling
  Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:23; 2 Thessalonians 2:13).

**[ILL]** A silversmith holds a piece of silver over the hottest part of the
fire. He does not leave it there to be destroyed, but watches it closely. He
knows the silver is refined only when he can see his own reflection perfectly
mirrored in it. So God allows us to be in the "furnace of affliction" until the
image of Jesus is perfectly reflected in our characters (Malachi 3:3).

### Q3. How long, according to the prophecy, was the little horn, which represents the Roman power, to persecute the saints?

**“And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the
saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws; and they shall be
given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” (Daniel
7:25)**

**Answer:**

This verse gives the specific mathematical calculation for the period of
persecution mentioned in the previous question.

1.  **The Prophetic Calculation:**
    - **Time:** One year (Jewish reckoning of 360 days).
    - **Times:** Two years (720 days).
    - **Dividing of Time:** Half a year (180 days).
    - **Total:** 360 + 720 + 180 = 1,260 prophetic days.
2.  **Day-Year Principle:** In Bible prophecy, a day represents a literal year
    (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). Thus, this power would hold supremacy for
    1,260 years.
3.  **Historical Fulfillment:** The supremacy of the Papacy (the "Little Horn")
    was established in **538 A.D.** when the last Arian opposition (the
    Ostrogoths) was removed. Adding 1,260 years brings us to **1798 A.D.**
4.  **The Deadly Wound:** In 1798, Berthier, a general of Napoleon, entered
    Rome, took the Pope prisoner, and declared the political rule of the Papacy
    at an end. This marked the beginning of the "Time of the End."
5.  **Changing Times and Laws:** This power would attempt to alter God's
    law—specifically the Sabbath (the only commandment dealing with time). True
    righteousness leads a believer to obey God's original law through faith in
    Jesus, rather than following human traditions (Acts 5:29; Matthew 15:9).

_Definitions:_

- **Little Horn:** The politico-religious power described in Daniel 7 that grows
  out of the collapse of the Roman Empire, historically identified by Protestant
  reformers as the Papacy.

**[ILL]** If you have a map that says "Walk 1,260 paces north to find the
treasure," and you stop at 500, you will not find it. God gave a precise map of
history. He marked the exact years (538 to 1798) so that when the time arrived,
His people could identify where they were in the stream of time and have
confidence in the accuracy of His Word.

### Q4. In the line of scientific inventions, have there been any remarkable developments since 1798?

**"More has been done in the course of our lifetime than in all the previous
existence of the race." — _London Spectator_ (19th Century)** **“The great facts
of the nineteenth century stand out so conspicuously above the achievements of
any preceding century...” — _Union Hand-Book, 1870_**

**Answer:**

Yes. Following the year 1798 (the start of the "time of the end"), the world
witnessed an explosion of scientific and technological progress unequaled in
human history.

1.  **Historical Context:** For thousands of years, from the time of Abraham to
    the time of George Washington, methods of travel (horse, wind-powered ship)
    and communication (written letters) remained virtually unchanged.
2.  **The Sudden Change:** Suddenly, in the 19th century, the human mind was
    unlocked. Steam power, electricity, and mechanization revolutionized life.
3.  **God’s Providence:** This was not an accident of evolution, but a divine
    providence. Just as the book of Daniel was unsealed (prophetic knowledge
    increased), God unsealed the secrets of nature (scientific knowledge
    increased).

**[ILL]** Compare a candle to an electric light bulb. For millenniums, men
pushed back the darkness with fire (torches, oil lamps, candles). Then, almost
instantly in the scope of history, we harnessed electricity to banish the night.
This physical light is a parallel to the immense spiritual light God poured out
at the same time to banish the darkness of error.

### Q5. When were some of the principal inventions brought out?

**The steamboat in 1807; steam printing-press in 1811; railroad cars in 1825;
reaper and mower in 1833; telegraph in 1837; sewing-machine in 1846; telephone
in 1876; air travel; radio and other communication marvels. It will be noted
that none of these inventions were before 1798.**

**Answer:**

The timing of these inventions aligns perfectly with the "Time of the End"
prophecy. God provided these tools for a specific spiritual purpose.

1.  **Tools for the Harvest:** The Gospel commission requires the message to go
    "to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" (Revelation 14:6).
    - **Steam Press & Internet:** To produce the Bible and truth-filled
      literature by the millions.
    - **Rail, Air, & Auto:** To transport missionaries swiftly.
    - **Telegraph, Radio, & Digital:** To communicate the warning message
      instantly across oceans.
2.  **A Warning for the Last Generation:** As the note in the lesson states, one
    generation must hear the final warning. Slow travel would make this
    impossible. God accelerated human invention to match the urgency of the
    judgment hour.
3.  **Stewardship of Technology:** For the Christian, technology is not for mere
    entertainment or ease. It is a talent entrusted to us to finish the work of
    God. We use these tools to point men to Christ our Righteousness.

_Definitions:_

- **Providence:** God’s faithful and effective care and guidance over the
  affairs of men and the history of the world to accomplish His purpose (Romans
  8:28).

**[ILL]** The Roman Empire built excellent paved roads to move their armies and
collect taxes. They did it for selfish power. But when Christ came, those same
roads became the highways for the Apostles to spread the Gospel to the known
world. Today, the world builds the internet for commerce and vanity, but God’s
people must use it as the "Roman roads" of the last days to carry the Three
Angels' Messages.

### Q6. What has the Saviour said should precede the end?

**“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a
witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14)**

**Answer:**

Jesus links the increase of knowledge and the "Time of the End" directly to the
completion of the Gospel commission. The end cannot come until the world has
been warned and invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

1.  **The Content of the Message:** It is the "Gospel of the Kingdom." This
    includes:
    - **The Good News:** Christ has paid the penalty for sin (Justification).
    - **The Power:** Christ can restore the law of love in the heart
      (Sanctification).
    - **The Kingdom:** Christ is coming to destroy sin and set up His eternal
      reign.
2.  **A Witness to All:** It does not say all will be converted, but all will
    have a "witness"—an opportunity to choose. The message separates the wheat
    from the tares.
3.  **Preparation for the End:** The preaching of this Gospel coincides with
    Christ's work in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary. He is
    blotting out the sins of those who accept Him. When the message is finished,
    probation closes, and He returns.
4.  **Our Responsibility:** Since we have the _knowledge_ (prophecy unsealed)
    and the _means_ (inventions), we are without excuse if we do not finish the
    work.

_Definitions:_

- **Gospel:** Literally "Good News." The revelation of God's plan to save
  humanity from the penalty and power of sin through the life, death, and
  resurrection of Jesus Christ (Romans 1:16).

**[ILL]** Imagine a city where a deadly dam is about to burst. The authorities
have the knowledge of the danger and the vehicles to reach the people. If they
sit comfortably in their office and do not use the vehicles to warn the
citizens, the blood of the people is on their hands. We possess the knowledge of
Christ's coming and the technology to tell the world. We must go.
