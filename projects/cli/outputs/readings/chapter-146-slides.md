## Slide 1 – Q1: Authority and Work

- **Question:** What has been given to every man?
- **Key Text:** Mark 13:34 – “For the Son of man is as a man taking a far
  journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every
  man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Authority Given:**
  - When Jesus ascended, He did not leave His church powerless.
  - He gave a commission to speak and act in His name (Matthew 28:18–20 – “And
    Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven
    and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations...” [abbreviated for
    length, full text implied]).
- **Individual Responsibility:**
  - "To every man his work" refutes the idea that ministry is only for ordained
    clergy.
  - In God's household, every child has a chore; every citizen has a duty.
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - True faith always works by love (Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ
    neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which
    worketh by love.”).
  - We do not work _to be_ saved, but we work because we _are_ saved (Ephesians
    2:10 – “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
    which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Ship and the Crew:**
  - Imagine a great ship navigating dangerous waters.
  - The captain is on the bridge, but the crew is scattered throughout the
    vessel (engineer, cook, deckhand).
  - If the cook stops feeding the crew because he thinks his work doesn't
    matter, the whole ship suffers.
  - **Lesson:** If "every man" in the church does not do "his work," the mission
    to rescue the perishing is hindered.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Talents and Ability

- **Question:** Besides work, what else has He given to every man?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:15 – “And unto one He gave five talents, to another
  two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
  straightway took his journey.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Definition of "Talents":**
  - In the parable, a talent was money; spiritually, it represents gifts,
    opportunities, intellect, time, and influence entrusted by the Holy Spirit.
- **According to Ability:**
  - God is not unreasonable; He asks for faithfulness in proportion to what we
    have received.
  - Luke 12:48 – “For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much
    required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the
    more.”
- **The Source:**
  - These talents are "given," not self-generated.
  - We are stewards, not owners.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Wise Father:**
  - A wise father asks his small child to carry a light bundle.
  - He asks his strong teenager to carry a heavy crate.
  - He fits the burden to the back.
  - **Lesson:** God knows our frame; He gives gifts suited to our capacity and
    asks us to use them fully for Him.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Identity of the Servants

- **Question:** Who comprise the "every man" here spoken of?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:14 – “For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling
  into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
  goods.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **"His Own Servants":**
  - We are bought with a price and are not our own.
  - 1 Corinthians 6:19–20 – “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of
    the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your
    own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and
    in your spirit, which are God's.”
- **The Universal Call:**
  - Includes young and old, rich and poor.
  - If you have accepted Christ as Savior, you have accepted Him as Master.
- **The Trust:**
  - The "goods" entrusted to us include the gospel, the sanctuary truth, and the
    three angels' messages.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Usage of Talents

- **Question:** Do all who profess to be God's servants make good use of the
  talents given them?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:16-18 – “Then he that had received the five talents
  went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents... But he that
  had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **Trading (Active Faith):**
  - Using the gift involves risk, effort, and interaction.
  - Sharing faith causes faith to grow.
- **Hiding (Passive Profession):**
  - Burying one's influence in worldly affairs.
  - Represents the believer who attends church but makes no effort to win souls.
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - Jesus is ministering in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - We are to be active in the outer court (earth); hiding our talent denies the
    purpose of His ministry.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **Muscle Atrophy:**
  - A muscle that is not exercised becomes weak and atrophies.
  - A language learned but never spoken is soon forgotten.
  - **Lesson:** If the love of Christ is not shared, it eventually dies out in
    the heart of the believer.

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Excuse

- **Question:** What did that one who hid his talent in the earth, render as an
  excuse for so doing?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:25 – “And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent
  in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Paralysis of Fear:**
  - The servant claimed he was "afraid." Fear is the enemy of faith.
- **A Distorted View of God:**
  - He viewed the master as hard and demanding (legalism).
  - He failed to see God as a Father who provides the power to obey.
- **Stagnation:**
  - He thought he could return exactly what was given without growth.
  - In spiritual life, there is no stasis; we are either advancing or sliding
    back.

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Master’s Verdict

- **Question:** What did his master say to that servant because he hid his
  talent?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:26 – “His lord answered and said unto him, Thou
  wicked and slothful servant.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points

- **Wicked and Slothful:**
  - Slothful means spiritually lazy or lethargic.
  - "Wickedness" here is defined by _neglect_—seeing the world perish and doing
    nothing.
- **Sins of Omission:**
  - Judgment deals with duties left undone.
  - James 4:17 – “Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
    him it is sin.”
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - True righteousness is Christ’s life in us.
  - Christ "went about doing good" (Acts 10:38); therefore, a slothful servant
    lacks Christ's righteousness.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Negligent Fireman:**
  - Imagine a fireman standing by a burning house with a hose in hand.
  - He refuses to turn on the water because he is "afraid" or "tired."
  - The inhabitants die because of his inactivity.
  - **Lesson:** The Christian holds the water of life; refusing to share it is
    criminal negligence.

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Minimum Requirement

- **Question:** What did he say the servant ought, at least, to have done with
  the talent?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:27 – “Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to
  the exchangers, and then at my coming I might have received mine own with
  usury.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **"Usury" (Interest):**
  - Refers to increase earned on an investment.
- **The Exchangers (Bankers):**
  - Represents organized instrumentalities in God's work.
  - If one cannot go as a missionary personally, they can invest means
    (money/resources) to support the church's mission.
- **No Excuse:**
  - Everyone can participate: if you cannot go, send; if you cannot speak,
    distribute literature.

## Slide 19 – Q8: Honest Fear or Excuse?

- **Question:** The man in the parable was afraid as well, because he said his
  master was a hard man. But was it real, honest fear that made him act as he
  did?
- **Key Text:** Luke 19:22, 23 – “And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth
  will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere
  man... wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank...?”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

- **Self-Condemnation:**
  - If the servant really believed the master was strict, he should have been
    _more_ diligent, not less.
- **The Real Issue:**
  - It was not fear, but a lack of love for the master and his interests.
  - He wanted the privileges of a servant without the responsibilities.
- **The Judgment:**
  - God judges motives; excuses crumble before Him.
  - Jeremiah 17:10 – “I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give
    every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Fate of the Slothful

- **Question:** What was the fate of the slothful servant?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:30 – “And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer
  darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points

- **Unprofitable:**
  - The servant was a dead branch, bringing no glory to God and no benefit to
    man.
- **Outer Darkness:**
  - Total separation from God, who is Light.
  - Points to the final destruction of the wicked.
- **The Lesson:**
  - We are not saved _by_ our fruit, but a lack of fruit proves the absence of
    saving faith.

## Slide 23 – Q10: Shared Fate

- **Question:** Who else will share the same fate?
- **Key Text:** Luke 13:27 – “But He shall say, I tell you, I know you not
  whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points

- **Workers of Iniquity:**
  - "Iniquity" refers to lawlessness.
  - God categorizes the idle hoarder of talents with the open sinner.
- **"I Know You Not":**
  - Salvation is a relationship.
  - John 17:3 – “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
    true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”
  - If we do not share His burden for souls, we do not truly know Him.

## Slide 25 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Broken Watch:**
  - A watch that does not keep time is useless, even if the case is gold.
  - It has failed the very purpose of its creation.
  - **Lesson:** A Christian who does not shine for Christ has failed the purpose
    of their redemption.

## Slide 26 – Q11: Reward of the Faithful

- **Question:** What was said to the servant who improved the talents given to
  him?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:21 – “His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good
  and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
  thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points

- **"Well Done":**
  - The sweet approval of Jesus is the highest reward possible.
- **Faithful in Few Things:**
  - How we handle our time and means in this life determines our eternal
    destiny.
- **Ruler Over Many:**
  - In the new earth, service continues without weariness.
- **Joy of the Lord:**
  - The joy of seeing others saved in the kingdom.

## Slide 28 – Q12: The Joy of Jesus

- **Question:** What did the joy placed before the Savior enable Him to bear?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 12:2 – “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of
  our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross,
  despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points

- **The Motivation:**
  - The "joy set before Him" was the anticipation of saving lost humanity.
- **Enduring the Cross:**
  - The vision of the redeemed outweighed the pain.
- **Despising the Shame:**
  - He treated the humiliation as nothing compared to the value of a soul.
- **RBF Application:**
  - As we look to the "Author and Finisher," His life infuses us with this same
    motivation to save others.

## Slide 30 – Q13: Full Satisfaction

- **Question:** When will the Lord have this satisfaction and joy?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 53:11 – “He shall see the travail of His soul, and shall
  be satisfied.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points

- **Travail of His Soul:**
  - Refers to the agony of Gethsemane and Calvary.
- **Satisfied:**
  - When Christ sees the redeemed multitude, He will feel the sacrifice was
    worth it.
  - Revelation 7:9 – “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no
    man could number... stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
    with white robes, and palms in their hands.”

## Slide 32 – Q14: Divine Celebration

- **Question:** How will Christ demonstrate the joy He feels at that time?
- **Key Text:** Zephaniah 3:17 – “The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is
  mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with joy: He will rest in His
  love, He will joy over thee with singing.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points

- **God Rejoices:**
  - God is not emotionless; He delights in the restoration of His children.
- **Joy with Singing:**
  - Like a parent singing to a child, the Creator expresses His love through
    song.
  - This is the ultimate celebration of the atonement between God and man.

## Slide 35 – Q15: Paul’s Expectation

- **Question:** What did Paul expect would be his joy at that time?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 2:19, 20 – “For what is our hope, or joy, or
  crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ
  at His coming? For ye are our glory and joy.”

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points

- **The Only Treasure:**
  - We cannot take possessions to heaven; we can only take people.
- **Crown of Rejoicing:**
  - Paul's "trophy" is seeing those he labored for standing saved in Jesus'
    presence.
- **Application:**
  - To have joy in heaven, we must invest in people on earth.

## Slide 37 – Q15: Illustration

- **Sand vs. Diamonds:**
  - A man who spends his life gathering sand has nothing at the end.
  - A man who spends his life gathering diamonds is rich.
  - **Lesson:** Souls are the diamonds of heaven.

## Slide 38 – Q16: Partaking in Joy

- **Question:** Since this joy comes to Christ only through His self-denial and
  sufferings for others, in what way must all others partake of that joy?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 2:11, 12 – “It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead
  with Him, we shall also live with Him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with
  Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us.”

## Slide 39 – Q16: Key Points

- **Dead with Him:**
  - We must die to the old self to live for Christ.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me...”
- **Fellowship of Suffering:**
  - Sharing the burden for souls and denying self.
  - Philippians 3:10 – “That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection,
    and the fellowship of his sufferings...”
- **Reigning:**
  - There is no shortcut to the joy of the Lord that bypasses the work of the
    Lord.

## Slide 40 – Q17: The True Motive

- **Question:** What motive should prompt everyone to engage in the work of
  saving souls?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:14 – “For the love of Christ constraineth us:
  because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead.”

## Slide 41 – Q17: Key Points

- **Constrained by Love:**
  - It is not _our_ love for Him, but _His_ love flowing through us that compels
    us.
- **The Logic of the Gospel:**
  - "If one died for all, then were all dead."
  - Humanity is in a desperate condition; since He died for them, they are of
    infinite value.
- **Not Guilt:**
  - We witness because we "get to" participate in His love, not because we "have
    to."

## Slide 42 – Q18: Ambassadors

- **Question:** Whom does every faithful worker represent?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:20 – “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as
  though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
  reconciled to God.”

## Slide 43 – Q18: Key Points

- **Ambassadors:**
  - Official representatives who speak the words of their King, not their own.
- **"In Christ's Stead":**
  - We are His voice and hands to plead with men and women.
- **Sanctuary Context:**
  - Just as the priest represented the sinner before God, we now represent God
    to the sinner, inviting them to the High Priest.

## Slide 44 – Q19: Result of Excuses

- **Question:** If one excuses himself from the work, what will be the result?
- **Key Text:** John 15:2 – “Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh
  away; and every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring
  forth more fruit.”

## Slide 45 – Q19: Key Points

- **Vitality through Service:**
  - Spiritual life depends on the flow of the Spirit; we receive to give.
  - If we stop giving, the flow stops.
- **Purging (Pruning):**
  - Fruitful workers face trials to become more effective.
  - Fruitless branches are removed entirely.

## Slide 46 – Q19: Illustration

- **Inlet and Outlet:**
  - A stream with an inlet but no outlet becomes a stagnant swamp (like the Dead
    Sea).
  - A stream that receives and gives remains fresh and full of life (like the
    Sea of Galilee).

## Slide 47 – Q20: No Neutrality

- **Question:** What position does one really occupy who does not labor for
  Christ?
- **Key Text:** Luke 11:23 – “He that is not with Me is against Me: and he that
  gathereth not with Me scattereth.”

## Slide 48 – Q20: Key Points

- **Gathering vs. Scattering:**
  - Christ gathers; Satan scatters.
  - If we are not helping Christ gather, our influence helps Satan scatter.
- **The Myth of Neutrality:**
  - Doing nothing _is_ doing harm to the cause of God.
- **The Call:**
  - Through the power of the indwelling Christ, take up your appointed work and
    enter into the joy of the Lord.
