### Q1. Before the day of the lord, who was to be sent to the world?

**“Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord." Mal. 4:5.**

**Answer:**
The prophet Malachi closes the canon of the Old Testament with a solemn promise and a warning. Before the "great and dreadful day of the Lord"—which refers to the final judgment and the Second Coming of Christ—God promises to send a special message and messenger in the spirit of Elijah.

*   **The Nature of the Warning:** Just as Elijah was sent to Israel at a time of deep apostasy to call them back to the true God (1 Kings 18:37), God will send a final warning to the world before probation closes.
*   **The Purpose:** The goal is not merely to frighten, but to prepare a people to stand in the presence of a holy God.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** In the typical service, the Day of Atonement was a day of judgment. The work of "Elijah" corresponds to the work of the high priest in the Most Holy Place—calling the people to afflict their souls and put away sin (Leviticus 16:29–30).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a bridge has washed out on a dark, winding highway. A conscientious highway patrolman does not hide in the bushes to catch drivers speeding toward the edge; he stands visibly on the road with flares and lights, warning them to stop before it is too late. The "Elijah message" is God’s flare in the darkness, warning the world that the bridge of human history is ending, and we must turn to Christ for safety.

### Q2. In whom was this prophecy partially fulfilled?

**“For all the Prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come." Matt. 11:13, 14.**

**Answer:**
Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the fulfillment of Malachi's prophecy for that generation.

*   **Partial Fulfillment:** While John fulfilled the prophecy by preparing the way for Christ's *first* advent, the prophecy of Malachi speaks of the "great and dreadful day of the Lord" (the *second* advent). Thus, John was a type (a foreshadowing), but there is a greater antitype (fulfillment) in the last days.
*   **The Work of John:** John called for repentance and baptism for the remission of sins (Mark 1:4). He pointed people away from themselves to the "Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** John’s message was that hereditary religion (being children of Abraham) could not save. One needed a personal, transformed character through faith in the coming Messiah (Matthew 3:8–9).

**Term Definition:**
**Type and Antitype:** A "type" is a biblical symbol or historical figure that foreshadows a future reality. The "antitype" is the reality itself. John the Baptist (type) foreshadows the final remnant people (antitype) who herald the Second Coming.

### Q3. What objection was raised by the scribes to Christ's mission?

**“And His disciples asked Him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?" Matt. 17:10.**

**Answer:**
The religious leaders of Christ’s day knew the letter of the prophecy but missed its spirit. They were expecting the literal prophet Elijah to descend from heaven in a chariot of fire to overthrow Rome and set up a glorious earthly kingdom. Because this spectacular event did not happen, they rejected Jesus as the Messiah.

*   **The Danger of Misinterpretation:** By clinging to a false interpretation of prophecy, they closed their minds to the present truth.
*   **Blindness to the Spirit:** They looked for outward glory, but God sent a humble man in the wilderness (John) preaching inward purity.

### Q4. What answer was made to this?

**“And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. Then the disciples understood that He spake unto them of John the Baptist." Matt. 17:11-13.**

**Answer:**
Jesus clarifies that the prophecy has a dual application:
1.  **"Elias is come already":** This referred to John the Baptist, whom the leaders rejected and killed.
2.  **"Elias truly *shall* first come":** Jesus speaks in the future tense here ("shall come"), indicating a future restoration work before the end of time.

*   **"Restore All Things":** The work of the final Elijah message is one of *restoration*.
    *   **Restoring the Law:** Pointing the world back to the forgotten commandments of God, specifically the Sabbath (Isaiah 58:12–14).
    *   **Restoring the Gospel:** Presenting the truth of Christ as our Righteousness—not a system of works, but the power of God to transform the life (Romans 1:16–17).
    *   **Restoring the Image of God:** Through the work of sanctification, the character of Christ is to be perfectly reproduced in His people (Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 69).

**Term Definition:**
**Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit imparts the life of Christ to the believer, progressively setting them free from the power of sin and conforming them to the character of God (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

---

### Q5. What was John's Testimony of himself?

**” And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that Prophet? And he answered, No." John 1:21.**

**Answer:**
When the Jewish leaders asked John if he was Elijah, he said "I am not."

*   **No Contradiction:** Jesus said John *was* Elijah (in function/spirit); John said he *was not* Elijah (in person). The Jews were asking if he was the literal Tishbite resurrected. John honestly answered no.
*   **Humility:** True servants of God do not draw attention to their own greatness or titles. John was content to be merely "a voice" (John 1:23), so that the Word (Jesus) could be magnified.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A magnifying glass does not exist to be looked *at*; it exists to be looked *through*. If the glass is dirty or calls attention to itself, it obscures the object. John the Baptist was a clean lens, focusing all attention on the Lamb of God.

### Q6. How is this apparent discrepancy explained?

**“And he shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord." Luke 1:17.**

**Answer:**
The angel Gabriel explains that John would possess the "spirit and power" of Elijah. This resolves the difficulty. It is not a reincarnation of the man, but a replication of the mission and character.

*   **The Spirit of Elijah:** A spirit of boldness, reform, and uncompromising loyalty to God's law in the face of universal apostasy.
*   **Turning Hearts:** The message produces deep relational healing:
    *   **Family Reformation:** Restoring order and love in the home ("fathers to the children").
    *   **Spiritual Reformation:** Turning the "disobedient to the wisdom of the just."
*   **Preparation:** The ultimate goal is to "make ready a people prepared for the Lord." This implies a work of purification—a people who have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 7:14) and have ceased from sin.

---

### Q7. When was this spirit and power to be manifested?

**“Before 'the great and dreadful' day of the Lord." Mal. 4:5.**

**Answer:**
The prophecy points to the very end of time. The "great and dreadful day" is the time of the seven last plagues and the glorious appearing of Christ (Revelation 6:14–17).

*   **Application:** Therefore, we must look for a movement *today*—before Jesus returns—that carries this spirit of reform. It is a message that calls men and women back to the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12).
*   **Urgency:** Just as Elijah appeared when Baal worship was the national religion, the final message appears when the world has wandered after the "beast" and false worship.

---

### Q8. What else was to take place before that "terrible" day?

**“The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come." Joel 2:31.**

**Answer:**
God provides signs in the natural world to herald the approach of the final judgment.

*   **Historical Fulfillment:** Seventh-day Adventists and other historicist interpreters identify the "Dark Day" of May 19, 1780, as a specific fulfillment of this prophecy. The sun was darkened supernaturally across New England, and the moon appeared as blood the following night.
*   **The Sequence:** These signs (along with the falling of the stars in 1833) mark the beginning of the "time of the end," leading up to the terrible day of the Lord. They serve as markers on God’s prophetic clock.

---

### Q9. Was that day still future in Peter's time?

**“But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise." 2 Peter 3:10.**

**Answer:**
Yes. The apostles looked forward to this day as a future event. Peter describes it as the time when the very elements will melt with fervent heat.

*   **"As a Thief":** For the world that is asleep in sin, the day comes unexpectedly (1 Thessalonians 5:2–4). But for the children of light, who are watching and prepared by the Elijah message, it will not overtake them as a thief.
*   **The End of Sin:** The heavens passing away signifies the complete cleansing of the universe from the stain of rebellion.

---

### Q10. What did the spirit of Elijah lead him to do?

**“And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then follow him." 1 Kings 18:21.**

**Answer:**
The spirit of Elijah forces a decision. It does not allow for neutrality or compromise.

*   **Halt Between Two Opinions:** The literal Hebrew suggests "hopping back and forth between two branches." The people wanted to worship Jehovah *and* Baal.
*   **Total Surrender:** God requires the whole heart. We cannot serve God and mammon (Matthew 6:24).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** True faith is not just an intellectual assent; it is a transaction where we give up our own way (Baal/Self) entirely and receive Christ's way (The Lord). It is a call to choose whom we will serve (Joshua 24:15).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A man cannot walk in two opposite directions at the same time. If he tries to keep one foot in a boat drifting downstream and one foot on the dock, he will eventually fall into the water. The Elijah message calls us to step fully onto the solid rock of Christ.

---

### Q11. After boldly declaring the truth, what was Elijah compelled to do?

**“Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba." 1 Kings 19:2, 3.**

**Answer:**
Despite his mighty victory on Mount Carmel, Elijah faced immediate, life-threatening persecution from Queen Jezebel, the proponent of Baal worship.

*   **The Pattern:** This foreshadows the experience of God’s people in the last days. After the proclamation of the final warning, the "dragon" (Satan) works through earthly powers to threaten those who keep God's commandments (Revelation 12:17).
*   **Human Weakness:** Even great prophets are subject to human frailty. Elijah fled in fear, showing that his power came from God, not himself.

---

### Q12. What charge was brought against Elijah?

**“And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?" 1 Kings 18: 17.**

**Answer:**
King Ahab accused Elijah of being the cause of the nation's calamities (the three-and-a-half-year drought).

*   **Misplaced Blame:** In reality, it was Ahab's sin and idolatry that had "troubled Israel" by cutting them off from God's blessing (1 Kings 18:18).
*   **Modern Parallel:** In the last days, those who conscientiously keep the commandments of God (especially the Sabbath) will be accused of bringing judgments upon the world and causing social division. The faithful will be branded as "troublers" and enemies of the state.

---

### Q13. How did Elijah feel?

**“And said, It is enough; now, a Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers." 1 Kings 19:4.**

**Answer:**
Elijah experienced deep discouragement and depression. He felt his work had been a failure and that he was alone in his faithfulness.

*   **God’s Response:** Notice that God did not rebuke Elijah for his feelings. Instead, God gave him rest, food, and a fresh revelation of His presence (1 Kings 19:5–12).
*   **Lesson for Us:** When we feel overwhelmed in the Christian walk, we must remember that our standing before God is based on His mercy, not our emotional state. "The Lord knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust" (Psalm 103:14).

---

### Q14. What did the Lord do for Elijah?

**“Behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." 2 Kings 2:11.**

**Answer:**
God honored his faithful servant by translating him—taking him to heaven without seeing death.

*   **Type of the 144,000:** Elijah represents the saints who will be alive when Jesus returns. They will be "changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye" (1 Corinthians 15:51–52) and translated to heaven without dying.
*   **Victory:** This proves that God has a remedy for death and that His grace is sufficient to bring a person through the severest trials to glory.

**Term Definition:**
**Translation:** In this context, being taken physically to heaven alive, bypassing the grave. (Enoch and Elijah are the two biblical examples).

---

### Q15. What will the last message before the Lord comes demand of the faithful?

**“And the third angel followed them, saying in a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Rev. 14:9-12.**

**Answer:**
The Third Angel's Message is the "Elijah message" for the last days. It demands:
1.  **Refusal to Compromise:** A refusal to worship the "beast" (a false religious-political system) or receive its mark of authority.
2.  **Obedience:** Keeping the "commandments of God"—all ten, including the fourth commandment regarding the Sabbath, which is the seal of God's authority.
3.  **Faith of Jesus:** Not just faith *in* Jesus, but possessing the *faith of* Jesus—a living, victorious trust that allows Christ to live His life of obedience within us (Galatians 2:20).

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** This message prepares the world for the close of probation in the heavenly sanctuary.

---

### Q16. How will the remnant church be generally regarded for thus keeping God's commandments?

**“And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.**

**Answer:**
The "remnant" (the last remaining part of the faithful church) will be the object of Satan's ("the dragon's") intense wrath.

*   **Why the War?** Because they stand as the only obstacle to Satan's claim of total dominion over the earth. Their obedience proves that God's law can be kept through the power of Christ.
*   **Characteristics:** They are identified by two marks:
    1.  **Keeping the Commandments:** A return to the full moral law.
    2.  **The Testimony of Jesus:** Which Revelation 19:10 defines as "the spirit of prophecy."

**Term Definition:**
**Remnant:** A small remaining quantity of something. Biblically, the final generation of believers who maintain the original apostolic faith and purity of doctrine.

---

### Q17. How far may we expect this persecution to be carried against those who will not yield to the power of the beast?

**” And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed." Rev. 13:15.**

**Answer:**
Just as Jezebel issued a death decree against Elijah, the final earthly powers will issue a decree that those who refuse false worship (and the mark of the beast) must be killed.

*   **Economic Sanctions:** Before the death decree, there is a restriction on buying and selling (Revelation 13:17).
*   **The Test:** This brings every soul to the decision: "Fear God" or "Fear Man"? It strips away all superficial religion. Only those who are grounded in Christ's righteousness will stand.

---

### Q18. If faithful, what will be done for these persecuted ones?

**“And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God." Rev. 15:2.**

**Answer:**
God grants them final deliverance and victory. They are seen standing on the "sea of glass" before God's throne.

*   **Victory over the Beast:** They did not yield. Their victory was not by their own strength, but "by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony" (Revelation 12:11).
*   **Harps of God:** They sing the song of Moses and the Lamb—a song of experience that no one else can sing, celebrating their deliverance from the power of sin and the threats of the enemy.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Fire purifies gold. The sea of glass is "mingled with fire." The trials of the last days are the refining fire that burns away the dross of selfishness, leaving a character that reflects the image of Jesus perfectly.

---

### Q19. How will the Lord gather His faithful ones in the last great struggle?

**“And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24:31.**

**Answer:**
The drama concludes with the glorious return of Christ. The angels are sent to gather the "elect"—those who have accepted the Elijah message, allowed Christ to cleanse their hearts, and stood faithful to the law of God.

*   **The Gathering:** This is the harvest of the earth.
*   **Assurance:** No matter how scattered, persecuted, or hidden the faithful may be, not one will be forgotten. The Lord knows them that are His (2 Timothy 2:19).
