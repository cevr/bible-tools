### Q1. What is to endure throughout all generations?

"Thy name, O Lord, endureth forever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all
generations." Psalm 135:13.

**Answer:** The Psalmist declares that two things are permanent and
unchangeable: God’s **name** and God’s **memorial**.

1.  **God’s Name (His Character):** In Scripture, a name often signifies
    character. When God proclaimed His name to Moses, He described His
    character: "The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering,
    and abundant in goodness and truth" (Exodus 34:5–7). This character of love
    and justice is the foundation of His government.
2.  **God’s Memorial:** A memorial is a reminder of who God is and what He has
    done. Because God is the Creator and Sustainer of all life, He has
    established a specific institution to ensure that His people never forget
    their source of life.
3.  **Endurance:** Trends, human empires, and earthly laws change, but God’s
    character and His established memorial endure "throughout all generations."
    They are not temporary ceremonies for a specific era, but eternal realities.

- **Memorial:** A monument, practice, or object established to preserve the
  memory of a person or event, preventing it from being forgotten.

**[ILL]** Imagine a great king who conquers a land and sets up a monument in the
capital square. As long as that monument stands, the people are reminded of who
their king is and by what authority he rules. If the monument is destroyed, the
memory of the king fades, and rebellion becomes easy. God has set up a memorial
in time so that the human race might never forget their true King.

### Q2. Does the Bible give any illustration of this definition?

“And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel forever."
Joshua 4:7.

**Answer:** Yes, the Bible uses physical objects to illustrate the spiritual
concept of a memorial. In this context, Joshua set up stones after the
miraculous crossing of the Jordan River.

- **The Function of the Memorial:** Humans are prone to forgetfulness. The
  visible stones served as a tangible "sign" or "witness" to a historical fact.
- **The Danger of Forgetting:** Throughout the Bible, forgetting God’s past
  leading is the first step toward apostasy. "Lest thou forget the Lord, which
  brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt" (Deuteronomy 6:12).
- **God’s Design:** God establishes memorials not for His benefit—He cannot
  forget—but for ours. He knows that without a reminder, we will lose sight of
  His power and claim upon our lives.

**[ILL]** A wedding ring is a memorial of a marriage covenant. The ring itself
is not the marriage, but it is a constant, visible reminder of the vows taken
and the relationship established. If a spouse consistently refuses to wear the
ring, it suggests a disregard for the relationship it signifies. God’s memorials
are like that ring—a sign of the covenant between Him and His people.

### Q3. What were these stones to commemorate?

“And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask
their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? then ye shall let
your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land." Joshua
4:21, 22.

**Answer:** These stones were to commemorate a specific act of **supernatural
power** and **deliverance**:

1.  **Dominion over Nature:** The stones testified that the God of Israel had
    power over the elements (stopping the river flow).
2.  **Fulfillment of Promise:** They testified that God was faithful to bring
    them into the Promised Land.
3.  **Education:** The memorial was an educational tool for future generations.
    It prompted the question, "What mean these stones?" allowing the truth of
    God to be passed down from father to son.

This establishes a principle: A biblical memorial points back to a specific
mighty act of God that establishes His authority and His love.

### Q4. What was another memorial instituted to commemorate another signal providence in behalf of the Israelites?

“And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to
the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance
forever." Exodus 12:14 (Exodus 13:3-9).

**Answer:** The Passover was instituted as a memorial of the deliverance from
Egyptian bondage.

- **The Shadow:** The Passover lamb was a type (shadow) of Christ. The blood on
  the doorpost saved the firstborn from death.
- **The Reality:** This memorial pointed forward to "Christ our passover" who is
  sacrificed for us (1 Corinthians 5:7). It commemorated redemption from the
  slavery of sin.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** This corresponds to the **Outer Court** of the
  sanctuary, where the sacrifice took place. It represents
  **Justification**—being saved from the penalty of sin by the blood of the
  Lamb.
- **Transient vs. Permanent:** While the Passover was a "shadow" that met its
  fulfillment at the cross (Colossians 2:14–17), the event it commemorated
  (redemption) is eternal. The Lord’s Supper now serves as the new covenant
  memorial of Christ's death until He comes (1 Corinthians 11:26).

- **Signal Providence:** A distinct, clearly recognizable act of God's
  intervention in human affairs.

**[ILL]** Independence Day is a national memorial. It does not make a nation
free; it commemorates the day freedom was declared. The Passover was Israel's
"Independence Day" from Egypt. God wants His people to celebrate their freedom,
but He also wants them to remember the _Creator_ of that freedom.

### Q5. Does God design that His power in creating the world shall be remembered, as well?

“The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure
therein. His work is honorable and glorious; and His righteousness endureth
forever. He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered." Psalm 111:2-4.

**Answer:** Yes, absolutely. While redemption is glorious, it is God's power as
**Creator** that gives Him the right to be our Redeemer and King.

1.  **The Foundation of Worship:** We worship God because He created us. "It is
    He that hath made us, and not we ourselves" (Psalm 100:3). If He did not
    create us, He would have no inherent authority over us.
2.  **Works to be Remembered:** The text says He has "made His wonderful works
    to be remembered." He has not left the memory of creation to chance or oral
    tradition alone; He designed a specific way to keep it in mind.
3.  **Righteousness and Creation:** The text links His works with His
    righteousness ("His righteousness endureth forever"). The God who creates
    the physical world is the same God who creates a clean heart in the believer
    (Psalm 51:10).

**[ILL]** An artist signs their painting to claim credit for the work. The
signature identifies the creator. God has placed a "signature" on the fabric of
time to identify Himself as the Maker of heaven and earth.

### Q6. What memorial has He given by which to remember it?

“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do
all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;... for in
six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day; wherefore [for this reason] the Lord blessed the Sabbath
day, and hallowed it." Exodus 20:8-11.

**Answer:** The Sabbath is God’s great memorial of Creation.

- **The Command:** It begins with "Remember," implying this is something humans
  are prone to forget, yet it existed before the giving of the law at Sinai.
- **The Reason:** The text is explicit: "For in six days the Lord made..." The
  Sabbath is not an arbitrary rule; it is a memorial of a fact. As long as the
  fact remains true (that God created the world in six days), the memorial
  remains valid.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** This command sits in the very heart of the Ten
  Commandments, which were placed inside the Ark of the Covenant in the **Most
  Holy Place** (Hebrews 9:4). This indicates the immutability and holiness of
  the law.
- **The Blessing:** God blessed the _day_, not just the people. He placed a
  spiritual presence in the seventh day that is not found in the other six.

- **Hallowed:** To set apart for holy use. God separated the seventh day from
  the common working days.

### Q7. For what reason does He say again that He gave the Sabbath to the children of Israel?

“Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that
they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." Ezekiel 20:12.

**Answer:** Here, the Sabbath takes on a deeper, redemptive meaning known as
**Righteousness by Faith**.

1.  **The Sign of Sanctification:** The Sabbath is a sign that "I am the Lord
    that sanctify them."
    - **Sanctification:** The process of being made holy and restored to God’s
      image (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
2.  **Faith, Not Works:**
    - Just as we did not create ourselves (Creation), we cannot re-create our
      hearts or make ourselves holy (Redemption).
    - By resting on the Sabbath, we acknowledge that we cannot work our way to
      heaven. We stop our own works to trust in God’s finished work.
    - "For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own
      works, as God did from his" (Hebrews 4:10).
3.  **Double Memorial:** The Sabbath is thus a memorial of **Creation** (God's
    power to make the world) and **Redemption** (God's power to make men holy).

**[ILL]** If a man tries to lift himself by his own bootstraps, he fails. He
needs a power from outside himself to lift him. The Sabbath rest teaches us
weekly that we cannot save ourselves by our own labor; we must rest in the power
of the Creator to change our hearts.

### Q8. How long was the Sabbath to be a sign, or memorial, of the true God?

” It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days
the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was
refreshed." Exodus 31:17.

**Answer:** The Sabbath is a sign **forever**.

- **The Basis is Unchanging:** The reason given in Exodus 31:17 is the Creation
  story. Because the fact of Creation never changes, the sign of Creation never
  expires.
- **Perpetual Covenant:** Verse 16 calls it a "perpetual covenant." God’s moral
  law is a transcript of His character, which does not change (Malachi 3:6).
- **Universal Scope:** While given to Israel, the Sabbath was made for "man"
  (Mark 2:27) at Creation, long before the Jewish nation existed.

---

### Q9. Who are the children of Israel?

"Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children:... but
the children of the promise are counted for the seed." Romans 9:7, 8.

**Answer:** According to the New Testament, the term "Israel" is not limited to
physical bloodlines but encompasses all who have the faith of Abraham.

- **Spiritual Israel:** Paul argues that being a "child of God" is a matter of
  the heart, not just genetics.
- **The Implication:** If the Sabbath is a sign between God and Israel forever,
  and if believers in Christ are the true "children of the promise," then the
  Sabbath is the sign between God and the Christian believer.

- **Children of the Promise:** Those who are born again by the Spirit of God,
  trusting in His promises rather than their own fleshly heritage.

---

### Q10. What did the promises to Abraham embrace?

“Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds,
as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ." Galatians 3:16.

**Answer:** The central promise to Abraham was **Christ**.

- The covenant was not merely about land in the Middle East; it was about the
  coming Messiah who would bless "all families of the earth" (Genesis 12:3).
- Therefore, the "Old Testament" promises are actually Christian promises. They
  center on Jesus.

---

### Q11. When we receive Christ, what relation do we sustain to Abraham and the promises?

“And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
promise." Galatians 3:29.

**Answer:** This is the key to understanding the continuity of God's law:

1.  **Union with Christ:** When we accept Jesus, we become part of His body.
2.  **Heirs of Abraham:** Since Christ is "the Seed," being in Christ makes us
    "Abraham's seed."
3.  **Inheritors of the Sign:** All the covenant blessings—and the covenant
    signs, including the Sabbath—belong to the believer in Jesus. The Sabbath is
    not "Jewish"; it is "Abrahamic" and "Christian."

**[ILL]** If you are adopted into a family, you take the family name and inherit
the family estate. You are subject to the family rules and enjoy the family
privileges. By faith in Christ, we are adopted into the family of God (Israel),
and the family "Memorial" (the Sabbath) becomes ours to keep.

### Q12. What does James denominate the Christian church?

“James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes
which are scattered abroad, greeting." James 1:1.

**Answer:** James writes to the Christian church (believers in the Lord Jesus
Christ) and addresses them as "the twelve tribes."

- **Continuity:** The early apostles did not see the Church as a separate entity
  that replaced God's plan, but as the flowering and continuation of true
  Israel.
- **One People:** God has only ever had one people: those who trust in the blood
  of the Lamb and obey His voice. Whether in the Old Testament or the New, they
  are the spiritual "twelve tribes."

---

### Q13. When redeemed, will the saints remember God's creative power?

“Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast
created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created." Rev. 4:11.

**Answer:** Yes. In the heavenly throne room, the song of the redeemed focuses
on **Creation**.

- **The Basis of Glory:** God is worthy to receive glory specifically _because_
  He created all things.
- **Enduring Theme:** If Creation is the theme of worship in heaven, the
  Memorial of Creation (the Sabbath) is relevant to heaven. We never "outgrow"
  our status as creatures; we will always owe our existence to Him.

---

### Q14. How often will they congregate to worship the Lord?

“And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one
Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord."
Isaiah 66:23.

**Answer:** In the New Earth, the weekly cycle continues, and the Sabbath is the
designated time for corporate worship.

1.  **Universal Worship:** "All flesh" will come. This confirms the Sabbath was
    never intended for Jews only, but for all humanity.
2.  **Restoration:** The plan of salvation ends with restoration. God restores
    Eden (Revelation 22). Since the Sabbath was part of Eden before sin (Genesis
    2:1–3), it is part of the New Earth after sin is destroyed.
3.  **Eternal Rhythm:** The cycle of labor and rest, and the special communion
    with God on the seventh day, continues throughout eternity.

---

### Q15. How long will this state of things exist?

“For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain
before Me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain." Isaiah
66:22.

**Answer:** It will exist forever.

- **The Parallel:** Just as the New Earth remains, so the worshippers ("your
  seed") remain.
- **The Conclusion:** The Sabbath, as the memorial of the Creator, endures as
  long as the creation itself endures.
- **Final Thought:** If we are preparing to live in the New Earth where the
  Sabbath is kept, the spirit of the Sabbath must be in our hearts now. It is
  the day of joy, of laying aside worldly burdens, and finding rest in Christ.

**[ILL]** If a musician is preparing to play in a great royal orchestra, they
practice the music _before_ the concert begins. They do not wait until the
performance to learn the tune. Sabbath-keeping on earth is our practice for the
eternal worship in the New Earth. It attunes our hearts to the rhythm of heaven.
