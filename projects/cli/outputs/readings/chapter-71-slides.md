## Slide 1 – Q1: The Law at Sinai

- **Question:** How does Nehemiah describe the giving of the law at Sinai?
- **Key Text:** Nehemiah 9:13, 14 – “Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: and madest known unto them Thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **Divine Origin:**
  - The law is not a human invention; God “came down” and “spake... from heaven.”
  - It is a transcript of His own character and will.
- **Moral Quality:**
  - Nehemiah calls the laws “right,” “true,” and “good.”
  - Because God is love (1 John 4:8), His law is the law of love.
  - Paul confirms this: Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”
- **Restoration of the Sabbath:**
  - God “madest known” the Sabbath, implying it existed before but was obscured by slavery in Egypt.
  - Sinai restored this institution to its rightful place.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Map and the Flashlight:**
  - Imagine a traveler lost in a dense forest at night.
  - A rescue pilot drops a map and a flashlight.
  - The traveler does not complain that the map restricts his freedom to walk into a swamp.
  - He rejoices because the map is “good” and “true”—it shows the safe way home.
- **Application:**
  - God’s law is that map, given to guide us safely through a sinful world.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Hebrews’ Advantage

- **Question:** What was the primary advantage possessed by the Hebrews?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:1, 2 – “What advantage then hath the Jew?... chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Depository of Truth:**
  - The Hebrews were chosen to be the “depository” of God’s truth for the world.
  - **Oracles:** These are the direct utterances or revelations of Jehovah.
- **Clear Knowledge:**
  - While other nations groped in pagan darkness, Israel had the written law and prophecies.
  - This gave them a clear knowledge of God’s will.
- **Stewardship for the World:**
  - This privilege was not for their salvation alone.
  - They were to be lights to the world: Isaiah 49:6 – “...I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.”
- **Application:**
  - Today, the church possesses the completed Scriptures and the full light of the gospel.

## Slide 6 – Q3: Judgment Before Sinai

- **Question:** Before the law was given at Sinai, how did Moses render judgment to the people?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 18:16 – “When they have a matter, they come unto me and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and His laws.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points

- **Pre-Sinai Knowledge:**
  - This event in Exodus 18 occurred *before* the law was given on Mount Sinai in Exodus 20.
  - Moses already knew the “statutes of God and His laws.”
- **Eternal Nature of the Law:**
  - The moral law is the foundation of God’s government and is as eternal as God Himself.
  - The principles did not begin at Sinai; they were merely codified (written down) there because sin had dulled man's memory.
- **Universal Standard:**
  - Judgment requires a standard. Moses could not have judged “between one and another” without an existing law of right and wrong.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration

- **Gravity and Newton:**
  - Gravity existed long before Sir Isaac Newton formulated the mathematical laws to describe it.
  - Newton did not “invent” gravity; he defined it so people could understand it.
- **Application:**
  - Similarly, God’s moral law existed from eternity.
  - At Sinai, God “defined” it in written form for clarity to a fallen race.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Manna and the Sabbath

- **Question:** In the wilderness, before reaching Sinai, how did Moses explain the absence of the manna on the seventh day?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:23-26 – “He said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord... Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **Sabbath Before Sinai:**
  - The Sabbath obligation was in full force weeks before the Ten Commandments were spoken.
- **The Miracle Lesson:**
  - God used manna to teach the weekly cycle:
    1. Manna fell for six days.
    2. A double portion fell on the sixth day.
    3. No manna fell on the seventh day.
    4. Manna kept over for Sabbath remained fresh (Exodus 16:24).
- **Restoring Creation:**
  - God was re-educating His people on the Creation week: Genesis 2:3 – “And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.”

## Slide 11 – Q5: Refusal to Obey

- **Question:** When some of the people went out to gather manna on the seventh day, what did the Lord say to Moses?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:28 – “And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws?”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points

- **Violation is Rebellion:**
  - God viewed gathering food on the Sabbath as a direct refusal to keep His “commandments and laws.”
  - Sin is not just a mistake; it is rebellion against God’s will.
- **Faith and Obedience:**
  - Obedience is a test of faith. The people had to trust that the Friday double portion was enough.
  - Going out on Sabbath showed a lack of faith in God’s provision.
- **Application:**
  - True obedience comes from trusting God’s word. We rest in His finished work and provision rather than our own anxiety.

## Slide 13 – Q6: Evidence of Law Before Sinai

- **Question:** What additional evidence do we have that the moral law of Ten Commandments existed before it was proclaimed at Mount Sinai?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Romans 5:19 – “By one's disobedience many were made sinners.”
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points

- **Logical Proof:**
  1. The Bible defines sin as “transgression of the law” (1 John 3:4).
  2. The Bible declares Adam, Cain, and Sodom were “sinners” (Gen 13:13).
  3. Therefore, the Law must have existed to define their sin.
- **No Law, No Sin:**
  - Romans 4:15 – “...for where no law is, there is no transgression.”
- **Historical Examples:**
  - **Cain:** God warned him that “sin lieth at the door” (Genesis 4:7).
  - **Joseph:** He knew adultery was a “sin against God” (Genesis 39:9 – “...how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”).

## Slide 15 – Q7: Presentation of the Commandments

- **Question:** How were the Ten Commandments first presented to the people at Sinai?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:1-3 – “God spake all these words, saying,... Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points

- **Audible Revelation:**
  - The Ten Commandments are unique; God spoke them directly to the entire assembly.
  - Deuteronomy 4:12 – “And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.”
- **Supreme Authority:**
  - This public proclamation established the Decalogue as the supreme constitution of the universe.
  - It is distinct from the ceremonial laws given later through Moses.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Illustration

- **The King’s Voice:**
  - If a king sends a messenger with a letter, it is authoritative.
  - But if the king himself stands on a balcony and speaks to the crowd, the weight of authority is undeniable and personal.
- **Application:**
  - God spoke the Law personally to demonstrate its unchangeable, eternal nature.

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Written Record

- **Question:** How was it then written down as a permanent record?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 31:18 – “He gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points

- **Written by God:**
  - Unlike other scriptures written by inspired men, the Ten Commandments were written by God Himself.
- **The Finger of God:**
  - This represents the power and Spirit of God (Luke 11:20).
- **Tables of Stone:**
  - Stone represents durability and permanence.
  - Parchment fades; stone endures.
- **New Covenant:**
  - The same “finger of God” now writes this law on our hearts: 2 Corinthians 3:3 – “...written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.”

## Slide 20 – Q9: The Broken Covenant

- **Question:** How did Moses show that the children of Israel had broken their part of the covenant between them and God?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 32:19 – “It came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the [golden] calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points

- **Visualizing the Spiritual Reality:**
  - Israel had promised: “All that the Lord hath spoken we will do” (Exodus 19:8).
  - By worshipping the calf, they broke the covenant immediately.
- **Failure of Human Promises:**
  - The breaking of the stone tablets signified that man cannot keep God’s law in his own strength (the carnal mind).
  - This demonstrated the need for a Mediator and a new heart.

## Slide 22 – Q10: The Second Writing

- **Question:** With what exactness did the Lord write the law the second time?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 10:4 – “He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them unto me.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points

- **Unchangeable Standard:**
  - God did not amend the law to make it easier. He wrote “according to the first writing.”
  - Psalm 89:34 – “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.”
- **Mercy and Law:**
  - Writing them a *second* time shows mercy (a second chance).
  - Yet the standard of holiness remained perfect.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The law must be perfect because it acts as the standard of judgment in the sanctuary.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Math Teacher:**
  - If a student fails a math test, the teacher does not change the laws of mathematics to help them pass next time.
  - The rules of math remain true.
  - Instead, the teacher helps the student learn the material to meet the standard.
- **Application:**
  - God does not change His Law to suit our weakness; He changes *us* through Christ to meet its claims.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Location of the Law

- **Question:** Where did Moses place these two tables of stone?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 10:5 – “I... put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Ark of the Covenant:**
  - The tables were placed inside the Ark in the Most Holy Place.
- **Foundation of the Throne:**
  - The Mercy Seat (grace) covered the Ark (law).
  - Psalm 89:14 – “Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.”
- **Christ’s Heart:**
  - The Ark typified Christ.
  - Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.”

## Slide 27 – Q12: The Other Law

- **Question:** What other law was also given at this time?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 31:24 – “When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points

- **Moral Law vs. Ceremonial Law:**
  - **Moral Law:** Written by God on stone, placed *inside* the Ark. Endures forever.
  - **Ceremonial Law:** Written by Moses in a book, placed *beside* the Ark (Deuteronomy 31:26).
- **Purpose of Ceremonial Law:**
  - It dealt with sacrifices, feast days, and priesthood.
  - These were “shadows” pointing to Christ.
  - Colossians 2:14 – “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us... and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Purpose of Redemption

- **Question:** Why did the Lord call His people out of the land of Egypt?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 105:43-45 – “He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen with gladness:... that they might observe His statutes, and keep His laws.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points

- **Saved to Serve:**
  - God saved Israel so they would be free to obey Him.
  - In Egypt, they were forced to serve idols; redemption gave them the liberty to do right.
- **Order of Salvation:**
  - First: “Brought forth His people” (Salvation/Justification).
  - Second: “That they might observe His statutes” (Sanctification/Obedience).
  - We do not keep the law *to get* saved; we keep it because we *are* saved.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Doctor and Patient:**
  - A doctor cures a patient of a deadly condition.
  - The doctor then gives health rules to maintain this new life.
  - The patient follows the rules not to *become* healed (that is already done), but out of gratitude and to maintain the life given.

## Slide 32 – Q14: Teaching the Law

- **Question:** How were they to teach the law to their children?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 6:7 – “Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sit test in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points

- **Diligence:**
  - Teaching God’s character requires constant, intentional effort.
- **Lifestyle Evangelism:**
  - The law of love was to be the topic of daily conversation—at dinner, on walks, at bedtime.
- **Character Formation:**
  - By constantly beholding God's principles, we are changed.
  - 2 Corinthians 3:18 – “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory...”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Conditional Promise

- **Question:** What promise to Israel hinged on their keeping the instructions that He had given them?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 19:5, 6 – “Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.”

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points

- **The Condition:**
  - “If ye will obey.” Blessings are connected to a cooperative relationship of faith and obedience.
- **Peculiar Treasure:**
  - Means “special property” or distinct possession.
- **Holy Nation:**
  - A people set apart.
  - Their mission was to be a “kingdom of priests,” mediating the knowledge of God to the nations.

## Slide 36 – Q16: Universal Promise

- **Question:** Was this promise made to the Jews alone?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 12:3 – “...and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”
  - Galatians 3:29 – “If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points

- **Universal Intent:**
  - God’s plan was never restricted to one ethnicity; all families were to be blessed.
- **Spiritual Israel:**
  - The true “seed” of Abraham is Christ.
  - Anyone “in Christ” inherits the promises.
- **The Church’s Role:**
  - 1 Peter 2:9 – “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people...”

## Slide 38 – Q17: The Law for Christians

- **Question:** What reveals that the Ten Commandment law, given at Sinai, is the law for the Christian?
- **Key Text:** James 2:10-12 – “Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all, For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points

- **New Testament Confirmation:**
  - James quotes the Ten Commandments as a binding standard for Christians.
- **Unity of the Law:**
  - Breaking one commandment is breaking the whole law because it rejects the Lawgiver’s will.
- **Law of Liberty:**
  - To the believer with the law written on the heart, obedience is freedom.
  - Psalm 119:45 – “And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.”

## Slide 40 – Q17: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **True Liberty:**
  - Real liberty is not freedom *to* sin, but freedom *from* the power of sin.
  - The Spirit of Christ empowers the believer to live the law of love freely.

## Slide 41 – Q18: The Wages of Sin

- **Question:** What is the wages of sin?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Romans 6:23 – “The wages of sin is death.”
  - Genesis 2:17 – “In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”
  - Ezekiel 18:4 – “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.”

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points

- **The Penalty:**
  - The penalty is the “second death”—eternal separation from God, the Source of life.
- **Justice:**
  - A law without a penalty is merely advice. The stability of the universe requires that rebellion be checked.
- **No Eternal Torment:**
  - The wages is “death,” not eternal life in misery.
  - Obadiah 1:16 – “...and they shall be as though they had not been.”

## Slide 43 – Q19: Entry of Death

- **Question:** How did death enter this world?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:12 – “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,' and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points

- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Death is an intruder; it was not part of God’s original creation.
  - It entered through Adam’s choice to believe Satan’s lies.
- **Universal Condition:**
  - Because of the fall, humanity inherited a fallen nature.
  - We sin because we are born separated from God, with a bent toward self.

## Slide 45 – Q20: Mercy and Justice

- **Question:** God is merciful, but will His mercy clear the guilty?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 14:18 – “The Lord is long suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty.”

## Slide 46 – Q20: Key Points

- **The Dilemma:**
  - God is merciful and wants to forgive, but He is just and cannot simply “clear the guilty” or the law would be void.
- **The Solution (Atonement):**
  - God provides a Substitute. In Christ, the penalty was paid.
  - Romans 3:26 – “To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.”
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - Mercy and Truth met together at the Mercy Seat (Psalm 85:10).

## Slide 47 – Q21: Willful Sin

- **Question:** What is the result of willfully sinning against God?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:26-29 – “If we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins... He that despised Moses' law died without mercy... Of how much sorer punishment... shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God... and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?”

## Slide 48 – Q21: Key Points

- **Willful Rebellion:**
  - This is not a slip or struggle, but a persistent rejection of God’s authority after knowing the truth.
- **No More Sacrifice:**
  - Christ’s sacrifice applies to the repentant. If one rejects Christ and clings to sin, there is no other way to be saved.
- **The Spirit of Grace:**
  - To continue in known sin is to insult the Holy Spirit and “tread under foot” the Son of God.

## Slide 49 – Q22: The Judge

- **Question:** To whom is the execution of judgment given?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Romans 12:19 – “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”
  - John 5:26, 27 – “The Father hath... given to the Son... authority to execute judgement also.”

## Slide 50 – Q22: Key Points

- **God’s Prerogative:**
  - Humans are not to take vengeance; judgment belongs to God alone.
- **Christ the Judge:**
  - The Father has committed judgment to the Son because He is the “Son of Man.”
  - Hebrews 4:15 – “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.”
- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - Christ investigates the books to determine who has accepted His righteousness before executing judgment.

## Slide 51 – Q23: Presumption

- **Question:** What presumptuous way of life do many pursue?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 8:11 – “Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.”

## Slide 52 – Q23: Key Points

- **Abusing Patience:**
  - Men mistake God’s longsuffering for indifference.
  - They think, “I sinned and nothing happened, so I am safe.”
- **Hardening the Heart:**
  - This presumption leads the heart to be “fully set” in evil, resulting in spiritual numbness.

## Slide 53 – Q23: Illustration

- **The Speeding Driver:**
  - A driver who speeds constantly without getting a ticket eventually believes the laws don't apply to him.
  - The lack of a ticket doesn't mean the police aren't watching; it just means the day of reckoning is delayed.
- **Lesson:**
  - Delayed judgment is not the absence of judgment.

## Slide 54 – Q24: God’s Message to Men

- **Question:** What message has God sent to men by His appointed messengers?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Isaiah 3:10, 11 – “Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him... Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him.”
  - 2 Corinthians 5:20 – “We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.”

## Slide 55 – Q24: Key Points

- **The Two Ways:**
  - For the righteous (justified by faith, walking in obedience): It “shall be well.”
  - For the wicked (clinging to sin): There is “woe.”
- **The Ambassador’s Plea:**
  - God is “beseeching” (begging) men to be reconciled.
  - The heart of the gospel is God trying to win back the trust of His children.
- **Reaping and Sowing:**
  - Everyone eventually eats the “fruit of their doings.”

## Slide 56 – Q25: The Escape

- **Question:** How can man escape the penalty of sin?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:23 – “The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 57 – Q25: Key Points

- **The Gift:**
  - We earn death (wages), but we cannot earn life. Eternal life is a gift.
- **Through Jesus Christ:**
  - **Justification:** He died our death, paying the wages we owed.
  - **Sanctification:** He lives out His life in us, enabling us to walk in obedience.
- **The Function of Law and Grace:**
  - The Law drives us to Christ to be cleansed.
  - Christ points us back to the Law to live a life of love and gratitude.

## Slide 58 – Q25: Illustration

- **The Lifeboat:**
  - A man drowning in a stormy sea (penalty of sin) cannot swim to shore (human works).
  - A lifeboat (Christ) rescues him. He is saved entirely by the Rescuer.
  - Once in the boat, he does not jump back into the water; he stays in the boat and follows the captain's orders.
- **Lesson:**
  - We are saved *by* grace, *for* a life of obedience.
