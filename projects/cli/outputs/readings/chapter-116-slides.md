## Slide 1 – Q1: The Nature of the Warfare

- Question: Against whom do we wrestle?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:12 – “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Conflict)

- **The Nature of the Conflict**
  - Our struggle is not against human beings, though they may oppose us.
  - We fight against a spiritual, organized enemy.
  - Revelation 12:7 – “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels.”
- **The Great Controversy**
  - This is a cosmic war over God’s character and the human heart.
  - The "darkness of this world" refers to the separation caused by sin.
  - Isaiah 59:2 – “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Victory Through Christ**
  - Because the enemy is supernatural, human willpower is insufficient.
  - We need the “whole armor of God” (Ephesians 6:13).
  - **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
    - We do not stand in our own strength.
    - We are hidden in the merit and power of Christ.
    - We rely on His victory, not our own performance.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Hidden Commander**
  - Imagine a soldier fighting on a battlefield against visible foot soldiers.
  - He realizes the true enemy commander is invisible, operating from a hidden bunker.
  - If the soldier only fights the visible enemies (people) but ignores the strategist (Satan), he will lose.
  - Lesson: We must recognize the spiritual source of temptation to effectively use spiritual weapons (prayer and the Word).

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Origin and Location of Evil

- Question: When the evil angels first sinned, where were they cast and why?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 2:4 – “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Origin and Restraint)

- **The Origin of Evil**
  - Sin began with Lucifer, not humanity.
  - Isaiah 14:12 – “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!”
- **"Cast Down to Hell" (Tartarus)**
  - This refers to a condition of restraint, not a place of fire (yet).
  - They are confined to the earth's atmosphere.
  - Ephesians 2:2 – “Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Sanctuary Connection (Judgment)

- **Reserved Unto Judgment**
  - Satan is a prisoner awaiting sentencing; he does not reign in hell.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, sins were transferred to the scapegoat (Azazel) on the Day of Atonement.
  - Leviticus 16:10 – “But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.”
  - Similarly, Satan is reserved to bear the ultimate responsibility for the sin he instigated before his final destruction.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Holding Cell**
  - Consider a dangerous criminal who has been arrested but not yet executed.
  - He is placed in a holding cell—a place of restriction—awaiting trial.
  - He is "reserved" for the day of sentencing.
  - Similarly, fallen angels are restricted to this earth, awaiting the final judgment of the Great White Throne (Revelation 20:11–15).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Satan’s Titles

- Question: What is Satan himself called?
- Key Text 1: 2 Corinthians 4:4 – “In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not...”
- Key Text 2: John 14:30 – “Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.”
- Key Text 3: Ephesians 2:2 – “...the prince of the power of the air...”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Usurped Dominion)

- **The Usurper**
  - Adam surrendered his God-given dominion to Satan through obedience to sin.
  - Romans 6:16 – “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”
- **God of this World**
  - Satan influences the world's systems and maxims.
  - He seeks to blind minds to the gospel.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Application (Christ the Conqueror)

- **Christ the Conqueror**
  - Jesus declared that Satan had no hold on Him (John 14:30).
  - John 12:31 – “Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.”
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - Through the cross, Satan’s legal claim is broken.
  - Believers are transferred to God's kingdom.
  - Colossians 1:13 – “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.”

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Hijacked Ship**
  - Imagine a ship hijacked by pirates.
  - The pirate captain declares himself the "captain" and forces the crew to serve him.
  - The rightful Owner arrives with superior force to retake the vessel.
  - Satan is the hijacker (usurper); Christ is the Owner who boards the ship to set the captives free.

## Slide 13 – Q4: The Work of the Enemy

- Question: What is the chief work of the devil and his angels? How earnestly does he carryon this work?
- Key Text 1: Mark 1:13 – “And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan...”
- Key Text 2: 1 Peter 5:8 – “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Key Points (Deception & Accusation)

- **Temptation and Deception**
  - Satan deceives the whole world (Revelation 12:9).
  - He tempted Christ to doubt God’s love; he will attack us similarly.
- **The Accuser**
  - He tempts men to sin, then accuses them before God.
  - Revelation 12:10 – “...for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - While Satan accuses, Jesus stands as our High Priest.
  - 1 John 2:1 – “...And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.”

## Slide 15 – Q4: Application (Victory over Sin)

- **The Promise of Victory**
  - We must be sober and vigilant.
  - James 4:7 – “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”
  - Victory comes through faith in Christ’s power.
  - 1 Peter 5:9 – “Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.”

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Stalking Lion**
  - A lion does not announce its presence with a bell; it stalks silently.
  - It looks for the straggler who has wandered away from the shepherd.
  - The lion fears the Shepherd.
  - Lesson: When we stay close to the Shepherd (Christ), the lion cannot devour us.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Closing the Door

- Question: What are we warned not to do?
- Key Text: Ephesians 4:26, 27 – “Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: Key Points (Cherished Sin)

- **Giving Place to the Devil**
  - To "give place" is to provide an opportunity or beachhead.
  - Cherished sins (anger, bitterness) are open doors for Satan.
- **Sanctification of the Temper**
  - We must not excuse a "bad temper" as hereditary.
  - **Sanctification:** The work of grace where the believer acts, thinks, and feels like Christ.
  - 1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 19 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Door Ajar**
  - If you live in a dangerous neighborhood, you do not leave your front door open.
  - Leaving the door even slightly ajar invites the thief to enter.
  - Unresolved anger or a cherished grudge is like leaving the soul’s door ajar.
  - Satan needs only a small opening to insert his foot and take over.

## Slide 20 – Q6: The Increase of Evil

- Question: As we near the close of human probation and the end of time, why may we expect an increase in demon manifestations?
- Key Text: Revelation 12:12 – “Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”

## Slide 21 – Q6: Key Points (Probation & Wrath)

- **The Shortness of Time**
  - Satan knows prophecy; he knows the "mystery of God" is finishing (Revelation 10:7).
- **Definition of Probation**
  - The time granted to humanity to accept the gospel before the final judgment.
  - Revelation 22:11 – “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still...”
- **Great Wrath**
  - Satan works with desperate energy (violence, anarchy) to distract from preparation.

## Slide 22 – Q6: Application (Sanctuary Preparation)

- **The Call to Readiness**
  - Satan’s wrath aims to deceive even the elect.
  - Matthew 24:24 – “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.”
  - This reality should drive us to the sanctuary—to prayer and soul-searching—to have sins blotted out.

## Slide 23 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Final Two Minutes**
  - A losing sports team plays with frantic intensity in the final minutes of the game.
  - They take extreme risks because the clock is ticking down.
  - Satan knows the "game clock" of history is near zero.
  - His fury is unleashed to ruin as many as possible before the end.

## Slide 24 – Q7: The Last Days Deception

- Question: What warning has been especially given to us who live in these last days?
- Key Text: 1 Timothy 4:1 – “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.”

## Slide 25 – Q7: Key Points (Spiritualism)

- **Departure from the Faith**
  - A warning against apostasy among those who once held truth.
  - We must receive the "love of the truth" (2 Thessalonians 2:10).
- **Seducing Spirits & State of the Dead**
  - Modern spiritualism claims the living can communicate with the dead.
  - Bible Truth: The dead sleep.
  - Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.”

## Slide 26 – Q7: Key Points (The Safeguard)

- **Doctrines of Devils**
  - Teachings that lower God's law or deny Christ's divinity.
  - Spirits claiming to be deceased loved ones are lying spirits (demons).
- **The Biblical Safeguard**
  - We must test every spirit by the Word.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

## Slide 27 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Counterfeit Bill**
  - A counterfeiter does not make bills that look obviously fake (like a $3 bill).
  - He makes them look almost exactly like the real thing.
  - Satan's end-time deceptions will closely mimic true Christianity (miracles, emotion).
  - Only those who know the "security features" of the Bible will spot the fake.

## Slide 28 – Q8: The Final Doom

- Question: What will be the final doom of Satan, his angels, and all the wicked of earth?
- Key Text 1: Matthew 25:41 – “Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”
- Key Text 2: Malachi 4:1 – “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven... and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble... that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.”

## Slide 29 – Q8: Key Points (Destruction of Sin)

- **Total Annihilation**
  - Satan is the "root," followers are the "branches."
  - "Neither root nor branch" implies total non-existence.
  - Obadiah 1:16 – “...and they shall be as though they had not been.”
- **The Nature of "Everlasting Fire"**
  - The *effect* is everlasting (permanent destruction), not the duration of the process.
  - Example: Sodom suffered "eternal fire" but turned to ashes.
  - Jude 7 – “Even as Sodom and Gomorrah... are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.”
  - 2 Peter 2:6 – “And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow...”

## Slide 30 – Q8: Key Points (God’s Love & New Earth)

- **God's Character of Love**
  - God will cleanse the universe of the cancer of sin, not torture eternally.
  - The wicked become "stubble" and ashes (Malachi 4:3).
- **A Cleansed Universe**
  - Sin will not rise a second time.
  - Nahum 1:9 – “What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.”
  - God will create a new heaven and earth (2 Peter 3:13).

## Slide 31 – Q8: Illustration

- **Burning the Plague**
  - If a house is infected with a deadly, incurable plague, authorities may burn it down.
  - The fire burns until the house is gone (turned to ash), then the fire goes out.
  - The destruction is permanent (eternal).
  - The fire of the last days cleanses the universe of the plague of sin forever.
