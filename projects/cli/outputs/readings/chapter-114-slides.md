## Slide 1 – The Rich Man and Lazarus

- A Study on the State of the Dead and the Justice of God
- Understanding Parables and Bible Symbols
- Examining Luke 16 through the Lens of Scripture

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: Lazarus in Abraham’s Bosom

- **Question:** In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, what is said to have become of Lazarus?
- **Key Text:** Luke 16:22 – “And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **Abraham’s Bosom:**
  - A common Jewish figure of speech denoting honor and intimate fellowship, not a literal geographical location.
  - Similar to John leaning on Jesus (John 13:23 – “Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.”).
- **The Great Reversal:**
  - The rich man had earthly wealth but no spiritual riches.
  - Lazarus was physically destitute but rich in faith (James 2:5 – “Harken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?”).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Lazarus represents the sinner who realizes his spiritual bankruptcy.
  - Matthew 5:3 – “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
  - He relies entirely on God’s mercy and is carried by messengers of grace into the family of the faithful.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **From Beggar to Royal Guest:**
  - Imagine a homeless man shivering outside a banquet hall.
  - Suddenly, the King’s guards lift him up, wash him, clothe him in royal robes, and seat him at the King’s right hand.
- **Spiritual Reality:**
  - We are destitute in sin, but through faith, God lifts us up.
  - Ephesians 2:6 – “And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.”

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Rich Man’s Fate

- **Question:** What befell the rich man?
- **Key Text:** Luke 16:22, 23 – “The rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **“In Hell” (Hades):**
  - The Greek word *Hades* corresponds to the Hebrew *Sheol*.
  - It refers to the grave or the realm of the dead, not the final lake of fire (*Gehenna*).
- **The Parabolic Nature:**
  - The rich man lifts up his “eyes,” yet Scripture teaches the body returns to dust.
  - Genesis 3:19 – “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”
  - This confirms Jesus is using a metaphor to teach a moral lesson, not a literal geography where heaven and hell are within speaking distance.
- **Danger of Self-Sufficiency:**
  - The rich man had outward wealth but inward poverty.
  - Revelation 3:17 – “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Request for Water

- **Question:** What request did the rich man make of Abraham?
- **Key Text:** Luke 16:24 – “And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **The Finality of Death:**
  - The “great gulf fixed” (Luke 16:26) represents the unchangeable nature of character after death.
  - Probation closes when life ends; there is no crossing over from rebellion to obedience.
- **Physical Impossibility:**
  - A literal drop of water cannot cool a man in literal fire.
  - This imagery highlights the intense regret of wasted probation.
- **Sanctuary Connection (The Atonement):**
  - We are currently in the time of atonement where Jesus, our High Priest, offers the water of life freely.
  - Revelation 22:17 – “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Wet Concrete:**
  - While concrete is wet, it can be shaped, smoothed, or removed.
  - Once it sets, it becomes rock-hard and cannot be molded.
- **Application:**
  - Life is the wet concrete; death is when it sets.
  - Our character becomes fixed at death.
  - Revelation 22:11 – “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Abraham’s Reply

- **Question:** Upon making the request for Lazarus to be sent to his father's house to warn his brethren, what did Abraham reply?
- **Key Text:** Luke 16:29 – “Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.”

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **Sufficiency of Scripture:**
  - “Moses and the prophets” refers to the Old Testament. The written Word is sufficient for salvation.
- **Faith vs. Sight:**
  - True faith comes from the Word, not from seeing ghosts.
  - Romans 10:17 – “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”
- **Christ in the Word:**
  - Rejecting the Bible is rejecting the only means of understanding salvation.
  - John 5:39 – “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.”
- **Sanctification:**
  - We are made holy by believing the truth (John 17:17 – “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”).

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Earnest Appeal

- **Question:** What earnest appeal did the rich man then make?
- **Key Text:** Luke 16:30 – “And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Human Delusion:**
  - We often think, “If I just saw a miracle, I would obey.”
  - But a heart hardened against God’s law will not be softened merely by a sign.
- **True Repentance:**
  - Repentance is a change of mind and heart, not just fear of punishment.
  - Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.”
- **Note on Resurrection:**
  - The rich man speaks of one coming “from the dead,” implying Lazarus was in the grave, not in heaven.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Speeding Driver:**
  - A driver ignores speed limits (the Law) and police warnings (the Prophets).
  - Seeing a terrible accident (a sign) scares him into slowing down briefly.
  - Once the fear fades, he speeds again because his respect for the law hasn't changed.
- **Lesson:**
  - Fear does not produce righteousness.
  - Only the Holy Spirit writing the law on the heart produces lasting obedience.

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: The Final Verdict

- **Question:** But had Lazarus gone on such a mission, what must have taken place?
- **Key Text:** Luke 16:31 – “And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.”

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points

- **Prophetic Fulfillment:**
  - Jesus later raised a literal Lazarus (John 11).
  - Instead of repenting, the leaders plotted to kill both Jesus and Lazarus.
- **Hardness of Heart:**
  - If a man rejects the authority of God’s Word, supernatural evidence will not convince him.
- **Application (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - We are saved by trusting God’s promise in His Word.
  - seeking signs is often an evasion of the duty to repent.
  - Romans 4:3 – “For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Timing of Punishment

- **Question:** When are the wicked punished?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 2:9 – “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **“Reserved” for Judgment:**
  - The unjust are kept in custody (reserved) *until* the day of judgment. They are not punished immediately at death.
- **Justice of God:**
  - It is unjust to punish a soul before their trial (Judgment Day).
- **The Biblical Order:**
  1. Death (Sleep).
  2. Resurrection (John 5:28-29 – “...all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth...”).
  3. Judgment.
  4. Reward or Punishment.
- **Sanctuary Context:**
  - This aligns with the Investigative Judgment (Daniel 7:9-10), where records are reviewed before rewards are given.

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Timing of Judgment

- **Question:** When will the judgment take place?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 4:1 – “I charge thee therefore before God, and the lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom.”

---

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

- **At His Appearing:**
  - Judgment of the dead is linked to the Second Coming ("His appearing").
- **Implication:**
  - If judgment happens at the Second Coming, the dead cannot be in heaven or hell right now.
  - They are waiting for that great day.
- **Harmony of Scripture:**
  - God vindicates His character and judges the wicked at the end of the age, not at every individual funeral.

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: Reward of the Righteous

- **Question:** When are the righteous to be recompensed?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:14 – “And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.”

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points & Illustration

- **Recompense at Resurrection:**
  - Jesus teaches that the reward is given at the "resurrection of the just," not at the moment of death.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout... and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”
- **Illustration – Payday:**
  - A worker labors all month but does not get paid every hour.
  - He waits for "payday."
  - The Christian labors in life, sleeps in death, and receives the reward on the Resurrection morning.

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: The Gathering of the Elect

- **Question:** When do the angels gather the elect to Christ?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:30, 31 – “And they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points

- **Gathering at the Second Coming:**
  - Angels gather the saved when the trumpet sounds.
  - If they are gathered *then*, they are not gathered individually at death now.
- **Conclusion on the Parable:**
  - Since Scripture teaches the wicked are reserved for judgment and the righteous are rewarded at the resurrection, the story of the Rich Man and Lazarus must be a **parable**.
- **Definition – Personification:**
  - A figure of speech where the dead (or inanimate objects) are described as having life and speech to make a vivid point.

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: God’s Perspective

- **Question:** Does God in other places speak of things that do not exist, as though they did exist?
- **Key Text:** Romans 4:17 – “(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations) before Him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points

- **Certainty of Future Events:**
  - God inhabits eternity. He often speaks of future events as if they have already happened because they are certain.
  - Abraham was called a father of nations before he had a son.
- **Application:**
  - In the parable, Jesus speaks of the final separation of the righteous and wicked as a finished reality.
  - This emphasizes the *certainty* of the judgment, not the *timing*.

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Personification in the OT

- **Question:** Name some instances given in the Old Testament which show that the figure of personification is a common mode of expression.
- **Key Text:** Habakkuk 2:11 – “For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.”

---

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points

- **Biblical Examples:**
  - **Habakkuk 2:11:** Stones and beams "cry out." (Inanimate objects given a voice).
  - **Genesis 4:10:** “The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.” (Blood does not literally speak).
  - **Judges 9:** Jotham’s parable of the talking trees.
- **Lesson:**
  - Jesus gives the dead "tongues" and "eyes" in the parable to teach a lesson.
  - This does not contradict the plain teaching that the dead know nothing.
  - Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing...”

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Personification in the NT

- **Question:** Does the New Testament sometimes use the same method?
- **Key Text:** James 5:4 – “Behold the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth.”

---

## Slide 30 – Q13: Summary Points

- **Inanimate Objects Speaking:**
  - Unpaid wages are described as "crying out" for justice.
  - This is clearly metaphorical; coins do not have mouths.
- **Summary of Doctrine:**
  1.  The dead sleep until the resurrection (Job 14:12 – “So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.”).
  2.  Rewards and punishments occur at the Second Coming.
  3.  The Parable teaches that character is fixed at death.
- **The Choice:**
  - The "gulf fixed" is the decision of the will. We must choose Christ today.

---

## Slide 31 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Map vs. The Reality:**
  - A map represents the land, but it is not the land itself.
  - A parable is a "map" of truth.
- **Interpretation:**
  - We must not mistake the symbols (fingers, tongues, bosoms) for literal geography.
  - We must follow the direction the map points:
    - Repentance.
    - Faith in God’s Word.
    - Preparation for the Judgment.
