### Q1. Who are accepted of God?

"In every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted
with Him." Acts 10:35. "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?" Gen.
4:7.

**Answer:** Acceptance with God is the foundation of all peace and spiritual
life. These verses indicate that God is not arbitrary; He does not show
partiality based on nationality, lineage, or social standing. However, the text
says he that "worketh righteousness" is accepted. This must be understood
through the lens of the Gospel to avoid the error of legalism (trying to earn
salvation by works).

1.  **The Source of Righteousness:** True righteousness is not self-generated.
    As Isaiah 64:6 tells us, our own righteousnesses are as "filthy rags."
    Therefore, the man who "worketh righteousness" is one who has surrendered to
    the influence of God's Spirit and is living up to the light he has received.
    He is accepted because his heart is turned toward God in faith.
2.  **Fearing God:** To "fear" God in the biblical sense means to have a deep,
    reverential awe and a willingness to obey Him (Ecclesiastes 12:13). It is
    the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10).
3.  **Working Righteousness by Faith:** In the Great Controversy between good
    and evil, God looks at the heart. When a person—like Cornelius in Acts
    10—responds to the drawing power of the Holy Spirit with faith and
    obedience, God accepts that faith. It is Christ’s righteousness that makes
    any human work acceptable.

**Definition:**

- **Righteousness:** Doing what is right in God's eyes; conformity to the law of
  God. In the plan of salvation, this is only possible through faith in Jesus
  Christ (Romans 3:22).

[ILL] Imagine a mirror. A mirror cannot generate light on its own; it is dark by
nature. However, if it is turned toward the sun, it "works" light by reflecting
it. A believer "works righteousness" not by creating it from within, but by
turning their heart toward the Sun of Righteousness (Malachi 4:2) and reflecting
His character.

### Q2. Since by nature man cannot "work righteousness," the carnal mind being "enmity against God" (Rom. 8:7), what transformation is necessary?

"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of
God." 1 Peter 1:23. "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." 2 Cor.
5:17.

**Answer:** Because the natural human heart is fallen and self-centered, a
superficial improvement or "turning over a new leaf" is insufficient. A radical
transformation is required:

1.  **The Problem—The Carnal Mind:** The "carnal mind" refers to human nature
    separated from God. It is naturally selfish, rebellious, and incapable of
    obeying God's law of love (Romans 8:7). It is not merely sick; it is dead in
    trespasses and sins (Ephesians 2:1).
2.  **The Solution—The New Birth:** Jesus taught Nicodemus, "Ye must be born
    again" (John 3:7). This is a new creation, not a renovation of the old life.
    The "old man" of sin must die, and a "new man" must be created in
    righteousness (Ephesians 4:24).
3.  **The Seed of Life:** This new life is planted by the "incorruptible seed,"
    which is the Word of God. When the sinner receives the Bible's promises by
    faith, the life of God enters the soul.

**Definition:**

- **Carnal Mind:** The natural, unregenerate human mind that seeks self-interest
  and resists God’s authority.
- **New Birth:** The spiritual act where God imparts a new nature and divine
  life to the believing sinner, enabling them to love and obey God.

[ILL] A sculpture can be polished and painted, but it remains stone—cold and
lifeless. It can never become a human being by improvement. It would require a
miracle to turn stone into flesh. Similarly, a sinner cannot be improved into a
saint; they must be "born again" by the creative power of God to become a "new
creature."

---

### Q3. By what agency is the new birth produced?

"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit
is spirit." John 3:6. "It is the Spirit that quickeneth." John 6:63. "If any man
have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of His." Rom. 8:9.

**Answer:** The agent of this miraculous transformation is the Holy Spirit, the
third person of the Godhead.

1.  **The Spirit Quickeneth:** To "quicken" means to make alive. Just as the
    Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters at creation (Genesis 1:2),
    the Holy Spirit moves upon the chaos of the human heart to bring spiritual
    life.
2.  **The Spirit of Christ:** The Holy Spirit brings the personal presence of
    Jesus into the believer's life. To have the Spirit is to have the mind of
    Christ (Philippians 2:5). Without this indwelling, we may have a form of
    religion, but we lack the power thereof (2 Timothy 3:5).
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the priest used water
    for cleansing. This typified the work of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5, the
    "washing of regeneration"). The Spirit applies the cleansing blood of Christ
    to the conscience.

**Definition:**

- **Regeneration:** Another term for the new birth; the act of the Holy Spirit
  reforming the heart and implanting a new principle of life.

[ILL] Think of a radio. It may have all the correct parts and be tuned to the
right frequency, but without electricity, it produces no sound. The Christian
brings the "machinery" of the mind and body, but it is the electricity—the Holy
Spirit—that powers the life and produces the music of the Gospel.

### Q4. How precious is forgiveness to the burdened soul at conversion! Is this rich boon conferred as a thing that is due, or as a pure act of grace or unmerited favor?

"In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
according to the riches of His grace." Eph. 1:7. "Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son." Luke
15:18, 19.

**Answer:** Forgiveness is the first great gift of the Gospel, and the Bible is
emphatic that it is a gift of pure grace, never a wage earned by human merit.

1.  **Not by Works:** The prodigal son in Luke 15 prepared a speech offering to
    work as a servant, but the father embraced him as a son before he could even
    finish. We are "justified freely by His grace" (Romans 3:24).
2.  **Through His Blood:** Grace is free to us, but it cost heaven everything.
    Forgiveness is legally possible because the penalty of the law was paid by
    the life and blood of Jesus Christ. In the sanctuary service, the sinner
    brought a lamb—Christ is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
    (John 1:29).
3.  **Unmerited Favor:** We are "no more worthy." The realization of our
    unworthiness, combined with the knowledge of God's love, breaks the heart
    and leads to genuine repentance.

**Definition:**

- **Grace:** The unmerited favor and love of God toward those who deserve
  exactly the opposite.
- **Justification:** God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is
  righteous. He treats the sinner as if he had never sinned, crediting Christ's
  perfect life to his account (Romans 4:5).

[ILL] If a man commits a crime and is fined one million dollars, he cannot pay
it. If a wealthy friend pays the fine for him, the judge can legally set the man
free. The freedom is a gift to the criminal, but the cost was real to the
friend. Christ paid our debt on the cross so we could receive the
receipt—forgiveness—as a free gift.

### Q5. What relation exists between God and believers?

"I will be their God, and they shall be My people." "And will be a Father unto
you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." 2 Cor.
6:16, 18.

**Answer:** The Gospel restores the intimate relationship that was broken in
Eden. It is a covenant relationship:

1.  **Adoption:** We are not merely subjects of a King; we are adopted children
    of a Father (Romans 8:15). This grants us access to the "throne of grace"
    with confidence.
2.  **Mutual Possession:** "I will be their God, and they shall be My people."
    This echoes the marriage covenant. God pledges His omnipotence to protect,
    guide, and save His people, and His people pledge their loyalty and love to
    Him.
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** God’s purpose in the sanctuary was, "Let them make
    me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them" (Exodus 25:8). Through the Holy
    Spirit, the believer’s body becomes the temple of the living God (1
    Corinthians 6:19).

[ILL] A street urchin may be pitied by a king and given a coin. But if the king
takes the child into the palace, signs adoption papers, and gives him the royal
name, the relationship changes entirely. The child now has a right to the
resources of the father. By faith, we are that child.

---

### Q6. Can such relation exist and one not be conscious of it?

"Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him
not, neither knoweth Him; but ye know Him: for He dwelleth with you, and shall
be in you." John 14:17. "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that
we are the children of God." Rom. 8:16. "Hereby know we that we dwell in Him,
and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit." 1 John 4:13.

**Answer:** True Christianity is an experiential reality, not just a theory.
While feelings fluctuate, there is a definite consciousness of a changed life
and relationship.

1.  **The Witness of the Spirit:** The Holy Spirit works upon the human
    conscience, giving an internal assurance of acceptance. This "witness" often
    comes through the application of Scripture to the heart—when we read a
    promise, the Spirit helps us believe, "This is for me."
2.  **Knowing Him:** Jesus says the world does not know the Spirit, but "ye know
    Him." Righteousness by faith involves a personal, interactive knowledge of
    God.
3.  **Evidence of Change:** We know we have passed from death to life because we
    love the brethren (1 John 3:14) and because our desires have changed from
    worldly things to spiritual things.

**Definition:**

- **Assurance of Salvation:** The confidence that we are currently accepted by
  God through Christ, based on the promises of His Word (1 John 5:13).

[ILL] If a person is carrying a heavy backpack of rocks and someone suddenly
cuts the straps and lifts it off, the person _knows_ the difference. They feel
the relief. When the burden of sin is rolled away at the foot of the cross, the
soul knows the relief of forgiveness.

---

### Q7. What does the knowledge of our acceptance with God bring?

"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord
Jesus Christ." Rom. 5:1.

**Answer:** The immediate result of justification is **peace**.

1.  **End of Hostilities:** Sin is rebellion; it is a state of war against God's
    government. When we surrender and accept Christ's righteousness, the war is
    over. We are no longer "enemies" (Romans 5:10), but friends.
2.  **Relief from Guilt:** A guilty conscience is a restless thing (Isaiah
    57:20). Justification removes the ground of guilt because Christ has taken
    the penalty.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** This peace comes only by _faith_. If we look to
    our own works for peace, we will find only anxiety, because our works are
    never perfect. But when we look to Christ's finished work, the peace is
    solid.

[ILL] Imagine a soldier who has been fighting against a legitimate king. He
lives in constant fear of capture and punishment. Then, he receives a royal
pardon and an invitation to dine at the king's table. The fear vanishes,
replaced by gratitude and peace. This is the peace of the justified soul.

---

### Q8. Of what nature is the peace of the believer?

"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give
I unto you." John 14:27.

**Answer:** The peace of Christ is distinct from what the world calls peace.

1.  **Not External:** Worldly peace is merely the absence of conflict or
    trouble. It depends on circumstances. If the bank account is full and health
    is good, the world has peace.
2.  **Internal and Divine:** Christ's peace ("My peace") is the calm He
    possessed even while facing the cross. It is a deep, settled trust in the
    Father's love that exists _regardless_ of external circumstances.
3.  **A Fruit of the Spirit:** It is part of the "fruit of the Spirit"
    (Galatians 5:22). It is the tranquility of a heart that has nothing to hide
    from God and nothing to fear from the future.

[ILL] The ocean surface may be raging with waves during a hurricane, but deep
below the surface, the waters are perfectly still. The Christian's life may have
storms on the surface (troubles, persecution), but deep in the soul, there is
the stillness of God.

---

### Q9. Will those who have this peace be free from tribulation?

"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome
the world." John 16:33.

**Answer:** No, the Christian is not promised an easy life. In fact, "all that
will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution" (2 Timothy 3:12).

1.  **The Reality of Conflict:** As long as the Great Controversy continues, the
    enemy will attack those who bear Christ's image. Tribulation helps refine
    the character, burning away the dross of selfishness (1 Peter 1:6-7).
2.  **Good Cheer:** We can be of "good cheer" not because the pain is gone, but
    because the Victory is already won. Christ has "overcome the world," and
    through faith, His victory becomes ours (1 John 5:4).
3.  **Sanctification through Suffering:** God uses trials to teach us dependence
    on Him. It drives us to the Sanctuary—to the throne of grace—where we find
    help in time of need.

[ILL] A diamond is shaped and polished by friction. Without the friction of the
grinding wheel, it would remain a rough, dull stone. God uses the friction of
tribulation to polish His people into jewels for His kingdom.

---

### Q10. What will be one of the delights of the converted man?

"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." Rom. 7:22. "His delight
is in the law of the Lord." Ps. 1:2.

**Answer:** This is a crucial test of true conversion. The carnal mind is "not
subject to the law of God" (Romans 8:7), but the converted heart loves it.

1.  **The Law Written on the Heart:** In the New Covenant, God promises, "I will
    put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).
    This means the believer wants to do God's will. Obedience becomes a delight,
    not a burden.
2.  **Character Alignment:** The law is a transcript of God’s character. When we
    love Christ, we naturally love His law because it describes what He is like.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Legalism keeps the law to earn salvation (which
    is impossible). Faith keeps the law because the heart has been changed by
    salvation. As Psalm 40:8 says, "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy
    law is within my heart."

**Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing process of being made holy; the Holy Spirit
  writing the law of God on the heart so that the believer grows up into the
  character of Christ.

[ILL] A prisoner in a cell may obey the guard solely out of fear of punishment.
That is the "spirit of bondage." A loving husband remains faithful to his wife
not because he fears jail, but because he loves her. That is the "delight" of
the converted heart toward God's law.

---

### Q11. How may true believers be identified?

"By their fruits ye shall know them. Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord,
Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My
Father which is in heaven." Matt. 7:20, 21.

**Answer:** Profession is nothing without possession. A verbal claim to
"believe" is insufficient if the life contradicts the confession.

1.  **Fruit as Evidence:** Fruit does not make the tree alive; the life of the
    tree produces the fruit. Similarly, good works do not save us, but a saved
    person will naturally produce good works.
2.  **Doing the Will of God:** Jesus emphasizes that entry into the kingdom is
    for "he that doeth the will of My Father." This is not salvation by works,
    but salvation _that works_. Genuine faith always leads to obedience (James
    2:17).
3.  **Investigative Judgment:** In the final judgment, our lives (fruits) will
    testify whether our faith was genuine or a counterfeit. God judges by the
    secrets of the heart as revealed in the life.

[ILL] If you walk into an orchard and see a tree with a sign that says "Apple
Tree," but it is covered in thorns and has no apples, you know the sign is a
lie. A Christian is identified not by the "sign" they wear (church membership),
but by the fruit they bear (character).

---

### Q12. What is the fruit of the Spirit?

"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." Gal. 5:22, 23.

**Answer:** When the Holy Spirit controls the life, these character traits
appear naturally.

1.  **Singular Fruit:** The word "fruit" is singular, suggesting that all these
    virtues are part of one clustered whole—the character of Christ. You cannot
    have true spiritual "faith" without "love," nor "peace" without "temperance"
    (self-control).
2.  **Against Such There is No Law:** These traits are the very definition of
    law-keeping. "Love is the fulfilling of the law" (Romans 13:10). When these
    fruits are present, the law of God is being kept from the heart.
3.  **Temperance:** This includes self-control in all things—appetite, passion,
    and speech. It is a vital part of Righteousness by Faith, as the body is
    brought into subjection to the sanctified mind (1 Corinthians 9:27).

**Definition:**

- **Temperance:** The control of the will, under the power of the Holy Spirit,
  over the appetites and passions.

[ILL] Light passing through a prism breaks into a rainbow of colors—red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, etc. The "fruit of the Spirit" is like white light; when it
shines through a human life, it breaks into the beautiful colors of love, joy,
peace, patience, etc.

---

### Q13. Can one bear this fruit of himself?

"As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more
can ye, except ye abide in Me." John 15:4.

**Answer:** This is the core of Righteousness by Faith.

1.  **Absolute Dependence:** A branch has no life of its own. If you cut it off
    from the trunk, it cannot produce a single grape; it withers and dies. In
    the same way, a human being cannot produce one act of genuine, unselfish
    righteousness apart from Christ.
2.  **Abiding:** The secret of victory over sin is not trying harder, but
    "abiding" closer. It is a constant, moment-by-moment dependence on Jesus. We
    receive His life through prayer and the Word.
3.  **Imparted Righteousness:** As the sap flows from the vine to the branch,
    the Holy Spirit flows from Christ to us, imparting His character. We live,
    yet not we, but Christ liveth in us (Galatians 2:20).

[ILL] A diver underwater depends entirely on the air hose connected to the
surface. If he pinches the hose to try and "breathe on his own," he dies. We
must remain connected to Christ, our life-source, every moment to live the
Christian life.

### Q14. What was the experience of the two disciples who talked with Jesus on the way to Emmaus?

"And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked
with us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?" Luke 24:32.

**Answer:** Communion with Christ through His Word produces a spiritual vitality
described as "burning" within the heart.

1.  **The Word Illumined:** Jesus "opened to them the Scriptures." The Bible is
    the channel through which Christ speaks to the soul. When the Spirit
    illuminates the Word, it ceases to be dry text and becomes the living voice
    of God.
2.  **The Burning Heart:** This represents the warming of the affections, the
    revival of hope, and the kindling of love for God. It is the antidote to the
    "lukewarm" condition of Laodicea (Revelation 3:15-16).
3.  **Christ Centered:** Notice that they burned when He showed them things
    "concerning Himself" (Luke 24:27). All Scripture finds its center in the
    cross and the ministry of Christ.

[ILL] If you place a cold iron poker into a blazing fire, it soon becomes hot
and glows red. It takes on the nature of the fire. When we spend time in the
fire of God's Word, our cold hearts are warmed and begin to glow with His love.

---

### Q15. What blessed experience may all have?

"If any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will
sup with him, and he with Me." Rev. 3:20. "And the peace of God, which passeth
all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." Phil.
4:7.

**Answer:** The final evidence of acceptance is the indwelling presence of
Christ.

1.  **The Divine Knock:** Revelation 3:20 is addressed to the church of
    Laodicea—the church of the judgment hour. Christ is standing at the door of
    the heart, knocking. He does not force entry; the will (the door) must be
    opened by the individual.
2.  **Intimate Fellowship:** To "sup" (eat) together implies the deepest
    friendship and communion. It suggests that Christ sustains us (He is the
    Bread of Life) and that He delights in our fellowship.
3.  **Peace that Guards:** Philippians 4:7 describes peace as a garrison (a
    military guard). The peace of God stands sentry over our hearts and minds,
    protecting us from the assaults of fear and doubt. This is the heritage of
    the servants of the Lord.

**Conclusion:** Acceptance with God is not a feeling, but a fact based on God's
promise to the repentant believer. By surrendering the will, trusting in
Christ's merit, and abiding in Him daily, we have the assurance that we are His
children.

[ILL] Holman Hunt painted a famous picture of Jesus knocking at a door
(illustrating Rev 3:20). When asked why there was no handle on the outside of
the door, the artist replied, "The handle is on the inside." Only you can open
your heart to Jesus. When you do, He promises to come in.
