### Q1. What commission did Christ give to His disciples?

"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Matt. 28:19.

**Answer:** Before His ascension to the heavenly sanctuary, Christ gave the
church its marching orders. This commission involves three distinct steps:

1.  **Teaching (Making Disciples):** The gospel must first reach the mind and
    heart. The word translated "teach" here actually means "make disciples."
2.  **Baptizing:** The public sign of entrance into the covenant of grace.
3.  **Instruction:** Teaching them to observe all things Christ commanded (v.
    20).

The command is to baptize in the "name" (singular) of the threefold
Godhead—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. This signifies that the new believer is
being adopted into the family of God and placed under the protection and power
of the entire heavenly trio.

- **Term Definition:** _Disciple:_ A learner and follower of Jesus Christ who
  accepts His teachings and imitates His life.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a soldier enlisting in an army. First, he must
understand the cause (teaching). Then, he puts on the uniform and takes the oath
(baptism). Finally, he undergoes training to learn the discipline of the service
(ongoing instruction). One cannot be a soldier of the Cross without enlisting
publicly under the banner of Prince Emmanuel.

### Q2. Before one is baptized, what is it necessary for him to do?

"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized everyone of you." Acts 2:38.

**Answer:** The first prerequisite for baptism is **repentance**. Baptism is not
a magic ritual that washes away sin mechanically; it is an outward sign of an
inward change. Without repentance, immersion in water is simply a bath.

True repentance involves a sorrow for sin and a turning away from it (Proverbs
28:13). It is the recognition that our past life has been out of harmony with
God and a decided choice to abandon the old ways.

- **Term Definition:** _Repentance:_ A godly sorrow for sin that leads to a
  change of mind and a turning away from transgression (2 Corinthians 7:10).

---

### Q3. Toward whom must men repent?

"Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and
faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ." Acts 20:21.

**Answer:** Paul presents two essential movements of the soul in conversion:

1.  **Repentance toward God:** We must repent toward the Father because He is
    the Lawgiver. It is His law we have broken. When a citizen breaks a law,
    they must answer to the government that established the law.
2.  **Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ:** While the Law condemns the sinner,
    it cannot save him. Therefore, we must look to Jesus, the Saviour, who paid
    the penalty for our transgression.

We do not repent toward Jesus and have faith in the Law; rather, we repent
toward the Lawgiver (God) for breaking His law, and we have faith in the
Redeemer (Jesus) who covers that breach with His blood.

- **Term Definition:** _Faith:_ Trusting fully in the merits of Christ’s
  sacrifice for forgiveness and in His power to restore us to obedience (Hebrews
  11:1).

---

### Q4. Why should one repent toward God?

"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23.

**Answer:** Repentance is necessary because every human being has failed to meet
the standard of God's character. The "glory of God" is His character (Exodus
33:18–19; 34:6–7), and His character is transcribed in His law. Because "all
have sinned," all are under the sentence of death unless rescued. We repent
toward God because we have violated the constitution of His universe.

- **Term Definition:** _Sin:_ "Sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John
  3:4). It is lawlessness and rebellion against God's government.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a man drives recklessly and crashes into a neighbor’s
house, he has offended the neighbor, but he has also broken the law of the
state. He needs the neighbor’s forgiveness (reconciliation) but he also stands
guilty before the judge (the law). Sin is a crime against the government of
Heaven.

---

### Q5. What effect does the law have upon sinners in conversion?

"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin
revived, and I died." Rom. 7:9.

**Answer:** The moral law acts as a mirror (James 1:23–25). Before Paul
understood the spiritual depth of the Ten Commandments, he felt "alive"—that is,
spiritually secure and self-righteous. But when the Holy Spirit applied the law
to his conscience ("when the commandment came"), he saw the hideousness of his
sin.

- **"Sin revived":** He realized how active and deadly sin was in his nature.
- **"I died":** His self-confidence was shattered. He realized he was
  spiritually dead and helpless. This "death" to self-righteousness is the first
  step toward true life in Christ.

---

### Q6. Why is it necessary for one to die in the sense here represented?

"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin
might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin." Rom. 6:6.

**Answer:** The gospel is not a modification of the old life; it is the end of
the old life and the beginning of a new one. The "old man"—the carnal nature
that loves sin and hates God—must be "crucified."

- **Victory over Sin:** The purpose of this death is "that the body of sin might
  be destroyed" and that we should "not serve sin."
- **Righteousness by Faith:** God does not just forgive the past; He breaks the
  power of enslaved habits. Through the indwelling Christ, the believer is no
  longer a slave to sin (Romans 6:14). We cannot walk in newness of life while
  keeping the "old man" alive.

- **Term Definition:** _Crucified with Christ:_ The spiritual experience of
  surrendering one's will completely to God, accepting Christ's death as one's
  own (Galatians 2:20).

---

### Q7. If one thus dies, how is he to live again?

"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him."
Rom. 6:8.

**Answer:** The Christian life is a resurrection life. Having surrendered the
old life of selfishness to the grave, the believer now lives by the power of
Christ's life. "Christ liveth in me" (Galatians 2:20). This is not merely a hope
for the future resurrection of the body, but a present reality of living by the
"power of His resurrection" (Philippians 3:10) today. We live _with_ Him—in
constant communion and dependence.

---

### Q8. If one is dead with Christ, what should be done with him?

"Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was
raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in
newness of life." Rom. 6:4.

**Answer:** When a person has died physically, the next step is burial.
Spiritual death to sin demands a spiritual burial. Baptism is that burial.

- **The Symbol:** The water represents the grave.
- **The Reality:** Going under the water symbolizes the end of the old life of
  sin. Coming up out of the water symbolizes the resurrection to "newness of
  life."
- **Sanctification:** This "newness of life" is the experience of
  sanctification—walking in obedience by the power of the Holy Spirit.

**[ILL] Illustration:** We do not bury people alive. If a person is buried, it
is understood they are dead. Likewise, baptism has no meaning if the candidate
is still "alive" to the love of the world and sin. We must die to self _before_
we are buried in the water.

---

### Q9. How is one to be buried in baptism?

"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be
also in the likeness of His resurrection." Rom. 6:5.

**Answer:** The mode of baptism must fit the meaning. The verse uses the imagery
of being "planted" or united in the _likeness_ of His death and resurrection.

- **Likeness of Death:** Christ died and was buried in the tomb. Only total
  immersion in water adequately symbolizes a burial. Sprinkling or pouring water
  on the head does not look like a burial.
- **Likeness of Resurrection:** Rising from the watery grave pictures Christ
  rising from the tomb.
- **Biblical Mode:** The Greek word _baptizo_ means to dip, plunge, or immerse.
  The physical act must align with the spiritual truth it proclaims.

---

### Q10. For what purpose is one baptized?

"Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the
faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead." Col. 2:12.

**Answer:** Baptism is an act of faith. It is not the removal of dirt from the
body (1 Peter 3:21), but the "answer of a good conscience toward God."

1.  **Faith in God's Operation:** The believer trusts that just as God raised
    Jesus from the dead, He will now raise this soul from the death of sin to
    the life of righteousness.
2.  **Declaration:** It is a public testimony that the believer accepts Christ's
    death as their atonement and Christ's life as their power.

- **Term Definition:** _Atonement:_ The work of reconciliation. In baptism, we
  accept the death of the Sacrifice (Jesus) in our place.

---

### Q11. When baptized into Christ, what does one put on?

"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." Gal.
3:27.

**Answer:** Baptism is the formal entry into a union with Jesus. To "put on
Christ" refers to the robe of His righteousness.

- **Justification (Imputed Righteousness):** We are covered by His merits, so
  when the Father looks at us, He sees the perfection of His Son.
- **Sanctification (Imparted Righteousness):** We put on His character, His
  humility, and His love in our daily walk. This verse implies a change of
  identity. The baptized believer now bears the family name of heaven
  (Christian) and is to reflect the family likeness.

**[ILL] Illustration:** In the parable of the wedding feast, the king provided a
wedding garment for every guest (Matthew 22:11–12). To refuse the garment was an
insult to the king. In baptism, we publicly put on the wedding garment of
Christ’s righteousness, hiding our own filthy rags of sin.

---

### Q12. What question did the eunuch ask after Philip had preached unto him Jesus?

"And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch
said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?" Acts 8:36.

**Answer:** The Ethiopian eunuch, after hearing the prophecy of Isaiah 53
explained by Philip, recognized Jesus as the Messiah. His immediate response was
a desire to identify with this Saviour. This shows that baptism should follow
plainly upon the acceptance of the gospel. He did not ask to join a social club;
he asked for the rite that would seal him to the Saviour he had just found.

---

### Q13. What reply did Philip make?

"And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest." Acts
8:37.

**Answer:** This is the crucial condition for baptism: **Belief with all the
heart.**

- **Not Head Knowledge Only:** It is not enough to merely agree with a creed.
  The heart—the will and affections—must be engaged.
- **No Infant Baptism:** An infant cannot believe with all their heart. They
  cannot repent or understand the gospel. Therefore, biblical baptism is
  reserved for those who have reached the age of accountability and can make a
  conscious decision for Christ.

---

### Q14. In administering the ordinance, where did Philip take the candidate?

"And they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he
baptized him." Acts 8:38.

**Answer:** The text is geographically precise to teach us the method.

1.  **"Down into the water":** If sprinkling were sufficient, Philip could have
    brought water in a cup. The fact that both men had to go _into_ the water
    serves as strong evidence that immersion was the only mode practiced by the
    apostles.
2.  **"Up out of the water" (v. 39):** This confirms the total immersion of the
    candidate.

---

### Q15. How many modes of baptism are recognized in the Bible?

"One Lord, one faith, one baptism." Eph. 4:5.

**Answer:** Paul declares there is only **one** valid baptism. In the context of
the early church and the meaning of the Greek word _baptizo_, this "one baptism"
is immersion of a repentant believer. The variety of modes seen today
(sprinkling, pouring, rose petals, flags) are human inventions that obscure the
beautiful symbolism of death, burial, and resurrection found in the "one
baptism" of Scripture.

---

### Q16. How many were added to the church on the day of Pentecost?

"Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there
were added unto them about three thousand souls." Acts 2:41.

**Answer:** The Holy Spirit's outpouring resulted in a massive harvest. Three
thousand people made a decision, "gladly received" the gospel, and were
baptized. This demonstrates that baptism is the door into the visible church. We
are not saved _by_ the church, but those who are saved are added _to_ the church
to serve and grow together.

---

### Q17. How many disciples were together on that occasion to engage in the work?

"And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said (the
number of names together were about a hundred and twenty)." Acts 1:15.

**Answer:** With 120 disciples present (Acts 1:15) and the twelve apostles (Acts
2:14), there were ample hands to baptize 3,000 people in a single day. This
highlights the "priesthood of all believers" (1 Peter 2:9). The authority to
baptize comes from Christ's commission, and in this instance, the disciples
worked together to harvest the souls the Spirit had convicted. It was a
corporate work of the body of Christ.

---

### Q18. Should one wait long after conversion before being baptized?

"And now why tarriest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins,
calling on the name of the Lord." Acts 22:16.

**Answer:** Ananias’ words to the converted Saul (Paul) convey urgency. Once a
person has repented and believed, there is no virtue in delay.

- **"Wash away thy sins":** Water cannot remove the guilt of sin—only the blood
  of Jesus does that (1 John 1:7). However, baptism is the public, formal
  acceptance of that cleansing. It is the "signing of the deed" that God has
  drawn up.
- **"Calling on the name of the Lord":** This indicates prayer and dependence.
  Baptism is a prayer for a clear conscience (1 Peter 3:21).

---

### Q19. What is necessary before baptism?

"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved,. but he that believeth not
shall be damned." Mark 16:16.

**Answer:** The order established by the Master is: **Believe -> Baptized ->
Saved.** One cannot reverse this order. One cannot be baptized first (as an
infant) and then believe later to make it valid. The refusal to believe brings
condemnation ("damned"), showing that faith is the saving instrument. Baptism is
the test of obedience for the one who claims to believe.

---

### Q20. After the release of Paul and Silas from jail, how many of the jailer's family submitted to baptism?

"And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes, and was
baptized, he and all his, straightway." Acts 16:33.

**Answer:** The entire household ("all his") was baptized. This is often cited
by those favoring infant baptism, but the context (seen in the next questions)
proves otherwise. The jailer washed the apostles' physical wounds (stripes), and
the apostles washed the jailer’s spiritual wounds through baptism. It was done
"straightway"—immediately—even at midnight, showing the importance of the
ordinance.

---

### Q21. To how many of them had Paul and Silas preached?

"And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his
house." Acts 16:32.

**Answer:** Before baptizing them, Paul and Silas preached the Word to **all**
in the house. This implies that everyone in the household was old enough to
listen, understand, and process the "word of the Lord." Faith comes by hearing
(Romans 10:17).

---

### Q22. How many of them believed the truth that was preached?

"And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and
rejoiced, believing in God with all his house." Acts 16:34.

**Answer:** The record states clearly that the jailer believed "with all his
house." Since infants cannot believe in God or rejoice in truth, we conclude
there were no infants baptized here. This was a household of believers who had
all heard the word and all accepted it by faith.

---

### Q23. After baptism, what should one do?

"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where
Christ sitteth on the right hand of God." Col. 3:1.

**Answer:** Baptism is the starting line, not the finish line. Having been
"risen with Christ" from the watery grave, the believer's focus shifts to the
heavenly sanctuary.

- **The Heavenly Focus:** Christ is "on the right hand of God" interceding for
  us. Our minds should be fixed on His work there.
- **Sanctification:** We are to leave the lowlands of sin and breathe the
  atmosphere of heaven. As Christ ministers in the sanctuary above to blot out
  our sins, we on earth are to cooperate by overcoming sin through His grace.

- **Term Definition:** _Intercession:_ Jesus standing before the Father as our
  High Priest, applying the benefits of His sacrifice to our individual cases.

---

### Q24. By what does one gain a knowledge of sin?

"I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law
had said, Thou shalt not covet." Rom. 7:7.

**Answer:** Why do we need baptism? Because we have sinned. How do we know we
have sinned? Because of the Law. The Ten Commandments define the boundaries of
right and wrong. Paul specifically quotes the tenth commandment ("Thou shalt not
covet"), showing that the law reaches the thoughts and intents of the heart.
Without the Law, there is no conviction of sin; without conviction, there is no
need for a Saviour; without a Saviour, baptism is meaningless. The Law points us
to the water of baptism for cleansing.

---

### Q25. What brought death into the world?

"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so
death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Rom. 5:12.

**Answer:** Adam’s transgression opened the floodgates of sin and death. Because
of this, every human being is born with a fallen nature and eventually chooses
to sin. Death is the wages of sin (Romans 6:23). Baptism is the gospel’s answer
to this problem: it acknowledges the death we deserve (burial in water) and
gives us the life we do not deserve (resurrection with Christ).

---

### Q26. Did death reign all the time between Adam and Moses?

"For until the law, sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is
no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses." Rom. 5:13, 14.

**Answer:** This text establishes the eternal nature of God's law.

- **The Argument:** Paul argues that death reigned from Adam (creation) to Moses
  (Sinai).
- **The Logic:** 1. Death is the result of sin. 2. Sin is not charged
  ("imputed") if there is no law. 3. Since people died between Adam and Moses,
  sin must have been imputed to them. 4. Therefore, God's law existed _before_
  it was written on stone at Sinai. The Law that convinces us of sin today is
  the same Law that governed the universe from the beginning. It reveals our
  desperate need for the cleansing blood of Christ, into which we are baptized.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Gravity existed before Isaac Newton wrote down the
formula for it. Men fell and died from cliffs long before the "law of gravity"
was written in a book. Similarly, God's moral law existed in the very nature of
His government long before He wrote it on tables of stone for Moses. It is this
eternal standard that drives us to the Cross.
