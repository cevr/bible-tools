## Slide 1 – Q1: Creation and Purpose
- Question: For what were all things created?
- Key Text: Revelation 4:11 – “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **Created for His Pleasure:**
  - “Pleasure” signifies God’s will. We exist to bring joy to God by reflecting His character.
- **The Basis of Authority:**
  - Because He created us, God has a sovereign right to our service. Refusing Him glory denies the purpose of our existence.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the heavenly sanctuary, the twenty-four elders cast their crowns before the throne.
  - If sinless angels acknowledge the Creator’s merit, redeemed sinners should do so even more.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Master Sculptor:**
  - Imagine a sculptor creating a vessel specifically to hold pure water.
  - If the vessel refuses to hold water or fills itself with mud, it fails the sculptor's design.
  - **Lesson:** Man was created to be a vessel of God’s glory. When we are filled with self, we defeat the purpose of creation.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Man’s Natural Condition
- Question: Does man in his natural condition carry out the design of God?
- Key Text: Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (The Nature of Sin)
- **Missing the Mark:**
  - To sin is to deviate from God's design of love and holiness.
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **Falling Short of Glory:**
  - God’s glory is His character (Exodus 34:6 – “And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth...”).
  - Man was made in God’s image, but sin has marred that image.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Universal Need)
- **Universal Failure:**
  - The text says “all.” No human being naturally possesses the righteousness required to stand in God's presence.
- **Definitions:**
  - **Sin:** Any deviation from the known will of God.
  - **Glory of God:** His character of perfect love, justice, and mercy.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Short Ladder:**
  - If a ladder is too short to reach the roof of a burning building, it does not matter if it is one foot short or ten feet short.
  - A short ladder cannot save.
  - **Lesson:** All human efforts to reach heaven by works fall short. We need a bridge—a Saviour—to span the gulf.

## Slide 8 – Q3: God’s Initiative
- Question: While in this state, what did the Lord do for us?
- Key Text: Romans 5:8 – “But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (The Atonement)
- **God’s Initiative:**
  - God did not wait for us to become good. He demonstrated His love while we were rebels.
- **The Cost:**
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
  - Christ took the penalty upon Himself at the cross (the antitypical Altar of Burnt Offering).

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Substitution)
- **The Great Exchange:**
  - Christ took our death so we might have His life.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”
- **Definition—Atonement:**
  - Romans 5:11 – “And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Rebel Soldier:**
  - A rebel soldier is captured and sentenced to death.
  - The King steps down from the throne, takes the soldier's place, and dies in his stead.
  - **Lesson:** Christ did not die for friends, but for enemies, to make them friends.

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Source of Repentance
- Question: Through what is man permitted to come to repentance?
- Key Text: Romans 2:4 – “Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points
- **A Gift, Not a Purchase:**
  - We cannot generate repentance on our own. It is the goodness of God that melts the heart.
  - Acts 5:31 – “Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.”
- **The Danger of Delay:**
  - Ignoring God's patience hardens the heart.
- **Definition—Repentance:**
  - A godly sorrow for sin that leads to a turning away from it (2 Corinthians 7:10).

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration
- **Sun and Ice:**
  - A block of ice does not melt itself to invite the sun.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Christ in the Believer
- Question: What does Christ become to those who accept Him?
- Key Text: Colossians 1:27 – “To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Indwelling)
- **Christ In You:**
  - Righteousness by Faith is Christ dwelling in the heart by the Holy Spirit.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me...”
- **Sanctuary Parallel:**
  - Just as the Shekinah glory dwelt in the Most Holy Place, Christ desires to dwell in the soul temple of man.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Key Points (Sanctification)
- **The Hope of Glory:**
  - Jesus within is the only hope of restoring the image of God.
- **Definition—Sanctification:**
  - The process where the Spirit imparts Christ's nature to the believer.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”

## Slide 18 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Glove and the Hand:**
  - A glove is lifeless and cannot work on its own.
  - When a living hand is inserted, the glove moves and acts.
  - **Lesson:** The glove takes no credit; the hand does the work. So it is with "Christ in you."

## Slide 19 – Q6: Results of Grace
- Question: When this grace is received, what will it cause one to do?
- Key Text: Romans 5:2 – “By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.”

## Slide 20 – Q6: Key Points
- **Standing in Grace:**

- **Rejoicing in Hope:**
  - We are not anxious about being "good enough" because we trust in the One who is.
- **Access:**
  - Through our High Priest, we have direct access to the Father.

## Slide 21 – Q6: Illustration
- **Sand vs. Granite:**
  - A man on a sliding pile of sand lives in fear of falling.
  - A man on a granite cliff overlooks the storm with confidence.
  - **Lesson:** Grace is the granite cliff.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Conditions of Security
- Question: On what condition are we to remain members of Christ's household?
- Key Text: Hebrews 3:6 – “But Christ as a son over His own house: whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.”

## Slide 23 – Q7: Key Points
- **Conditional Security:**
  - We remain part of His house *if* we hold fast.
  - Faith is a daily gripping of Christ’s hand, not just a one-time event.
- **Confidence:**
  - Trust in His ability to keep us.
  - Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy...”

## Slide 24 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Rope:**
  - A drowning man is thrown a rope.
  - He is safe as long as he holds the rope.
  - **Lesson:** The strength of the rope saves him, not his own muscle, but he must not let go.

## Slide 25 – Q8: Thanksgiving
- Question: How often, and for how much, should we render thanks to God?
- Key Text: Ephesians 5:20 – “Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 28 – Q9: Thanksgiving in Trials
- Question: The "all things" of the last text, includes our trials and disappointments. Why should we give thanks for them?
- Key Text: Romans 8:28 – “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”

## Slide 29 – Q9: Key Points
- **The Purpose of Trials:**
  - God overrules difficulties to refine our faith.
  - 1 Peter 1:7 – “That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth... might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.”
- **The Ultimate Good:**
  - The "good" is conformity to Christ's image (Romans 8:29).

## Slide 30 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Weaver:**
  - The weaver sees the upper side of the tapestry (the pattern).
  - The observer underneath sees only knots and tangles.
  - **Lesson:** In this life, we see the knots (trials); God sees the pattern He is weaving (character).
