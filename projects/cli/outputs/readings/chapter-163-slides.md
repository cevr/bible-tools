## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Supreme Position

- Question: Who is exalted above all that exists?
- Key Text:
  - Psalm 97:9 – “For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth; thou art exalted
    far above all gods.”
  - Psalm 57:5 – “Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
    above all the earth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **Supreme Authority:**
  - Jehovah, the self-existent God, holds the position of supreme authority.
  - While angels or earthly rulers may be called “gods” in a lower sense, God is
    the “Most High.”
- **Universal Glory:**
  - His glory fills the heavens and the earth; it is not confined to human
    temples.
- **Nature of Exaltation:**
  - God is not exalted due to pride.
  - He is exalted because He _is_ goodness, truth, and life (1 John 4:8).
- **Definition: Sovereignty**
  - The supreme power and authority of God to rule over His creation (1
    Chronicles 29:11–12).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Sun and the Candle:**
  - Imagine a small candle claiming to be the brightest light in the universe.
  - When the sun rises, the candle’s flame becomes invisible in the brilliance
    of the day.
  - **Lesson:** Humans and angels are flickering lights; God is the Sun. To
    exalt Him is simply to recognize reality.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Basis of God’s Rule

- Question: Why should God be thus exalted?
- Key Text: Nehemiah 9:6 – “Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made
  heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things
  that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them
  all; and the host of heaven worshipeth thee.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Creator Rights:**
  - Because God made us, we belong to Him (Psalm 100:3).
  - As the Designer, only He knows how we function best.
- **Sustainer of Life:**
  - We do not have life inherent in ourselves; we borrow breath from Him moment
    by moment.
  - If He withdrew His Spirit, all flesh would perish (Job 34:14–15).
- **Angelic Response:**
  - The “host of heaven” worships Him because they see His infinite power is
    matched by infinite love.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Creation and Re-creation:**
  - Because God is the Creator, He is the only One capable of _re-creation_.
  - The gospel is the power of God to create a clean heart in a sinner (Psalm
    51:10 – “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
    me.”).
  - We exalt Him by stopping our own efforts to “fix” our nature and allowing
    the Creator to sanctify us.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Author and the Character:**
  - A character in a book owes its name, description, and existence entirely to
    the author.
  - It would be absurd for a character to say, “I made myself.”
  - **Lesson:** We are the characters in history; God is the Author of life.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Exaltation of Christ

- Question: How high is Christ exalted?
- Key Text: Acts 5:30–31 – “The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew
  and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince
  and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **From Cross to Throne:**
  - The world gave Christ a cross of shame; the Father gave Him a throne of
    glory.
- **Two Titles:**
  - **Prince:** He has the authority to command our allegiance.
  - **Saviour:** He uses His authority to rescue us from sin.
- **Purpose of Exaltation:**
  - He is not exalted to crush sinners, but to give repentance and forgiveness.
  - He ministers for us in the heavenly courts.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Application (Sanctuary)

- **The Heavenly High Priest:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the priest bore the names of Israel on his
    breastplate.
  - Jesus is now exalted in the true Heavenly Sanctuary to plead the merits of
    His blood for us (Hebrews 7:25).
  - **Definition: Atonement**
    - The work of reconciliation bringing God and man back into oneness through
      Christ’s sacrifice and ministry (Romans 5:11).

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Lifeguard on the Tower:**
  - A lifeguard sits on a high tower, not to look down on people with arrogance,
    but to see who is drowning.
  - The high position provides the best vantage point to save.
  - **Lesson:** Christ is raised high to be a Saviour to all who call upon Him.

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Paradox of the Kingdom

- Question: Who will be exalted by God?
- Key Text: Matthew 23:12 – “And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased;
  and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Law of the Kingdom:**
  - In the world, men scramble to reach the top.
  - In Christ’s kingdom, greatness is measured by service and humility (Mark
    10:43–44).
- **The Pattern of Christ:**
  - We must have the “mind of Christ,” who humbled Himself to death and was
    _therefore_ exalted (Philippians 2:5–9).
- **The Divine Action:**
  - The text says “shall be exalted.” We do not lift ourselves up; God does it
    in His time.

## Slide 14 – Q4: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Necessity of Emptiness:**
  - We cannot receive Christ’s righteousness while we feel “rich and increased
    with goods” (Revelation 3:17).
  - Justification is only for the one who admits he is a sinner in need of a
    Saviour (Luke 18:13–14).
- **Definition: Justification**
  - God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is accounted righteous
    because of Christ’s merits, not their own works (Romans 3:24).

## Slide 15 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Empty Cup:**
  - You cannot fill a cup that is already full of liquid.
  - If a man is full of pride and self-sufficiency, the water of life cannot
    enter.
  - **Lesson:** We must be emptied before we can be filled with the Spirit.

## Slide 16 – Q5: The Prerequisite

- Question: What, then, must precede exaltation?
- Key Text: Proverbs 15:33 – “The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom;
  and before honor is humility.”

## Slide 17 – Q5: Key Points

- **Preparation for Service:**
  - God cannot entrust spiritual power to a proud heart.
  - Example: Moses spent 40 years in the desert learning humility before leading
    Israel.
- **The Fear of the Lord:**
  - True humility comes from seeing the greatness of God.
  - When we see God as He is (Isaiah 6:1–5), we see ourselves correctly, and
    humility follows naturally.

## Slide 18 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Skyscraper Foundation:**
  - To build a tall skyscraper, builders must first dig deep into the earth.
  - The higher the building, the deeper the foundation.
  - **Lesson:** Humility is the painful digging process necessary to support the
    weight of glory God wishes to bestow.

## Slide 19 – Q6: The Source of Humility

- Question: What is the foundation of true humility?
- Key Text: 1 Corinthians 13:4 – “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity
  envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.”

## Slide 20 – Q6: Key Points

- **Nature of Love (Charity):**
  - True humility is self-forgetfulness born of love.
  - Pride looks inward; love looks outward to God and others.
- **Not “Puffed Up”:**
  - Pride is empty wind; love is substantial.
  - Love does not need to brag because it finds satisfaction in blessing others.
- **Definition: Sanctification**
  - The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit making the believer holy in character,
    learning to love as Christ loves (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

## Slide 21 – Q7: The Model Believer

- Question: What is necessary, therefore, in order that we may obtain
  exaltation?
- Key Text: Matthew 18:4 – “Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this
  little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”

## Slide 22 – Q7: Key Points

- **Teachability:**
  - A child acknowledges ignorance and is willing to be taught. The proud think
    they already know.
- **Dependence:**
  - A child trusts parents for food and safety. The believer must live in
    dependence on the Father.
- **Simplicity:**
  - To humble oneself as a child means to accept God’s Word without debate and
    trust His promises.

## Slide 23 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Father’s Hand:**
  - When crossing a dangerous street, a child does not rely on his own speed.
  - He grips his father's hand tightly.
  - **Lesson:** The “greatest” Christian is the one who grips Christ’s hand the
    tightest.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Source of True Strength

- Question: In what only should we desire to be exalted?
- Key Text: Psalm 89:17 – “For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy
  favor our horn shall be exalted.”

## Slide 25 – Q8: Key Points

- **Glory of Their Strength:**
  - The believer does not claim strength of their own, but says, “The Lord is my
    strength” (Psalm 27:1).
- **The Horn:**
  - Symbolizes power and victory.
  - Our victory is found only “in Thy favor.”
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - We have no righteousness of our own.
  - **Definition: Imputed Righteousness** – The credit of Christ’s perfect life
    given to the believer (Romans 4:22–24).

## Slide 26 – Q9: Protection from Pride

- Question: What means does God sometimes employ to keep us from self
  exaltation?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 12:7 – “And lest I should be exalted above measure
  through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the
  flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above
  measure.”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points

- **Danger of Privilege:**
  - Great spiritual privilege often brings a high risk of spiritual pride.
- **Paul’s Thorn:**
  - A painful, humiliating affliction permitted by God.
  - God did not send it, but allowed it for a redemptive purpose.
- **God’s Purpose:**
  - To keep Paul dependent on grace.
  - Paul learned: “My grace is sufficient for thee” (2 Corinthians 12:9).

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **Ballast in the Ship:**
  - A ship with tall sails must carry heavy weights (ballast) deep in the hull.
  - Without ballast, the ship would capsize in the wind.
  - **Lesson:** Our trials are the ballast that keeps us upright when the winds
    of success blow.

## Slide 29 – Q10: Victory Over Pride

- Question: By what means may self exaltation be overcome?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 10:4–5 – “For the weapons of our warfare are not
  carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; Casting
  down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the
  knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
  of Christ.”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points

- **Spiritual Weapons:**
  - Willpower and psychology (“carnal weapons”) cannot destroy pride.
- **The Battleground:**
  - The battle is fought in the mind (“imaginations,” “thoughts”).
  - Pride is a stronghold built against the knowledge of God.
- **Captive Thoughts:**
  - Victory requires bringing _every_ thought into obedience to Christ.
  - We must instantly surrender proud thoughts to the Holy Spirit.

## Slide 31 – Q11: The Armor of God

- Question: What are these weapons of our warfare?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:13–17 (Summary) – The girdle of truth, the breastplate
  of righteousness, the sandals of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of
  salvation, the sword of the Spirit.

## Slide 32 – Q11: Key Points

- **Christ Our Armor:**
  - **Breastplate of Righteousness:** Christ’s righteousness covering the heart.
  - **Shield of Faith:** Trusting God’s promises to quench doubt.
  - **Sword of the Spirit:** The Word of God (“It is written”).
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Like the priest’s garments, we are clothed in Christ.
  - We walk in the light (Truth) and eat the bread (Word), connecting to the
    Power Source in the heavenly sanctuary.

## Slide 33 – Q12: The Origin of Evil

- Question: What caused Satan's fall, and brought into existence all the sin and
  evil which are in the world?
- Key Text: Isaiah 14:12–14 – “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son
  of the morning! ... For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into
  heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the
  Most High.”

## Slide 34 – Q12: Key Points

- **The Five “I Wills”:**
  - Lucifer’s fall began with a focus on self (“I”) rather than God.
- **Coveting God’s Place:**
  - He wanted God’s position and power, not God’s character of love.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Self-exaltation introduced rebellion into the universe.
  - All sin today roots back to this original pride.

## Slide 35 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Planet and the Sun:**
  - Lucifer was like a glorious planet designed to reflect God’s light.
  - He desired to become a sun—to generate his own light and have others orbit
    him.
  - **Result:** In trying to become a sun, he became a wandering star reserved
    for darkness (Jude 13).

## Slide 36 – Q13: The Man of Sin

- Question: What is the most striking example of self exaltation found in the
  annals of history?
- Key Text: 2 Thessalonians 2:3–4 – “...that man of sin be revealed, the son of
  perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or
  that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing
  himself that he is God.”

## Slide 37 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Prophetic Identity:**
  - This “mystery of iniquity” operates within the church (“temple of God”).
  - Identified by Bible students as the Papal system claiming God’s prerogatives
    on earth.
- **Exaltation Above God:**
  - How does a power exalt itself _above_ God? By claiming authority to change
    God’s immutable law.
  - Attempting to change the Sabbath (Daniel 7:25) implies authority superior to
    the Lawgiver.
- **Contrast:** Christ came to magnify the law (Isaiah 42:21); the antichrist
  spirit seeks to change it.

## Slide 38 – Q14: The Final Judgment

- Question: What will be the end of self exaltation?
- Key Text:
  - Matthew 23:12 – “Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased.”
  - Isaiah 2:12 – “For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that
    is proud and lofty, and upon everyone that is lifted up; and he shall be
    brought low.”

## Slide 39 – Q14: Key Points

- **Universal Abasement:**
  - At the Second Coming, human pride, titles, and power will mean nothing.
- **End of Sin:**
  - Since sin began with pride, the eradication of sin requires the total
    destruction of pride.
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
  - Now is the time to afflict (humble) our souls so sins may be blotted out
    (Leviticus 23:27–29).

## Slide 40 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Mountain and the Valley:**
  - Prophecy describes the Lord’s coming: “Every valley shall be filled, and
    every mountain and hill shall be brought low” (Luke 3:5).
  - Mountains represent proud earthly powers; valleys represent the humble.
  - God’s judgment levels the ground.

## Slide 41 – Q15: The Reward of the Humble

- Question: When will the humble be exalted?
- Key Text: Psalm 37:34 – “Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall
  exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see
  it.”

## Slide 42 – Q15: Key Points & Conclusion

- **Wait on the Lord:**
  - Now is the time for service and cross-bearing; exaltation is future.
- **Inherit the Land:**
  - “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth” (Matthew 5:5).
- **Final Victory:**
  - When sin is destroyed, God lifts up His people to be kings and priests
    (Revelation 1:6).
  - This honor is based entirely on His grace, not our ambition.
