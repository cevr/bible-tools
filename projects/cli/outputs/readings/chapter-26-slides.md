## Slide 1 – Q1: Set Apart for Priesthood

- **Question:** By what act were Aaron and his sons set apart for the
  priesthood?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 30:30 – "And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and
  consecrate them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest's office."

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Consecration)

- **The Meaning of Anointing:**
  - In Scripture, oil is a symbol of the Holy Spirit.
  - Just as oil was poured on Aaron, the Spirit was poured on Christ (Acts
    10:38) and is promised to believers.
- **Consecration Defined:**
  - To "consecrate" means to set apart strictly for holy use.
  - A consecrated person is no longer common property; they belong exclusively
    to God.
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - Priests had to be washed and anointed to serve in the holy place.
  - We must be washed by Christ’s blood (**Justification**) and anointed by His
    Spirit (**Sanctification**).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Cup in the Kitchen:**
  - A cup used for drinking water is useful.
  - If that same cup is used to mix poison or hold trash, it becomes unfit.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Consecration is taking a vessel misused by sin, washing it, and setting it
    on the King's table.
  - The believer says, "This cup is now reserved only for the King's wine."

## Slide 4 – Q2: God’s People Today

- **Question:** What are God's people now called?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 2:9 – "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal
  priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the
  praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light."

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Priesthood of Believers)

- **A Royal Priesthood:**
  - We are "royal" because we belong to the King of kings.
  - We are "priests" because we have direct access to the Father through Jesus
    (Hebrews 4:16).
  - We need no human mediator; Christ is our High Priest in the heavenly
    sanctuary.
- **A Peculiar People:**
  - Means a special, private possession or treasure.
  - God values His people as His supreme treasure.
- **A Holy Nation:**
  - Holiness is being separated from the world’s customs and dedicated to God’s
    laws.

## Slide 6 – Q3: Before the Call

- **Question:** What were they before being a "chosen" people?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 2:10 – "Which in time past were not a people, but are
  now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
  mercy."

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points (Conversion)

- **The State of the Lost:**
  - Before Christ, we were "not a people."
  - Sin isolates us from God (Isaiah 59:2) and the covenant of promise.
  - Without God, we have no true identity or eternal future.
- **The Power of Adoption (Justification):**
  - God declares the repentant sinner to be His own child.
  - We are accepted in the Beloved.
- **Identity Shift:**
  - We move from being orphans of sin to sons and daughters of the King
    immediately upon saving faith.

## Slide 8 – Q4: Called Out

- **Question:** Out of what were they called?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 2:9 – "That ye should show forth the praises of Him who
  hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light."

## Slide 9 – Q4: Key Points (From Darkness to Light)

  - Represents ignorance of God, confusion of sin, and hopelessness.
- **Into Marvelous Light:**
  - God is light (1 John 1:5).
  - We are called to see His truth and the beauty of His law.
- **The Purpose:**
  - To "show forth" His praises.
  - A consecrated life reflects the "Sun of Righteousness" (Malachi 4:2) into a
    dark world.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Trapped Miner:**
  - Imagine a miner trapped in a sunless cavern for years.
  - A rescuer breaks through and leads him to the surface at noon.
  - The contrast is blinding and overwhelming.
- **The Application:**
  - This is the soul's experience when the "Three Angels' Messages" break upon
    the mind.
  - It reveals Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary and His law of love.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Consecrated for Whom?

- **Question:** For whom are the godly consecrated?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 4:3 – "But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is
  godly for himself: the Lord will hear when I call unto him."

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points (Set Apart)

- **"For Himself":**
  - God saves us because He loves us and wants us for His own.
  - He desires to dwell in us (Exodus 25:8).
- **Godliness (Sanctification):**
  - To be "godly" means to be like God.
  - The Holy Spirit restores the moral image of God in man.
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - Temple furniture was "set apart" exclusively for God.
  - Our minds, bodies, and talents must be reserved for God's glory, not lent to
    the enemy.

## Slide 13 – Q6: Public Acceptance

- **Question:** By what act does one publicly take on the Lord Jesus?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:27 – "For as many of you as have been baptized into
  Christ have put on Christ."

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points (Baptism)

- **Putting on Christ:**
  - We acknowledge our own life is filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).
  - We accept Jesus’ perfect life as our title to heaven (**Imputed
    Righteousness**).
- **Death and Resurrection:**
  - Baptism is a grave; we die to the old self.
  - We rise to "newness of life" (Romans 6:4).
- **A Change of Uniform:**
  - Like a soldier putting on a uniform, we declare we have defected from
    Satan's army to serve the cross.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Definitions (Justification)

- **Justification:**
  - God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of
    Christ's merits (Romans 3:24).
- **Imputed Righteousness:**
  - The credit of Christ's perfect life given to the believer.

## Slide 16 – Q7: The Desire to Serve

- **Question:** When one comes to Christ, what should he desire to do?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 11:28, 29 – "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
  heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me;
  for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points (The Yoke)

- **The Yoke of Service:**
  - A yoke couples two oxen together.
  - Jesus invites us to get in the yoke _with_ Him; He bears the heavy load.
- **Learning of Him:**
  - Consecration requires a teachable spirit.
  - We must learn His meekness and lowliness.
- **Rest for the Soul:**
  - We stop trying to earn salvation by works.
  - We trust His finished work while serving Him out of love.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Oxen Plowing:**
  - If a young ox fights the yoke, it chafes its neck and gets exhausted.
  - If it yields to the lead ox, the work is easy.
- **The Lesson:**
  - When we fight God’s will, life is hard.
  - When we surrender, His "commandments are not grievous" (1 John 5:3).

## Slide 19 – Q8: Willingness to Sacrifice

- **Question:** If one would come to Christ to be a learner or disciple of Him,
  what must he be willing to give up?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:26 – "If any man come to me, and hate not his father,
  and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his
  own life also, he cannot be my disciple."

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Supreme Loyalty)

- **The Meaning of "Hate":**
  - Biblical idiom for "loving less" by comparison (Matthew 6:24).
  - Our love for Christ must be supreme.
- **The First Commandment:**
  - "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3).
  - Family, reputation, or life become idols if placed before God.
- **Loyalty Tested:**
  - If family asks us to disobey a plain command (e.g., breaking the Sabbath),
    loyalty to Christ must prevail.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Conditions of Discipleship

- **Question:** How emphatic does the Saviour, then, make the conditions of
  one's discipleship?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:33 – "So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh
  not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Forsaking All)

- **Stewardship vs. Ownership:**
  - We renounce _ownership_ of everything.
  - Money, time, and talents are held in trust for God.
- **The Transaction of Grace:**
  - We are not "buying" heaven.
  - We are emptying our hands of trash to receive the Kingdom's gold.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot hold a known sin and Jesus at the same time.
  - Faith requires total surrender of the will.

## Slide 23 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Diamond and the Glass:**
  - A child holds a sharp piece of broken glass, thinking it is a jewel.
  - The father offers a real diamond but says, "You must drop the glass to take
    this."
  - We must drop the world to take hold of Christ.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Effect on Relationships

- **Question:** What does he say the acceptance of Christ will cause in some
  cases?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 10:35, 36 – "For I am come to set a man at variance
  against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in
  law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own
  household."

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Division)

- **The Inevitable Conflict:**
  - Light and darkness cannot coexist.
  - A consecrated life (e.g., keeping the Sabbath) often irritates the
    conscience of the disobedient.
- **A Test of Faith:**
  - Will we love Jesus more than the approval of relatives?
- **Endurance:**
  - Respond with patience and prayer, not anger.
  - Aim to win loved ones by a consistent life (1 Peter 3:1).

## Slide 26 – Q11: Hatred from the World

- **Question:** Why does all the world unite to hate the true Christian?
- **Key Text:** John 15:19 – "If ye were of the world, the world would love his
  own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the
  world, therefore the world hateth you."

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points (Two Kingdoms)

- **Two Kingdoms in Conflict:**
  - The Kingdom of Satan (the world) vs. the Kingdom of Christ.
- **Opposing Spirits:**
  - World: Self-exaltation, force, pride.
  - Christ: Self-sacrifice, service, humility.
- **The Friction:**
  - A holy life is a silent rebuke to sin.
  - The world feels condemned and reacts with hatred.

## Slide 28 – Q12: Union with Christ

- **Question:** How closely does Christ unite His followers to Himself?
- **Key Text:** John 15:5 – "I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth
  in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can
  do nothing."

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Vital Connection:**
  - A branch only lives while connected to the vine.
  - If the connection breaks, the branch withers.
- **Total Dependence:**
  - "Without Me ye can do nothing."
  - We cannot generate one righteous thought apart from Christ.
- **The Sap of the Spirit:**
  - The Holy Spirit flows from Christ (Vine) to us (branches), producing fruit.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Branch:**
  - A branch does not "try hard" to produce grapes.
  - It simply _abides_ (stays connected).
- **The Lesson:**
  - Christian fruit comes not by legalistic straining.
  - It comes by maintaining a living, daily connection with Jesus.

## Slide 31 – Q13: The Test of Possession

- **Question:** If one does not bear the same fruit as Christ, what may be a
  safe conclusion?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:9 – "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if
  so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit
  of Christ, he is none of his."

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points (The Test)

- **Profession vs. Possession:**
  - Names on church books or outward Sabbath keeping are not enough.
  - If the Spirit of Christ (love, humility, obedience) is absent, we do not
    belong to Him.
- **The Warning:**
  - Guards against "cheap grace."
  - We cannot be saved while living in willful sin.

## Slide 33 – Q14: The Fruit of the Spirit

- **Question:** But if one has the Spirit of Christ, what fruit will he bear?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:22, 23 – "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
  peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance:
  against such there is no law."

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points (Character)

- **Fruit, not Fruits:**
  - It is one singular cluster; you cannot have true faith without temperance.
  - It is the wholeness of God’s character.
- **Sanctification (Imparted Righteousness):**
  - Christ’s own character lived out in our flesh.
- **No Condemnation:**
  - The law condemns sin, but these virtues _are_ the keeping of the law.

  took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And
  being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto
  death, even the death of the cross."

## Slide 39 – Q16: Key Points (Obedience)

- **Self-Abnegation:**
  - Lucifer sought to be "like the Most High."
  - Christ took the form of a servant. Consecration is the death of pride.
- **Obedience unto Death:**
  - Jesus obeyed even when it cost Him His life.
- **Our Standard:**
  - We do not ask, "Is this convenient?"
  - We ask, "Is this God's will?" and obey regardless of cost.

  world?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:4 – "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and

  having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."

## Slide 43 – Q18: Key Points (Victory Over Sin)

- **The Power of the Promise:**
  - God's Word has creative power.

## Slide 45 – Q19: Key Points (Sanctuary & Health)

- **The Body Temple:**
  - Just as God dwelt in the Sanctuary, the Spirit desires to dwell in us.
- **Health Reform:**

  - The cost paid at Calvary shows our infinite value.
- **Not Your Own:**
  - We have no right to do as we please with our lives.
- **Glorify God:**
  - Reveal His character in how we treat our bodies (health) and use our minds.

  hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
  mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy
  upon us."

## Slide 52 – Q22: Key Points (Surrender)

- **Waiting on the Lord:**
  - Like a servant watching the master's hand for the slightest signal.
  - We keep our eyes fixed on Jesus (Hebrews 12:2).
- **Total Dependence:**
  - Looking to Him for daily bread, instruction, and grace.
- **The Conclusion:**
  - Consecration is a moment-by-moment attitude: "Lord, what will You have me to
    do?"
