## Slide 1 – Q1: Defining Faith

- **Question:** Give the Bible definition of faith.
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:1 – “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for,
  the evidence of things not seen.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **Not a Feeling:** Bible faith is not a guess, a feeling, or a "leap in the
  dark." It is a tangible spiritual reality.
- **Substance (Assurance):**
  - The Greek word _hypostasis_ implies a title deed, foundation, or ground of
    confidence.
  - Faith treats God's future promises as a present reality.
- **Evidence (Proof):**
  - Faith acts as the "eye of the soul" (2 Corinthians 4:18 – “While we look not
    at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen...”).
  - It provides evidence for the invisible reality of God and the heavenly
    sanctuary.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Hand of Faith:**
  - Faith is the hand that lays hold of the merits of Christ.
  - We cannot physically see our names in the Book of Life or see Christ's
    righteousness covering us.
  - Faith accepts the "substance" of Christ’s perfect life as our own (Romans
    4:5 – “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
    ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”).

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Title Deed:**
  - Imagine holding a title deed to land in a distant country you have never
    visited.
  - You have never seen the land, but the deed is the "substance" or legal proof
    of ownership.
  - You can sell it or build on it because the deed makes it real.
- **Lesson:** The Word of God is the title deed; faith accepts it as fact.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Believing God

- **Question:** When coming to God, what is it necessary to believe concerning
  Him?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:6 – “But without faith it is impossible to please
  Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a
  rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **That He Is (Existence):**
  - We must believe in a personal, living God who created and sustains all
    things.
  - This is the step away from atheism and idolatry.
- **That He Is a Rewarder (Character):**
  - It is not enough just to believe He exists; even devils believe that (James
    2:19).
  - We must trust His benevolent character—that He is a Father waiting to bless,
    not a tyrant waiting to condemn.
- **Definition of Grace:**
  - The unmerited favor of God toward the undeserving (Ephesians 2:8 – “For by
    grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift
    of God”).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Child and the Father:**
  - A child asking a father for bread will approach with fear if they believe
    the father is cruel.
  - If the child knows the father is loving and generous, they come with
    confidence.
- **Lesson:** Our view of God's character determines how we approach the throne
  of grace.

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Evidence of Existence

- **Question:** How may we know that God exists?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 19:1 – “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the
  firmament showeth His handiwork.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **Two Great Books:** God reveals Himself through Scripture and Nature.
- **General Revelation:**
  - The intricate design of the universe testifies to a Designer (Romans 1:20).
- **Law and Order:**
  - Nature obeys physical laws; the moral universe obeys God's moral law.
  - The order of the heavens declares God is not the author of confusion (1
    Corinthians 14:33).
- **The Sabbath Connection:**
  - The Sabbath is the memorial of creation (Exodus 20:11).
  - Keeping the Sabbath acknowledges the God whose handiwork the heavens
    declare.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Pocket Watch:**
  - If you found a ticking watch in a field, you would not assume wind and rain
    assembled it by accident.
  - The gears and springs prove there was a watchmaker.
- **Lesson:** The universe is far more complex than a watch; it proves there is
  a Creator.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Obtaining Faith

- **Question:** How may we have faith in Him?
- **Key Text:** Romans 10:17 – “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by
  the word of God.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **Source of Faith:**
  - Faith is not manufactured by emotions; it is generated by contact with God's
    Word.
  - God's Word carries the power to fulfill itself (Isaiah 55:11).
- **Intellect and Will:**
  - We "hear" (understand) and choose to accept the Word.
  - Faith grows naturally as we feed on Bible promises.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Just as we receive righteousness as a gift, we receive faith as a gift
    through the Word.
  - Studying the life of Christ produces confidence in God.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Bridge:**
  - A man does not try to "feel" trust before walking on a bridge.
  - He examines the bridge's cables, concrete, and steel.
  - The more he sees the strength of the bridge (the Word), the more his
    confidence (faith) grows.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Value of Promises

- **Question:** Are the promises of God of any value to those who do not believe
  them?
- **Key Text:** Jude 5 – “I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye
  once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of
  Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points

- **Conditional Benefit:** God's promises are absolute, but we only benefit if
  we believe.
- **Lesson of Israel:**
  - Delivered from Egypt (Justification) but failed to enter Canaan
    (Glorification) due to unbelief (Hebrews 3:19).
  - They did not believe God could give victory over "giants" (sin).
- **Mixing Faith:**
  - The word preached does not profit unless "mixed with faith" in the hearer
    (Hebrews 4:2).

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Unused Account:**
  - A philanthropist deposits a million dollars in your name.
  - If you do not believe the money is there, you will never write a check.
  - You will live in poverty despite the provision made for you.
- **Lesson:** Unbelief renders God’s infinite resources useless to us.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Object of Faith

- **Question:** In whom must we believe in order to be saved?
- **Key Text:** John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
  Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
  life.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **Believing in a Person:**
  - Saving faith is not just believing a doctrine, but trusting Jesus Christ,
    the Lamb of God.
- **The Great Exchange:**
  - We give Him our sins; He gives us His righteousness.
  - This is the essence of the Atonement (reconciliation).
- **From Death to Life:**
  - Sin causes separation (death).
  - Faith in Christ reconnects the soul to the Source of life.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: Evidence of Forgiveness

- **Question:** When we believe on the Son of God, what evidence do we have that
  our sins are forgiven?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 5:10 – “He that believeth on the Son of God hath the
  witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar; because he
  believeth not the record that God gave of His Son.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Record:**
  - Evidence is found in God's Word, not our shifting emotions.
  - If we confess, God _says_ we are forgiven (1 John 1:9).
- **Not Making God a Liar:**
  - To doubt forgiveness after confession is to call God a liar.
- **The Witness:**
  - When we accept the Word as true, the Holy Spirit plants assurance in the
    heart.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Judge's Pardon:**
  - If a prisoner receives a signed pardon from a judge, he is free.
  - He may _feel_ guilty or afraid, but his feelings do not change the fact of
    the pardon.
  - Freedom depends on the "record" (signature), not the emotion.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: Nature of the Witness

- **Question:** What is the nature of this witness?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:16 – “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our
  spirit, that we are the children of God.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **Cooperative Witness:**
  - The Holy Spirit interacts with our renewed mind/spirit.
- **Adoption:**
  - Assures us we are no longer slaves to fear, but adopted children of the
    King.
- **Harmony:**
  - When our conscience consents to God's law and trusts His promises, the
    Spirit confirms, "Yes, you are God's child."

---

## Slide 24 – Q9: Result of the Witness

- **Question:** When we have this witness, what does it do for us?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace
  with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points

- **Peace:**
  - The immediate fruit of justification is peace with God.
  - Justification ends the war caused by sin (Isaiah 59:2).
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - Christ is our Peace Offering.
  - He restores fellowship and communion between the worshiper and God.
- **Rest:**
  - We stop trying to earn heaven by painful efforts and rest in Christ's
    finished work.

---

## Slide 26 – Q10: Conditions for Forgiveness

- **Question:** Upon what conditions has God promised the forgiveness of sin?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
  forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points

- **Confession:**
  - Requires genuine repentance and turning away from specific sins.
  - We cannot hold onto known sin and receive forgiveness simultaneously.
- **Walking in the Light (1 John 1:7):**
  - We must obey the truth God reveals.
  - Rejecting new light (e.g., Sabbath, health reform) is choosing darkness.
- **Two-Fold Cleansing:**
  - **Forgive:** Justification (Imputed Righteousness).
  - **Cleanse:** Sanctification (Imparted Righteousness/Transformation).

---

## Slide 28 – Q11: Believing Before Seeing

- **Question:** Does the Bible warrant one in believing that he receives what he
  asks for, before he is conscious of possessing it?
- **Key Text:** Mark 11:24 – “Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye
  desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Order of Faith:**
  - We do not receive then believe; we believe then receive.
- **Claiming the Promise:**
  - When praying according to God's will (e.g., for victory), we claim it
    immediately.
  - "I have it because God promised it."
- **Faith vs. Sight:**
  - Waiting for proof before believing is walking by sight.

## Slide 30 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Online Order:**
  - When you buy a product online, you pay and receive a confirmation.
  - You do not have the box yet, but you "believe that you receive it."
  - Faith trusts God’s delivery system.

---

## Slide 31 – Q12: Developing Patience

- **Question:** How may one learn to develop patience in waiting on God?
- **Key Text:** James 1:3 – “Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh
  patience.”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Key Points

    14:12).

---

## Slide 33 – Q13: Faith in Affliction

- **Question:** When in affliction, what ought all to believe?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:28 – “And we know that all things work together for
  good to them that love God.”

## Slide 34 – Q13: Key Points

- **God's Sovereignty:**
  - God overrules sickness, loss, and disappointment for our spiritual good.
- **The Goal is Character:**
  - The "good" is to be "conformed to the image of His Son" (Romans 8:29).
  - Affliction burns away the dross of selfishness.

## Slide 35 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Weaver:**
  - A tapestry looks like a tangled mess of dark threads from the back.
  - The weaver knows the dark threads are needed to make the beautiful design on
    the front.
  - Faith trusts the Weaver's design even when we only see the tangle.

---

## Slide 36 – Q14: Faith Without Works

- **Question:** What kind of faith is that which is unaccompanied with works?
- **Key Text:** James 2:26 – “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so
  faith without works is dead also.”

## Slide 37 – Q14: Key Points

- **Dead Faith:**
  - Faith that does not lead to obedience is a counterfeit.
- **Harmony of Scripture:**
  - Paul: Justified by faith _apart_ from works (preventing boasting).
  - James: Saving faith _always_ produces works (preventing cheap grace).
- **The Vital Sign:**
  - Obedience is the breath of living faith.
  - True faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).

---

## Slide 38 – Q15: Disobedience and Confidence

- **Question:** If one knows the he is constantly disobeying God, can he have
  real living faith?

- **Confidence Destroyed:**
  - We cannot approach God with confidence while willfully rebelling.
  - A guilty conscience separates us from God.
- **Condition of Answered Prayer:**
  - We receive answers _because_ we keep His commandments.
  - This is the relationship of a loyal child to a loving Father.
- **Victory is Possible:**
  - Through the indwelling Christ, we can do what is pleasing in His sight.

## Slide 40 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Disloyal Employee:**
  - An employee who steals from the register cannot confidently ask the boss for
    a favor.
  - Actions destroy the ground of confidence.
  - Sin destroys our confidence in God (Isaiah 59:2).

---

## Slide 41 – Q16: The Doubtful Mind

- **Question:** How much may one hope to receive, who asks with a doubtful mind?
- **Key Text:** James 1:7 – “Let not that man think that he shall receive
  anything of the Lord.”

## Slide 42 – Q16: Key Points

- **Double-Mindedness:**
  - The man who wavers between faith and the world receives nothing.
- **Stability Required:**
  - We cannot pray for victory while planning to sin.
  - We must look to God with a "single eye," depending totally on Him.

---

  meet the Saviour on the stormy sea?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 14:31 – “And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand,
  and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst
  thou doubt?”

## Slide 44 – Q17: Key Points

- **Shifting Focus:**

  - He sank when he looked at the wind and waves (circumstances).
- **The Lesson:**
  - Looking at our sins or weaknesses leads to despair.
  - We must fix our eyes on Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith (Hebrews
    12:2).
- **Christ's Grip:**
  - Even when faith failed, Jesus "caught him." Our Saviour is great.
