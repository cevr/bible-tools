## Slide 1 – Q1: Grace Before Law

- **Question:** When God was about to speak the law to Israel, of what did He
  tell Moses to remind them?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 19:3, 4 – “And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord
  called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house
  of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the
  Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Grace & Relationship)

- **Grace Precedes Law:**
  - God delivered Israel from Egypt _before_ giving them the Ten Commandments.
  - Salvation is a free gift; obedience is the response of love (1 John 4:19 –
    “We love him, because he first loved us.”).
- **Dependence on God:**
  - The “eagles' wings” imagery shows total dependence.
  - Just as an eaglet is carried, the believer is carried by divine power, not
    human effort (Isaiah 40:31 – “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
    their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles...”).
- **The Goal is Relationship:**
  - God brought them “unto Myself.”
  - The purpose of salvation is restoring the broken relationship between God
    and man (John 17:3 – “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee
    the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Firefighter Analogy:**
  - Imagine a firefighter rescuing a child from a burning building.
  - He does not shout rules from the ground (“Climb down properly and I will
    save you”).
  - He climbs up, grabs the child, and carries them to safety first.
  - Only _after_ the child is safe does he teach them fire safety.
- **Spiritual Lesson:** God saved Israel from the slavery of Egypt before giving
  them the law of liberty.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Proposed Covenant

- **Question:** What covenant did He propose to make with them?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 19:5, 6 – “Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice
  indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me
  above all people: for all the earth is Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom
  of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto
  the children of Israel.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Condition & Promise)

- **The Condition:**
  - “If ye will obey My voice.”
  - God’s character is order and love; walking with Him requires harmony with
    His law.
- **The Promise:**
  - **Peculiar Treasure:** A special property belonging to God.
  - **Kingdom of Priests:** A priest stands between God and the world to
    minister salvation. Israel was to evangelize the nations (Deuteronomy 4:6 –
    “Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding
    in the sight of the nations...”).
- **The Holiness:**
  - **Sanctification:** To be set apart for holy use.
  - God desires a people who reflect His holiness (1 Peter 2:9 – “But ye are a
    chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar
    people...”).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Definition (Sanctification)

- **Sanctification:**
  - The process by which the Holy Spirit cleanses the believer from sin and sets
    them apart for God’s service.
  - It results in a character that reflects Christ.
- **Scripture:**
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification...”
  - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 – “...God hath from the beginning chosen you to
    salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Defining a Covenant

- **Question:** What is a covenant?
- **Definition:** “A mutual agreement of two or more persons or parties, in
  writing and under seal, to do or to refrain from some act or thing; a
  contract.” (Webster)

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (God’s Initiative)

- **Biblical Definition:**
  - A solemn bond between God and man.
  - Unlike human contracts between equals, a divine covenant is initiated
    _solely_ by God.
  - God sets the terms; man accepts by faith.
- **Two Main Covenants:**
  1.  **The Old Covenant:** Ratified at Sinai; characterized by the people's
      promise to obey in their own strength.
  2.  **The New Covenant:** Ratified by the blood of Christ; characterized by
      God's promise to write the law in the heart.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Benefactor:**
  - A wealthy benefactor offers to pay a poor man’s massive debt and build him a
    house.
  - The only request is that the man lives responsibly in it.
  - The poor man does not negotiate the price; he simply accepts the agreement.
- **Spiritual Lesson:** God’s covenant is a gracious offer of life and law. We
  do not negotiate terms; we accept His grace by faith.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The People’s Response

- **Question:** When Moses told the people what the Lord had proposed, what did
  they say?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 19:7, 8 – “And all the people answered together, and
  said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words
  of the people unto the Lord.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (The Old Covenant Failure)

- **Establishing the Old Covenant:**
  - The people’s response ("We will do") established the Old Covenant
    arrangement.
- **Two Fatal Flaws:**
  1.  **Self-Confidence:** They promised to obey in their own strength, not by
      God’s help.
  2.  **Ignorance of Sin:** They did not realize the spiritual depth of the law
      or their own weakness (Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity
      against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can
      be.”).
- **The Result:**
  - This pledge failed quickly; they worshipped the golden calf shortly after.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Definition (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The truth that human beings cannot produce righteousness (right doing) on
    their own.
  - We must receive Christ’s righteousness by faith.
  - **Imputed:** Credited to us to cover our past sins.
  - **Imparted:** Given to us to empower present obedience.
- **Scripture:** Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own
  righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of
  Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Requirement

- **Question:** In the Covenant which the Lord proposed to make with Israel,
  what did He say that they were to do?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 19:5 (first part) – “Now therefore, if ye will obey My
  voice indeed, and keep My covenant...”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Obedience and Relationship)

- **Full Allegiance:**
  - God required them to “obey My voice.”
  - In Scripture, truly hearing implies obeying.
- **Keeping the Covenant:**
  - To keep the covenant is to remain faithful to the relationship God
    established.
  - God cannot be in a covenant of peace with rebellion (Amos 3:3 – “Can two
    walk together, except they be agreed?”).

## Slide 15 – Q6: The Covenant Content

- **Question:** What was His covenant which they were to keep as their part of
  the mutual agreement or covenant between Him and them?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 4:12, 13 – “And the Lord spake unto you out of the
  midst of the fire... And he declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded
  you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of
  stone.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Agreement vs. Law)

- **Distinguishing the Agreement from the Law:**
  - **The Law (Subject Matter):** The Ten Commandments are the eternal standard
    of righteousness. They are holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12).
  - **The Agreement (Old Covenant):** The specific arrangement where the people
    promised to keep this law _to become_ God's people.
- **The Problem:**
  - The problem was not the Ten Commandments.
  - The problem was the people's inability to keep them without a Savior.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Mirror and the Soap:**
  - **The Mirror:** Represents the Ten Commandments. It shows you the dirt on
    your face.
  - **The Old Covenant:** Like a person promising, "I will use this mirror to
    clean my face."
  - **The Reality:** A mirror can show dirt, but it cannot remove it.
- **Spiritual Lesson:** We need the "water of life" (Christ) to cleanse us. The
  law points out sin; only Jesus takes it away.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Relation of Law to Covenant

- **Question:** What relation did the ten commandments bear to the covenant made
  between God and the children of Israel?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 19:5 – “...if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
  covenant...” (Referencing back to the Ten Commandments as the covenant text).

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points (Basis of Government)

- **The Basis:**
  - The Ten Commandments were the **basis** and **condition** of the covenant.
  - God’s government is moral; His agreement with man must be based on moral
    law.
- **Pre-existence:**
  - The principles existed before Sinai (sin existed from Adam).
  - At Sinai, they were codified as the explicit basis for the nation.
- **Standard of Judgment:**
  - Because the law is the transcript of God’s character, it is the standard in
    the judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:13 – “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole
    matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of
    man.”).

## Slide 20 – Q8: Completeness of the Law

- **Question:** After God had spoken His law (the "covenant which He commanded,"
  Ex. 20:3-17), did He continue speaking to the people?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 5:22 – “These words the Lord spake unto all your
  assembly in the mount... with a great voice: and He added no more. And He
  wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points (He Added No More)

- **Completeness:**
  - “He added no more” signifies a perfect moral code.
  - It covers duty to God (first four) and duty to man (last six).
- **Divine Authorship:**
  - Only these words were spoken audibly by God to the multitude and written by
    His finger.
- **Permanence:**
  - Written on stone (enduring) vs. ceremonial laws on parchment (decaying).
  - Psalm 111:7, 8 – “The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
    commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever...”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Instruction to Moses

- **Question:** What was the nature of the instruction afterward given to Moses
  (Ex. 20:22, 23)?
- **Answer Summary:** It was a practical application or explanation of the Ten
  Commandments.

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Statutes and Judgments)

- **Practical Application:**
  - The statutes given to Moses (Exodus 21–23) applied the broad principles of
    the Ten Commandments to daily life.
  - Included civil issues (property, liability) and ceremonial issues (altars).
- **Example:**
  - The command “Thou shalt not kill” was expanded to include liability for a
    dangerous ox (Exodus 21:29).
  - **Lesson:** God cares about the practical details of how we treat our
    neighbors.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Formalizing the Covenant

- **Question:** As reported in Ex. 24:3, Moses told the people all the words of
  the Lord, and they promised to be obedient. What did Moses then do, that there
  might be no misunderstanding?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 24:4, 7 – “And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and
  rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve
  pillars... And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of
  the people: and they said, All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be
  obedient.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Writing & Reading)

- **Recorded:**
  - Moses **wrote** the terms so they were not left to memory.
- **Sacrifice:**
  - He built an **altar**. Sinful man cannot enter a covenant with a holy God
    without sacrifice (pointing to Christ).
- **Intelligent Faith:**
  - He **read** the book to the people.
  - Obedience must be intelligent and based on the Word of God (Romans 10:17 –
    “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”).

## Slide 26 – Q11: Ratification by Blood

- **Question:** When the people had again heard the words of the Lord, and again
  promised obedience (verse 7), what was done to ratify the covenant which had
  thus been made?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 24:8 – “And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the
  people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made
  with you concerning all these words.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points (Atonement & Symbolism)

- **Ratification:**
  - The covenant was sealed by blood.
  - Hebrews 9:22 – “And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
    without shedding of blood is no remission.”
- **Type and Shadow:**
  - Animal blood could not remove sin but pointed to Christ’s blood.
  - **Sanctuary Connection:** The sprinkling of blood signified the people
    entering under "blood protection," a type of the Atonement made by Christ.

## Slide 28 – Q12: A New Covenant Promised

- **Question:** Is the covenant made at Sinai the only covenant which God made
  with Israel?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 31:31, 32 – “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,
  that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house
  of Judah: Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers...
  which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith the
  Lord.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (Failure of the Old)

- **The Distinction:**
  - The New is “not according to” the Old.
- **Why the Old Failed:**
  - Not because God was unfaithful (“I was a husband unto them”).
  - Because the people “brake” their promise.
- **God’s Solution:**
  - The New Covenant is designed to secure what the Old could not: a people who
    actually keep the law through God’s power.

## Slide 30 – Q13: Comparison of Covenants

- **Question:** What comparison does God make between the two covenants?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 8:6 – “But now hath He obtained a more excellent
  ministry, by how much also He is the mediator of a better covenant, which was
  established upon better promises.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points (Better Promises)

- **Old Covenant Promises:**
  - Based on the _people’s_ promise (“We will do”).
  - Weak because human nature is weak.
- **New Covenant Promises:**
  - Based on _God’s_ promise (“I will put,” “I will write”).
  - Strong because God cannot lie (Titus 1:2).
- **Better Mediator:**
  - Jesus Christ is the mediator, able to save to the uttermost (Hebrews 7:25).

## Slide 32 – Q13: Illustration

- **Rowboat vs. Ocean Liner:**
  - **Old Covenant:** Like crossing a stormy ocean in a rowboat you built
    yourself. You promise to row hard, but your strength fails.
  - **New Covenant:** Like boarding a massive Ocean Liner piloted by the
    Captain. The journey relies on the ship's engine, not the passenger's
    muscles.

## Slide 33 – Q14: The Fault

- **Question:** In what respect was the first covenant faulty?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 8:7, 8 – “For if that first covenant had been faultless,
  then should no place have been sought for the second. For finding fault with
  them, he saith...”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points (Human Failure)

- **Where was the fault?**
  - Not in the Law (it is holy).
  - Not in God (He is faithful).
  - The fault was in **“them”** (the people).
- **The Defect:**
  - The agreement relied on human effort.
  - It produced legalism or despair, but not a changed heart.

## Slide 35 – Q15: Promises of the New Covenant

- **Question:** What are the promises of the new covenant?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with
  the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into
  their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and
  they shall be to me a people.”

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points (Internalized Law)

- **Four Key Promises:**
  1.  **Sanctification:** “I will write them in their hearts.” (Obedience
      becomes our nature).
  2.  **Relationship:** “I will be to them a God.”
  3.  **Knowledge:** “All shall know Me.”
  4.  **Forgiveness:** “I will remember their sin no more.” (Hebrews 8:12).
- **The Law Remains:** The New Covenant writes the _same_ law (Ten Commandments)
  on the heart instead of stone.

## Slide 37 – Q16: Order of Fulfillment

- **Question:** Are these promises stated in the order of their fulfillment?
- **Answer Summary:** Jeremiah 31 mentions forgiveness last, though it logically
  precedes the writing of the law in the heart.

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points (Simultaneous Experience)

- **Logical Order of Salvation:**
  1.  Justification (Forgiveness).
  2.  Sanctification (Transformation/Writing on heart).
- **Experiential Reality:**
  - The experience is often simultaneous.
  - When we come to Christ, He forgives us _and_ immediately begins the work of
    transformation.
  - 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
    our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: The Nature of Israel's Promise

- **Question:** In the first covenant, to what was Israel's promise really
  equivalent?
- **Answer Summary:** It was a promise to make themselves righteous.

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points (Self-Righteousness)

- **Filthy Rags:**
  - Isaiah 64:6 – “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
    righteousnesses are as filthy rags...”
- **Helplessness:**
  - Jesus said, “Without Me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5).
- **The Remedy (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - We stop trying to produce righteousness.
  - We receive “The Lord Our Righteousness” (Jeremiah 23:6).
  - Christ’s perfect life is credited to us and lived out in us.

## Slide 41 – Q18: Requirement for Life

- **Question:** Yet what must be done in order to have eternal life?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 19:17 – “...but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
  commandments.”

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points (The Unchanged Standard)

- **The Standard:**
  - God requires perfect obedience. He cannot admit sin into heaven.
- **The Dilemma:**
  - The law requires perfection, but we are sinners.
- **The Solution:**
  - We cannot lower the standard.
  - God provides the righteousness we lack through Christ.
  - Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
    who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 43 – Q19: Hope for Ancient Israel

- **Question:** Then how could ancient Israel have any chance for eternal life?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:15 – “And for this cause he is the mediator of the new
  testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions
  that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the
  promise of eternal inheritance.”

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points (Retrospective Faith)

- **Saved by the New Covenant:**
  - Believers in the OT were saved by the New Covenant (Grace), looking
    _forward_ to the cross.
  - Christ's death covered the "transgressions under the first testament."
- **Type and Antitype:**
  - Sacrifices were an expression of faith in the coming Lamb of God.
  - David prayed for a "clean heart" (Psalm 51:10)—a New Covenant request.

## Slide 45 – Q20: How Good Works Appear

- **Question:** How alone can the good works required by the law be manifested
  in the lives of men?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I
  live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the
  flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
  for me.”

## Slide 46 – Q20: Key Points (Christ in You)

- **Divine Power:**
  - True obedience is not a man trying to look like Jesus.
  - It is Jesus living His life through the man.
  - Philippians 2:13 – “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to
    do of his good pleasure.”
  - Colossians 1:27 – “...Christ in you, the hope of glory.”

## Slide 47 – Q20: Illustration

- **The Glove and the Hand:**
  - A glove cannot pick up a Bible on its own. It has no life.
  - If a hand is inserted, the glove moves and acts.
  - The glove gets the credit for "holding the book," but the hand provides 100%
    of the power.
- **Lesson:** We are the glove; Christ is the hand.

## Slide 48 – Q21: Our Part

- **Question:** In order to have God make us "perfect in every good work to do
  His will," what must be our position?
- **Key Text:** James 4:7 – “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the
  devil, and he will flee from you.”

## Slide 49 – Q21: Key Points (Submission)

- **Yielding:**
  - Romans 6:13 – “...but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive
    from the dead...”
- **The Role of the Will:**
  - We cannot cleanse ourselves, but we can choose to submit to the Cleanser.
  - Victory comes when the will is surrendered to God.

## Slide 50 – Q22: The Law in the New Covenant

- **Question:** What is said of the law in the second, or new covenant?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 31:33 – “...I will put My law in their inward parts,
  and write it in their hearts.”

## Slide 51 – Q22: Key Points (Law Established)

- **Not Abolished:**
  - The New Covenant establishes the law (Romans 3:31).
  - If the law were abolished, there would be nothing to write on the heart.
- **Nature of the Believer:**
  - To have the law in the heart means to love righteousness.
  - The believer obeys because they _want_ to, restoring the image of God.

## Slide 52 – Q23: Ratification of Better Promises

- **Question:** Since no such promise was made in the old covenant... were not
  the promises of the new covenant much "better" than those of the old?
- **Answer Context:** When and how was the second covenant ratified?

## Slide 53 – Q23: Key Points (The Cross)

- **Ratification by Death:**
  - A covenant (testament) is valid only after the death of the testator
    (Hebrews 9:16, 17).
  - Christ’s death on Calvary legally ratified the New Covenant.
- **Prophecy:**
  - Daniel 9:27 – “And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and
    in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to
    cease...”

## Slide 54 – Q24: Benefit to OT Saints

- **Question:** Then how could the Israelites, or any people before the first
  advent, derive any benefit from it?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 6:19, 20 (Context of Hope entering the veil) & Romans
  4:3 – “For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted
  unto him for righteousness.”

## Slide 55 – Q24: Key Points (The Everlasting Covenant)

- **The Everlasting Gospel:**
  - The "New Covenant" is the covenant of grace existing since Eden (Genesis
    3:15).
- **Faith in the Messiah:**
  - Abraham, Moses, and Elijah were saved by the provisions of the New Covenant.
  - They offered sacrifices as an expression of faith in the coming Redeemer.

## Slide 56 – Q25: Confirmation in Abraham

- **Question:** How and in whom was the covenant with Abraham confirmed?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:17 – “And this I say, that the covenant, that was
  confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty
  years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.”

## Slide 57 – Q25: Key Points (The Seed)

- **Confirmed in Christ:**
  - The covenant ("In thy seed shall all nations be blessed") refers to Christ
    (Galatians 3:16).
  - The Gospel of grace is older than the legalism of Sinai.

## Slide 58 – Q26: Abrahamic vs New Covenant

- **Question:** Is there anything in the second covenant that was not in the
  Abrahamic covenant?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:29 – “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's
  seed, and heirs according to the promise.”

## Slide 59 – Q26: Key Points (One Plan of Salvation)

- **Unity of the Covenant:**
  - The New Covenant is the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant.
- **Heirs:**
  - We are heirs of the _same_ promise given to Abraham.
  - From Adam to the last saint, all are saved by grace through faith.

## Slide 60 – Q27: Purpose of Sinai

- **Question:** Then why was the covenant made at Sinai?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no
  flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”

## Slide 61 – Q27: Key Points (The Schoolmaster)

- **Conviction of Sin:**
  - Israel had lost sight of God’s holiness. The law revealed their sinfulness.
- **The Schoolmaster:**
  - Galatians 3:24 – “Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
    Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”
  - The failure of the Old Covenant drove them to despair of self, causing them
    to cry out for a Savior.

## Slide 62 – Q27: Application (Rest of Faith)

- **Conclusion:**
  - **Old Covenant:** "Obey and live." (We try and fail).
  - **New Covenant:** "Live through Christ, and you will obey." (Christ succeeds
    in us).
- **Appeal:**
  - Let us cease from our own works (Hebrews 4:10).
  - Enter into the rest of faith, allowing Jesus to write His law upon our
    hearts today.
