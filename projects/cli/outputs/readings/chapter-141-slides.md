## Slide 1 – Q1: Perseverance in Prayer

- Question: For what purpose did the Saviour utter the parable of the
  importunate widow?
- Key Text: Luke 18:1 – “And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men
  ought always to pray, and not to faint.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Dependence)

- **The Necessity of Perseverance**
  - The Saviour gave this parable to teach us not to give up when answers are
    delayed or circumstances look dark.
- **The Meaning of "Fainting"**
  - To "faint" spiritually is to lose heart, give up hope, or stop communicating
    with God due to discouragement.
- **Constant Dependence**
  - "Always to pray" means maintaining an attitude of unceasing dependence on
    divine power.
  - It is not staying on our knees every moment, but keeping the heart uplifted
    to God for every breath of spiritual life.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (End Time Context)

- **The Time of the End**
  - As we approach the final scenes of earth’s history, the temptation to
    "faint" will increase because iniquity will abound.
  - Matthew 24:12 – “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall
    wax cold.”
- **Standing Firm**
  - To stand in these last days, the believer must maintain a living connection
    with heaven through constant prayer.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Diver’s Air Line**
  - Imagine a deep-sea diver who relies entirely on the air line connecting him
    to the surface.
  - He does not breathe deeply only once a week; he must draw breath moment by
    moment.
  - If the line is cut or if he stops breathing, he perishes.
  - Prayer is the breath of the soul; to stop praying is to faint spiritually
    and die.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Prayer of Faith

- Question: If one asks in the proper way for what he needs, how will his prayer
  be regarded?
- Key Text: Mark 11:24 – “Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye
  desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Faith Defined)

- **A Completed Transaction**
  - God regards the prayer of faith as a transaction already completed in
    heaven.
  - The condition for receiving is believing that God is true to His Word.
- **Defining Faith**
  - Faith is not a mere feeling or emotion; it is taking God at His word.
  - It is trusting that God is able to perform what He has promised.
  - Romans 4:21 – “And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was
    able also to perform.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Applying Faith to Salvation**
  - When a repentant sinner asks for pardon, they must _believe_ that Christ’s
    righteousness is imputed to them immediately.
  - We do not wait to "feel" different; we stand on the promise.
  - 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
    our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
- **Justification**
  - This is the legal declaration that a sinner is righteous through the merits
    of Christ.
  - We receive this status by the same faith described in Mark 11:24—believing
    we have received it because God said so.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Certified Check**
  - If a wealthy, honest friend gives you a check for a large sum, you count
    that money as yours the moment you hold the paper.
  - You make plans based on it before you even go to the bank.
  - God’s promises are His checks.
  - When we pray according to His will, we hold the "check," and faith treats it
    as a reality.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Conditions of Answered Prayer

- Question: What must accompany faith in order that our hearts shall not condemn
  us, and that we may have the things of which we ask?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:22 – “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we
  keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Obedience)

- **Harmony of Will**
  - Prayer brings us into harmony with God's will; it does not force God to do
    our will.
  - We cannot expect blessings if we knowingly rebel against His government.
- **Sin Separates**
  - Cherishing known sin cuts the line of communication.
  - Isaiah 59:2 – “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
    and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Application (Faith and Works)

- **The Fruit, Not the Root**
  - We do not keep commandments to _earn_ answers (legalism).
  - Obedience is the evidence that Christ is dwelling in us.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - True faith always works by love and purifies the soul.
  - Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
    thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”
  - If a person claims faith but refuses to obey, that faith is dead (James
    2:20). The power to obey comes from Christ within.

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Clogged Pipe**
  - A water pipe brings water to a house, just as faith brings blessings from
    God.
  - If the pipe is clogged with mud and debris, the water cannot flow.
  - The source is not empty, but the blockage stops the supply.
  - Known sin is the "clog" that hinders the flow of God's grace.

## Slide 13 – Q4: The Danger of Doubt

- Question: If one does not ask in faith, what does he gain?
- Key Text: James 1:6-7 – “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he
  that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For
  let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Key Points (Wavering)

- **Double-Mindedness**
  - The wavering man often wants God's blessing but still wants to hold onto the
    world.
  - They desire victory over sin, yet secretly love the sin.
- **The Insult of Unbelief**
  - To doubt God is to question His character and make Him a liar.
  - 1 John 5:10 – “He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
    himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he
    believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.”

## Slide 15 – Q4: Application (Judgment)

- **Steadfast Confidence**
  - In the investigative judgment and final atonement, God's people will need
    faith that endures even when they cannot see.
  - We must learn now to trust the Unseen Hand completely.
  - A person not surrendered to God's outcome cannot receive His answer.

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Anchorless Ship**
  - A ship without an anchor or rudder is at the mercy of every wind and wave.
  - It drifts aimlessly and reaches no destination.
  - A prayer without faith is like that ship—it has no stability and never
    reaches the port of Heaven.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Forgiveness

- Question: If prayer is offered while cherishing an unforgiving spirit toward
  another, of what avail is it?
- Key Text: Mark 11:25-26 – “And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have
  ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you
  your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is
  in heaven forgive your trespasses.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: Key Points (Mercy)

- **The Condition of Mercy**
  - We are saved by grace alone, but a heart that has truly received grace will
    show grace to others.
  - Refusing to be a channel of mercy blocks the flow of mercy to ourselves.
- **The Character of Christ**
  - "Righteousness by Faith" means having Christ's character imparted to us.
  - Christ prayed for His enemies: Luke 23:34 – “Then said Jesus, Father,
    forgive them; for they know not what they do.”

## Slide 19 – Q5: Application (Sanctuary)

- **Sanctuary Cleansing**
  - In the Day of Atonement (the judgment), we seek to have our sins blotted
    out.
  - We cannot have our sins removed if we hold onto bitterness.
  - The spirit of unforgiveness is the spirit of Satan, not of Christ.

## Slide 20 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Closed Door**
  - Imagine your heart is a room with one door.
  - If you slam the door shut to keep your enemy out, you also lock Christ out.
  - You cannot shut out your brother and keep God in at the same time.

## Slide 21 – Q6: Prayer in the Home

- Question: What course on the part of husbands or wives will prevent their
  prayers from being answered?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 3:7 – “Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to
  knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as
  being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.”

## Slide 22 – Q6: Key Points (Domestic Relations)

- **The Home as a Symbol**
  - The family on earth is to be a symbol of the family in heaven.
  - Strife, selfishness, or tyranny grieves the Holy Spirit away.
- **Mutual Respect**
  - Peter emphasizes that husband and wife are "heirs together."
  - Spiritually, they are equals before the Cross.
  - Mistreating a spouse is an offense against God, their Father.

## Slide 23 – Q6: Key Points (Peace)

- **The Barrier to Prayer**
  - An agitated, unloving spirit makes the mind unfit for communion with God.
  - Romans 12:18 – “If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably
    with all men.”
- **Illustration: The Out-of-Tune Instrument**
  - If two musicians play a duet but fight and are out of tune, they cannot make
    music.
  - Prayer is the music of the soul.
  - Domestic strife puts the heart out of tune, making harmony with heaven
    impossible.

## Slide 24 – Q7: The Law and Prayer

- Question: What answer will he receive who turns away his ear from hearing the
  law?
- Key Text: Proverbs 28:9 – “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law,
  even his prayer shall be abomination.”

## Slide 25 – Q7: Key Points (Law and Gospel)

- **Rebellion vs. Ignorance**
  - This text refers to those who willfully refuse to listen or obey, not those
    who are ignorant.
  - To claim to love Jesus while despising His Law is a contradiction.
  - The Law is a transcript of Christ's character.
- **The New Covenant**
  - God writes His law in the heart of the believer.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my
    laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”
  - To reject the law is to reject the covenant of grace.

## Slide 26 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Patient and the Prescription**
  - A man asks a doctor for health but throws the prescription in the trash.
  - His request is a mockery because he rejects the method of healing.
  - God’s law is the prescription for moral health.
  - To pray for blessing while rejecting the law is an insult to the Great
    Physician.

## Slide 27 – Q8: What to Pray For (Part 1)

- Question: When the conditions are complied with on which answers to prayer may
  be expected, for what may petitions be offered?
- **Spiritual Cleansing**
  - _Forgiveness/Justification:_ 2 Chronicles 7:14 – “If my people... shall
    humble themselves, and pray... then will I hear from heaven, and will
    forgive their sin...”
  - _Holy Spirit:_ Luke 11:13 – “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good
    gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
    Holy Spirit to them that ask him?”

## Slide 28 – Q8: What to Pray For (Part 2)

- **Power and Wisdom**
  - _Deliverance from Temptation:_ Matthew 6:13 – “And lead us not into
    temptation, but deliver us from evil...”
  - _Wisdom:_ James 1:5 – “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
    giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.”
- **Physical Needs**
  - _Healing:_ James 5:15 – “And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and
    the Lord shall raise him up...”

## Slide 29 – Q8: What to Pray For (Part 3)

- **Intercession**
  - _For Ministers:_ Ephesians 6:19 – “And for me, that utterance may be given
    unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the
    gospel.”
  - _For Rulers:_ Ezra 6:10 – “That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours
    unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.”
- **The Triumph of the Gospel**
  - _Coming of Christ:_ Revelation 22:20 – “...Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”

## Slide 30 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Child and the Parent**
  - A child comes to a parent with a scraped knee (healing), asking for homework
    help (wisdom), asking for lunch (temporal needs), or asking forgiveness.
  - A loving parent is interested in _all_ these things.
  - Our Heavenly Father is interested in every detail of our lives.

## Slide 31 – Q9: When Answers are Delayed

- Question: If an answer does not come at the time and in the manner expected,
  what should be the attitude of the petitioner?
- Key Text: Psalm 37:7 – “Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him...”

## Slide 32 – Q9: Key Points (Trusting Wisdom)

- **God’s Higher Wisdom**
  - We are finite; God is infinite.
  - God often answers our prayers in the way we _would_ wish them answered if we
    could see the end from the beginning.
- **Character Building**
  - The waiting period is a time of sanctification.
  - It tests faith, purifies motives, and teaches reliance on the Giver rather
    than the gift.

## Slide 33 – Q9: Application (The Sanctuary)

- **The Sanctuary Analogy**
  - Just as Israelites waited while the High Priest performed the work in the
    Sanctuary (Luke 1:21), we live in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
  - We wait for Christ to finish His work of judgment and blotting out of sins.
  - Hebrews 10:37 – “For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come,
    and will not tarry.”

## Slide 34 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Sharp Knife**
  - A small child asks his father for a sharp knife, thinking it a shiny toy.
  - The father refuses or gives a spoon instead, out of love and safety.
  - The child may cry, thinking the prayer unanswered.
  - We must trust that God answers according to His wisdom and love, not our
    ignorance.
