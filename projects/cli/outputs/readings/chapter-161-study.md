### Q1. Selfishness is how defined by Webster?

"That supreme self-love or self-preference which leads a person to direct his purposes to the advancement of his own interest, power, or happiness, without regarding those of others."

**Answer:**

This definition strikes at the very root of the great controversy between Christ and Satan. While Webster provides a dictionary definition, the Bible reveals the spiritual origin of this trait. Selfishness—the prioritization of "I" over God and neighbor—began with Lucifer in heaven when he said in his heart, "I will ascend... I will be like the most High" (Isaiah 14:13–14).

In the Christian life, we must understand that selfishness is not merely a bad habit; it is the governing principle of the natural, unrenewed heart (Jeremiah 17:9). It is the direct opposite of God’s character, for "God is love" (1 John 4:8), and true love is self-sacrificing. The entire plan of salvation is designed to eradicate this disease of self-love from the human heart and replace it with the love of Christ.

*   **The Two Principles:**
    *   **Satan’s Principle:** Self-seeking, pride, and the grasping for power (Ezekiel 28:15–17).
    *   **God’s Principle:** Self-renouncing love and service (Mark 10:45).

**[ILL]** Imagine the solar system. If a planet decided to stop orbiting the sun and instead tried to make itself the center of gravity, chaos and destruction would ensue. Similarly, when a human soul shifts its center from God to "Self," spiritual chaos follows. The life is pulled out of its true orbit, leading to collision and ruin.

### Q2. What specific commandments forbids this sin?

"Thou shalt not covet." Ex. 20: 17.

**Answer:**

The tenth commandment is unique among the Decalogue because it deals not with an outward act, but with the secret thoughts and intents of the heart. It forbids the very root of all sin: unlawful desire.

*   **The Spirituality of the Law:** The law is "spiritual" (Romans 7:14). A man may refrain from stealing or killing physically, yet break the law in his spirit through selfishness.
*   **The Root of Action:** Before a man steals (8th commandment), he first covets. Before a man commits adultery (7th commandment), he first lusts. Selfishness is the fountain; specific sins are the streams.
*   **Sanctuary Insight:** In the earthly sanctuary, the law was placed beneath the Mercy Seat. This shows that while the law points out the sin of covetousness (Romans 7:7), only the mercy of God and the blood of Christ can cover the sinner and cleanse the heart from this deep-seated iniquity.

**Definition:**
> **Covetousness:** An intense, inordinate desire for wealth, possessions, or power that belongs to another; fundamentally, it is idolatry because it places the created thing above the Creator (Colossians 3:5).

---

### Q3. Selfishness, then, is contrary to what law?

"If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well." James 2:8.

**Answer:**

The "Royal Law" is the law of the King of kings. It acts as the summary and the spirit of the Ten Commandments. Jesus condensed the law into two great principles: supreme love to God and love to our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:37–40). Selfishness is the direct violation of both.

*   **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
    *   Human effort cannot manufacture this love. We naturally love ourselves supremely.
    *   **Justification:** We are forgiven for our past selfishness through faith in Christ’s blood.
    *   **Sanctification:** The Holy Spirit writes this "Royal Law" on our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). This is the imparting of Christ’s nature, enabling us to actually love our neighbor as ourselves. It is not a work of human will, but the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22).

### Q4. How does it show itself in the conduct of an individual?

(1) As Lovers of Self. "For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous." 2 Tim. 3:2.
(2) As Pleasing Ourselves. "We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves." Rom. 15:1.
(3) As Seeking Our Own. "Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved." 1 Cor. 10:33.
(4) As seeking after Gain. "Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, everyone for his gain, from his quarter." Isa. 56:11.
(5) As Seeking Undue Precedence. "Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom." Matt. 20:21.
(6) As Neglect of the Poor. "But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?" 1 John 3:17.
(7) As Performing Duty for Reward. "The heads thereof judge for reward, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us." Micah 3:11.

**Answer:**

Scripture provides a comprehensive diagnostic list of selfishness. Like a disease with many symptoms, selfishness manifests in various ways depending on the person's circumstances:

1.  **Idolizing the Self:** Putting one's own opinion, comfort, and will above God's Word and the needs of others.
2.  **Lack of Sympathy:** Refusing to bear the "infirmities of the weak." The selfish Christian is impatient with the faults of others, forgetting how much patience God has shown them.
3.  **Mercenary Religion:** As seen in Micah 3:11 and the example of Balaam (Jude 11), this is serving God only for what one can get out of it—be it money, status, or a "fire insurance" policy against hell, rather than out of love for Christ.
4.  **Ambition for Position:** Like James and John (at that time), many seek position in the church or society to feed their ego, rather than to serve.
5.  **Financial Greed:** The text in Isaiah 56 compares selfish leaders to "greedy dogs." This warns against using spiritual positions for material gain.

**Definition:**
> **Sanctification:** The progressive work of God’s grace by which the believer is freed from the power of sin (selfishness) and renewed in the image of God, resulting in a life of obedience and love (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:13).

**[ILL]** A sponge absorbs water and keeps it until it is squeezed. A channel receives water only to pass it on to the thirsty fields. A selfish heart is a sponge; a converted heart is a channel.

### Q5. Show that selfishness is inconsistent with the communion of saints.

"There should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it." 1 Cor. 12:25, 26.

**Answer:**

The Apostle Paul uses the anatomy of the human body to illustrate the church. In a healthy body, no organ exists for itself. The heart pumps blood not for its own sake, but for the whole body; the stomach digests food to nourish every limb.

*   **The Schism of Self:** Selfishness creates "schism" (division). When one member seeks preeminence or refuses to care for another, the spiritual circulation is blocked.
*   **Mutual Dependence:** True Christianity recognizes that we are "members one of another" (Ephesians 4:25). We cannot grow in isolation. The sanctification of one benefits the whole, and the suffering of one should be felt by all.

---

### Q6. Prove that it is contrary to Christian charity, or love.

"Charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil." 1 Cor. 13:4, 5.

**Answer:**

1 Corinthians 13 is the great definition of God's character. The phrase "seeketh not her own" is the pivot point of the chapter.

*   **The Nature of Agape:** The word used for charity is *Agape* (divine love). This is not merely human affection, which often loves only those who love back. *Agape* is an unconditional, self-giving principle.
*   **The Contrast:**
    *   Selfishness seeks to *get*. Love seeks to *give*.
    *   Selfishness is easily provoked when rights are violated. Love "suffereth long."
    *   Selfishness thinks evil (judges motives). Love hopes all things.
*   **The Need for Imputed Righteousness:** When we look at this standard, we see how far we fall short. This drives us to Christ. We need His love *imputed* to us for standing, and *imparted* to us for living.

**Definition:**
> **Charity (Agape):** A self-sacrificing, intelligent, and volitional love that seeks the highest good of others regardless of their worthiness or response; the very nature of God (1 John 4:8).

---

### Q7. How are we admonished with regard to selfishness?

"Let no man seek his own." 1 Cor. 10:24. "Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others." Phil. 2:4. (Read also Zech. 7:9, 10).

**Answer:**

The admonition is a command to shift our focus. The natural human tendency is to look inward—at our own wounds, our own rights, and our own desires. The gospel command is to look outward and upward.

*   **Practical Application:** This means in business dealings, we consider the other person's benefit, not just our profit. In family life, we consider the spouse's preference before our own.
*   **The Law of the Kingdom:** In God's kingdom, to be great is to be a servant (Matthew 20:26–28). We are commanded to adopt the mindset of heaven while living on earth.

---

### Q8. By what means may we overcome selfishness?

"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again." 2 Cor. 5:14, 15.

**Answer:**

This is the core of Righteousness by Faith. We cannot overcome selfishness by selfishly trying to improve ourselves. We are overcome only by the revelation of the Cross.

1.  **The Motivating Power:** "The love of Christ constraineth us." It is not the fear of punishment or the hope of reward that cures selfishness; it is a view of Christ's sacrificial love. When we see what it cost Him to save us, our hearts are broken and melted.
2.  **The Exchange:** The text says "One died for all." In the Sanctuary service, the innocent victim died for the sinner. By faith, we identify with Christ's death. We reckon our old selfish nature dead with Him (Romans 6:6, 11).
3.  **The New Life:** Because He rose again, He lives His life in us. The Christian no longer lives "unto themselves" but "unto Him." It is a displacement: Self goes out, Christ comes in (Galatians 2:20).

**Definition:**
> **Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man through the life, death, and priestly ministry of Jesus Christ. It involves both the payment for sin and the restoration of the sinner to oneness with God (Romans 5:11).

**[ILL]** A piece of iron is cold and hard. If you try to rub it to make it warm, it stays cold. But place it in a furnace, and it becomes glowing hot, taking on the nature of the fire. We cannot remove the coldness of selfishness by working on ourselves; we must dwell in the "furnace" of Christ's love.

---

### Q9. How prevalent is this sin?

"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's." Phil. 2:21.

**Answer:**

Paul’s lament shows that even in the early church, true self-sacrificing laborers were rare. This indicates the universality of the struggle.

*   **The Human Condition:** "All have sinned" (Romans 3:23). The default setting of fallen humanity is self-preservation.
*   **The Need for Revival:** If this was true in Paul's day, how much more in ours? This verse calls for a deep searching of heart in the light of the Sanctuary lampstand (the Holy Spirit). Are we seeking the things of Christ—the salvation of souls and the glory of God—or our own comfort?

---

### Q10. What among other things will help to make the last days a perilous time?

"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous." etc. 2 Tim. 3:1, 2.

**Answer:**

Prophecy warns that the final generation will face a climax of selfishness. The "perilous times" are not just due to wars or disasters, but due to a degradation of character.

*   **The Laodicean State:** The last-day church is described as saying, "I am rich... and have need of nothing" (Revelation 3:17). This is spiritual selfishness—pride in one's own attainments.
*   **The Climax of the Controversy:** As we approach the end, the distinction between those who serve God (love) and those who serve self (sin) will become stark and undeniable (Malachi 3:18).

---

### Q11. Can we be followers of Christ without overcoming selfishness?

"If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me." Matt. 16:24.

**Answer:**

No. Self-denial is not an optional track for "advanced" Christians; it is the entry requirement for discipleship.

*   **Deny Himself:** This does not mean merely denying oneself a luxury (like skipping dessert). It means denying the *authority* of the self. It is to say "No" to the "Ego" as the ruler of the life.
*   **Take Up His Cross:** The cross was an instrument of execution. To take up the cross means to walk to the place of death—death to the old man of sin.
*   **Victory is Promised:** While we cannot do this alone, Christ promises that "he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it" (Matthew 10:39).

---

### Q12. Show that Christ condemned selfishness by His example.

"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich." 2 Cor. 8:9. "For even Christ pleased not Himself." Rom. 15:3.

**Answer:**

Christ's life is the perfect rebuke to selfishness.

1.  **His Pre-existence:** He possessed all the glory of heaven (John 17:5). He was the Commander of the angel hosts.
2.  **His Humiliation:** He did not grasp onto His equality with God (Philippians 2:6–8). He stepped down from the throne to the manger, and from the manger to the cross.
3.  **His Ministry:** "The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister" (Matthew 20:28). Every miracle He performed was for others; He never used His divine power for His own comfort (e.g., refusing to turn stones to bread for Himself in the wilderness).

**Sanctuary Connection:**
The High Priest bore the names of the people on his breastplate (over his heart) and on his shoulders (strength). Christ, our High Priest, carries us on His heart. He lives "to make intercession" for us (Hebrews 7:25), totally devoted to our salvation.

---

### Q13. What should this lead us to do?

"Let everyone of us please his neighbor for his good to edification." Rom. 15:2.

**Answer:**

The contemplation of Christ’s example must lead to action. If we claim to abide in Him, we must walk as He walked (1 John 2:6).

*   **Edification:** This means "building up." Our goal in pleasing our neighbor is not flattery or enabling their sin, but acting for their spiritual good and growth.
*   **The Fruit of the Spirit:** When we are connected to the Vine (Christ), the sap of His self-sacrificing love flows through us to others. We become the hands and feet of Jesus to a dying world.

---

### Q14. What example has the apostle Paul given us in this respect?

"Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved." 1 Cor. 10:33 (1 Cor. 9:19-23).

**Answer:**

Paul, formerly a proud Pharisee, became a slave to all for the sake of the gospel.
*   **Adaptability:** He became "all things to all men"—a Jew to the Jews, weak to the weak—not to compromise truth, but to remove barriers of self so that others might see Jesus.
*   **The Goal:** His motive was not popularity, but "that they may be saved." He was willing to be "accursed from Christ" if it meant his brethren could be saved (Romans 9:3). This is the height of Christ-like love.

---

### Q15. Give some Bible examples of selfishness.

Cain (Gen. 4:9); Nabal (1 Sam. 25:3, 11 ); Haman (Esther); princes (Isa. 1:23); priests (Isa. 56:10, 11); James and John (Mark 10:35-37); the multitude (John 6:24-26).

**Answer:**

Scripture records these lives as warning buoys for us:

*   **Cain:** "Am I my brother's keeper?" Selfishness leads to murder and rejection of responsibility.
*   **Nabal:** His name means "Fool." He refused to share his abundance with David, saying, "Shall I take *my* bread, and *my* water...?" Possession-focused selfishness.
*   **Haman:** Consumed by the need for reverence. He could not enjoy his riches as long as one man (Mordecai) refused to bow. Ego-focused selfishness.
*   **The Multitude:** Followed Jesus not for His words of life, but for the loaves and fishes. Consumer Christianity.

**[ILL]** These examples show that selfishness is a dead-end road. Like a snake eating its own tail, selfishness eventually consumes the person who harbors it.

---

### Q16. What is the condition, and what will be the final punishment, of those who continue to be governed by selfishness?

"Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever." Jude 11-13.

**Answer:**

Jude paints a terrifying picture of the final result of a selfish life.

1.  **The Condition:**
    *   *Spots in feasts:* They contaminate the fellowship of believers.
    *   *Clouds without water:* They promise much but give nothing; they have no rain of the Spirit to bless others.
    *   *Feeding themselves:* Like bad shepherds (Ezekiel 34), they take from the flock but do not feed it.
2.  **The Punishment:**
    *   *Wandering Stars:* A star that breaks free from its orbit wanders into the cold void of space. "The blackness of darkness forever." This is the ultimate result of separating from God (the Sun of Righteousness) to follow the orbit of Self.
    *   *Investigative Judgment:* In the final judgment, the books will be opened. Those who lived only for self will find they have no character that can endure the presence of a holy God. To cling to self is to lose one's soul.

**The Gospel Promise:**
Yet, there is hope. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9). We may bring our selfish hearts to the Sanctuary, lay them on the altar, and receive the heart of Christ in exchange. This is the preparation needed for the coming of the Lord.
