### Q1. What did Christ say to the people of His day concerning the Scriptures?

"Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which testify of Me." (John 5:39)

**Answer:**

The Scriptures referred to here by Jesus are the Old Testament writings, as the New Testament had not yet been written. Christ directs the people not merely to read the surface of the text, but to *search* them diligently.

*   **The Object of the Search:** The Pharisees studied the Scriptures intellectually, thinking that the mere possession of the law gave them eternal life. Jesus corrected this fatal error. The Bible is not an end in itself; it is a map leading to a Person. The Scriptures "testify of Me."
*   **Christ Centered:** The entire Old Testament—its history, its laws, its prophecies, and its temple services—shadows forth the work of Jesus Christ. To read the Bible without finding the Savior is to miss the very source of life.
*   **Life through Faith:** Eternal life is found only in the Son (1 John 5:11–12). When we search the Scriptures, we are looking for the One who can justify us (declare us righteous) and sanctify us (make us holy).

**[ILL] Illustration:**
Imagine a man dying of thirst who possesses a map showing the location of a fresh spring of water. He studies the map, memorizes the topography, and argues about the scale of the drawing, yet he never goes to the spring to drink. Does the map save him? No. The map is valuable only because it leads him to the water. The Bible is the map; Christ is the Living Water. We must not mistake the map for the Water.

### Q2. Do the Scriptures furnish positive evidence that the gospel was known in the patriarchal age?

"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham." (Galatians 3:8)

**Answer:**

Yes, the plan of salvation has been the same in every age. The "Patriarchal Age" refers to the time of the fathers (like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) before the written law of Moses.

*   **One Gospel:** There are not two ways to be saved—one by works in the Old Testament and one by grace in the New. The "gospel" (the good news of salvation from sin) was preached to Abraham.
*   **Justification by Faith:** Paul clearly states that God justifies the heathen (the nations) through *faith*. Abraham is the father of all who believe because he believed God's promise concerning the coming Seed (Christ), and it was counted to him for righteousness (Genesis 15:6; Romans 4:3).
*   **The Lamb of God:** The patriarchs understood the gospel through the sacrificial system. Every time they offered a lamb, they were confessing their faith in the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** The legal act of God declaring a repentant sinner righteous, not because of their own works, but because of the merits of Christ imputed (credited) to them.

### Q3. Does Holy Writ contain unmistakable evidence that the Hebrews were taught the gospel under the former dispensation?

"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them; but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it." (Hebrews 4:2)

**Answer:**

The "former dispensation" refers to the time of the Mosaic law and the wilderness wanderings. The Bible confirms that the Israelites had the gospel preached to them just as we do today.

*   **The Sanctuary as Gospel:** The tabernacle in the wilderness was an object lesson of the gospel.
    *   The **Altar of Burnt Offering** pointed to the Cross (Justification).
    *   The **Laver** pointed to cleansing and regeneration (Titus 3:5).
    *   The **Most Holy Place** pointed to the final blotting out of sin and judgment (Daniel 8:14).
*   **The Necessity of Faith:** Why did this gospel not profit many of them? Because it was not "mixed with faith." They went through the motions of the rituals but did not have faith in the coming Messiah to cleanse their hearts from sin.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Knowledge of the truth alone does not save. The Word must be received into the heart by faith, where it becomes a power to transform the character (1 Thessalonians 2:13). Faith acts as the hand that grasps the power of God to obey.

### Q4. Why did Moses give up the riches of Egypt?

"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward." (Hebrews 11:26)

**Answer:**

Moses made a deliberate choice to identify with the people of God rather than enjoy the "pleasures of sin for a season" (Hebrews 11:25).

*   **The Reproach of Christ:** This verse proves that Christ was present with His people in the Old Testament. Moses understood that to follow God meant to share in the sufferings of the Messiah. He chose spiritual wealth over temporal gold.
*   **Sanctification and Self-Denial:** This is the essence of practical sanctification. It is the choice to separate from the world and its transient glory to walk with Jesus.
*   **The Reward:** Moses looked beyond the immediate struggles to the eternal reward. Faith sees the invisible; it values the approval of God more than the applause of nations.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
If a man holds a handful of colored glass beads but is offered a diamond of immense value, he must drop the beads to grasp the diamond. He cannot hold both. Moses saw the throne of Egypt as mere glass beads compared to the diamond of Christ’s righteousness and the eternal inheritance.

### Q5. Whence came the spiritual meat and drink of the Israelites while in the wilderness?

"And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; And did all eat the same spiritual meat; And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ." (1 Corinthians 10:2–4)

**Answer:**

The physical provisions given to Israel were types (shadows) of spiritual realities.

*   **The Rock was Christ:** The water that flowed from the stricken rock (Exodus 17:6) symbolized the life-giving stream of salvation flowing from the stricken Savior. Christ was "smitten" for our transgressions (Isaiah 53:4–5), and from Him flows the Holy Spirit to quench the thirst of the soul.
*   **Daily Dependence:** Just as Israel could not survive the desert without the manna and the water, the Christian cannot survive the spiritual wilderness of this world without daily feeding on Christ through His Word and prayer.
*   **Christ's Presence:** The text says the Rock "followed them." Christ was not distant; He was the Angel of His presence guiding, protecting, and sustaining them (Isaiah 63:9).

### Q6. What was the chief corner-stone of the faith of both apostles and prophets?

"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone." (Ephesians 2:20)

**Answer:**

The church of God is not a new invention of the New Testament; it is one continuous body of believers built upon one foundation.

*   **Unity of the Bible:** The "apostles" (New Testament) and "prophets" (Old Testament) form a unified foundation because they both testify of the same truth. The Old Testament predicts the Christ; the New Testament reveals Him.
*   **The Corner Stone:** In ancient architecture, the cornerstone set the alignment for the entire building. Every stone had to line up with it. Similarly, every doctrine and every believer must align perfectly with the life, character, and teachings of Jesus.
*   **Our Spiritual House:** We are "lively stones" built up into a spiritual house (1 Peter 2:5). If we try to build our character on human philosophy, feelings, or legalism, the building will collapse. It must rest on the Rock of Ages.

### Q7. What part of the Scriptures did Philip hear a certain eunuch reading?

"And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?" (Acts 8:30)

**Answer:**

The Ethiopian eunuch was reading from the book of Isaiah (specifically chapter 53). This demonstrates that the Old Testament was the Bible of the early church and the primary tool for evangelism.

*   **Seeking Truth:** This man had traveled a great distance to worship, showing his hunger for God. God always responds to the sincere seeker (Jeremiah 29:13).
*   **The Importance of Prophecy:** He was reading prophecy. This tells us that studying the prophetic portions of Scripture is essential for understanding the mission of Jesus.

***

### Q8. When asked if he understood what he was reading, what reply did the eunuch make?

"And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him." (Acts 8:31)

**Answer:**

The eunuch’s response reveals humility and a teachable spirit.

*   **The Need for Teachers:** While the Holy Spirit is the ultimate teacher, God often uses human instruments to explain His Word (Romans 10:14–15). This is the purpose of the church and Bible study—to help one another understand the "deep things of God" (1 Corinthians 2:10).
*   **Spiritual Discernment:** The Bible is not merely literature; it is a spiritual book that must be spiritually discerned (1 Corinthians 2:14). We should always approach the Bible with the prayer, "Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law" (Psalm 119:18).

***

### Q9. What did Philip then do?

"Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus." (Acts 8:35)

**Answer:**

Philip did not preach politics, philosophy, or tradition. He preached Jesus.

*   **Christ in Isaiah:** The passage in question was Isaiah 53:7-8, depicting the Messiah as a lamb led to the slaughter. Philip showed how this prophecy was perfectly fulfilled in the crucifixion of Christ.
*   **The Central Theme:** No matter where we begin in the Bible, the destination is always the Cross. The Law shows us our need of a Savior; the Prophets predict His coming; the Gospels record His work; the Epistles explain His power in us.
*   **Personal Application:** Preaching Jesus includes teaching His power to save the individual from their specific sins. It is the "power of God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16).

***

### Q10. What are the Scriptures able to do?

"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus." (2 Timothy 3:15)

**Answer:**

The Bible possesses a supernatural ability that no other book claims: it can make a person "wise unto salvation."

*   **Power to Convert:** The Word of God is "quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword" (Hebrews 4:12). It cuts through our defenses, reveals our sin, and points us to the remedy.
*   **Through Faith:** Note that the Scriptures alone do not save like a magic charm; it is "through faith which is in Christ Jesus." We must believe the promises and claim them for ourselves.
*   **Sanctification:** As we study, the Word has a cleansing effect. Jesus prayed, "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth" (John 17:17).

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing process by which the Holy Spirit separates a believer from sin and imparts the character of Christ to them. It is the work of a lifetime.

### Q11. What was said of the Bereans because they searched the Scriptures daily?

"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so." (Acts 17:11)

**Answer:**

The Bereans are commended as "noble" for two specific traits: open-mindedness to hear the truth, and diligence to verify it by Scripture.

*   **Daily Search:** They did not rely on the preacher's word alone. They went to the source daily. God desires us to be thinkers, not merely reflectors of other men's thoughts.
*   **The Standard of Truth:** They tested Paul's preaching by the written Word. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20).
*   **Individual Responsibility:** In the judgment, we cannot plead that we were misled by a minister or a tradition. We are responsible for what the Bible says.

### Q12. By what is man to live?

"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." (Matthew 4:4)

**Answer:**

Jesus spoke these words during His temptation in the wilderness. He defeated Satan not by divine power, but by the written Word, setting an example for us.

*   **Spiritual Food:** Just as physical bread sustains the body, the Word of God sustains the spiritual life. A Christian who neglects the Bible will soon grow spiritually weak and fall into sin.
*   **Victory Over Sin:** How do we live the victorious life? By "every word." When tempted, we must rely on the promises of God. This is Righteousness by Faith in action—believing that God's Word has the power to keep us from falling (Jude 24).
*   **The Creative Word:** The same Word that spoke the worlds into existence (Psalm 33:6) speaks the new creation into our hearts. If God says "Thou shalt not," His Word contains the power to enable us to obey, if we receive it by faith.

**[ILL] Illustration:**
A diver in the depths of the ocean relies entirely on the air line connected to the surface for life. If that line is cut, he dies. The Christian is in the depths of a sinful world. The Word of God is our air line to heaven. We must live by every breath that comes from the mouth of God.

### Q13. How greatly has God magnified His word?

"I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name." (Psalm 138:2)

**Answer:**

This is a profound statement. God’s "name" represents His character, His authority, and His honor. He has placed His Word on a level even higher than His name because His name is only as good as His Word.

*   **God Cannot Lie:** Because God has magnified His Word, we can have absolute confidence in His promises. If He has promised to forgive us (1 John 1:9), He will do it. If He has promised to write His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10), He will do it.
*   **The Basis of Judgment:** Since God has so magnified His Word, it becomes the standard by which all will be judged. We cannot treat the Bible lightly. It is the voice of God speaking to the soul.
