## Slide 1 – Bible Study: The Sin of Selfishness

- **Topic:** The Great Controversy in the Human Heart
- **Focus:** Righteousness by Faith, The Sanctuary, and Christian Living
- **Based on:** Scriptural Principles and Prophecy

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Definition and Origin

- **Question:** Selfishness is how defined by Webster?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 14:13–14 – “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (The Great Controversy)

- **The Root of Sin:**
  - Webster defines it as supreme self-preference without regard for others.
  - The Bible reveals it as the root of the Great Controversy.
  - It began with Lucifer’s assertion of "I" over God (Isaiah 14:13–14).
- **The Two Principles:**
  - **Satan’s Principle:** Self-seeking, pride, and grasping for power (Ezekiel 28:15–17).
  - **God’s Principle:** Self-renouncing love and service (Mark 10:45 – “For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”).
- **The Nature of the Heart:**
  - Selfishness is the governing principle of the unrenewed heart (Jeremiah 17:9).
  - Salvation aims to eradicate self-love and replace it with Christ’s love.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Solar System:**
  - Imagine if a planet refused to orbit the sun and tried to become its own center of gravity.
  - Result: Chaos, collision, and destruction.
- **Spiritual Application:**
  - When a soul shifts its center from God to "Self," spiritual chaos follows.
  - The life is pulled out of its true orbit, leading to ruin.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Commandment Against Self

- **Question:** What specific commandments forbids this sin?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:17 – “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Law & Sanctuary)

- **The Spirituality of the Law:**
  - The 10th Commandment forbids the *root* of sin: unlawful desire.
  - Before a man steals (8th Commandment), he covets.
  - Before a man commits adultery (7th Commandment), he lusts.
- **Sanctuary Insight:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the Law was placed beneath the **Mercy Seat**.
  - This signifies that while the Law detects the sin in the heart (Romans 7:7), only God’s mercy and Christ’s blood can cover the sinner and cleanse the heart.
- **Definition of Covetousness:**
  - Ideally, it is idolatry (Colossians 3:5).
  - It places the created thing above the Creator.

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Royal Law

- **Question:** Selfishness, then, is contrary to what law?
- **Key Text:** James 2:8 – “If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Royal Law:**
  - It is the law of the King of kings: Supreme love to God and love to neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40).
  - Selfishness violates both.
- **Justification:**
  - We naturally love ourselves supremely.
  - We are forgiven for past selfishness through faith in Christ’s blood.
- **Sanctification:**
  - The Holy Spirit writes this law on our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).
  - This is not human effort, but the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22).
  - It is the imparting of Christ’s nature, enabling us to love others as ourselves.

---

## Slide 9 – Q4: Symptoms of the Disease

- **Question:** How does it show itself in the conduct of an individual?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:2 – “For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points (Diagnostic List)

- **Lovers of Self:** Putting one’s own opinion and will above God’s Word.
- **Pleasing Ourselves:** Refusing to bear the infirmities of the weak (Romans 15:1).
- **Seeking Our Own:** Ignoring the profit and salvation of others (1 Corinthians 10:33).
- **Seeking Gain:** Using religion for material benefit; "greedy dogs" (Isaiah 56:11).
- **Seeking Precedence:** Ambition for position and status (Matthew 20:21).
- **Neglect of the Poor:** Closing one's heart to a brother in need (1 John 3:17).
- **Mercenary Religion:** Serving God only for reward or safety (Micah 3:11).

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **Sponge vs. Channel:**
  - A **sponge** absorbs water and keeps it until it is forcibly squeezed.
  - A **channel** receives water only to pass it on to thirsty fields.
- **Application:**
  - A selfish heart is a sponge.
  - A converted heart is a channel of God’s grace.

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Body of Christ

- **Question:** Show that selfishness is inconsistent with the communion of saints.
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 12:25–26 – “That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Unity)

- **The Anatomy of the Church:**
  - In a healthy body, no organ exists for itself.
  - The heart pumps blood for the whole body; the stomach digests for every limb.
- **The Schism of Self:**
  - Selfishness creates division.
  - When one member seeks preeminence, spiritual circulation is blocked.
- **Mutual Dependence:**
  - We are "members one of another" (Ephesians 4:25).
  - The sanctification of one benefits the whole; the suffering of one affects all.

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: Contrary to Divine Love

- **Question:** Prove that it is contrary to Christian charity, or love.
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 13:4–5 – “Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Agape)

- **Seeketh Not Her Own:**
  - This is the pivot point of love (*Agape*).
  - Selfishness seeks to *get*; Love seeks to *give*.
- **The Contrast:**
  - Selfishness is easily provoked; Love suffers long.
  - Selfishness thinks evil (judges); Love hopes all things.
- **Need for Imputed Righteousness:**
  - We fall short of this standard.
  - We need Christ’s love *imputed* to us for standing before God.
  - We need Christ’s love *imparted* to us for living among men.

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: The Admonition

- **Question:** How are we admonished with regard to selfishness?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 10:24 – “Let no man seek his own, but every man another's wealth.”
- **Additional Text:** Philippians 2:4 – “Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points (Kingdom Law)

- **Shift of Focus:**
  - The natural tendency is to look inward (rights, desires, wounds).
  - The Gospel command is to look outward and upward.
- **Practical Application:**
  - Business: Consider the other person's benefit.
  - Family: Consider the spouse's preference first.
- **The Rule of Greatness:**
  - In God's kingdom, to be great is to be a servant (Matthew 20:26–28).

---

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Cure for Selfishness

- **Question:** By what means may we overcome selfishness?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:14–15 – “For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points (The Exchange)

- **The Motivating Power:**
  - Selfishness is not cured by trying to be "good."
  - It is cured by the "love of Christ" constraining us.
- **Identity with Christ:**
  - "One died for all."
  - By faith, we reckon our old selfish nature dead with Him (Romans 6:6).
- **The Displacement:**
  - Because He rose, He lives in us.
  - Self goes out; Christ comes in (Galatians 2:20).

---

## Slide 20 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Iron in the Furnace:**
  - Cold iron cannot be warmed by rubbing it.
  - Place it in a furnace, and it becomes glowing hot, taking on the nature of the fire.
- **Lesson:**
  - We cannot remove the coldness of selfishness by working on ourselves.
  - We must dwell in the "furnace" of Christ’s love.

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Prevalence of the Sin

- **Question:** How prevalent is this sin?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 2:21 – “For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.”

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (The Human Condition)

- **Universal Struggle:**
  - "All have sinned" (Romans 3:23).
  - Even in the early church, true self-sacrificing laborers were rare.
- **Call to Revival:**
  - We need the Holy Spirit (the Sanctuary lampstand) to search our hearts.
  - Are we seeking the things of Christ (salvation of souls) or our own comfort?

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: The Last Days

- **Question:** What among other things will help to make the last days a perilous time?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:1–2 – “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous...”

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (Prophetic Warning)

- **Character Degradation:**
  - Perilous times are defined by a degradation of character, not just disasters.
- **The Laodicean State:**
  - The last-day church claims, "I am rich... and have need of nothing" (Revelation 3:17).
  - This is spiritual selfishness—pride in attainments.
- **The Final Test:**
  - As the end approaches, the distinction between serving Self and serving God will become undeniable (Malachi 3:18).

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: Discipleship Requirement

- **Question:** Can we be followers of Christ without overcoming selfishness?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 16:24 – “Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (Taking the Cross)

- **No Option:**
  - Self-denial is the entry requirement for discipleship.
- **"Deny Himself":**
  - Not just denying a luxury.
  - Denying the *authority* of the "Ego" to rule the life.
- **"Take Up His Cross":**
  - The cross is an instrument of death.
  - It means walking to the place of death to the old man of sin.

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Christ’s Example

- **Question:** Show that Christ condemned selfishness by His example.
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 8:9 – “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”
- **Additional Text:** Romans 15:3 – “For even Christ pleased not himself...”

---

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points (Sanctuary & Service)

- **Christ's Humiliation:**
  - He stepped down from the throne to the manger, and to the cross (Philippians 2:6–8).
  - He never used His divine power for His own comfort.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The High Priest bore the people on his heart (breastplate) and shoulders.
  - Christ, our High Priest, lives "to make intercession" for us (Hebrews 7:25).
  - He is totally devoted to our salvation, not His own ease.

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Our Response

- **Question:** What should this lead us to do?

- **Question:** What example has the apostle Paul given us in this respect?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 10:33 – “Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q14: Key Points (Soul Winning)

- **Nabal:** "Shall I take *my* bread...?" (Possession-focused).
- **Haman:** Could not enjoy riches because one man refused to bow (Ego-focused).
- **The Multitude:** Followed Jesus for loaves and fishes (Consumer Christianity).

---

## Slide 35 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Dead End:**
  - Selfishness is a dead-end road.
  - Like a snake eating its own tail, selfishness eventually consumes the person who harbors it.

---

## Slide 36 – Q16: Final Judgment

- **Question:** What is the condition, and what will be the final punishment, of those who continue to be governed by selfishness?
- **Key Text:** Jude 11–13 – “Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain... wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points (Punishment & Promise)

- **The Punishment:**
  - **Wandering Stars:** Separated from the Sun of Righteousness to follow the orbit of Self.
  - **Investigative Judgment:** Those living only for self will have no character to endure God's presence.
- **The Gospel Promise:**
  - "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).
  - We may bring our selfish hearts to the Sanctuary and receive the heart of Christ in exchange.
