## Slide 1 – Title Slide
- **Bible Study: Health, Healing, and Faith**
- Understanding God’s Will for the Body and the Soul
- A Scriptural Examination of Divine Healing

***

## Slide 2 – Q1: Obedience and Health
- **Question:** What bearing did the regarding of God's commandments formerly have on the removal of sickness?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 7:11-15
  - “Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them... And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee...”

***

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (The Unity of Law)
- **The Fundamental Principle:**
  - God is the author of all life.
  - His laws (moral and physical) are designed to sustain that life.
- **The Unity of Law:**
  - We often separate spiritual law from physical law, but God sees them as one.
  - The God who said, “Thou shalt not steal” (Exodus 20:15) also gave laws on diet and hygiene (Leviticus 11–15).
  - Violating physical laws is a violation of God’s law.
- **Cause and Effect:**
  - Much sickness results directly from violating natural law (intemperance in eating, drinking, or labor).
  - God’s promise to remove sickness was conditional on obedience.
  - Aligning with God’s design removes the *causes* of disease.

***

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Sanctification & Faith)
- **Sanctification of the Body:**
  - 1 Corinthians 6:19 – “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?”
  - Sanctification includes preserving our physical powers to offer God perfect service (Romans 12:1).
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - We do not earn health or heaven by works.
  - However, true faith (imputed righteousness) produces obedience (imparted righteousness).
  - The believer obeys health laws not to *be* saved, but because they belong to Christ.

***

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Manufacturer’s Manual:**
  - Imagine a high-performance machine with a manual.
  - If the owner pours sand into the engine instead of oil, the machine breaks.
  - The manufacturer is not arbitrarily "punishing" the owner; the owner simply violated the law of the machine's design.
- **The Lesson:**
  - God’s commandments are the "manual" for our happiness and longevity.
  - Obedience preserves the machinery of the body.

***

## Slide 6 – Q2: Mercy to the Rebellious
- **Question:** When through disobedience King Jeroboam's hand withered, how was it restored to strength?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 13:6
  - “And the man of God besought the Lord, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.”

***

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points (Intercession & Grace)
- **Judgment and Mercy:**
  - Jeroboam’s withered hand was a judgment for his rebellion against God’s messenger.
  - The restoration shows God’s willingness to heal even the undeserving.
- **The Role of the Intercessor:**
  - The king could not heal himself; he had to ask the “man of God” to pray.
  - This points to the ministry of Christ:
    - We are spiritually “withered” by sin.
    - We require a Mediator to stand between the living God and our dying souls.
- **Grace, Not Merit (Justification):**
  - Healing was not a reward for Jeroboam’s goodness (he had none).
  - It was an act of pure grace, illustrating how God justifies the sinner through the intercession of Jesus (Titus 3:5).

***

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Rebellious Child:**
  - A child may break a window in anger and cut his hand deeply.
  - The parent, though grieved by the rebellion, immediately binds up the wound.
  - The healing is an act of parental love, not an endorsement of the rebellion.
- **The Lesson:**
  - God heals us to give us a "space for repentance" (Revelation 2:21 – “And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.”).

***

## Slide 9 – Q3: Miriam’s Leprosy
- **Question:** When Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, what did Moses do in her behalf?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 12:13
  - “And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.”

***

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Sin & The Mediator)
- **Leprosy as a Type of Sin:**
  - It begins small, spreads, creates insensitivity (numbness), and separates the victim from the congregation (Leviticus 13:45–46).
- **The Spirit of the Mediator:**
  - Moses reflects the Spirit of Christ.
  - Though Miriam spoke against him, he held no grudge and immediately prayed for her.
  - Luke 23:34 – “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do...”
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Healing of the body and cleansing of the soul are tied to the High Priest’s work.
  - Moses appealed to the High Court of Heaven for her cleansing.

***

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Stain and the Formula:**
  - Imagine a garment stained with a dye that no scrubbing can remove. It is ruined.
  - A chemist possesses a specific formula that can dissolve the stain instantly.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Sin is the stain; Christ’s blood applied by faith is the formula.
  - Moses applied for this "cleansing agent" on behalf of his sister.

***

## Slide 12 – Q4: Physicians and Trust
- **Question:** Are there cases when it is best not to apply to earthly physicians?
- **Key Text:** 2 Chronicles 16:12
  - “And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great; yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.”

***

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points (Faith vs. Presumption)
- **Trusting Man over God:**
  - Asa’s sin was that he sought *not* the Lord, *but* the physicians.
  - He replaced the Creator with the creature.
- **Context of Ancient Medicine:**
  - Many "physicians" of that time used magic, incantations, and pagan rites.
- **The True Physician's Role:**
  - God works through means (e.g., figs for Hezekiah in Isaiah 38:21; clay for the blind man in John 9:6).
  - We should use rational remedies (diet, rest, surgery), but our trust must remain in the Lord who gives the healing power.
- **Definitions:**
  - **Faith:** Trusting God while obeying His laws and using His provided blessings.
  - **Presumption:** Ignoring God's laws/means and demanding a miracle.

***

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Broken Bone:**
  - If a man breaks his leg, he goes to a surgeon to set the bone.
  - The surgeon sets it, but cannot knit the bone back together; only the life-force God put in the body can do that.
- **The Lesson:**
  - If the man thanks the surgeon but ignores God, he is like Asa.
  - We must recognize the medical professional as merely an instrument in the Master Healer's hand.

***

## Slide 15 – Q5: God, the Master of Life
- **Question:** When Elijah prayed for the restoration of a child, what was the result?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 17:21, 22
  - “And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.”

***

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Resurrection & Power)
- **The Source of Life:**
  - The return of the soul (*nephesh* - life/breath) confirms life is a gift from God.
- **Earnest Prayer:**
  - Elijah "stretched himself upon the child"—identifying with the need.
  - James 5:16 – “...The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.”
- **Resurrection Hope:**
  - This miracle points to the final resurrection when the voice of Christ will call forth the sleeping saints (1 Thessalonians 4:16).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Elijah was a man of "like passions" (James 5:17), yet he stood in God's righteousness.
  - His prayer was answered because his faith grasped God's power.

***

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Unplugged Lamp:**
  - A lamp that is unplugged is dark and "dead."
  - When plugged back into the socket, the light returns.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The lamp does not generate the light; it receives it.
  - Elijah’s prayer re-connected the child to God, the source of all vitality.

***

## Slide 18 – Q6: Hezekiah’s Extension
- **Question:** When Hezekiah prayed for restoration from sickness, what answer was returned to him?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 38:5
  - “Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.”

***

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points (Providence & Warning)
- **God Sees Tears:**
  - Psalm 103:13 – “Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.”
  - God is personally touched by our grief.
- **Prayer Changes Things:**
  - God granted an extension based on Hezekiah’s plea.
  - Prayer changes *us*, allowing God to safely grant blessings He otherwise could not.
- **A Solemn Warning:**
  - The extra 15 years were spiritually disastrous (Hezekiah showed treasures to Babylon; Manasseh was born).
  - Lesson: We must always pray, "Thy will be done," as we do not always know what is best.

***

## Slide 20 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Loan Extension:**
  - A bank manager may grant a loan extension to a client who pleads for time.
  - The time is given, but the client is responsible for how that time is used.
- **The Lesson:**
  - God gave Hezekiah a "lease extension" on life.
  - Sadly, he did not use the borrowed time entirely for God's glory.

***

## Slide 21 – Q7: Christ’s Threefold Ministry
- **Question:** What was a part of the work of Christ while He was here on earth?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 4:23
  - “And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.”

***

## Slide 22 – Q7: Key Points (The Right Arm)
- **The Whole Man:**
  - Jesus ministered to the body to open the heart to the Gospel.
  - Healing, Teaching, and Preaching worked together.
- **The "Right Arm":**
  - Medical missionary work prepares the way for the Gospel message.
- **Type of the Kingdom:**
  - Healings were "signs" of the future Kingdom where no one says, "I am sick" (Isaiah 33:24).
- **Application:**
  - Jesus healed "all manner" of disease.
  - Likewise, His grace can heal "all manner" of spiritual disease (sins/habits).

***

## Slide 23 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Master Gardener:**
  - A gardener does not just speak to the plant.
  - He waters the soil, prunes dead leaves, and ensures sunlight.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Jesus tends the physical soil of our lives (healing) so the spiritual fruit (character) may grow.

***

## Slide 24 – Q8: Atonement and Healing
- **Question:** What impressive words does Matthew use to show further the burden that the Saviour took in this matter?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 8:17
  - “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.”

***

## Slide 25 – Q8: Key Points (Vicarious Suffering)
- **Vicarious Atonement:**
  - Christ took the place of the sinner.
  - He did not just remove sickness; He "took" it upon Himself, feeling the weight of a fallen world.
- **Sympathy of the High Priest:**
  - Hebrews 4:15 – “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities...”
  - He knows our pain because He has borne it.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - The Lamb of God takes the consequences of sin (sickness/death) so we might have life.
  - Every pulse of health we enjoy was bought by the Cross.

***

## Slide 26 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Swimmer:**
  - Imagine a drowning man dragged down by a heavy weight.
  - A strong swimmer dives in, takes the weight onto his own shoulders, and lifts the man to shore.
  - The swimmer feels the crushing weight so the other can be free.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Christ took the weight of our curse to give us freedom.

***

## Slide 27 – Q9: The Touch of Faith
- **Question:** When the woman touched the hem of Jesus' garment and was healed of her infirmity, what gave effect to the touch?
- **Key Text:** Luke 8:48
  - “And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.”

***

## Slide 28 – Q9: Key Points (Justification by Faith)
- **The Press vs. The Touch:**
  - Many "pressed" Jesus (casual contact), but only one "touched" Him with faith.
  - Being around religious things is not enough; we need personal faith.
- **Faith as the Medium:**
  - Faith is not the power; it is the hand that grasps the power.
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - This is a picture of Justification.
  - The woman was bankrupt of human effort and came to Christ as a last resort.
  - Her total dependence resulted in immediate restoration.

***

## Slide 29 – Q9: Illustration
- **The Live Wire:**
  - A house may have many wires, but a "dead" wire transmits nothing even if it touches the power source.
  - A "live" wire immediately conducts the current upon contact.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Faith makes us "live wires," capable of receiving the current of Christ’s life.

***

## Slide 30 – Q10: Gifts in the Church
- **Question:** Is the gift of healing given to the church of Christ?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 12:28
  - “And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.”

***

## Slide 31 – Q10: Key Points (Order & Permanence)
- **Order of Gifts:**
  - Healing is listed *after* apostles, prophets, and teachers.
  - Miracles confirm the Word; they do not replace it.
- **Sovereign Bestowal:**
  - God divides gifts “as He will” (1 Corinthians 12:11).
- **Permanence:**
  - There is no scriptural evidence these gifts were withdrawn.
  - We may expect a revival of primitive godliness and power in the last days.

***

## Slide 32 – Q11: The Scriptural Method
- **Question:** How is this gift exercised?
- **Key Text:** James 5:14
  - “Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:”

***

## Slide 33 – Q11: Key Points (The Anointing)
- **Initiative:**
  - “Let *him* call.” The sick person must desire the prayers and be right with God.
- **The Elders:**
  - An official act of the church, ensuring order and preventing fanaticism.
- **Anointing with Oil:**
  - **Symbolism:** Represents the Holy Spirit.
  - **Medicinal:** In biblical times, oil was a remedy (Luke 10:34); implies combining prayer with rational treatments.
  - **Dedication:** Signifies setting the person apart for God.
- **"In the Name of the Lord":**
  - The power is in Jesus' authority, not the oil or the men.

***

## Slide 34 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Prescription:**
  - When a doctor writes a prescription, you must follow the instructions to get the benefit.
  - God has given a "prescription" in James 5.
- **The Lesson:**
  - We call the elders, use the symbol (oil), and pray in faith, leaving the result to the Great Physician.

***

## Slide 35 – Q12: The Prayer of Faith
- **Question:** If the sick one is restored to health, by what power is it accomplished?
- **Key Text:** James 5:15
  - “And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.”

***

## Slide 36 – Q12: Key Points (Forgiveness & Healing)
- **The Prayer of Faith:**
  - Not a command, but a trust that lays hold of God’s promises while submitting to His will.
- **Connection to Forgiveness:**
  - "If he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven."
  - Physical healing is secondary to the healing of the soul (justification).
  - Sickness often awakens the conscience, leading to confession and peace.
- **Sanctuary Theme:**
  - Prayer (incense) is effective because of the Sacrifice (blood).

***

## Slide 37 – Q12: Illustration
- **Pulling the Root:**
  - To remove a weed permanently, you must pull out the root.
  - Often, sin (guilt, anxiety, intemperance) is the root of sickness.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The prayer of faith allows God to pull the root (sin) so the plant (the person) can flourish again.

***

## Slide 38 – Q13: Authority Delegated
- **Question:** Did Christ bestow the gift of healing upon His disciples?
- **Key Text:** Luke 9:1
  - “Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.”
- **Key Text:** Acts 3:6
  - “Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.”

***

## Slide 39 – Q13: Key Points (Power & Authority)
- **Delegated Power:**
  - Jesus gave *power* (ability) and *authority* (right) to authenticate the Gospel message.
- **Peter’s Experience:**
  - The church may be poor in "silver and gold," but should be rich in spiritual power.
  - Peter acted merely as an agent "In the name of Jesus."
- **Complete Restoration:**
  - The man "leaped" and praised God—physical liberty leads to spiritual praise.

***

## Slide 40 – Q14: The Great Commission
- **Question:** Was this commission to cease with the twelve apostles?
- **Key Text:** Mark 16:17-18
  - “And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils... they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”

***

## Slide 41 – Q14: Key Points (Signs Following)
- **"Them that Believe":**
  - The promise extends to all believers, not just the twelve apostles.
  - As long as the Gospel is preached, the credentials of the Gospel remain valid.
- **Why the Lack of Power Today?**
  - **Unbelief:** Relying on worldly methods rather than God.
  - **Presumption:** Ignoring health laws.
  - **End-Time Context:** Caution needed against counterfeit miracles (2 Thessalonians 2:9).
- **Assurance:**
  - Where the Gospel is preached in purity, God still bears witness.

***

## Slide 42 – Q15: Prerequisites to Healing
- **Question:** What special work is necessary for one who expects to be healed?
- **Key Text:** James 5:16
  - “Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.”

***

## Slide 43 – Q15: Key Points (Confession)
- **Clearing the Channel:**
  - Psalm 66:18 – “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.”
  - Unconfessed sin clogs the channel of blessing.
- **Types of Confession:**
  - Private sins: Confess to God.
  - Sins against others: Confess to the person injured ("one to another").
  - Public sins: Confess publicly.
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - In the antitypical Day of Atonement, we must "afflict our souls" and put away sin.

***

## Slide 44 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Clogged Pipe:**
  - If a water pipe is blocked by mud, opening the faucet does no good.
  - You must first clear the mud.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Unconfessed sin and grudges are "mud" in the spiritual pipe.
  - Confession removes the obstruction, allowing the water of life to flow.

***

## Slide 45 – Q16: Motives in Prayer
- **Question:** Why is it that in some cases persons are not healed in answer to prayer?
- **Key Text:** James 4:3
  - “Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.”

***

## Slide 46 – Q16: Key Points (Asking Amiss)
- **Wrong Motives:**
  - Asking for health to return to self-indulgence or sin is asking God to sustain rebellion.
  - God values our eternal salvation too much to finance our destruction.
- **The Purpose of Health:**
  - We should ask for health *so that* we may serve God and bless others.
- **God's Mercy:**
  - Sometimes God allows sleep (death) to save a soul from future sin (Isaiah 57:1).

***

## Slide 47 – Q16: Illustration
- **The Sharp Knife:**
  - A parent will not give a sharp knife back to a toddler who just cut himself.
  - The child may cry, but the parent refuses out of love.
- **The Lesson:**
  - God sometimes withholds health if He sees we would use that strength to hurt ourselves spiritually.

***

## Slide 48 – Q17: The Barrier of Unbelief
- **Question:** Why could not the disciples, on a certain occasion, cast the demon out of a child?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 17:19, 20
  - “Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief...”

***

## Slide 49 – Q17: Key Points (Faith & Dependence)
- **The Barrier:**
  - Unbelief insulates us from heaven’s power.
  - The disciples had been arguing about greatness (pride) rather than praying.
- **Prayer and Fasting:**
  - Mark 9:29 – “...This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.”
  - **Fasting:** Disconnecting from the world/flesh.
  - **Prayer:** Connecting with Heaven.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - John 15:5 – “...for without me ye can do nothing.”
  - Victory requires total dependence on Christ, not past experience.

***

## Slide 50 – Q17: Illustration
- **The Diver:**
  - A diver relies on an air hose connected to the surface.
  - If the hose is kinked, he suffocates.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Unbelief and self-reliance "kink" our hose to heaven.
  - Prayer and fasting straighten it out, allowing the Spirit's power to flow.

***

## Slide 51 – Conclusion: God’s Will and Trust
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Sickness is the result of sin and Satan; God is the Healer.
- **Our Attitude:**
  - Fulfill conditions: Obedience, Confession, Faith.
  - Submission: "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).
- **The Blessed Hope:**
  - If not healed now, we trust His sufficient grace (2 Corinthians 12:9).
  - We look to the resurrection: "For this corruptible must put on incorruption" (1 Corinthians 15:53).
