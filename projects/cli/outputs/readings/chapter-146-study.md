### Q1. What has been given to every man?
**“For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch." Mark 13:34.**

**Answer:**
The Master has assigned a specific task to every single believer. In the great plan of salvation, there are no idle spectators.

*   **The Authority given:** When Jesus ascended to heaven (the "far journey"), He did not leave His church powerless. He gave "authority" to His servants. This authority is the commission to speak and act in His name to a dying world (Matthew 28:18–20).
*   **Individual responsibility:** The text says He gave "every man his work." This refutes the idea that missionary work is only for the ordained minister or the professional clergy. In the household of God, every child has a chore; every citizen has a duty.
*   **The Porter’s duty:** The command to "watch" links our work with the expectancy of the Second Coming. We work not merely to improve society, but to prepare a people for the return of the King.
*   **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** True faith always works by love (Galatians 5:6). Just as a living body breathes, a living faith works. We do not work *to be* saved, but we work because we *are* saved and possess the life of Christ (Ephesians 2:8–10).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a great ship navigating dangerous waters. The captain is on the bridge, but the crew is scattered throughout the vessel. The engineer, the cook, the deckhand, and the lookout all have different jobs. If the cook decides his work doesn't matter and stops feeding the crew, the ship suffers. In God’s church, if "every man" does not do "his work," the vessel is hindered in its mission to rescue the perishing.

### Q2. Besides work, what else has He given to every man?
**“And unto one He gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey." Matt. 25:15.**

**Answer:**
God never demands a task without supplying the necessary resources to accomplish it.

*   **Definition of "Talents":** In the parable, a talent was a large sum of money. Spiritually, it represents the gifts, opportunities, intellect, time, means, and influence entrusted to us by the Holy Spirit.
*   **According to ability:** God is not unreasonable. He does not expect a one-talent man to produce a five-talent result. He simply asks for faithfulness in proportion to what we have received (Luke 12:48).
*   **The Source of the Gift:** These talents are not self-generated; they are "given." We are stewards, not owners. Whether we have great intellect or simple strength, it is a trust from God to be used for His glory.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A wise father asks his small child to carry a light bundle, while he asks his strong teenager to carry a heavy crate. He fits the burden to the back. God knows our frame; He gives us gifts suited to our capacity and asks us to use them fully for Him.

---

### Q3. Who comprise the "every man" here spoken of?
**“For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods." Matt. 25:14.**

**Answer:**
The "every man" refers to all who profess to be servants of Christ.

*   **"His Own Servants":** This phrase implies ownership. We have been bought with a price—the precious blood of Jesus (1 Corinthians 6:19–20). Therefore, we are not our own.
*   **The Universal Call:** This includes the young and the old, the wealthy and the poor, the learned and the unlearned. If you have accepted Christ as your Savior, you have also accepted Him as your Lord and Master. You are part of this company.
*   **The Trust:** He delivered unto them "his goods." The gospel, the truth of the sanctuary, the three angels' messages—these are the "goods" entrusted to the Seventh-day Adventist church and to individual believers to trade with until He comes.

---

### Q4. Do all who profess to be God's servants make good use of the talents given them?
**“Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents... But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money." Matt. 25:16-18.**

**Answer:**
Sadly, no. The parable reveals two classes of professors: the diligent and the negligent.

*   **Trading (Active Faith):** To "trade" means to use the gift. It involves risk, effort, and interaction with others. When we share our faith, our faith grows. When we use our knowledge to bless others, our understanding deepens.
*   **Hiding (Passive Profession):** To "dig in the earth" is to bury one's influence in worldly affairs. This represents the Christian who attends church but makes no effort to win souls, claiming they have "too little" to offer.
*   **Sanctuary Application:** Jesus is currently ministering in the heavenly sanctuary. While He is there, we are to be active in the outer court (the earth). To hide our talent is to deny the purpose of His ministry.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Muscle that is not exercised atrophies and becomes weak. A language learned but never spoken is soon forgotten. So it is with grace; if the love of Christ is not shared, it eventually dies out in the heart of the believer.

---

### Q5. What did that one who hid his talent in the earth, render as an excuse for so doing?
**“And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine." Matt. 25:25.**

**Answer:**
The servant's excuse was fear, rooted in a false concept of God's character.

*   **The Paralysis of Fear:** He claimed he was "afraid" to lose the talent or fail. Fear is often the enemy of faith.
*   **A Distorted View of God:** He viewed the master as hard and demanding. This is the essence of legalism—viewing God as a harsh taskmaster who demands the impossible, rather than a loving Father who provides the power to obey.
*   **Self-Preservation:** "Lo, there thou hast that is thine." He thought he could simply return exactly what was given, without growth. But in the spiritual life, there is no stasis; we are either advancing or sliding back.

---

### Q6. What did his master say to that servant because he hid his talent?
**“His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant." Matt. 25:26.**

**Answer:**
The master’s judgment is severe, labeling the passive servant "wicked and slothful."

*   **Definition of Slothful:** Lazy, sluggish, spiritually lethargic.
*   **Why "Wicked"?** We often think of wickedness as committing terrible crimes (murder, theft). But in God's eyes, *neglect* is wickedness. To see a world perishing and do nothing to save it is a violation of the law of love.
*   **Sins of Omission:** The judgment deals not only with what we did wrong but with the good duties we left undone (James 4:17).
*   **RBF Connection:** True righteousness is the life of Christ in the soul. Christ was never slothful; He "went about doing good" (Acts 10:38). Therefore, a slothful servant lacks the righteousness of Christ.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a fireman stands by a burning house with a hose in his hand but refuses to turn on the water because he is "afraid" or "tired," he is criminally negligent. The inhabitants die because of his inactivity. So it is with the Christian who holds the water of life but does not share it.

---

### Q7. What did he say the servant ought, at least, to have done with the talent?
**“Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I might have received mine own with usury." Matt. 25:27.**

**Answer:**
If the servant felt unable to trade personally, he should have supported those who could.

*   **Definition of Usury:** In old English, this simply meant "interest" or increase earned on an investment.
*   **The Exchangers (Bankers):** This represents organized instrumentalities in God’s work. If a person cannot preach or go as a missionary personally, they can invest their means (money/resources) to support the organized mission of the church.
*   **No Excuse:** There is a way for everyone to participate. If you cannot go, you can send. If you cannot speak, you can distribute literature.

---

### Q8. The man in the parable was afraid as well, because he said his master was a hard man. But was it real, honest fear that made him act as he did?
**“And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow; wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?" Luke 19:22, 23.**

**Answer:**
No, it was not honest fear; it was a dishonest excuse. The master exposes the contradiction.

*   **Self-Condemnation:** The master argues, "If you really believed I was so strict and demanding, that should have made you *more* diligent, not less."
*   **The Real Issue:** The servant's problem was not that he feared the master, but that he did not love him or care for his interests. He wanted the privileges of being a servant without the responsibilities.
*   **The Judgment:** In the investigative judgment, God looks at the motives. Excuses that sound plausible to human ears will crumble before the searcher of hearts (Jeremiah 17:10).

---

### Q9. What was the fate of the slothful servant?
**“And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matt. 25:30.**

**Answer:**
The result of uselessness is total separation from God.

*   **Unprofitable:** The servant brought no glory to God and no benefit to man. He was a dead branch.
*   **Outer Darkness:** God is light. To be cast out is to be removed from His presence. This points to the final destruction of the wicked.
*   **The Lesson:** We are not saved *by* our fruit, but we are saved *for* fruitfulness. A lack of fruit proves the absence of saving faith.

---

### Q10. Who else will share the same fate?
**“But He shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity." Luke 13:27.**

**Answer:**
Those who do nothing for God are classed with the "workers of iniquity."

*   **Definition of Iniquity:** Lawlessness (Greek: *anomia*).
*   **The Comparison:** In God's reckoning, the man who idly hoards his talent is in the same category as the open sinner. Both are living for self rather than for God.
*   **"I Know You Not":** Salvation is a relationship ("knowing" God, John 17:3). If we do not share His burden for souls, we do not truly know Him, for His character is self-sacrificing love.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A watch that does not keep time is useless, regardless of how gold and shiny the case is. It has failed the very purpose of its creation. A Christian who does not shine for Christ has failed the purpose of their redemption.

---

### Q11. What was said to the servant who improved the talents given to him?
**“His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord." Matt. 25:21.**

**Answer:**
Faithfulness is rewarded with commendation, increased responsibility, and shared joy.

*   **"Well Done":** The sweet approval of Jesus is the highest reward a creature can receive.
*   **Faithful in Few Things:** God tests us in this life with "a few things"—our short time, our limited means. How we handle these determines our eternal destiny.
*   **Ruler over Many:** In the new earth, the redeemed will have active roles in God's government. Service continues, but without the weariness of sin.
*   **Joy of the Lord:** What is this joy? It is the joy of seeing others saved (see next question).

---

### Q12. What did the joy placed before the Savior enable Him to bear?
**“Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God." Heb. 12:2.**

**Answer:**
The joy that motivated Jesus was the anticipation of saving lost humanity.

*   **Enduring the Cross:** The suffering was real and terrible, but the vision of the redeemed—of you and me saved in His kingdom—outweighed the pain.
*   **Despising the Shame:** He treated the humiliation of the cross as nothing compared to the value of a soul.
*   **RBF Connection:** We look to Jesus, the "Author and Finisher." As He infuses His life into us, we begin to possess the same motivation. We become willing to suffer inconvenience and shame if it means winning a soul to Christ.

---

### Q13. When will the Lord have this satisfaction and joy?
**“He shall see the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied." Isa. 53:11.**

**Answer:**
God experiences this joy fully when the plan of redemption is complete and the harvest is gathered in.

*   **Travail of His Soul:** This refers to the agony of Gethsemane and Calvary.
*   **Satisfied:** When Christ looks upon the great multitude that no man can number (Revelation 7:9), standing on the sea of glass, He will feel that His sacrifice was worth it. He will not regret the price paid.

---

### Q14. How will Christ demonstrate the joy He feels at that time?
**“The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with joy: He will rest in His love, He will joy over thee with singing." Zeph. 3:17.**

**Answer:**
This creates one of the most beautiful pictures in Scripture: God singing over His redeemed people.

*   **Rejoicing:** God is not a stoic, emotionless force. He is a Father who delights in the restoration of His children.
*   **"Joy over thee with singing":** Just as a parent sings to comfort and delight a child, the Creator will express His love through song. This is the ultimate celebration of the at-one-ment (atonement) between God and man.

---

### Q15. What did Paul expect would be his joy at that time?
**“For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? For ye are our glory and joy." 1 Thess. 2:19, 20.**

**Answer:**
Paul’s joy was people. Specifically, the people he had labored to save.

*   **The Only Treasure:** We cannot take our houses, cars, or bank accounts to heaven. The only thing we can take with us from this world is another person.
*   **Crown of Rejoicing:** In the ancient games, winners received a laurel crown. Paul says his "trophy" is seeing the Thessalonians standing saved in the presence of Jesus.
*   **Practical Application:** If we want joy in heaven, we must invest in people on earth.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A man who spends his life gathering sand will have nothing at the end. A man who spends his life gathering diamonds will be rich. Souls are the diamonds of heaven.

---

### Q16. Since this joy comes to Christ only through His self-denial and sufferings for others, in what way must all others partake of that joy?
**“It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He also will deny us." 2 Tim. 2:11, 12.**

**Answer:**
To share in the harvest, we must share in the labor and the suffering.

*   **Dead with Him:** This is the essence of the Gospel—death to the old self (Galatians 2:20). We cannot live for Christ if we are still living for our own ego and comfort.
*   **Suffering:** This is not merely physical pain, but the "fellowship of His sufferings" (Philippians 3:10)—bearing the burden of souls, facing rejection, and denying self for the good of others.
*   **Reigning:** The crown follows the cross. There is no shortcut to the joy of the Lord that bypasses the work of the Lord.

---

### Q17. What motive should prompt everyone to engage in the work of saving souls?
**“For the love of Christ constraineth us: because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead." 2 Cor. 5:14.**

**Answer:**
The only sustainable motive for missionary work is the love of Christ.

*   **"Constraineth":** This word means to compel, to urge, or to hold together. It is a driving force. It is not *our* love for Him, but *His* love for us (and for the world) flowing through us.
*   **The Logic of the Gospel:** "If one died for all, then were all dead." We realize the desperate condition of humanity without Christ. If He died for them, they must be of infinite value. How can we remain silent?
*   **Not Guilt, But Love:** We do not witness because we "have to" in order to avoid punishment; we witness because we "get to" participate in His love.

---

### Q18. Whom does every faithful worker represent?
**"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God." 2 Cor. 5:20.**

**Answer:**
Every believer is an ambassador—a personal representative of the Sovereign of the Universe.

*   **Definition of Ambassador:** An official representative sent to a foreign land. They do not speak their own words, but the words of their King. Their primary goal is to maintain or restore peace.
*   **"In Christ's Stead":** This is a staggering thought. Since Christ is no longer walking the earth in bodily form, we are His voice and His hands. We are to plead with men and women to be reconciled to God.
*   **Sanctuary Context:** Just as the priest represented the sinner before God, we now represent God to the sinner, inviting them to the High Priest.

---

### Q19. If one excuses himself from the work, what will be the result?
**"Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit." John 15:2.**

**Answer:**
The result of fruitlessness is being cut off from the Vine.

*   **Vitality through Service:** The spiritual life depends on the flow of the Spirit. We receive to give. If we stop giving, the flow stops, and we spiritually die.
*   **Purging (Pruning):** Even the fruitful worker faces trials (pruning), but this is God's way of making them even more effective. The fruitless branch, however, is removed entirely.
*   **Warning:** We cannot maintain a connection with Christ while refusing to participate in His work. The sap of the vine creates the fruit; if there is no fruit, the connection is faulty.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A stream that has an inlet but no outlet becomes a stagnant swamp (like the Dead Sea). A stream that receives and gives remains fresh and full of life (like the Sea of Galilee).

---

### Q20. What position does one really occupy who does not labor for Christ?
**"He that is not with Me is against Me: and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth." Luke 11:23.**

**Answer:**
In the Great Controversy, there is no neutral ground.

*   **Gathering vs. Scattering:** Christ is the great Gatherer of sheep. Satan is the scatterer. If we are not actively helping Christ gather, our influence (by apathy or example) is helping Satan scatter.
*   **The Myth of Neutrality:** One cannot say, "I will simply do no harm." Doing nothing *is* doing harm to the cause of God.
*   **The Call:** God calls us to step off the sidelines. Through the power of the indwelling Christ, we are to take up our appointed work, use our talents, and enter into the joy of bringing souls to the Savior.
