### Q1. For what purpose was the earth created?
"For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth and made it; He hath established it, He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited." Isa. 45:18.

**Answer:**

God is a God of purpose and order, not of confusion. When He spoke the world into existence, His intent was not to create a desolate wasteland, but a home filled with life, joy, and holy beings who would reflect His character.

*   **Designed for Life:** The phrase "not in vain" implies that an empty, chaotic, or sin-filled earth is contrary to God’s original design. He created the earth to be the abode of a holy, happy race (Genesis 1:31).
*   **The Character of the Creator:** God is Love (1 John 4:8). Love desires to share existence and happiness. He formed the earth to be a theater where His love could be displayed through the happiness of His creatures.
*   **Spiritual Parallel:** Just as God created the physical earth to be inhabited, He created the human heart to be the habitation of His Spirit. He does not want our lives to be "void" or empty, but filled with the fruits of righteousness (Ephesians 3:17).

**[ILL]** A master builder does not lay a foundation and erect walls just to let the structure stand empty and decay. He builds a house so that a family may live in it. Likewise, God built this world to be the eternal home of His family. Though sin has temporarily vandalized the "house," the Architect has a plan to renovate and inhabit it again.

### Q2. Why was man made?
"Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou has put all things under His feet." Ps. 8:6 (Gen. 1:26) (Ps. 115:16).

**Answer:**

Man was created to be the vice-gerent (a representative ruler) of God upon this earth. He was crowned with glory and honor, standing as the head of earth's creation.

*   **Dominion:** This term refers to loving authority and stewardship. Adam was to rule the earth not by force, but by the power of love, just as God rules the universe. He was to care for the garden and the animals, reflecting God's benevolent character to the lower creation.
*   **The Image of God:** To have dominion requires one to be like the Sovereign. Man was made in God's image (Genesis 1:26), possessing the power of choice, reason, and a moral character in harmony with God’s law.
*   **A King in His Sphere:** As long as Adam remained loyal to the King of the universe, he was the king of the earth. The elements and the animals obeyed him because he obeyed God.

**[ILL]** A governor is appointed by a king to rule over a specific province. As long as the governor supports the king's laws, he carries the king's authority. If the governor rebels, he loses his legitimate power. Adam was the appointed governor of earth.

### Q3. Does man now have all these things under him?
“Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that He put all in subjection under Him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him." Heb. 2:8.

**Answer:**

The text gives a tragic "not yet." While the original plan was total dominion, sin has interrupted that plan.

*   **The Rebellion of Nature:** When man rebelled against his Creator, the creation rebelled against man. The thorns, thistles, and wild beasts that now hurt or defy man are evidences that the scepter of dominion has fallen from his hand (Genesis 3:17–18).
*   **The Loss of Self-Dominion:** Worse than losing control of the animals, man lost control of himself. Without God, man is a slave to his own appetites and passions. A man who cannot rule his own spirit cannot truly rule the world (Proverbs 25:28).
*   **The Usurper:** We do not see all things under man because an enemy has entered the territory.

**[ILL]** If a captain mutinies against the admiral of the fleet, the sailors under the captain will eventually lose respect for the captain as well. Disorder at the top leads to chaos below. When Adam mutinied against God, chaos entered the whole earth.

---

### Q4. When man lost his dominion, to whom did he yield it?
"For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage." 2 Peter 2:19.

**Answer:**

In the Garden of Eden, Adam faced a choice of allegiance. By choosing to obey the serpent (Satan) rather than God, he surrendered his loyalty and his dominion to the deceiver.

*   **Bondage:** To be in bondage means to be a slave. The Bible teaches that "his servants ye are to whom ye obey" (Romans 6:16). When humanity obeyed Satan, they became captives of Satan.
*   **The Transfer of Territory:** By the laws of conquest, the victor takes the possessions of the vanquished. Satan overcame Adam; therefore, the dominion Adam held passed temporarily into the hands of the enemy.
*   **The Great Controversy:** This earth became a rebel province in the universe, occupied by the forces of darkness. This explains the misery, death, and suffering we see today—it is the rule of a tyrant.

**Definition:** *Bondage* – The spiritual condition of being unable to do right or free oneself from the power of sin and Satan. Only Christ can break this chain.

**[ILL]** In ancient times, if a king was defeated in battle, he surrendered his crown and his kingdom to the conqueror. Adam, representing the human race, was defeated at the tree of knowledge and surrendered the keys of the earth to a foreign power.

---

### Q5. What circumstance shows that the earth came into Satan's possession?
"And the Devil, taking Him up into a high mountain, showed unto Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the Devil said unto Him, All this power will I give Thee, and the glory of them; for that is delivered unto Me; and to whomsoever I will, I give it." Luke 4:5, 6.

**Answer:**

This encounter during the temptation of Christ reveals the extent of what Adam lost. Satan claimed to be the "prince of this world" (John 12:31), and here he asserts his legal right to it.

*   **"Delivered unto Me":** Satan did not claim to have created the world, but that it was *delivered* to him. This delivery happened when Adam sinned.
*   **The Temptation:** The temptation was for Christ to regain the world by compromising with Satan rather than by the painful path of the Cross. Satan offered the crown without the suffering.
*   **Christ's Response:** Jesus did not dispute Satan’s claim that he currently held the world in his grip. Instead, Jesus refused the offer because He came to redeem the world through righteousness and sacrifice, not through a deal with the devil.

**[ILL]** Imagine a thief who steals a precious heirloom. He holds it in his possession, but he does not own it by right. Satan is the "squatter" on God's property. He holds the world hostage, but Christ came to pay the ransom and evict the intruder.

---

### Q6. Is this first dominion to be restored? And to whom is it to come?
"And thou, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem." Micah 4:8.

**Answer:**

Yes, the Bible promises a full restoration. The "first dominion"—the perfect rule and peace enjoyed in Eden—will return.

*   **The Tower of the Flock:** This is a prophetic title for the Messiah, Jesus Christ. As the Good Shepherd, He watches over His flock. The dominion comes *first* to Him because He is the conqueror who defeated Satan.
*   **Restoration, Not Just Replacement:** God does not merely discard this world; He redeems it. The plan of salvation is to "seek and to save that which was lost" (Luke 19:10). This includes the lost earth as well as the lost man.
*   **The Daughter of Jerusalem:** This refers to God's people, the church, who are joint-heirs with Christ.

**Definition:** *Redemption* – The act of buying back something that was sold or lost. In the Bible, a "Kinsman-Redeemer" (like Boaz in the story of Ruth) had the right to buy back a relative's lost land. Jesus is our Kinsman-Redeemer.

---

### Q7. If man lost the dominion through sin and death, through whom will it be restored?
"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that He by the grace of God should taste death for every man." Heb. 2:9.

**Answer:**

The dominion is restored through Jesus Christ, the Second Adam. Where the first Adam failed, Christ succeeded.

*   **Made Lower:** Christ took upon Himself human nature ("made a little lower than the angels") to meet man where he was. He entered the battlefield where Adam fell.
*   **Suffering of Death:** The penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23). Before the title deed of the earth could be returned to man, the penalty of the broken law had to be paid. Jesus paid that debt on Calvary.
*   **Tasted Death for Every Man:** This is the heart of the Gospel. He took our death so He could give us His life. By conquering death, He stripped Satan of his power (Hebrews 2:14).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot win back the dominion by our own works. It was lost by sin; it is recovered only by the perfect righteousness of Christ imputed to us and imparted to us.

**[ILL]** If a father gambles away the family estate, the children are left homeless. They cannot buy it back because they are penniless. But a wealthy, benevolent brother steps in, pays the debt, and restores the deed to the family. Jesus is that Brother.

### Q8. What blessing did our Saviour pronounce upon the meek?
"Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth." Matt. 5:5.

**Answer:**

Jesus confirms that the earth—renewed and restored—is the final reward of the saints.

*   **Who are the Meek?** Meekness is not weakness. It is strength under control, submitted to God. It is the spirit of Jesus, who "made himself of no reputation" (Philippians 2:7). The meek are those who have ceased trying to justify themselves and trust wholly in Christ’s righteousness.
*   **Inheritance:** An inheritance is a gift, not a wage. We do not earn the new earth; we inherit it because we are adopted children of the King.
*   **Future Reality:** This promise is future. In the present world, the aggressive, the proud, and the ruthless often seem to "own" the earth. But their possession is temporary. The meek wait for God to vindicate them.

### Q9. Who does David say have the most of earthly things?
"For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked... Their eyes stand out with fatness; they have more than heart could wish." Ps. 73:3-7.

**Answer:**

In this present evil age, it often appears that the wicked are winning. They frequently possess the wealth, the political power, and the prime lands of this earth.

*   **The Envy of the Righteous:** Even the psalmist Asaph struggled when he saw the wicked prosper while the righteous suffered. This is a common trial of faith.
*   **The Deception of Appearances:** Material prosperity is not a sign of God’s favor, nor is poverty a sign of His displeasure. Satan often rewards his followers with temporary gain (Luke 4:6), but it is a trap.

**[ILL]** A fattened calf may seem to be "prospering" more than the ox that pulls the plow daily. It eats and rests all day. But the calf is being prepared for slaughter, while the ox is useful to the master.

---

### Q10. Will there be a difference between the portion of the righteous and that of the wicked?
"Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it." Ps. 37:34.

**Answer:**

Yes, a reversal is coming. The current state of affairs is not permanent.

*   **"Wait on the Lord":** This is the posture of faith. We do not take matters into our own hands to seize power. We trust in God's timing.
*   **The Wicked Cut Off:** There is a judgment coming. The sanctuary service teaches us that sin cannot exist forever in God's universe. Eventually, the "scapegoat" (Satan and his followers) will be separated forever from the camp of the saints (Leviticus 16).
*   **Inherit the Land:** The righteous will stand on the earth when the wicked are no more (Malachi 4:1–3).

---

### Q11. What promise was made to Abram concerning the land?
"And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever." Gen.13:14, 15.

**Answer:**

God made an unconditional covenant with Abraham to give him the land.

*   **"To Thee":** Notice the promise was personal. "To *thee* will I give it." Abraham himself was promised the land, not just his descendants.
*   **"Forever":** This promise implies eternal life. Abraham ultimately died. For him to possess this land "forever," there must be a resurrection and a world where death no longer exists.

**Definition:** *Covenant* – A solemn, binding agreement. God's covenant with Abraham is the foundation of the gospel, promising a land and a Seed (Christ) through whom all nations would be blessed.

---

### Q12. How much did this promise comprehend?
"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith." Rom. 4:13.

**Answer:**

The apostle Paul expands the promise to its full dimension: Abraham was to be heir of the **whole world**.

*   **Not Through the Law:** We cannot earn the New Earth by keeping the law. If inheritance depended on our perfect performance, we would all be disinherited, for "all have sinned" (Romans 3:23).
*   **Through Righteousness of Faith:** This is the core of the Gospel. Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness (Genesis 15:6).
    *   **Justification:** We are declared righteous by faith in Christ's blood.
    *   **Sanctification:** By faith, Christ lives His life in us, fitting us for that holy land.
*   **The Scope:** It wasn't just about a small strip of land in the Middle East; that was a type of the greater reality—a renewed, sinless planet.

**[ILL]** A man cannot walk to the moon on a ladder of his own making (works/law). He must be carried there by a vehicle designed for the journey. Likewise, we cannot reach the New Earth by the ladder of our own good deeds. We are carried there by the vehicle of Grace, entered through Faith.

### Q13. How much of the land of Canaan did Abraham own in his lifetime?
"And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on; yet He promised that He would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child." Acts 7:5. (Heb. 11:13).

**Answer:**

Historically, Abraham owned nothing but a burial cave (Machpelah) which he had to buy with his own money. He lived as a nomad.

*   **The Delay:** God often tests faith by delay. Abraham had the *promise* (the title deed) in his heart, but not the *possession* under his feet.
*   **Died in Faith:** Hebrews 11:13 says he died "not having received the promises." This proves that the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant is yet future, to be realized after the resurrection of the just.

---

### Q14. How much of the promised possession did Abraham expect during his lifetime?
"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God." Heb. 11:8-10.

**Answer:**

Abraham understood that the earthly Canaan was a symbol of something greater. He was not looking for a temporal kingdom, but an eternal one.

*   **Strange Country:** He lived as a stranger (pilgrim) because he knew this present world, marred by sin, was not his true home.
*   **The City with Foundations:** He looked for the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21). Tents are temporary; foundations are permanent. Abraham sought a permanent righteousness and a permanent home, built by God.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the tabernacle in the wilderness was a temporary dwelling for God's presence until the temple was built, our life here is a temporary sojourn until we reach the solid "city of God."

---

### Q15. Who is the seed to whom the Abrahamic promise was made?
"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to "seeds" as of many: but as of one, And to thy "seed," which is Christ." Gal. 3:16.

**Answer:**

This is the vital key to the prophecy. The true Heir of the world is **Jesus Christ**.

*   **The Singular Seed:** The promise centers on Christ. He is the one who obeyed God perfectly. He is the one who conquered Satan. Therefore, the title deed to the earth belongs legally to Him.
*   **Christ Centeredness:** All God's promises are "Yea and Amen" in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20). We cannot claim the promises apart from Him.

---

### Q16. Who are counted heirs of that promise?
"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3:29.

**Answer:**

This is the glorious truth of Righteousness by Faith: **Union with Christ makes us heirs.**

*   **"If ye be Christ's":** When we surrender to Jesus and accept His sacrifice, we become part of His body.
*   **Joint-Heirs:** Because the inheritance belongs to Christ (the Seed), those who are *in* Christ share in that inheritance (Romans 8:17).
*   **Not by Bloodline:** It is not physical descent from Abraham that matters, but spiritual descent through faith in Jesus.
*   **Spiritual Application:** We do not earn the inheritance by our works, but by our relationship (marriage) to the Heir. When a poor woman marries a wealthy prince, she instantly becomes owner of all he possesses. When we are joined to Christ, we become heirs of the world.

---

### Q17. Why did not these ancient worthies receive the promise?
"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise, God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect." Heb. 11:39, 40.

**Answer:**

God has a collective plan for His family. He waits so that all His children—from Adam to the very last soul saved—can enter the reward together.

*   **Without Us:** The saints of old are waiting for us. They are sleeping in their graves (John 5:28, 29; Acts 2:34). They did not go immediately to heaven to receive the inheritance at death.
*   **Made Perfect:** This refers to the glorification at the resurrection. The family circle will not be broken. We will all be "caught up together" (1 Thessalonians 4:17).
*   **The "Better Thing":** The grand reunion at the Second Coming.

---

### Q18. What is to become of our earth in the day of the Lord?
"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also; and the works that are therein shall be burned up." 2 Peter 3:10. (Isa. 13:9) (Isa. 24:1-6) (Jer. 4:23-27).

**Answer:**

Before the earth can be the home of the saved, it must be cleansed of every trace of sin. This involves a purifying fire.

*   **The Cleansing Fire:** Just as the world was once cleansed by water (the Flood), it will be cleansed by fire. This fire destroys Satan, sinners, and the very marks of sin on the planet (Malachi 4:1).
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the sanctuary service, the sin was transferred to the sanctuary, then cleansed. Finally, the camp was cleansed. This fire is the final act of atonement—the total eradication of sin from the universe.
*   **Not Annihilation of Substance:** The "works" are burned, and the "elements melt," but the planet itself is purified to be remade, not blotted out of existence.

---

### Q19. What will follow this great conflagration?
"Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:13. (Rev. 21:1-5).

**Answer:**

From the ashes of the old world, God recreates a glorious new home.

*   **"Wherein Dwelleth Righteousness":** This is the defining characteristic of the New Earth.
    *   No more rebellion.
    *   No more selfishness.
    *   The law of God (love) is written on every heart and reflected in every action.
*   **The Home of the Saved:** It is a real place for real people with resurrected bodies. It is not a ghostly existence on clouds, but a restored Edenic life.

**[ILL]** A refiner of gold puts the ore into the fire not to destroy the gold, but to burn away the dross (impurities). When the fire is finished, only the pure gold remains. God's fire burns away the dross of sin, leaving the pure gold of a restored creation.

---

### Q20. To what promise did Peter refer, when saying that he looked for new heavens and a new earth?
"For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind." Isa. 65:17.

**Answer:**

Peter was quoting the prophet Isaiah. This confirms the unity of the Old and New Testaments on the hope of the righteous.

*   **"Former Shall Not Be Remembered":** This does not mean a memory wipe where we forget who we are. It means the *pain*, the *trauma*, and the *sting* of the past will no longer burden us. The joy of the present will far outweigh the sorrows of the past.
*   **New Creation:** God uses the word "create" (bara)—the same word used in Genesis 1:1. He is making all things new (Revelation 21:5).

---

### Q21. What will be the condition of things in the new earth?
"The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock, and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, saith the Lord." Isa. 65:25.

**Answer:**

The curse of sin is lifted from the animal kingdom and nature itself.

*   **Peace in Nature:** The law of force and predation—animals killing one another—is a result of sin. In the New Earth, the law of love pervades even the animal creation.
*   **No Hurt nor Destroy:** This is the standard of God's kingdom.
*   **Practical Application:** If we hope to live in a kingdom where no one hurts or destroys, we must allow the Holy Spirit to remove the spirit of hurting and destroying (anger, malice, gossip) from our hearts *now*. We must practice the manners of the heavenly country before we arrive there.

---

### Q22. How will the ransomed demonstrate their joy in that place?
"And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away." Isa. 35:10.

**Answer:**

The saved will be a singing people. The burden of sin, guilt, sickness, and death will be lifted forever.

*   **The Ransomed:** Those who have been bought back by the blood of Christ.
*   **Everlasting Joy:** Not the fleeting happiness of this world, which is often followed by sorrow, but a joy that deepens throughout eternity.
*   **No Sorrow:** Every tear is wiped away by God's own hand (Revelation 21:4).

---

### Q23. How extensive will be the reign of Christ at that time?
"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth." Ps. 72:8.

**Answer:**

Christ's kingdom will not be limited to Palestine or a specific region. It will be global and universal.

*   **Total Dominion:** The entire planet, which was kidnapped by Satan, is fully recovered. "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof" (Psalm 24:1).
*   **One King:** There will be no rival political parties, no warring nations. There will be one Lord, and His name One (Zechariah 14:9).

---

### Q24. What does Daniel say of this kingdom?
"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him." Dan. 7:27.

**Answer:**

The prophecy of Daniel concludes with the vindication of the saints. After the judgment is set and the books are opened (Daniel 7:10), the kingdom is awarded to Christ and His people.

*   **Given to the Saints:** God shares His dominion. We are "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans 8:17).
*   **Everlasting:** It will never be conquered or pass away.
*   **The High Calling:** God invites you to be part of this kingdom. It is offered freely to all who will accept the righteousness of the King. By faith in Jesus, we may have our citizenship registered in that kingdom today, and soon, we shall possess it in reality.

**[ILL]** When a great war ends, the soldiers go home to peace. We are currently in the battlefield of the Great Controversy. But the promise is sure: The war will end, the enemy will be defeated, and the soldiers of the cross will inherit the land of peace forever.
