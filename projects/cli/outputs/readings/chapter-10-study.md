### Q1. In what does the Lord delight?

**"Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the
transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger
forever, because he delighteth in mercy." Micah 7:18.**

**Answer:**

God’s character is the foundation of the entire plan of salvation. While human
courts often delight in judgment and condemnation, the Creator of the universe
finds His highest joy in showing mercy.

1.  **The Uniqueness of God:** The prophet asks, "Who is a God like unto thee?"
    In heathen religions, gods were often depicted as angry deities needing
    appeasement. In contrast, the God of the Bible actively seeks to pardon.
2.  **Pardoning Iniquity:** The word "pardon" here implies lifting a heavy
    burden. In the sanctuary service, the sinner transferred their sin to the
    lamb, and the priest symbolically bore that iniquity into the sanctuary.
    This foreshadowed Christ bearing our sins in His own body (1 Peter 2:24).
3.  **The Remnant:** The text specifically mentions the "remnant of his
    heritage."
    - _Definition:_ **Remnant** refers to the faithful group at the end of time
      who keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus (Revelation
      12:17). Even for this faithful group, acceptance is based on God's
      pardoning mercy, not their own inherent merit.
4.  **Mercy, Not Anger:** God’s anger is real—it is His settled opposition to
    sin because sin destroys His creation. However, anger is His "strange work"
    (Isaiah 28:21). His "delight" (His natural preference and joy) is mercy.

**[ILL]** Imagine a judge who must uphold the law against a criminal who is also
his estranged son. The judge hates the crime because it has ruined his son’s
life. He must pronounce the sentence to be just; but then he steps down from the
bench, takes off his robe, and pays the full penalty himself so he can embrace
the son. The judge delights not in the sentence, but in the restoration.

### Q2. How is His mercy continually manifested?

**"It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions
fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness." Lamentations
3:22, 23.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Protection from Destruction:** Because "the wages of sin is death" (Romans
    6:23), the natural result of rebellion is destruction. That we are alive
    today is evidence that God is holding back the winds of strife to give us
    time for repentance. We are not consumed because He is shielding us.
2.  **Daily Renewal:** The Christian life is not powered by a one-time
    experience in the past. God’s mercies are "new every morning." This teaches
    us the necessity of **daily consecration**. Just as the manna in the
    wilderness had to be gathered fresh every morning (Exodus 16:21), so we must
    receive fresh grace from Christ each day to live victoriously.
3.  **Unfailing Compassion:** Human patience runs out; God's does not. His
    faithfulness depends on His character, not ours (2 Timothy 2:13).

**[ILL]** The sun rises every morning to dispel the darkness, regardless of what
crimes were committed under the cover of night. It does not ask permission to
shine; it simply gives light. So God’s mercy rises upon us each day, offering a
fresh start and the power to walk in the light.

### Q3. Is His mercy limited to any special class?

**"Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing
he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things." Acts 17:25. "That ye may be
the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on
the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."
Matthew 5:45.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Universal Benevolence:** God is the source of all life. Every breath taken
    by a skeptic or a sinner is a gift from the very God they may deny. This
    "common grace" (sun and rain) is given to all to lead them to repentance
    (Romans 2:4).
2.  **God’s Independence:** God does not need our service; we need His life. He
    is the great Giver.
3.  **The Standard for Believers:** Jesus uses this fact to teach us how to
    treat others. If God blesses the "evil and the unjust," we cannot limit our
    kindness only to those who agree with us or belong to our "class." We are to
    reflect the character of our Father.

---

### Q4. How has mankind repaid Him for His love in creating them and giving them all things to enjoy?

**"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Romans 3:23. See
Isaiah 1:4-6.**

**Answer:**

Despite God's constant care, the human response has been rebellion.

1.  **The Universal Condition:** "All have sinned." There is no room for human
    pride. Whether one is a moralist or an open criminal, the heart is naturally
    at enmity with God (Romans 8:7).
2.  **Defining Sin:**
    - _Definition:_ **Sin** is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4). It is
      a wandering away from the path of God's government.
3.  **Coming Short of the Glory:**
    - _Definition:_ **The Glory of God** is His character (Exodus 33:18–19;
      34:6–7).
    - Man was created in God's image, but sin marred that image. To "come short"
      means we fail to reflect the self-sacrificing love and perfect
      righteousness of God. We were made to be temples for His Spirit, but the
      temple has been defiled.
4.  **Total Corruption (Isaiah 1:4-6):** Isaiah describes the spiritual
    condition of humanity as a body full of "wounds, and bruises, and putrifying
    sores." Sin is a leprosy that the sinner cannot cure himself.

**[ILL]** If you have a chain holding a ship to an anchor, it does not matter if
one link breaks or ten links break; the connection is severed. Humanity has
broken the chain of obedience that connects us to heaven. We have drifted
"short" of the harbor.

---

### Q5. While all men were in this condition, how did God still further show His love to them?

**"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John
3:16. "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8.**

**Answer:**

Here is the heart of the Gospel and the foundation of Righteousness by Faith.

1.  **The Initiative of God:** God did not wait for us to become righteous
    before He loved us. He acted "while we were yet sinners."
2.  **The Cost of the Gift:** He "gave his only begotten Son." This was not a
    loan; it was a permanent gift. Christ took upon Himself human nature
    forever. The infinite God paid an infinite price to ransom us.
3.  **The Purpose—Salvation from Perishing:**
    - _Definition:_ **Atonement** refers to the reconciliation between God and
      man through the sacrifice and priestly ministry of Jesus.
    - Without this gift, the inevitable result of sin is to "perish" (cease to
      exist, eternal death). God’s love provided a way of escape that satisfies
      the law's demands while saving the sinner.
4.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We are saved not by working our way up to God,
    but by believing in the One He sent down to us. This faith is a transaction:
    we give Him our sins; He gives us His righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21).

---

### Q6. Is there any difference between the love of the Father and that of the son?

**"I and my Father are one." John 10:30. "Believe me that I am in the Father,
and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake." John
14:11.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Perfect Unity:** There is a false idea that the Father is stern and angry,
    needing the gentle Son to convince Him to be merciful. The Bible rejects
    this. The Father _sent_ the Son. Their love is identical.
2.  **God in Christ:** "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself"
    (2 Corinthians 5:19). When we look at Jesus—His compassion for the leper,
    His tears at Lazarus’s grave, His forgiveness of the thief on the cross—we
    are seeing the exact character of the Father.
3.  **One Purpose:** The Father and Son cooperate perfectly in the plan of
    salvation. The Father gave the Son; the Son gave Himself; the Spirit applies
    the gift.

**[ILL]** A ray of light and the heat from the sun are distinct, yet they
originate from the same source and work together to bring life to the earth. You
cannot have the sun's warmth without its light. So the Father and Son are one in
nature and purpose.

---

### Q7. Into what relationship to God does His love bring us, if we accept it?

**"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should
be called the sons of God; therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew
him not." 1 John 3:1.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Adoption (Justification):**
    - _Definition:_ **Justification** is the legal declaration that a believer
      is reinstated as a child of God, treated as if they had never sinned.
    - This is a change of _status_. We were rebels; now we are sons and
      daughters.
2.  **Transformation:** The verse implies a change in nature as well. Because we
    become sons of God, we begin to resemble Him.
3.  **Alienation from the World:** Because the world operates on principles of
    selfishness and force, it cannot understand a life operating on love and
    humility. As we become like Jesus, the world will misunderstand us just as
    it misunderstood Him. This is a sign of true conversion.

---

### Q8. What is given us to show that we are sons?

**"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye
have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the
Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth
witness with out spirit, that we are the children of God." Romans 8:14-16.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Evidence of Sonship:** How do we know we are God's children? It is not
    merely a feeling, but a fact of being "led by the Spirit."
    - To be _led_ implies movement and progress. The Spirit leads us away from
      sin and into obedience to God's law (Ezekiel 36:27).
2.  **From Fear to Love:** The "spirit of bondage" is legalism—serving God only
    out of fear of punishment. The "Spirit of adoption" is the spirit of a
    loving child who obeys the Father because they love Him.
    - _Definition:_ **Sanctification** is the work of the Holy Spirit to impart
      Christ's holy character to us, making us obedient from the heart.
3.  **The Witness:** The Holy Spirit gives us an internal assurance (peace with
    God) that aligns with the external witness (a changed life in harmony with
    the Bible).

---

### Q9. What does the Holy Spirit beget in the hearts of those who receive it?

**"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us." Romans 5:5.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The New Covenant Experience:**
    - The essence of the New Covenant is God writing His law in our hearts
      (Hebrews 8:10).
    - Since "love is the fulfilling of the law" (Romans 13:10), when the Holy
      Spirit sheds the **love of God** abroad in our hearts, He is effectively
      writing the law there.
2.  **A Supernatural Gift:** We cannot manufacture this love. It is not human
    affection. It is the divine nature implanted in humanity.
3.  **Hope that Stands:** This experience gives us a hope that does not
    disappoint ("make ashamed") because it is based on the reality of Christ's
    presence in the soul, not on our own weak promises.

**[ILL]** A dry canal cannot water the fields no matter how hard it tries. But
if a river is diverted into the canal, the water flows naturally and brings
life. Our hearts are the canal; the Holy Spirit is the river of God's love. When
He fills us, love flows out naturally.

---

### Q10. If the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, what effect will it have?

**"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another." 1 John
4:11.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Inevitable Result:** You cannot contain the love of God. If it is
    truly in the heart, it _must_ flow out to others.
2.  **The Test of Profession:** The apostle John argues that it is impossible to
    love God (whom we haven't seen) while hating our brother (whom we have seen)
    (1 John 4:20).
3.  **Horizontal and Vertical:** The Ten Commandments are two tables: love to
    God (vertical) and love to man (horizontal). True Righteousness by Faith
    restores both. We treat others with grace because we have been treated with
    grace.

---

### Q11. How much must we love one another?

**"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you." John
15:12. "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for
us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren." 1 John 3:16.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Standard:** The measure is not human kindness, but "as I have loved
    you." This is **self-sacrificing love**.
2.  **Laying Down Life:** This does not always mean physical martyrdom. It means
    dying to self daily (1 Corinthians 15:31). It means sacrificing our time,
    our convenience, our resources, and our pride for the good of others.
3.  **The Commandment:** Jesus calls this "My commandment." Obedience to this
    command is the fruit of the Gospel. It is impossible for the natural man,
    but natural to the man filled with Christ’s Spirit.

---

### Q12. What exhortation is based upon Christ's love for us?

**"And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us
an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour." Ephesians 5:2.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Sanctuary Imagery:** The phrase "offering and sacrifice... for a
    sweetsmelling savour" is language from the earthly sanctuary (Leviticus
    1:9). It represents a life fully consumed and dedicated to God, rising as
    pleasant incense before Him.
2.  **The Walk:** We are to "walk in love." This implies a continuous, active
    lifestyle, not just a theory.
3.  **Imitation of Christ:** Christ's entire life was a sacrifice for others. We
    are called to enter into the fellowship of His sufferings. When we deny self
    to help another, it is a "sweet savor" to God.

---

### Q13. If we have the love of God, will we love only those who love us?

**"Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate
thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and
persecute you." Matthew 5:43, 44. "For if ye love them which love you, what
reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?" Matthew 5:46.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Distinctive Mark of Christianity:** Loving family and friends is
    natural; even "publicans" (tax collectors, considered sinners) do that.
    Loving an enemy is supernatural. It is the definitive proof that God is
    living in the heart.
2.  **Active Love:** Note the verbs: _Love, Bless, Do Good, Pray_. This is not a
    passive feeling, but active kindness toward those who are hostile.
3.  **Perfection of Character:** In verse 48 (the conclusion of this thought),
    Jesus says, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
    is perfect."
    - _Context:_ Perfection here is defined as loving impartially, just as God
      gives rain to the just and unjust. It is maturity in love.

**[ILL]** A sandalwood tree perfumes the very axe that chops it down. This is
the nature of Christ’s love—forgiveness for those who nailed Him to the cross.

---

### Q14. Did God love us because of any good that we had done?

**"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy
he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;
Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour." Titus 3:5, 6.
"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even
when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye
are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly
places in Christ Jesus." Ephesians 2:4-6.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Not by Works:** We are not saved _by_ our good works, though we are
    created _unto_ good works (Ephesians 2:10). The cause of our salvation is
    God's mercy; works are the result.
2.  **Washing of Regeneration:**
    - _Definition:_ **Regeneration** means being "born again." It is the
      imparting of a new spiritual life to a soul that was "dead in sins."
    - This "washing" alludes to baptism and the cleansing power of the Word
      (Ephesians 5:26).
3.  **Dead in Sins:** A dead man cannot resuscitate himself. We were spiritually
    dead. God "quickened" (made alive) us.
4.  **Grace:**
    - _Definition:_ **Grace** is God's unmerited favor and His enabling power
      given to those who deserve the opposite.

---

### Q15. What alone should prompt all our acts?

**"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one
died for all, then were all dead." 2 Corinthians 5:14.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Motivation for Obedience:** True obedience is not driven by the whip
    of the law or the fear of hell. It is driven by the "constraining" love of
    Christ.
    - The word "constrain" means to grip, to hold together, or to urge forward.
      When we realize the price paid for us at Calvary, we cannot help but live
      for Him.
2.  **The Logic of the Cross:** "If one died for all, then were all dead." We
    owe our very lives to Him. Therefore, we no longer live for ourselves, but
    for Him (v. 15).
3.  **Love-Based Service:** Any service rendered to God that does not spring
    from love is legalism and is unacceptable. God looks at the heart.

---

### Q16. In what other way is God's love manifested to His people?

**"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent."
Revelation 3:19. "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
son whom he receiveth." Hebrews 12:6.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Discipline as Love:** We often view hardship as a sign of God's
    displeasure. The Bible teaches that discipline is a sign of sonship. An
    indifferent father lets his child run wild; a loving father corrects the
    child to save him from ruin.
2.  **Purpose of Chastening:** Hebrews 12:10 tells us the purpose: "that we
    might be partakers of his holiness." God allows trials to refine our
    characters, remove the dross of selfishness, and fit us for heaven.
3.  **The Call to Repentance:** When we feel the rebuke of the Holy Spirit or
    the discipline of life, the proper response is zeal and repentance, not
    discouragement.

**[ILL]** A sculptor chiseling a block of marble strikes it hard, not to destroy
the marble, but to remove the rough edges so the beautiful image can be
revealed. God is the sculptor; we are the marble.

---

### Q17. What may we confidently expect, from the fact that God so loved us as to give Christ to die for us?

**"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he
not with him also freely give us all things?" Romans 8:32.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Argument from the Greater to the Lesser:** If God has already given
    the greatest gift possible (His Son), will He withhold the smaller gifts we
    need (strength, wisdom, daily bread, victory over sin)?
2.  **Freely Give:** The resources of heaven are open to the believer.
3.  **"All Things":** This encompasses everything necessary for life and
    godliness (2 Peter 1:3). It assures us that there is no sin too strong for
    us to overcome, for God provides the power.

---

### Q18. What is God's love for His children able to do when enemies rise up against them?

**"Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy
God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved
thee." Deuteronomy 23:5.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Sovereignty Over Evil:** Balaam was hired to curse Israel, but God
    physically prevented the curse. God can overrule the malice of men and
    devils.
2.  **Curse into Blessing:** This is a principle of the Kingdom. Joseph’s
    brothers meant evil, but God meant it for good (Genesis 50:20). The cross
    was the greatest evil man could do, yet God turned it into the greatest
    blessing (salvation).
3.  **Security:** The reason given is simple: "because the Lord thy God loved
    thee." We are safe in His love.

---

### Q19. If we appreciate this loving kindness, what will we do?

**"How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put
their trust under the shadow of thy wings." Psalms 36:7.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Trust:** The natural response to realizing God's love is trust (faith).
    Faith is simply taking God at His word.
2.  **Shadow of Thy Wings:** This imagery suggests the sanctuary (the cherubim
    wings over the mercy seat) and nature (a mother hen protecting her chicks).
    It implies intimacy, protection, and nearness.
3.  **Refuge:** When we know God loves us, we run _to_ Him when we sin or
    suffer, rather than running _away_ from Him.

---

### Q20. How enduring is God's love to us?

**"The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an
everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee." Jeremiah
31:3.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Everlasting Love:** God’s love had no beginning and will have no end. It
    is not a temporary emotion but an eternal principle.
2.  **Drawing Power:** "With lovingkindness have I drawn thee." We do not come
    to God by our own initiative. He is constantly drawing us by His Spirit.
3.  **Perseverance:** Even when Israel failed, God’s love remained to draw them
    back. This gives us hope that if we are wandering, His love is still
    pursuing us.

---

### Q21. Can anything turn aside the love of God for those who trust Him?

**"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Romans 8:38, 39.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Total Security in Christ:** Paul lists every conceivable power—political,
    spiritual, physical, temporal—and declares them unable to sever the bond
    between the believer and God.
2.  **The Condition:** This promise is for those "in Christ Jesus."
3.  **Personal Choice:** While no _external_ force can separate us, we can
    separate ourselves by choosing to walk away or cherishing sin (Isaiah 59:2).
    But as long as we choose to trust Him, no enemy can pluck us from His hand
    (John 10:28).

---

### Q22. Unto whom will the saints of God ascribe universal praise both here and in eternity?

**"And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of
the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and
washed us from our sins in his own blood." Revelation 1:5.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Center of Praise:** All praise is directed to Jesus Christ. The song
    of the redeemed is not about their own achievements, but about His love and
    His blood.
2.  **Washed From Sins:**
    - This refers to the complete work of **Salvation**.
    - _Justification:_ Being forgiven of the guilt of sin.
    - _Sanctification:_ Being cleansed from the defilement and power of sin.
    - The blood of Christ (His sacrificed life) is the only agent that can
      cleanse the conscience (Hebrews 9:14).
3.  **The Motivation for Eternity:** We will love Him forever because He first
    loved us. This love will be the study and the song of the saved throughout
    ceaseless ages.

**[ILL]** A man rescued from a burning building does not brag about how he
climbed down the ladder; he points to the firefighter who carried him out
through the flames. In heaven, we will point only to the Lamb of God.
