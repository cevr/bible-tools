Based on the title **"A Remarkable Symbol,"** this study covers the prophecy of **Daniel 8**, specifically the vision of the Ram, the He-Goat, and the Little Horn power that attacks the Sanctuary.

This chapter explores how God foretold the rise and fall of empires and the great spiritual conflict between earthly systems of worship and the true ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.

*Note: As the specific questions were not provided in the prompt, the standard questions associated with this classic "Bible Readings for the Home Circle" topic have been reconstructed and expanded below.*

### Q1. At what time was the vision of Daniel 8 given?

**Verse:** "In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first." (Daniel 8:1)

**Answer:**
This vision was given toward the close of the Babylonian empire, shortly before the events of the writing on the wall (Daniel 5). While Daniel 2 showed the political history of the world through a metal image, and Daniel 7 through carnivorous beasts, Daniel 8 shifts the imagery to the **Sanctuary**.

1.  **Sanctuary Imagery:** The symbols used here (a ram and a goat) are sacrificial animals used in the sanctuary service, specifically on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:5). This indicates that the vision is not merely political, but deeply religious—it concerns the plan of salvation and God’s method of dealing with sin.
2.  **God's Foreknowledge:** God gives light before darkness comes. Just as Babylon was about to fall, God gave His people a roadmap for the future so their faith would not fail (Isaiah 46:9–10).

### Q2. What was the first symbol presented to the prophet?

**Verse:** "Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last." (Daniel 8:3)

**Answer:**
The first symbol is a ram with two horns. The angel Gabriel explicitly interprets this symbol later in the chapter: "The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia" (Daniel 8:20).

*   **Historical Fulfillment:** This represents the Medo-Persian empire.
*   **The Two Horns:** The horn that came up last and was higher represents the Persian element of the empire, which became stronger and more dominant than the Medes, though they rose to power later.
*   **No Fighting Against God:** The ram pushed "westward, and northward, and southward" (verse 4), and no beast could stand before it. This shows that when God allows a nation to rise, no human power can prevent it until God's purpose is accomplished (Daniel 2:21).

**[ILL] The Tide of History:** Men often think they shape history through their military genius or political strategy. However, they are like driftwood on a rising tide; they move only where the tide takes them. The rise of Medo-Persia was decreed by God years before Cyrus was born (Isaiah 45:1), proving that God is the true Sovereign of the nations.

### Q3. What symbol was next introduced?

**Verse:** "And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes." (Daniel 8:5)

**Answer:**
While Daniel watched the ram, a he-goat appeared. The angel identifies this power: "And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king" (Daniel 8:21).

1.  **Speed of Conquest:** The goat moving so fast that it "touched not the ground" symbolizes the incredible speed of Alexander the Great's conquests. In roughly a decade, the Greek forces swept across the known world, conquering the vast Persian empire.
2.  **The Notable Horn:** This represents Alexander the Great.
3.  **The Fury:** Verse 6 describes the goat running in "the fury of his power." This represents the intense conflict between East and West, foreshadowing that earthly kingdoms are built on force, violence, and pride.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Prophetic Symbolism:** The Bible uses physical objects (like animals) to represent abstract realities (like kingdoms or political powers) to impart a moral lesson about their character (e.g., predatory, swift, strong).

***

### Q4. What happened to the "notable horn" when it was strong?

**Verse:** "Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven." (Daniel 8:8)

**Answer:**
At the height of his power, having conquered the world and with no enemies left to fight, Alexander the Great died (reportedly of a fever and intemperance) at the age of 32 (323 B.C.).

*   **Human Fragility:** This underlines a distinct Bible truth: "Let not the mighty man glory in his might" (Jeremiah 9:23). Alexander could conquer nations, but he could not conquer his own appetites or death.
*   **The Four Horns:** After his death, his kingdom was not passed to his sons. Instead, it was divided among his four leading generals (Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus), exactly as the prophecy predicted—"toward the four winds."

**[ILL] The Broken Pillar:** Imagine a massive marble pillar holding up a great roof. Suddenly, it snaps not from external weight, but from a flaw within. Alexander’s empire did not fall to an outside army; it broke because the man at the center was mortal and flawed. Our only sure foundation is the Rock, Christ Jesus, which can never be broken (1 Corinthians 10:4).

***

### Q5. What new power arises from one of the four winds?

**Verse:** "And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land." (Daniel 8:9)

**Answer:**
This "little horn" represents the power of **Rome**, which succeeded Greece. It appears in two phases: first as Pagan Rome (the political empire that ruled during Christ's life) and second as Papal Rome (the religious-political power that ruled during the Middle Ages).

1.  **Exceeding Great:** While the Ram was "great" and the Goat was "very great," this Little Horn becomes "exceeding great." It represents a power that extends its influence not just politically, but spiritually, dominating the conscience of man.
2.  **The Pleasant Land:** This refers to Palestine/Judea. Rome conquered this territory in 63 B.C., and it was under Roman authority that Jesus was born, ministered, and was crucified.

### Q6. How does this power treat the "Prince of the host"?

**Verse:** "Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down." (Daniel 8:11)

**Answer:**
Here the prophecy shifts from military battles to a spiritual war against Christ and His ministry.

*   **The Prince of the Host:** This is Jesus Christ, the Commander of the armies of heaven (Joshua 5:14).
*   **Magnifying Himself:** This power sets itself up as a rival to Christ, claiming prerogatives that belong only to God (2 Thessalonians 2:4).
*   **Taking Away the "Daily":** The word "sacrifice" is supplied by translators. The Hebrew is simply *Ha-Tamid* ("The Daily" or "The Continual"). In the sanctuary, this refers to the continual ministry of the High Priest.
    *   By establishing an earthly priesthood, earthly sacrifices (the mass), and an earthly mediator (the pope/priests), this power obscured the view of Christ's **continual** (daily) mediation in the heavenly sanctuary.
    *   It effectively "took away" the reliance of the people on Jesus' direct intercession.

**Righteousness by Faith Insight:**
Salvation is found only in direct communion with Christ by faith. When a system interposes human priests or rituals between the sinner and the Savior, it "casts down" the truth of the Gospel. We are justified freely by God's grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus (Romans 3:24), not through human systems.

***

### Q7. What was done to the truth?

**Verse:** "And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered." (Daniel 8:12)

**Answer:**
This verse describes a period of spiritual darkness where the truth of God was trampled.

1.  **Truth Cast Down:** The "truth" includes the law of God (Psalm 119:142) and the gospel of the sanctuary. The Little Horn power attempted to change God’s law (Daniel 7:25) and substituted a system of works for salvation by faith.
2.  **By Reason of Transgression:** Error prospers when people turn away from the law of God. When the law is set aside, the gospel is also misunderstood, for the law shows us our need for the gospel (Romans 3:20).
3.  **It Prospered:** For a long time (the 1260 years of papal supremacy), this system seemed to win. But God merely tolerates evil for a season to reveal its true character before the universe.

***

### Q8. What question was asked concerning this desolation?

**Verse:** "Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?" (Daniel 8:13)

**Answer:**
The cry of the universe is "How long?" (Revelation 6:10). How long will truth be trampled? How long will the character of God be misrepresented? How long until the ministry of Christ is fully vindicated and understood?

The question specifically concerns the **Sanctuary**. The central issue is the restoration of the knowledge of God's way of salvation—how a sinner can be made right with God without human intermediaries.

***

### Q9. What was the answer regarding the time?

**Verse:** "And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." (Daniel 8:14)

**Answer:**
This is the longest time prophecy in the Bible.

1.  **The Time Span:** In Bible prophecy, a day represents a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). Thus, this period is 2,300 literal years.
2.  **The Event:** "Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." In the earthly tabernacle, the sanctuary was cleansed once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This was a day of judgment where sin was symbolically removed from the camp (Leviticus 16).
3.  **The Application:** This points to the end-time work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary—the **Investigative Judgment**. Before Christ returns, there is a work of examination to see who has truly accepted the robe of Christ's righteousness.

**Term Definition:**
*   **Cleansing of the Sanctuary:** The final phase of Christ’s High Priestly ministry. Just as the earthly priest cleansed the earthly tabernacle once a year, Christ entered the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary (at the end of the 2300 days, in 1844) to blot out the record of sin and prepare a people for His coming.

**[ILL] The Courtroom:** Imagine a courtroom where the judge reviews the cases before issuing the verdicts. The verdict is not based on the defendant's perfect performance, but on whether they have a competent Advocate (Lawyer). The cleansing of the sanctuary is that review. If we rely on our own works, we are lost. If we rely on Christ our High Priest, His righteousness covers us, and our sins are blotted out (Acts 3:19).

**Practical Conclusion:**
The message of Daniel 8 is that while earthly powers may attack God's truth and substitute human works for divine grace, God has a set time to restore the truth. The "cleansing of the sanctuary" is a call for us to turn our eyes to heaven, to afflict our souls (repent), and to trust entirely in the merits of Jesus, who is now finishing His work of atonement on our behalf.
