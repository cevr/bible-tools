## Slide 1 – Q1: The Timing of the Vision

- **Question:** Daniel's second vision was given at what time?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:1 – “In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **Chronological Context:**
  - This vision occurs *before* Daniel 5 (the fall of Babylon).
  - The empire was nearing its end; God gave the aging prophet a panoramic view of history.
- **God Reveals the Future:**
  - Before major crises, God reveals His plans.
  - Amos 3:7 – “Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.”
- **The Written Word:**
  - Daniel “wrote the dream.”
  - Prophecy is recorded for future generations to test and find strength in.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - While earthly kings feasted, Heaven was recording history.
  - This vision reveals the cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Ship Captain:**
  - Imagine a captain navigating treacherous waters at night.
  - Before the storm hits, he consults his chart to locate hidden rocks.
- **The Application:**
  - God provides prophecy as a "chart" of history.
  - When political storms arise, God’s people can remain calm because they know where they are in the stream of time.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Opening Scene

- **Question:** What did the prophet first see?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:2 – “Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Vision by Night:**
  - Represents the moral darkness of the world.
  - 2 Peter 1:19 – “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place...”
- **Striving:**
  - Implies violent conflict bursting from all directions.
- **The Great Sea:**
  - Represents the populated areas of the earth (explained further in Q6).
- **Definition of Prophecy:**
  - A message inspired by God revealing His will.
  - 2 Peter 1:21 – “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Hurricane:**
  - Standing on a beach during a hurricane, the water is churned into foam by the invisible force of the wind.
  - The sea cannot remain calm when the wind blows.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Humanity cannot remain at peace when the "winds" of human passion and satanic incitement blow upon the nations.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Result of Conflict

- **Question:** What was the result of this strife?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:3 – “And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Product of Conflict:**
  - These kingdoms arose from war and upheaval ("winds striving"), not peace.
- **Diverse Nature:**
  - Different in character and administration, yet all were "beasts."
  - Earthly governments are often predatory, ruling by force.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, beasts were sacrificed for sin.
  - Here, beasts represent powers opposing God.
  - The solution is the High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary who judges them (Daniel 7:9-10).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Zoo:**
  - In a zoo, predatory animals cannot coexist in the same cage; a lion will eat a lamb.
  - These beasts illustrate kingdoms built on pride and force.
- **Contrast with God's Kingdom:**
  - Earthly kingdoms survive by conquering.
  - God's Kingdom is built on love and service.
  - Matthew 20:25-28 – “...whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant...”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Interpreting the Beasts

- **Question:** What did the beasts represent?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:17 – “These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **Kings and Kingdoms:**
  - In prophecy, a "king" represents the kingdom or empire he rules.
  - These are four universal empires dominating world history.
- **"Out of the Earth":**
  - Signifies earthly, sensual origins (James 3:15).
  - Operates on force, ambition, and selfishness.
- **Contrast with Christ's Kingdom:**
  - John 18:36 – “Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight...”
  - Christ’s kingdom is the "stone cut out without hands" (Divine origin), not from the earth.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Source of Righteousness:**
  - We cannot build a righteous character by "earthly" methods (willpower, legalism, social reform).
  - True righteousness must come from above.
- **The Gift of God:**
  - Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ...”
  - Self-generated righteousness is like "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6); we need the righteousness of Heaven.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Symbolism of Winds

- **Question:** In symbolic language, what is represented by winds?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 25:32 – “Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **Agents of Destruction:**
  - Winds represent war, commotion, and the passions of men let loose.
  - Jeremiah 49:36-37 describes winds as scattering nations and sending the sword after them.
- **Restrained by God:**
  - Revelation 7:1 – “...holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth...”
  - Political stability is God's mercy, granting time for the gospel to advance.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Forest Fire:**
  - Wind is the driving force that pushes a fire from tree to tree.
  - In history, the "winds" of war drive armies to conquer one nation after another, redrawing the map of the world.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Symbolism of Waters

- **Question:** What is symbolized by the term waters?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 17:15 – “And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest,... are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **Populated Areas:**
  - Water represents dense populations and multitudes.
  - Isaiah 57:20 – “But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.”
- **The Prophetic Formula:**
  - **Wind** (War) + **Water** (Peoples) = **Beasts** (Nations arising through conquest).
- **Bible Consistency:**
  - The definitions given to John (Revelation) explain the visions given to Daniel centuries earlier.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **Island vs. Sea:**
  - A lonely island is surrounded by water.
  - In prophecy, the "sea" is the teeming masses of humanity.
  - Like the restless ocean, human society without God is unstable and constantly shifting.

## Slide 19 – Q7: The First Beast (Babylon)

- **Question:** What was the first beast like?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:4 – “The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **Identity:** Babylon (605–539 B.C.), the Head of Gold (Daniel 2).
- **The Lion:**
  - Represents majesty and power.
  - Winged lions were common in Babylonian art.
- **Eagle's Wings:**
  - Symbolize swift conquest (Habakkuk 1:8 – “Their horses also are swifter than the leopards... they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.”).
- **Wings Plucked & Man's Heart:**
  - Conquest ceased; the empire became weak and luxury-loving.
  - A "man's heart" here implies timidity and loss of martial spirit (Belshazzar's feast).

## Slide 21 – Q7: Application (A New Heart)

- **Pride vs. God's Gift:**
  - Babylon represents human pride.
  - Human pride leads to weakness ("heart of a man").
- **True Strength:**
  - Found in the "new heart" given by God.
  - Ezekiel 36:26 – “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Second Beast (Medo-Persia)

- **Question:** By what was the second kingdom symbolized?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:5 – “And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **Identity:** Medo-Persia (539–331 B.C.), the Chest of Silver (Daniel 2).
- **The Bear:**
  - Strong, brutal, and overwhelming (massive armies).
- **Raised on One Side:**
  - Dual monarchy where the Persians eventually became dominant over the Medes.
- **Three Ribs:**
  - The three principal powers conquered: **Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt**.
- **"Devour Much Flesh":**
  - Known for cruelty and heavy bloodshed.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Bear's Method:**
  - A bear is a lumbering, crushing force.
  - Unlike the lion (precision/majesty), the bear overwhelms.
  - This illustrates the Persian method of warfare: overwhelming the enemy by sheer weight of numbers.

## Slide 25 – Q9: The Third Beast (Greece)

- **Question:** By what was the third universal empire symbolized?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:6 – “After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points

- **Identity:** Greece (331–168 B.C.), the Thighs of Brass (Daniel 2).
- **The Leopard & 4 Wings:**
  - Symbolize supernatural speed.
  - Alexander the Great conquered the known world in roughly 10 years.
- **Four Heads:**
  - Alexander died young; his empire was divided among his four generals (Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, Seleucus).
- **Historicism:**
  - This view sees prophecy as a continuous timeline from the prophet's day to the Second Coming.

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Fourth Beast (Rome)

- **Question:** How is the fourth kingdom represented?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:7 – “After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it...”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points

- **Identity:** Roman Empire (168 B.C. – 476 A.D.), the Legs of Iron (Daniel 2).
- **Dreadful and Terrible:**
  - A monster with no counterpart in nature.
- **Iron Teeth:**
  - The "Iron Monarchy," known for rigid discipline and crushing power.
- **Diverse:**
  - Evolved from a republic to an empire.
  - Evolved from a pagan power to a religio-political power (Papal Rome).

## Slide 29 – Q10: Sanctuary Connection

- **The Outer Court:**
  - Under Roman authority, Jesus (the Lamb of God) was crucified.
- **The Earthly Temple:**
  - This power destroyed the earthly temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70.
- **The Contrast:**
  - While Rome "stamps the residue" on earth, Christ ministers in the Heavenly Sanctuary.

## Slide 30 – Q11: The Ten Horns

- **Question:** What was denoted by the ten horns?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:24 – “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.”

## Slide 31 – Q11: Key Points

- **Ten Kings:**
  - Rome was not conquered by another empire but disintegrated.
  - Represents the barbarian tribes (modern European nations) between A.D. 351–476.
- **Stage for Antichrist:**
  - The "Little Horn" rises *among* or *after* these ten.
- **Three Kings Subdued:**
  - The Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths were destroyed to make way for the Papacy.

## Slide 32 – Q11: Application & Conclusion

- **The Failure of Earthly Power:**
  - Even "strong exceedingly" powers eventually fragment.
- **The True Hope:**
  - The vision ends with the **Judgment** and the **Kingdom of the Most High** (Daniel 7:27).
- **Sanctuary Focus:**
  - We live in the time of the "horns."
  - Our hope is in the High Priest in heaven, who prepares a people to stand when earthly kingdoms fall.

## Slide 33 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Sandcastle:**
  - Earthly empires are like sandcastles; they look impressive but collapse when the tide comes in.
  - Only the Kingdom built on the Rock (Christ) will stand forever.
