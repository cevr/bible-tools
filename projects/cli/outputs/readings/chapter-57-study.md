### Q1. What special promise did the Saviour make concerning His second coming?
“In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am there ye may be also." John 14:2, 3.

**Answer:**
This is one of the most comforting assurances in all of Scripture. Jesus does not leave His disciples as orphans; His departure is purposeful.
*   **The Preparation:** Christ has ascended to the heavenly sanctuary, not only to prepare a physical dwelling place for us but to prepare *us* for the dwelling place. As High Priest, He intercedes for us, blotting out our sins and perfecting our characters (Hebrews 7:25; 9:24).
*   **The Certainty:** The return of Christ is the climax of the plan of salvation. Without the Second Coming, the Cross and the Resurrection would be incomplete, for death would still hold the saints in the grave.
*   **The Reunion:** The ultimate goal of the gospel is restoration—God and humanity dwelling together again (Revelation 21:3).

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
Jesus prepares the mansion for the believer, but He also prepares the believer for the mansion. We cannot enter heaven with the defilement of sin. We need:
1.  **Justification:** A title to heaven (Christ’s righteousness imputed to us).
2.  **Sanctification:** A fitness for heaven (Christ’s righteousness imparted to us, transforming our character).
By faith, we allow Him to clothe us in the "wedding garment" so we may sit at His table (Matthew 22:11–12).

**[ILL]** A loving bridegroom buys a plot of land and builds a beautiful home. He paints the walls and furnishes the rooms, thinking of his bride with every stroke of the hammer. But he does not just build the house; he also sends his bride a beautiful dress and helps her prepare for the wedding day. Christ is doing both: preparing heaven for us, and through His Spirit, preparing us for heaven.

### Q2. What was to take place before the lord should return?
“The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come." Joel 2:31.

**Answer:**
God, in His mercy, rarely pours out judgment without first sending a warning (Amos 3:7).
*   **Signs in Nature:** The physical universe itself is moved by the approaching steps of its Creator. These signs—the darkening of the sun and the bloody moon—serve as alarm bells to a sleeping world.
*   **The Day of the Lord:** This phrase refers to the final time of judgment and deliverance. It is "terrible" (awesome/fearful) to the unrepentant because it marks the end of probation, but it is a day of deliverance for the righteous.

**Definition:**
*   **Probation:** The period of time during which God graciously grants sinners the opportunity to repent and accept salvation before the final judgment is set.

### Q3. Upon hearing Christ say that the time would come when the temple at Jerusalem should be entirely destroyed, what did the disciples ask Him?
“Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?" Matt. 24:3.

**Answer:**
The disciples were confused. To the Jewish mind, the destruction of their magnificent temple and the end of the world were one and the same event. They could not conceive of the temple falling while the world continued.
*   **A Dual Prophecy:** In Matthew 24, Jesus answers both questions. His words apply first to the destruction of Jerusalem by Rome in A.D. 70, but they also project forward to the final destruction of the world at the Second Coming.
*   **A Type and Antitype:** The ruin of Jerusalem is a "type" (a foreshadowing symbol) of the final ruin of the world. The warnings given for the first event are crucial for surviving the second.

---

### Q4. Did He intimate that the end was then close at hand?
” And Jesus answered and said unto them. Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in My name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet." Matt. 24:4-6.

**Answer:**
Jesus cautioned against premature excitement and, more importantly, against deception.
*   **Deception is the Greatest Danger:** The first sign Jesus gave was not a physical disaster, but a spiritual danger: "Take heed that no man deceive you."
*   **False Messiahs:** Satan will seek to counterfeit the work of Christ. If he cannot keep men in open sin, he will trap them in false religion.
*   **Political Turmoil:** Wars and rumors of wars are conditions of a sinful world, but they are not the specific sign of the immediate end. The believer is to remain calm ("be not troubled") because their trust is in God's providence.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
We are protected from deception only by a personal knowledge of the Truth—who is Christ Himself (John 14:6). A theoretical knowledge of the Bible is not enough; we must have the truth written in our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Hebrews 8:10), so that we can distinguish the voice of the Shepherd from the voice of the stranger (John 10:4–5).

---

### Q5. After telling them there would be wars, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in many places, what did He say these would be?
“All these are the beginning of sorrows." Matt. 24:8.

**Answer:**
The word translated "sorrows" literally means "birth pangs."
*   **Creation Groaning:** As the Apostle Paul wrote, "the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now" (Romans 8:22).
*   **Intensity:** Just as birth pains increase in frequency and intensity as the birth draws near, so disasters in the natural world (famines, earthquakes, pestilence) will become more frequent and severe as the return of Christ approaches.
*   **Hope:** Birth pangs are painful, but they lead to life. These sorrows indicate that the new heaven and new earth are about to be born.

---

### Q6. To what extent is the gospel to be preached before the end?
“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." Matt. 24:14.

**Answer:**
This is the definitive sign of the close of history.
*   **The Gospel of the Kingdom:** This is not merely a message that God exists, but the full "Three Angels' Messages" of Revelation 14—the announcement that the hour of God's judgment is come, and a call to worship the Creator and keep His commandments.
*   **For a Witness:** God does not promise the whole world will be *converted*, but that the whole world will be *warned*. Every person must have an intelligent opportunity to choose between Christ and Satan.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
This gospel is "the power of God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16). It is not just a theory of forgiveness, but the power to live a holy life. When the world sees a people who actually keep the commandments of God through the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12), that demonstration will be the ultimate "witness."

**[ILL]** A lighthouse does not need to force ships to come into the harbor; it simply needs to shine brightly enough that every captain in the storm can see the way and make their own choice. The church is that light.

### Q7. What has been already admitted concerning the progress of the gospel?
“Within a year, Central Africa, the last remaining strong- hold of barbarism, has been opened up... If the doctrine of the pre-millennialists be correct, that the gospel is to be preached, not to convert the world, 'but for a witness unto all nations,' and that when it is so preached we are to expect the end, then it may well be that the end is nearer than most of us think." Christian Union, Nov. 13, 1878.

**Answer:**
Even in the late 19th century, observers recognized that the barriers to the gospel were falling.
*   **Global Reach:** Today, through radio, internet, satellite, and the printed page, the gospel is penetrating regions that were once entirely closed.
*   **The Final Work:** The fact that technology allows the message to travel instantly to "all nations" suggests that once the spiritual revival of God's people is complete, the final work can be finished rapidly (Romans 9:28).

---

### Q8. After giving a general summary of matters, how did the Lord particularize the events of the future?
“When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth, let him understand)." Matt. 24:15.

**Answer:**
Jesus points His followers back to the prophecies of Daniel (specifically Daniel 9:26-27, 11:31, and 12:11).
*   **Historical Fulfillment:** In the destruction of Jerusalem, the "abomination" was the Roman armies with their idolatrous standards (eagles) standing on the holy ground around the temple.
*   **Prophetic/Spiritual Fulfillment:** In the long scope of history, this points to the work of the Papacy (the "Little Horn" of Daniel 8), which sets up an earthly priesthood and human traditions in place of Christ's daily ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. This system "desolates" the sanctuary by obscuring Christ's mediation.

---

### Q9. How is this same thought expressed elsewhere?
“And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh." Luke 21:20.

**Answer:**
Luke gives the practical sign for the disciples living in the first century.
*   **The Sign:** When the Roman armies (under Cestius Gallus in A.D. 66) surrounded the city and then mysteriously withdrew, the Christians recognized the sign given by Christ.
*   **The Result:** Because they believed Christ’s words, they fled to the mountains (to Pella) and not a single Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.
*   **Lesson:** Obedience to the prophetic word is a matter of life and death.

---

### Q10. What did our Lord say was to follow this destruction of the city?
“For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be." Matt.24:21.

**Answer:**
While there was tribulation in A.D. 70, this prophecy extends to the "Great Tribulation" of the Dark Ages.
*   **Persecution:** For centuries, the true church was driven into the wilderness. Millions were martyred for their faith, for owning Bibles, or for refusing to bow to human authority in place of God's Word.
*   **The Elect:** God sustained a remnant during this time who held to the "faith of Jesus."

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
These martyrs did not have a "cheap grace." They possessed a faith that overcame the world (1 John 5:4). They loved not their lives unto the death (Revelation 12:11) because Christ lived in them. This same conquering faith is offered to us today.

### Q11. How long was the papal power to hold sway over the saints?
“And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time." Dan. 7:25.

**Answer:**
This is a key identifying mark of the Antichrist power.
*   **Character:** It speaks pompous words, persecutes God's people, and attempts to change God's law (specifically the Sabbath, the only commandment dealing with "time").
*   **Duration:** "Time" (1 year) + "Times" (2 years) + "Dividing of time" (half a year) = 3.5 prophetic years.

---

### Q12. What is the meaning of the expression, "time and times and the dividing of time?
“And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days." Rev. 12:6.

**Answer:**
Scripture is its own interpreter.
*   **Calculation:** Revelation 12:6 and 12:14 equate the "time, times, and half a time" with **1,260 days**.
*   **The Woman:** In prophecy, a pure woman represents God's true church (Jeremiah 6:2; 2 Corinthians 11:2).

---

### Q13. What does a symbolic day indicate?
“This shall be a sign [symbol] to the house of Israel... And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year." Eze. 4:3-6.

**Answer:**
In symbolic Bible prophecy, a day represents a literal year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6).
*   **The Period:** 1,260 prophetic days = **1,260 literal years**.
*   **The Timing:** The Papacy secured its supremacy in **A.D. 538** (when the decree of Justinian was fully effective and the Ostrogoths were uprooted).
*   **The End:** Adding 1,260 years to 538 brings us to **A.D. 1798**.
*   **Fulfillment:** In 1798, Berthier, a general of Napoleon, entered Rome, took the Pope prisoner, and declared the temporal power of the Papacy at an end. The prophecy was fulfilled exactly.

---

### Q14. What did the Lord say would be done in view of the rigor of that persecution?
“And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened." Matt. 24:22.

**Answer:**
Although the *dominion* of the Little Horn continued until 1798, the active, large-scale *persecution* ceased earlier.
*   **The Reformation:** The rise of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, and later the influence of movements leading to religious liberty, checked the power of Rome.
*   **God's Mercy:** Had the intense persecution continued to the very end of the 1798 period, the church might have been wiped out. God intervened for "the elect's sake."

---

### Q15. Did the Lord say He would return immediately after the tribulation ceased?
“Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." Matt. 24:23, 24.

**Answer:**
No, He warned of a period of deception first.
*   **Counterfeits:** As we approach the end, Satan works with "all power and signs and lying wonders" (2 Thessalonians 2:9). Spiritualism and false revivals will make it appear that Christ has come or is working in specific places.
*   **The Safeguard:** The elect are preserved not by their own cleverness, but because they test everything by the Law and the Testimony (Isaiah 8:20).

---

### Q16. What did He say would immediately follow?
“Immediately... after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken." Matt. 24:29.

**Answer:**
Here is the specific prophetic sequence:
1.  The 1260-year period (538–1798).
2.  The "tribulation" (persecution) is shortened (ends effectively around the mid-18th century).
3.  **Immediately after** that persecution eases (but before 1798 arrives), the signs in the sun and moon appear.
4.  The stars fall.

---

### Q17. How is this expressed by Mark?
“But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light." Mark 13:24.

**Answer:**
Mark is very precise: "In those days" (within the 1260 years, which ended in 1798) but "after that tribulation" (after the persecution had largely ceased).
*   **The Window of Time:** We must look for this sign between roughly 1773 (suppression of the Jesuits/end of active persecution) and 1798 (end of the 1260 years).

---

### Q18. Was there such a phenomenon? If so, when did it occur?
On May 19, 1780.

**Answer:**
Yes, the "Dark Day" of May 19, 1780, fulfills this prophecy perfectly in timing and character.
*   **The Event:** Across New England and parts of Canada, the sun was obscured by a supernatural darkness. It was not an eclipse (the moon was full). Animals went to roost, and men trembled, believing the Judgment had come.
*   **Significance:** It occurred exactly within the prophetic window marked out by the Saviour.

**(See Notes in original text regarding the historical accounts of the legislature and the "Day of Judgment" atmosphere.)**

---

### Q19. When did the moon refuse to shine?
“The night succeeding that day (May 19, 1780) was of such pitchy darkness that in some instances horses could not be compelled to leave the stable when wanted for service." Stone's History of Beverly (Mass.).

**Answer:**
The prophecy stated the moon would be turned to "blood" (Joel 2:31).
*   **The Fulfillment:** After the dense darkness of the day lifted slightly, the moon appeared, but it had the appearance of blood. This occurred the very night following the Dark Day.

---

### Q20. When did the stars fall, as predicted in the prophecy?
November 13, 1833.

**Answer:**
This is the famous Leonid meteor shower, the most spectacular in recorded history.
*   **The Event:** North America witnessed a storm of falling stars that was described as "flakes of snow" for their number.
*   **The Prophetic Link:** Revelation 6:13 describes this event: "And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."
*   **Timing:** This occurred 53 years after the Dark Day, completing the series of celestial signs Jesus predicted in Matthew 24:29.

---

### Q21. When the trees put forth their leaves, what does it indicate?
"Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh." Matt. 24:32.

**Answer:**
Jesus uses a simple illustration from nature.
*   **The Lesson:** We do not need a calendar to know summer is coming when we see the buds on the trees; nature tells the story.
*   **Application:** In the same way, when we see the specific signs Christ predicted (Sun, Moon, Stars, Distress of Nations), we do not need to guess; we *know* the season of His return is here.

**[ILL]** A farmer seeing dark clouds gathering, the wind picking up, and the temperature dropping knows a storm is coming. He doesn't ignore the signs. God has given us "prophetic weather signs" so we are not caught unprepared.

---

### Q22. What just as surely indicates the Lord's speedy coming?
“So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors." Matt. 24:33.

**Answer:**
*   **Proximity:** The phrase "at the doors" implies immediate urgency. The Judge is standing at the threshold (James 5:9).
*   **Sanctuary Context:** In the type, when the High Priest finished his work in the Most Holy Place, he came out to bless the people. Christ is currently finishing His work in the heavenly sanctuary; He is at the door, ready to step out.

---

### Q23. How near is the Lord's coming when these signs have been fulfilled?
“Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away." Matt 24:34, 35.

**Answer:**
The "generation" spoken of is the one that witnesses these signs.
*   **Prophetic Certainty:** Just as the generation that saw the miracles of Christ was held accountable for rejecting Him, the era of history that witnesses the fulfillment of the 1260 years, the Dark Day, and the Falling Stars is the "time of the end."
*   **Faithfulness:** The visible heavens may dissolve, but the promises of Christ are more stable than the ground we walk on.

---

### Q24. Can we know the day and hour of His coming?
“But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only." Matt. 24:36.

**Answer:**
*   **No Time-Setting:** God has revealed the *season* (nearness) but not the *exact date*. This keeps the church in a state of constant watchfulness and dependence.
*   **Preparation:** If we knew the date, we might delay preparation until the last moment. Because we do not know, we must live every day in Christ, ready for His appearing.

---

### Q25. What will be the moral condition of the world when the Lord comes?
“But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be." Matt. 24:37-39.

**Answer:**
*   **Preoccupation:** The sin of the antediluvians was not just violence, but total absorption in earthly life. They lived as if this world was the only reality.
*   **Indifference:** They "knew not"—not because they weren't warned (Noah preached for 120 years), but because they didn't care. They ignored the warning until the door of the ark was shut.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** There is a time when the door of probation closes. We must enter the "Ark" (Christ) while the door is still open.

---

### Q26. If we have knowledge of the Lord's coming, what is our duty?
“Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh." Matt. 24:44.

**Answer:**
Readiness is not a state of panic, but a state of union with Christ.
*   **How to be Ready:**
    1.  **Repentance:** Turning from sin to God.
    2.  **Faith:** Trusting in Christ's atoning blood for forgiveness (Justification).
    3.  **Obedience:** allowing His life to flow through us, producing good works and victory over sin (Sanctification).
*   **The Warning:** He comes when we "think not." We cannot trust our feelings; we must trust His Word.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
To be "ready" is to be found "in Him, not having mine own righteousness... but that which is through the faith of Christ" (Philippians 3:9).

---

### Q27. What will be the doom of those who say in their hearts that the Lord is not soon coming?
” But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming,... the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder [margin, cut him off], and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth." Matt. 24:48-51.

**Answer:**
*   **The Evil Servant:** Note that this man is a "servant"—he claims to be a Christian. His failure is not that he denies Christ openly, but that he loses the sense of the *imminence* of Christ's return.
*   **The Result of Delay:** Believing the Lord is delayed leads to:
    1.  **Worldliness:** Eating and drinking with the drunken (joining the world's spirit).
    2.  **Cruelty:** Smiting fellow servants (criticism, harshness, lack of love).
*   **The Judgment:** He is appointed his portion with the hypocrites. He professed to serve God, but his heart was in the world.

**Final Appeal:**
The prophecy of Matthew 24 is a call to wake up. The signs have appeared; the history is fulfilled; the Judge is at the door. Let us not be like the evil servant, but like the wise, watching for our Lord with lamps trimmed and burning.
