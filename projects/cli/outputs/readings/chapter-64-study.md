### Q1. How did the Saviour say it would be in the days of the Son of man (or when the Son of man would be revealed)?

**"And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man." Luke 17:26. Read also verses 27-30, and Matt. 24:37-39.**

**Answer:**
Our Lord Jesus Christ draws a direct parallel between the condition of the antediluvian world and the world just prior to His Second Coming. In the days of Noah, life continued with an alarming sense of normalcy despite the impending doom. They were "eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage" (Matthew 24:38). These activities are not sinful in themselves; rather, they represent a society wholly absorbed in the things of this life, utterly oblivious to the claims of God and the coming judgment.

Just as the Flood came suddenly and took them all away, so will the coming of the Son of Man surprise a world that has rejected the warnings of God’s word. This teaches us that the majority will not be converted before the end; instead, the world will be lulled into a carnal security.

*   **The Warning Message:** As Noah preached righteousness for 120 years, today the **Three Angels’ Messages** (Revelation 14:6–12) are going forth to warn the world.
*   **The Close of Probation:** In Noah’s day, God shut the door of the ark *before* the rain fell (Genesis 7:16). Similarly, Christ’s intercessory work in the heavenly sanctuary will cease shortly before He returns. When He steps out of the Most Holy Place, probation closes, and he that is filthy will remain filthy still (Revelation 22:11).

**[ILL]** Imagine a village at the base of a volcano. The experts warn that an eruption is imminent. Smoke is rising; the ground is trembling. Yet, the villagers are so busy planning festivals, building houses, and arguing over politics that they ignore the signs. When the lava flows, it is not because they weren't warned, but because they were too absorbed in the temporal to prepare for the eternal. So it is with this generation.

### Q2. How was it in the days of Noah?

**“And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." Gen. 6:5.**

**Answer:**
The condition of the antediluvian world was one of total depravity. The text indicates that the problem was internal: "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." This demonstrates the desperate need for the Gospel. Man cannot reform himself because the fountain of his life—the heart—is polluted.

*   **The Nature of Sin:** Sin is not merely an outward act; it is a condition of the heart that is at enmity with God (Romans 8:7).
*   **The Need for a New Covenant:** Because the heart is "evil continually," the only hope for salvation is the **New Covenant** promise: "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). This is the essence of Righteousness by Faith—God cleansing the inside of the cup.

**Definitions:**
*   **Depravity:** The corruption of human nature due to sin, making man unable to save himself or generate true righteousness apart from God.
*   **Regeneration:** The spiritual rebirth where the Holy Spirit imparts a new nature to the believer (Titus 3:5).

**[ILL]** You cannot make a muddy stream clear by painting the banks or planting flowers along the edge. The source must be cleansed. In the same way, societal reform, education, and culture cannot cure the "evil continually" in the human heart. Only the blood of Jesus applied to the conscience can cleanse the stream.

### Q3. How did Paul characterize the last days?

**”This know, also, that in the last days perilous times shall come." 2 Tim. 3:1.**

**Answer:**
The Apostle Paul, looking down the stream of time through the lens of prophecy, did not see a golden age of spiritual prosperity or a world gradually converted to Christ. He saw "perilous" (or difficult, dangerous) times. This directly contradicts the popular theory that the world will enter a temporal millennium of peace before Christ returns. The closer we get to the end, the more dangerous the spiritual landscape becomes for the believer.

---

### Q4. What will make those times perilous?

**“For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof." 2 Tim. 3:2-5.**

**Answer:**
The peril comes not just from open atheism, but from a corruption of Christianity itself. Paul describes a society dominated by **Self**—"lovers of their own selves." This list of sins culminates in a striking description of false religion: "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof."

*   **The Form:** This refers to outward ceremonies, profession of faith, church attendance, and liturgy.
*   **The Power:** This is the Gospel, which is "the power of God unto salvation" (Romans 1:16). It is the power to deliver from the reign of sin.

To deny the power is to claim to follow Jesus while claiming it is impossible to overcome sin. True Righteousness by Faith teaches that Christ came not only to forgive us (Justification) but to empower us to live obedient, holy lives (Sanctification). A religion that allows a man to remain "unholy," "fierce," or a "lover of pleasure" while claiming to be saved is a deception.

**[ILL]** A wax apple may look perfect—it has the right shape, color, and "form." But it has no life, no juice, and no seeds. It cannot nourish. A religion that is all ceremony or theory but lacks the victory over selfishness and sin is like that wax apple. It denies the life-giving power of the Vine (John 15:5).

---

### Q5. But will not this state of things grow better before the Lord comes?

**”But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived." 2 Tim. 3:13.**

**Answer:**
Scripture is emphatic: the world will not gradually improve into a kingdom of God on earth. Instead, wickedness will escalate. "Waxing worse and worse" implies a progression of evil. As light increases through the preaching of the Gospel, the rejection of that light leads to deeper darkness.

This creates a widening gulf. As the **Investigative Judgment** proceeds in heaven, a separation is taking place on earth. The righteous are being settled into the truth so they cannot be moved, while the wicked are being ensnared by deception (2 Thessalonians 2:10–12).

---

### Q6. Will it be easy for those living at this time to serve the Lord?

**"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." 2 Tim. 3:12.**

**Answer:**
It will not be easy; it will be a battle. Holiness (living godly) antagonizes the spirit of the world. If a Christian is fully accepted and praised by a wicked world, it is reason to examine whether they are truly walking in the light.

*   **"In Christ Jesus":** Notice that the godly life is only possible *in* Him. It is His life lived out in us (Galatians 2:20).
*   **Persecution:** This may be physical, or it may be social and mental—ridicule, exclusion, and economic pressure (as seen in the mark of the beast prophecy, Revelation 13:17).

**[ILL]** A dead fish floats downstream with the current; it takes no effort. But a live fish swims upstream, against the current. To live godly in the last days is to swim against the violent current of popular culture and compromised religion. The friction you feel is proof of spiritual life.

### Q7. According to the parable of the wheat and the tares, how long are the good and the bad to remain together?

**”The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;" "the enemy that sowed them is the Devil." "Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn." Matt. 13:38, 39, 30.**

**Answer:**
This parable destroys the idea that the whole world will be converted. The "wheat" (true believers) and the "tares" (false believers/wicked) grow together in the world until the very end.

*   **The Mixture:** We are not to expect a pure world before Jesus comes. God allows the tares to remain so that the wheat is not uprooted during its development.
*   **Character Development:** Both classes are ripening. The righteous are ripening in the character of Christ (Revelation 14:12), and the wicked are ripening in the character of Satan.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** This separation is finalized during the **Day of Atonement** (Investigative Judgment). When the judgment concludes, the "harvest" is ready to be reaped (Revelation 14:14–16).

---

### Q8. When does the harvest come?

**“The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels." Matt. 13:39.**

**Answer:**
The harvest is not a long era of peace; it is a specific event at "the end of the world" (or age). It is the final separation. Just as a farmer does not harvest until the grain is fully ripe, God waits until the principles of righteousness and the principles of sin are fully matured and demonstrated before the universe.

### Q9. When shall the "man of sin" (2 Thess. 2:3), also called "that Wicked," cease his iniquity?

**“And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming." 2 Thess. 2:8.**

**Answer:**
The "Man of Sin" (the Antichrist power) is not converted, nor does he gradually fade away due to the spread of the gospel. He continues his deceptive work until he is destroyed by the personal, literal return of Jesus Christ ("the brightness of His coming").

This proves there is no millennium of peace *before* the Second Coming. If the greatest enemy of the church exists until Jesus returns, then the church remains in a state of war until that day.

**Definition:**
*   **The Man of Sin:** The system of apostasy that exalts itself above God, seeking to change God's law and usurp Christ’s priestly ministry (Daniel 7:25).

---

### Q10. How long is the "little horn" (Dan. 7:25) to make war with the saints?

**“I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom." Dan. 7:21, 22.**

**Answer:**
The "Little Horn" power (the same entity as the Man of Sin) makes war with the saints *until* the Ancient of Days comes. The saints do not possess the kingdom through political takeover or gradual conversion of the nations. They possess it only after the Judgment is rendered in their favor.

*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phrase "judgment was given to the saints" implies a judicial decision in the heavenly sanctuary. God vindicates His people, declaring them righteous through the blood of Jesus and the work of the Spirit in their lives, before He gives them the kingdom.

---

### Q11. How many classes of people will there be on the earth when the Lord comes?

**”For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief." 1 Thess. 5:2-4.**

**Answer:**
There are only two classes:
1.  **Children of Darkness:** Those crying "Peace and safety," unaware of the coming judgment. They are overtaken as by a thief.
2.  **Children of Light (Brethren):** Those who are awake, watching, and sober. They are not overtaken as by a thief because they study the prophecies and know the time of their visitation.

**Practical Application:** To be a child of light means to have the "armor of light" (Romans 13:12). This is the righteousness of Christ covering the believer, and the law of God written in the heart, guarding the life against sin.

---

### Q12. What will those who are in darkness say when they hear about the Lord's coming?

**“Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creations." 2 Peter 3:3, 4.**

**Answer:**
Skepticism will prevail. The scoffers rely on the argument of **uniformitarianism**—the idea that nature works in a closed system where things continue exactly as they always have, without divine intervention. They deny the literal Creation and the literal Flood (2 Peter 3:5–6), and consequently, they deny the coming fire.

*   **"Walking after their own lusts":** Their theology is dictated by their morality. They deny the Second Coming because they do not wish to face the Judge. They prefer a world without accountability.

**[ILL]** A tenant who has destroyed the landlord's property and refuses to pay rent will naturally argue that the landlord is never coming back. His desire for the landlord's absence shapes his belief.

---

### Q13. What will be popularly taught in the last days?

**“But in the last days... many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob;... and He shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." Micah 4:1-3.**

**Answer:**
This passage describes what "many nations shall come and say." It is a prophecy of the popular, false teaching of the last days—a message of universal peace, a "golden age" where the world converts to God and war is abolished by human effort or political alliance. This is the "Peace and Safety" cry mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 5:3. It is a delusion that lulls the world to sleep just before destruction comes.

---

### Q14. What does the Lord say will be the actual condition of the world just before the end?

**“Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong." Joel 3:9, 10.**

**Answer:**
In direct contrast to what the nations *say* (Micah 4), God declares what will actually *happen* (Joel 3). Instead of beating swords into plowshares (peace), the nations will beat plowshares into swords (war). The spirit of war will stir the nations, culminating in the final conflict often called Armageddon.

God's word predicts international conflict, not universal peace, as the prelude to the Day of the Lord.

### Q15. But are not the heathen to be given to the Lord for an inheritance?

**“Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession." Ps. 2:8.**

**Answer:**
Yes, the Father gives the nations to the Son. However, we must read the very next verse to understand *how* He receives them. He inherits the earth to reclaim it from the usurper (Satan) and to cleanse it of rebellion.

---

### Q16. What will the Lord do with them?

**“Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." Ps. 2:9.**

**Answer:**
He inherits them not to convert them all, but to execute judgment. The "rod of iron" signifies absolute, unbreakable rule and judgment. Those who refused the scepter of His grace must now face the rod of His justice. This confirms that the Kingdom is ushered in by a catastrophic destruction of the wicked, not by the gradual conversion of the heathen.

**[ILL]** A potter inspects the vessels. Those that are marred and hardened in a crooked shape cannot be remolded once they are fired in the kiln; they must be broken. When Christ returns, the time for molding (probation) is past.

---

### Q17. When does the Lord thus rule the wicked nations in wrath?

**“And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations; and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of Kings and lord of lords." Rev. 19:15, 16.**

**Answer:**
This occurs at the Second Coming. The imagery of the "wine press" connects with the sanctuary service. The "wine" of Babylon (false doctrine) made the nations drunk; now they drink the "wine" of God's wrath (Revelation 14:10).

*   **Justification vs. Judgment:** Today, Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). On that day, He is the King of Kings who judges the world. We must accept Him as Lamb now to avoid facing Him as the Lion then.

---

### Q18. Then instead of looking for the conversion of the world, what should be the hope of the church?

**“Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ." Titus 2:13. See also 2 Tim. 4:6-8; 1 Thess. 4:14-18; 1 Peter 5:4.**

**Answer:**
The hope of the Christian is not in politics, the United Nations, or the gradual improvement of society. Our hope is "The Blessed Hope"—the literal, visible, glorious return of Jesus Christ.

*   **The Purpose of Grace:** Titus 2:11–12 tells us that the grace of God has appeared to teach us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts. Why? So we can look for this Blessed Hope with confidence.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** We look for Him not with terror, but with longing, because we have been covered by His righteousness and cleansed by His Spirit. We are waiting for the Bridegroom.

**Summary:** The Bible teaches that the world will grow more rebellious, the wheat and tares will ripen side by side, and the end will come suddenly with the destruction of the wicked and the salvation of the righteous. Therefore, "he that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure" (1 John 3:3).
