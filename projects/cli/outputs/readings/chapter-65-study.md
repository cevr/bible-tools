### Q1. What great event will take place at the coming of Christ?

**“For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise
first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them
in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air." 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.**

**Answer:** This passage describes the literal, audible, and visible Second
Coming of Jesus Christ, which marks the beginning of the Millennium (the
thousand-year period). This is the climax of history and the "blessed hope" of
the church (Titus 2:13).

- **A Personal Return:** Notice the text says, "The Lord _Himself_." He does not
  send a representative; the same Jesus who ascended to heaven returns for His
  own (Acts 1:11).
- **The First Resurrection:** The "dead in Christ"—those who died having
  accepted His righteousness—are raised to life. This is often called the
  "resurrection of life" (John 5:29).
- **Translation of the Living:** Those faithful believers who are alive when He
  comes are "caught up" (translated) without seeing death, just as Enoch and
  Elijah were.
- **Meeting in the Air:** Christ does not touch the earth at this specific time.
  He calls His people _up_ to meet Him.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:** To be "in Christ" at that moment—whether
dead or alive—we must be in Him _now_.

- **Justification:** We must have a clear title to heaven through the imputed
  righteousness of Christ, which covers our past sins (Romans 3:24).
- **Sanctification:** We must have a fitness for heaven through the imparted
  righteousness of Christ, allowing His Spirit to reproduce His character in us
  (Colossians 1:27). Only those who have let Jesus reign in their hearts today
  will rejoice to see Him reign in the clouds then.

> **[ILL] The Magnet:** Imagine a table covered with wood shavings and iron
> filings mixed together. If you pass a powerful magnet over the table, only the
> iron filings will leap up to meet it. The wood shavings remain below. The
> magnet does not _change_ the wood into iron; it only attracts what is already
> sensitive to its pull. So it is with Christ’s coming: He draws those who
> partake of His nature. We must possess the "iron" of faith and His indwelling
> Spirit now to respond to His call then.

### Q2. Where will the saints then be taken?

**“In My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told
you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I
will come again, and receive you unto Myself." John 14:2, 3.**

**Answer:** After meeting the Lord in the air, the saints are taken to the
"Father's house"—heaven itself.

- **The Destination:** Jesus was clear: He went to heaven to prepare a place,
  and He returns to take us _there_. This contradicts the view that the
  Millennium is a time of peace here _on_ the earth.
- **The Reunion:** We are received "unto Myself." The joy of heaven is not just
  golden streets or mansions, but uninterrupted fellowship with Jesus.
- **Sanctuary Insight:** In the earthly sanctuary service, the High Priest went
  into the Most Holy Place while the people waited outside. When his work was
  done, he came out to bless the people. Jesus, our High Priest, will soon
  finish His work in the heavenly sanctuary, come out to bless His waiting
  people, and lead them into the temple above (Hebrews 9:28).

> **[ILL] The Bridegroom:** In ancient times, a bridegroom would leave his
> betrothed to build an addition to his father's house. The bride waited,
> keeping herself pure, knowing he would return. When the room was ready, he
> came to fetch her and take her _to his father's home_ for the marriage feast.
> Christ is the Bridegroom coming to take His bride (the church) to the marriage
> supper in heaven (Revelation 19:7–9).

---

### Q3. In what condition will the earth be after the coming of Christ?

**“I beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens
and they had no light." "I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness,
and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by
His fierce anger." Jer. 4:23, 26 (Isa. 24:1-3).**

**Answer:** While the righteous are in heaven, the earth is left in a state of
absolute ruin and chaos.

- **Without Form and Void:** Jeremiah uses the same Hebrew phrase (_tohu va
  bohu_) found in Genesis 1:2 before creation. The earth returns to a
  pre-creation state of darkness and disorder.
- **Causes of Destruction:** The seven last plagues (Revelation 16) and the
  massive earthquake at Christ's coming (Revelation 16:18–20) level the cities.
  The "presence of the Lord" is a consuming fire to sin and the structures of
  man's pride.
- **No Golden Age:** This clearly refutes the idea that the Millennium is a time
  of conversion or earthly prosperity. It is a time of silence and desolation.

**Definition:**

- **The Millennium:** The period of 1,000 years mentioned in Revelation 20,
  occurring between the first resurrection (righteous) and the second
  resurrection (wicked).

---

### Q4. Will any man be living on the earth at that time?

**“I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were
fled." Jer. 4:25 (Zeph. 1:3).**

**Answer:** No human life remains on the planet during the thousand years.

- **The Righteous:** They have been caught up to heaven (1 Thessalonians 4:17).
- **The Wicked:** They have been slain by the brightness of His coming (see next
  question).
- **Total Depopulation:** Jeremiah sees "no man." The planet is a cosmic prison
  house, devoid of human inhabitants.

> **[ILL] The Abandoned House:** Imagine a house where the family has moved out,
> taking everything of value. Afterwards, a great storm strikes, shattering the
> windows and tearing off the roof. The house stands empty, ruined, and silent.
> This is the condition of the earth during the Millennium—the "family" (God's
> people) is in heaven; the "house" (earth) is a wreck.

---

### Q5. What is to become of those who are not caught up to heaven with the Lord?

**“The Lord hath a controversy with the nations; He will plead with all flesh;
He will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord." Jer. 25:31 (2
Thess. 1:7, 8).**

**Answer:** Those who rejected God's grace are destroyed at the Second Coming.

- **Slain by Glory:** 2 Thessalonians 2:8 tells us the lawless one is destroyed
  by "the brightness of His coming." Sin cannot exist in the immediate presence
  of a holy God. Those who have clung to sin, refusing to let Christ remove it,
  are consumed by that glory.
- **A Sad Necessity:** God does not delight in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel
  33:11). However, because they refused the "wedding garment" of Christ’s
  righteousness, they are defenseless before the consuming fire of God's purity.

**Righteousness by Faith Application:** This highlights the vital need for
**Imputed Righteousness**. We need a covering that is not our own. Just as a
shield protects a soldier from fire, Christ’s merit covers the believer so they
can stand in the presence of Holy God and live (Isaiah 33:14–16).

---

### Q6. How long will these resurrected saints reign with Christ in heaven?

**“And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them:
and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for
the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image,
neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they
lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years." Rev. 20:4.**

**Answer:** The saints will reign with Christ in heaven for **one thousand
years**.

- **The Work of Judgment:** "Judgment was given unto them." Paul asks, "Do ye
  not know that the saints shall judge the world?" (1 Corinthians 6:2).
- **Why Judge?** God is transparent. During this time, the redeemed examine the
  records of the wicked (those not in heaven). They will see why a neighbor, a
  king, or a family member was lost. They will see that God did everything
  possible to save them, but their choice was honored. This vindicates God's
  character against Satan's accusations of unfairness.

---

### Q7. When were these made to live?

**“Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the
second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and
shall reign with Him a thousand years." Rev. 20:6.**

**Answer:** They were made to live at the **First Resurrection**, which occurs
at the beginning of the 1,000 years (at Christ's return).

- **Character Qualification:** Note the description: "Blessed and _holy_." This
  holiness is not self-generated; it is the result of submitting to the Holy
  Spirit's work of sanctification.
- **Victory:** They are priests of God. In the earthly life, they offered
  themselves as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1). Now, they serve God directly.

**Definition:**

- **Second Death:** The final, eternal destruction of the wicked in the lake of
  fire (Revelation 20:14). The righteous are immune to this because they have
  already died to self and been born again in Christ.

---

### Q8. How long will the wicked remain in their graves?

**“But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thou- sand years were
finished." Rev. 20:5.**

**Answer:** The wicked dead (those who died before Christ's return or were slain
at His return) remain in their graves for the entire duration of the Millennium.
There is no "second chance" during this time; their probation has closed.

---

### Q9. What will be Satan's condition during the thousand years?

**“And He laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and
Satan, and bound him a thousand years." Rev. 20:2.**

**Answer:** Satan is "bound." His power is checked, and his freedom of movement
is restricted. This is the fulfillment of the scapegoat typology in the Day of
Atonement service (Leviticus 16), where the sins of the people were symbolically
placed on the head of the scapegoat (Azazel), who was then led into the
wilderness.

---

### Q10. Where will he be kept?

**“And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon
him." Rev 20:3.**

**Answer:** He is confined to the **bottomless pit**.

---

### Q11. Where is the bottomless pit?

**“And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as
the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of
the smoke of the pit." Rev. 9:2.**

**Answer:** The "bottomless pit" (Greek: _abussos_, meaning abyss or deep) is
not a subterranean cavern, but the earth itself in its chaotic, ruined
condition.

- **Biblical Parallel:** The Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) uses this same
  word _abussos_ in Genesis 1:2 to describe the "deep" over which darkness
  hovered.
- **The Prison:** Satan is chained to this broken, dark, depopulated planet. He
  cannot go to other worlds to tempt unfallen beings. He is forced to look upon
  the ruin his rebellion has caused for 1,000 years.

---

### Q12. What is Satan's occupation up to the time of his binding?

**“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion,
walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." 1 Peter 5:8.**

**Answer:** Until the very end, Satan is frantically busy deceiving, tempting,
and destroying. He works through the children of disobedience (Ephesians 2:2)
and accuses the brethren (Revelation 12:10).

---

### Q13. In what sense are we to understand the binding of Satan?

**The saints are taken to heaven at the coming of Christ, and the wicked fall
dead at His presence, to remain thus during the thousand years. Satan's
occupation is gone; there is nothing left for him to do but to wander over the
desolate earth, and view the terrible work of which he is the author. There is
now no one for him to tempt, and he is therefore bound in his operations.**

**Answer:** Satan is bound by **circumstances**, not just a literal chain.

- **No Subjects:** A king without subjects is no king. A tempter with no one to
  tempt is powerless.
- **Solitary Confinement:** He is left alone with his demons to contemplate the
  failure of his rebellion. This mental anguish is part of his punishment.

> **[ILL] The Chained General:** Imagine a general who thrives on war and
> manipulation. If he is captured and placed on a deserted island with no
> soldiers to command and no enemies to fight, he is effectively "bound," even
> if he can walk around the island. His power to influence is gone.

---

### Q14. What will release Satan from this condition?

**“But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were
finished." "And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out
of his prison." Rev. 20:5, 7.**

**Answer:** The **resurrection of the wicked** (the "rest of the dead") at the
end of the 1,000 years releases Satan. Suddenly, the earth is teeming with
billions of unrepentant people from all ages. Satan once again has people to
deceive and organize.

---

### Q15. For how long a period will he be loosed?

**“That he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be
fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season." Rev. 20:3.**

**Answer:** He is loosed for a "little season"—a short period of time sufficient
for him to organize the wicked for one last, desperate attempt to overthrow God.

---

### Q16. In what work will he immediately engage?

**“And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the
earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, the number of whom is
as the sand of the sea." Rev. 20:8.**

**Answer:** He engages in immediate **deception and mobilization for war**.

- **The Deception:** He likely convinces the resurrected wicked that he raised
  them from the dead, that they are a mighty army, and that they can capture the
  Holy City which has now descended to earth (Revelation 21:2).
- **Gog and Magog:** Here used symbolically to represent the universal
  confederacy of God's enemies.
- **The Spirit of Rebellion:** Note that even after resurrection and 1,000 years
  of death, the wicked have not changed. Character is fixed at death. They rise
  with the same rebellion they died with.

---

### Q17. What will be the result of their effort to take the city?

**“And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the
saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven,
and devoured them." Rev. 20:9.**

**Answer:** This is the final battle. As they surround the New Jerusalem (the
"camp of the saints"), they are stopped not by weapons of the saints, but by
God's executive judgment. Fire comes down and "devours" them. This is the
execution of the sentence pronounced during the Millennium judgment.

---

### Q18. What statement will thus be fulfilled?

**“Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the
land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it." Ps. 37:34.**

**Answer:** The promise that the meek shall inherit the earth is finally
realized. The wicked are "cut off"—removed from existence so that the universe
may be clean.

**Practical Application:** "Wait on the Lord" is the command. In a world where
the wicked often seem to prosper, we are called to patience. The final reckoning
belongs to God.

---

### Q19. How many will escape this second death?

**“Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the
second death hath no power." Rev. 20:6.**

**Answer:** Only those who experienced the **new birth** and remained faithful
to Christ escape.

- **Victory over Sin:** Victory is possible through Christ. "This is the victory
  that overcometh the world, even our faith" (1 John 5:4).
- **The Contrast:** The first death (physical death) is a sleep. The second
  death is annihilation. Those in Christ need never fear the second death.

---

### Q20. What will be the effect of the fire?

**“For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud,
yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall
burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
branch." Mal. 4:1.**

**Answer:** The fire brings **total destruction**, not eternal conscious
torment.

- **Stubble:** The wicked are compared to dry grass, which burns up quickly and
  turns to ash (Malachi 4:3).
- **Root and Branch:** Satan is the root; his followers are the branches. All
  are consumed.
- **God's Love:** This act is a "strange act" (Isaiah 28:21), but it is an act
  of love. To keep rebellious sinners alive in an atmosphere of perfect holiness
  would be torture to them. God mercifully ends the history of sin.

---

### Q21. What, besides the wicked, will feel the effect of this fire?

**“But the heavens [atmosphere heavens] and the earth, which are now, by the
same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men." 2 Peter 3:7.**

**Answer:** The physical earth and the atmospheric heavens are also purified.
The curse of sin has infected the very soil and air (Genesis 3:17; Romans 8:22).
The purifying fire cleanses the planet of every trace of sin, disease, and
death.

---

### Q22. What will be the result?

**“And the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also; and the works
that are therein shall be burned up." 2 Peter 3:10.**

**Answer:** The old world, polluted by sin, passes away. All the monuments of
human pride—skyscrapers, weapons of war, casinos, prisons—are "burned up."
Nothing of the old regime of selfishness remains.

---

### Q23. Then what will come?

**“Never the less we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new
earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:13.**

**Answer:** From the ashes of the old world, God recreates the earth—Eden
restored, but more glorious.

- **Wherein Dwelleth Righteousness:** This is the defining characteristic of the
  New Earth. It is not just a place of gold and jewels; it is a place where
  _Righteousness_ is at home.
- **The Law Written on the Heart:** The inhabitants keep God’s law perfectly,
  not as a burden, but as a delight. This is the ultimate goal of the New
  Covenant (Hebrews 8:10).

> **[ILL] The Artist:** A master artist paints a masterpiece. An enemy throws
> black ink over it, ruining it. The artist does not just clean the canvas; he
> burns the ruined canvas and paints a new, even more beautiful image, which can
> never be destroyed. God restores His creation to its original design.

---

### Q24. Who will inherit the new earth?

**“For evil doers shall be cut off; but those that wait upon the Lord, they
shall inherit the earth." Ps. 37:9.**

**Answer:** Those who "wait upon the Lord"—those who trusted in Christ for
salvation and allowed Him to transform their lives. It is the home of the saved.

---

### Q25. What will be their condition there?

**“But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the
abundance of peace." Ps. 37:11.**

**Answer:**

- **Meekness:** The earth is not inherited by the aggressive, the wealthy, or
  the powerful, but by the meek (Matthew 5:5)—those who are gentle and
  submissive to God's will.
- **Abundance of Peace:** No more war, no more fear, no more anxiety. It is the
  peace that passes understanding, made permanent.

---

### Q26. How will every intelligent creature in the universe then show his appreciation of the gift of eternal life?

**“And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth,
and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and
unto the Lamb forever and ever." Rev. 5:13.**

**Answer:** The Great Controversy ends with a universal anthem of praise.

- **Harmony Restored:** Every voice in the universe unites to declare that God
  is Love.
- **The Focus:** The praise is directed "unto the Lamb." Throughout eternity,
  the scars in Jesus' hands will remind the saved that their righteousness,
  their peace, and their home were purchased by His sacrifice.
- **The Invitation:** This future can be yours. By accepting Jesus today as your
  Sacrifice and High Priest, you are registered as a citizen of that future
  kingdom.

> "The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire
> universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the vast
> creation." — _The Great Controversy_, p. 678.
