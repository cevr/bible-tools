## Slide 1 – A Remarkable Symbol: Daniel 8

- **Topic:** The Vision of the Ram, the He-Goat, and the Sanctuary
- **Focus:** The rise and fall of empires and the spiritual conflict involving Christ’s ministry.
- **Key Chapter:** Daniel 8

***

## Slide 2 – Q1: Time of the Vision

- **Question:** At what time was the vision of Daniel 8 given?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:1 – “In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.”

***

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **Historical Context:**
  - given toward the close of the Babylonian empire.
  - shortly before the events of the writing on the wall (Daniel 5).
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - Unlike previous visions using wild beasts, this vision uses a Ram and a Goat.
  - These are sacrificial animals used on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:5 – “And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.”).
  - This indicates the vision concerns the plan of salvation and God’s method of dealing with sin.
- **God's Foreknowledge:**
  - God provides a roadmap before the darkness of a new era comes (Isaiah 46:9-10 – “Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done...”[fragment]).

***

## Slide 4 – Q2: The First Symbol

- **Question:** What was the first symbol presented to the prophet?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:3 – “Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.”

***

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Identity of the Ram:**
  - The angel Gabriel interprets this explicitly:
  - Daniel 8:20 – “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.”
- **The Two Horns:**
  - Represents the dual nature of the Medo-Persian empire.
  - The higher horn coming up last represents the Persian element, which became dominant later in the alliance.
- **Sovereignty of God:**
  - The ram pushed westward, northward, and southward; no beast could stand before it.
  - This confirms that when God allows a nation to rise, no human power can stop it until His purpose is fulfilled (Daniel 2:21 – “And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings...”).

***

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Tide of History**
  - Men often believe they shape history through military genius or strategy.
  - In reality, they are like driftwood on a rising tide; they move only where the tide takes them.
  - The rise of Medo-Persia was decreed by God long before Cyrus was born.
  - Isaiah 45:1 – “Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him...”

***

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Second Symbol

- **Question:** What symbol was next introduced?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:5 – “And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.”

***

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Identity of the He-Goat:**
  - Daniel 8:21 – “And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.”
- **Speed of Conquest:**
  - The goat "touched not the ground," symbolizing the incredible speed of Alexander the Great’s conquests.
  - In roughly a decade, Greek forces swept across the known world.
- **The Notable Horn:**
  - Represents Alexander the Great.
- **Prophetic Symbolism:**
  - The Bible uses physical objects (animals) to represent abstract realities (kingdoms) and their moral character (predatory, swift, strong).

***

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Broken Horn

- **Question:** What happened to the "notable horn" when it was strong?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:8 – “Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.”

***

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **Human Fragility:**
  - Alexander conquered the world but died at age 32 (323 B.C.), reportedly of fever and intemperance.
  - Jeremiah 9:23 – “Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might...”
- **The Four Horns:**
  - The kingdom did not pass to Alexander's sons.
  - It was divided among his four leading generals (Cassander, Lysimachus, Ptolemy, Seleucus) toward the "four winds," exactly as prophesied.

***

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Broken Pillar**
  - Imagine a massive marble pillar supporting a great roof.
  - It snaps not from external weight or attack, but from a flaw within.
  - Alexander’s empire broke because the man at the center was mortal and flawed.
  - Our only sure foundation is Christ, the Rock that cannot be broken.
  - 1 Corinthians 10:4 – “And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.”

***

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Little Horn

- **Question:** What new power arises from one of the four winds?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:9 – “And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.”

***

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **Identity of the Little Horn:**
  - Represents **Rome** in two phases:
    1. **Pagan Rome:** The political empire ruling during Christ’s life.
    2. **Papal Rome:** The religious-political power ruling the Middle Ages.
- **"Exceeding Great":**
  - Surpasses the Ram ("great") and Goat ("very great").
  - Extends influence spiritually, dominating the conscience of man.
- **The Pleasant Land:**
  - Refers to Judea/Palestine.
  - Rome conquered this territory in 63 B.C.; under this power, Jesus was born and crucified.

***

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Attack on the Prince

- **Question:** How does this power treat the "Prince of the host"?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:11 – “Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.”

***

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points

- **Spiritual Warfare:**
  - The prophecy shifts from military battles to a war against Christ’s ministry.
- **The Prince of the Host:**
  - This is Jesus Christ, Commander of heaven's armies (Joshua 5:14).
- **Taking Away "The Daily":**
  - "Sacrifice" is a supplied word. The Hebrew is *Ha-Tamid* ("The Continual").
  - Refers to Christ's continual ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - By establishing an earthly priesthood and earthly sacrifices, this power obscured Christ's direct intercession.

***

## Slide 16 – Q6: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Danger of Human Mediation:**
  - When a system places human priests or rituals between the sinner and the Savior, it "casts down" the truth of the Gospel.
- **True Justification:**
  - Salvation is found only in direct communion with Christ by faith.
  - We are justified freely by grace, not through human systems.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”

***

## Slide 17 – Q7: Truth Cast Down

- **Question:** What was done to the truth?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:12 – “And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.”

***

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **Truth Cast Down:**
  - The "truth" includes the Law of God and the Gospel of the sanctuary.
  - Psalm 119:142 – “Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.”
- **By Reason of Transgression:**
  - Error prospers when people turn away from God's law.
  - When the law is set aside, the gospel is misunderstood (Romans 3:20).
- **It Prospered:**
  - For a season (the 1260 years), this system seemed to win.
  - God tolerates evil temporarily to reveal its true character before the universe.

***

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Question of "How Long?"

- **Question:** What question was asked concerning this desolation?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:13 – “Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?”

***

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

- **The Cry of the Universe:**
  - "How long?" is a cry for justice and restoration (Revelation 6:10).
- **The Central Issue:**
  - How long will truth be trampled?
  - How long will God’s character be misrepresented?
- **Focus on the Sanctuary:**
  - The question concerns the restoration of the knowledge of God's way of salvation.
  - It is about restoring the truth that sinners are made right with God through Christ alone, without human intermediaries.

***

## Slide 21 – Q9: The 2300 Days

- **Question:** What was the answer regarding the time?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

***

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points

- **The Time Span:**
  - In Bible prophecy, a day represents a year.
  - Numbers 14:34 – “After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities...”
  - Ezekiel 4:6 – “...I have appointed thee each day for a year.”
  - This period is 2,300 literal years.
- **The Event: Cleansing the Sanctuary:**
  - Points to the **Investigative Judgment**.
  - Just as the earthly sanctuary was cleansed on the Day of Atonement, Christ entered the Most Holy Place (1844) to blot out sin and prepare a people for His return.

***

## Slide 23 – Q9: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Courtroom**
  - Imagine a courtroom where a judge reviews cases before the verdict.
  - The verdict is not based on the defendant's perfect performance, but on whether they have a competent Advocate.
  - The cleansing of the sanctuary is that review.
  - If we rely on our own works, we are lost.
  - If we rely on Christ our High Priest, His righteousness covers us.
  - Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.”

***

## Slide 24 – Conclusion

- **Restoration of Truth:**
  - Daniel 8 reveals that while earthly powers attack God's truth, God has a set time to restore it.
- **Our Response:**
  - The "cleansing of the sanctuary" is a call to turn our eyes to heaven.
  - We must trust entirely in the merits of Jesus, who is finishing His work of atonement for us.
