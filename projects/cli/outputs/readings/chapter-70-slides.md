## Slide 1 – Q1: The Certainty of Judgment
- Question: Where must all men appear?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 5:10 – “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Universality & Sanctuary)
- **The Universality of Judgment:**
  - The text says "we must *all* appear."
  - No one is exempt—believer or unbeliever, rich or poor.
- **The Basis of Review:**
  - We are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8 – “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God”).
  - However, works are the evidence of genuine faith.
  - A faith without obedience is dead (James 2:20 – “But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?”).
- **The Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest cleansed the sanctuary once a year (Day of Atonement).
  - Christ now ministers in the heavenly sanctuary to blot out sins before His return.
- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - The phase of Christ’s ministry (begun in 1844, Daniel 8:14) where believers' lives are reviewed to vindicate God's justice and mercy.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Courtroom:**
  - Imagine a courtroom where you are the defendant and the law books are open.
  - Standing alone, your record of "bad things" condemns you.
  - If you have accepted Christ, He stands as your Advocate (1 John 2:1 – “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous”).
  - He argues that He has paid your penalty and that your life shows a heart surrendered to Him.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Standard of Judgment
- Question: What will be the standard in the judgment?
- Key Text: James 2:12 – “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.”
- Key Text: Romans 3:19 – “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law...”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Law & Righteousness by Faith)
- **A Law of Liberty:**
  - To the sinner, the law is a yoke of bondage because it condemns.
  - To the believer, it is a "law of liberty" because the Spirit writes it on the heart (Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”).
  - Freedom is wanting to do exactly what you ought to do.
- **God’s Unchanging Standard:**
  - The law is a transcript of God’s character.
  - Because God does not change (Malachi 3:6 – “For I am the LORD, I change not...”), His standard of righteousness remains the Ten Commandments.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot meet this standard alone.
  - **Justification:** Trusting Jesus to forgive past transgressions.
  - **Sanctification:** Trusting Jesus to live His law-keeping life through us day by day.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Mirror:**
  - James compares the law to a mirror (James 1:23).
  - If a mirror shows dirt on your face, it is doing its job (judging your condition).
  - The mirror cannot wash you.
  - You must go to the water (Christ and His blood) for cleansing.
  - The law points out the sin; Christ provides the remedy.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Condition of Humanity
- Question: In what condition are all men?
- Key Text: Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Sin & Inability)
- **The Definition of Sin:**
  - The Bible defines sin clearly: 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **Coming Short:**
  - We were made in God’s image, but sin has marred that reflection.
  - We fail to reflect His character.
- **Total Inability:**
  - We cannot generate righteousness from a sinful heart.
  - Job 14:4 – “Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.”
  - This establishes our absolute need for a Savior.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Archer:**
  - The Greek word for sin often means "missing the mark."
  - Imagine an archery contest where the target is absolute moral perfection.
  - One person may shoot further than another (a moral person vs. a criminal).
  - However, *all* fall short of the target.
  - No one hits the bullseye of God's glory without Christ's grace.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Scope of Sin
- Question: How many are included in the "all" who have sinned?
- Key Text: Romans 3:9 – “What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise; for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Universal Guilt & Justification)
- **Universal Guilt:**
  - No privileged class exists in salvation.
  - Religious heritage or church membership does not exempt a person from a fallen nature.
- **"Under Sin":**
  - To be "under sin" is to be under its power and condemnation.
  - Only Christ can emancipate us from this slavery (John 8:36 – “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed”).
- **Key Definition: Justification:**
  - The legal act where God declares a repentant sinner "righteous."
  - Not based on their works, but by crediting Christ’s perfect life to their account (Romans 4:5 – “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness”).

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Purpose of the Law
- Question: By what are all men thus proved guilty?
- Key Text: Romans 3:19 – “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Conviction & Grace)
- **Stopping the Mouth:**
  - The natural heart makes excuses.
  - The Spirit uses the law to silence excuses and reveal spiritual bankruptcy.
- **The Knowledge of Sin:**
  - Romans 3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”
  - You cannot know you are crooked without a straight line to measure against.
- **Preparation for Grace:**
  - The law is a "schoolmaster" to bring us to Christ (Galatians 3:24 – “Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith”).
  - The law wounds so the Gospel can heal.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration
- **The X-Ray:**
  - A man with a broken bone may refuse a doctor if he feels little pain.
  - An X-ray (the law) reveals the fracture clearly.
  - His "mouth is stopped"—he can no longer deny the condition.
  - The X-ray cannot heal the bone, but it proves the absolute need for the Physician.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Faith and the Law
- Question: What effect does faith in Christ have upon the law?
- Key Text: Romans 3:31 – “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the law.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Establishing the Law)
- **Not "Void":**
  - Faith does not nullify or abolish the obligation to obey.
- **We Establish the Law:**
  - **Legally:** We acknowledge Christ paid the law's penalty.
  - **Experientially:** Faith receives the Spirit, who writes the law on the heart.
- **Gospel Obedience:**
  - A man saved by grace obeys through the power of Christ, not self-effort.
  - **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of grace transforming the character to be like Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”).

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Master Builder:**
  - An architect draws a blueprint (the law).
  - If a construction crew ruins the building, the Master Builder (Christ) steps in.
  - He does not tear up the blueprint ("make void the law").
  - He restores the building to match the original design perfectly ("establishes the law").

## Slide 18 – Q7: The Believer's Delight
- Question: In what did the apostle Paul delight?
- Key Text: Romans 7:22 – “For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points (A New Heart)
- **The Inward Man:**
  - Refers to the new nature created by the Holy Spirit.
- **Love for the Law:**
  - Psalm 119:97 – “O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.”
  - To the converted heart, the law is a delight because it reflects God's character.
- **The Promise of the New Covenant:**
  - Ezekiel 36:27 – “And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Illustration
- **Diet and Health:**
  - To a person addicted to junk food, a healthy diet feels like punishment.
  - To a person who has regained health, healthy food is a delight.
  - Conversion changes our spiritual "palate."
  - We begin to hunger and thirst for righteousness (Matthew 5:6).

## Slide 21 – Q8: The Carnal Mind
- Question: How does the carnal mind stand related to the law of God?
- Key Text: Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points (The Need for Rebirth)
- **The Carnal Mind:**
  - Human nature controlled by sinful impulses rather than the Holy Spirit.
- **Enmity:**
  - The natural mind is hostile toward God; it resents authority.
- **Necessity of Rebirth:**
  - Education and culture cannot fix the carnal mind.
  - We must be "born again" (John 3:3).
  - The solution is the crucifixion of self (Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me...”).

## Slide 23 – Q8: Illustration
- **Oil and Water:**
  - You can shake a bottle to mix oil and water, but they separate when you stop.
  - They are contrary by nature.
  - The carnal mind is like oil—it will not mix with the water of God's law.
  - The nature itself must be changed.

## Slide 24 – Q9: The Perpetuity of the Law
- Question: How long did the Saviour say all the law would be in force?
- Key Text: Matthew 5:18 – “For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points (Unchangeable Law)
- **"Till Heaven and Earth Pass":**
  - God's moral law remains in effect as long as we live on this earth.
- **Jot and Tittle:**
  - Jesus confirmed that not even the smallest detail of the moral law is to be altered.
- **Consistency of the Cross:**
  - If the law could be changed, Christ would not have needed to die.
  - The death of Christ is the strongest proof that the law is immutable.

## Slide 26 – Q10: The Great Commandment
- Question: When asked which was the great commandment in the law, what answer did Christ make?
- Key Text: Matthew 22:37-39 – “Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points (Summary of the Decalogue)
- **The First Table:**
  - The first four commandments show us *how* to love God supremely.
- **The Second Table:**
  - The last six commandments show us *how* to love our neighbor.
- **Love as the Motive:**
  - Obedience without love is legalism.
  - Love without obedience is sentimentalism.
  - True love manifests in keeping God's requirements.

## Slide 28 – Q11: Foundation of the Law
- Question: What did He say hung on these two requirements?
- Key Text: Matthew 22:40 – “On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Key Points (Hinges and Door)
- **Hanging the Law:**
  - The specific commandments hang on the principle of love.
  - You cannot have the hinge without the door, nor the door without the hinge.
- **Specifics of Love:**
  - Loving God = No idols (2nd Commandment), Remembering Sabbath (4th Commandment).
  - Loving Neighbor = No stealing (8th Commandment), No lying (9th Commandment).
- **Unity of the Law:**
  - The law is a unit; breaking one part violates the principle of love.

## Slide 30 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Tree:**
  - Love is the root and trunk.
  - The Ten Commandments are the branches.
  - The fruit is the specific acts of obedience in daily life.
  - You cannot have the fruit without the branches, nor the branches without the root.

## Slide 31 – Q12: Christ Our Example
- Question: What does the apostle say about the practice of Christ in keeping the law?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:5 – “And ye know that He was manifested to take away our sins; and in Him is no sin.”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Key Points (Christ's Righteousness)
- **In Him is No Sin:**
  - Hebrews 4:15 – “...but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.”
  - Jesus lived a life of perfect obedience.
- **Taking Away Sin:**
  - He bore the penalty at the cross.
  - He breaks the power of sin in our hearts.
- **Our Righteousness:**
  - Christ’s perfect law-keeping enables us to stand in judgment.
  - We are "accepted in the beloved" (Ephesians 1:6).

## Slide 33 – Q13: Christ's Claim
- Question: What does Christ say of Himself in this respect?
- Key Text: John 15:10 – “I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.”

## Slide 34 – Q13: Key Points (Abiding in Love)
- **The Example:**
  - Jesus obeyed because He abode in the Father's love.
- **The Connection:**
  - Obedience is the natural atmosphere of love.
  - Disobedience disrupts the relationship.
- **The Source of Power:**
  - John 5:19 – “The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do...”
  - Jesus kept the commandments by depending entirely on the Father, just as we must depend on Christ.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Walking as He Walked
- Question: If one would abide in Christ, what ought he to do?
- Key Text: 1 John 2:6 – “He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points (Sanctified Life)
- **Imitation through Habitation:**
  - If Christ walked in obedience to the Ten Commandments, His followers must walk the same path.
- **Consistency:**
  - It is a contradiction to claim to abide in Christ while walking in willful disobedience.
  - The fruit must match the vine (John 15:5).
- **Sanctification:**
  - We learn to walk one step at a time, leaning on Jesus.

## Slide 37 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Shadow:**
  - If you walk in the sunlight, your shadow follows your every move.
  - If we walk in the light of Christ, our lives will shadow His life.
  - Where He goes, we go. What He does, we do.

## Slide 38 – Q15: Being a Doer
- Question: How does James say one may be blessed in his deeds?
- Key Text: James 1:25 – “But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.”

## Slide 39 – Q15: Key Points (Blessing of Obedience)
- **Looking and Continuing:**
  - Implies a steadfast, daily relationship with God's will.
- **Doer of the Work:**
  - Not salvation by works, but salvation *unto* works.
  - Ephesians 2:10 – “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works...”
- **Blessed in his Deed:**
  - Peace comes from a life in harmony with God.
  - Psalm 119:165 – “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.”

## Slide 40 – Q16: The Test of Profession
- Question: What is said of those who profess to know the Lord, and yet do not keep His commandments?
- Key Text: 1 John 2:4 – “He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.”

## Slide 41 – Q16: Key Points (Knowing God)
- **The Test of Knowing Him:**
  - "Knowing" God is an intimate relationship, not just intellectual awareness.
  - Jeremiah 31:34 – “...for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest...”
- **Cheap Grace:**
  - It is a lie to claim salvation while willfully clinging to sin.
- **True Conversion:**
  - The bent of the converted life is toward obedience, not excusing sin.

## Slide 42 – Q17: Passing from Death to Life
- Question: What is the test whereby one may know he has passed from death unto life?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:14 – “We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.”

## Slide 43 – Q17: Key Points (Love as Evidence)
- **From Death to Life:**
  - Describes the resurrection of the soul at conversion (Ephesians 2:1).
- **Loving the Brethren:**
  - The carnal mind is selfish.
  - Genuine love for others proves the Spirit has entered the heart.

## Slide 44 – Q18: Evidence of Love
- Question: How may one be sure he loves the brethren?
- Key Text: 1 John 5:2 – “By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep His commandments.”

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points (Defining Love)
- **Biblical Definition:**
  - Love is seeking the highest good of others according to God's will.
- **Link to the Law:**
  - You cannot love the children of God while sinning against them.
  - Example: You cannot love a neighbor while violating the 7th commandment (adultery) or 8th commandment (stealing).
  - The commandments protect our neighbor.

## Slide 46 – Q19: Loving God
- Question: And what is the love of God?
- Key Text: 1 John 5:3 – “For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.”

## Slide 47 – Q19: Key Points (Love in Action)
- **Action, Not Just Emotion:**
  - John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”
  - We prove love by aligning our will with His.
- **Not Grievous:**
  - To the renewed heart, the law is not a burden but a path of safety.
- **The Easy Yoke:**
  - Obedience is only possible through Christ.
  - Matthew 11:30 – “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”

## Slide 48 – Q20: The Remnant Church
- Question: What will characterize the "remnant" church?
- Key Text: Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 49 – Q20: Key Points (End-Time Faith)
- **The Remnant:**
  - The last remaining piece of fabric, identical to the original apostolic church.
- **Distinguishing Marks:**
  - **Keep the Commandments:** Uplifting God's law (including the Sabbath) when the world makes it void.
  - **Testimony of Jesus:** Defined as the "spirit of prophecy" (Revelation 19:10).
- **The Target of Satan:**
  - The dragon wars against them because their obedience through faith refutes his claims.
  - They are the "patience of the saints" (Revelation 14:12).

## Slide 50 – Q20: Illustration
- **The Fortress:**
  - In war, the enemy attacks the fortress flying the King's true flag.
  - The Remnant refuse to lower the flag of God's Law.
  - They stand firm, not by their own might, but because the Commander (Christ) is inside the fortress with them.
