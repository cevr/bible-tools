## Slide 1 – Q1: Defining Spiritualism
- **Question:** What is Spiritualism defined to be?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 3:4 – “And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Biblical Perspective
- **A Deadly Deception**
  - While secular dictionaries define it as communication with spirits, the Bible defines it as a belief system based on the first lie told in Eden: "Ye shall not surely die."
  - It bypasses God's appointed means of communication (the Bible) in favor of subjective experiences and supernatural manifestations.
- **The Great Controversy Context**
  - This is one of Satan's two master deceptions (alongside Sunday sacredness).
  - By convincing humanity that the dead are alive, Satan prepares the way to impersonate loved ones and lead the world into demon worship (Revelation 16:14 – “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”).
- **The Nature of the Soul**
  - A "soul" is the whole person, not a disembodied entity.
  - Genesis 2:7 – “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”
  - Ezekiel 18:4 – “Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Ventriloquist**
  - A ventriloquist speaks through a dummy, making the lifeless doll appear to have a voice and personality.
  - The audience is entertained by the illusion, but the doll is lifeless.
  - **Application:**
    - In Spiritualism, the "dummy" is the image or memory of the dead.
    - The dead person is asleep and silent.
    - The voice speaking is that of a fallen angel (demon) animating the manifestation to deceive.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Ancient Origins
- **Question:** Did this doctrine exist in ancient times?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 19:31 – “Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Spiritual Defilement
- **A History of Rebellion**
  - This deception is as old as sin itself; anciently called necromancy (consulting the dead).
- **Sanctuary Connection: Defilement**
  - The text warns that seeking these spirits causes one to be "defiled."
  - In the sanctuary service, defilement separated a person from the congregation and from God until a sacrifice was made.
  - Engaging with spiritualism creates a spiritual impurity that severs communion with the Holy Spirit.
- **Familiar Spirits**
  - Refers to demons who "familiarize" themselves with a person’s voice, memories, and habits to impersonate them perfectly after death.
- **Spiritual Adultery**
  - God says, "I am the Lord your God." Consulting the dead is turning away from the Living God to traffic with darkness.

## Slide 6 – Q3: God’s View of Sorcery
- **Question:** How does God regard sorcerers?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:5 – “And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Judgment and Advocacy
- **A Capital Offense**
  - Sorcery is not a harmless curiosity; it is an attempt to gain power or knowledge apart from God.
- **The Investigative Judgment**
  - Malachi places this warning in the context of judgment.
  - In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ desires to be our Advocate (1 John 2:1 – “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous”).
  - For those who cling to sorcery, the Truth becomes a "swift witness" against them rather than a defense for them.
  - We cannot claim Christ’s righteousness while consulting His enemy.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration
- **The King’s Court**
  - Imagine a citizen who ignores the King's open court and lawful procedures.
  - Instead, he makes secret deals with the King's sworn enemy to get what he wants.
  - This is treason.
  - **Application:** Sorcery is treason against the government of Heaven.

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Deception of Liars
- **Question:** What does he call the sorcerers?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 27:9-10 – “Therefore hearken not ye to... your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers; ...for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Losing the Inheritance
- **The Foundational Lie**
  - God plainly calls them liars.
  - They teach that death is not real and God’s Law can be disregarded.
- **Losing the Heavenly Canaan**
  - Ancient Israel risked losing their physical land by listening to false prophets.
  - Spiritual Israel risks losing the heavenly inheritance.
  - We are kept by faith, but listening to "enchanters" replaces biblical faith with presumption.
  - 1 Peter 1:5 – “Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.”

## Slide 11 – Q5: The Severity of the Sin
- **Question:** What was the ancient law concerning witches, and those who had familiar spirits?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 20:27 – “A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Application to the Christian
- **Why the Death Penalty?**
  - In the ancient theocracy, witchcraft was a "cancer" that led to demon worship and severed the covenant.
- **Spiritual Application Today**
  - While we do not execute civil penalties, the spiritual reality remains: "The wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23).
  - Embracing spiritualism cuts the believer off from the Source of Life.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - The only escape from this spiritual death is faith in Christ, who became a curse for us.
  - Galatians 3:13 – “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.”
  - However, we cannot embrace the Savior while holding hands with devils.

## Slide 13 – Q6: Works of the Flesh
- **Question:** With what is witchcraft classed by Paul?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:20-21 – “Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies... I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Sanctification and Victory
- **Works of the Flesh**
  - Witchcraft is grouped with murder and adultery.
  - The desire to control others or seek supernatural power apart from God is a product of the unconverted heart.
- **The Need for Sanctification**
  - Victory over these tendencies comes through the "Fruit of the Spirit" (Galatians 5:22-23).
  - A believer cannot harbor an interest in the occult and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
- **Inheritance Lost**
  - "Shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
  - Rebellion cannot be admitted into the universe a second time.

## Slide 15 – Q7: Where to Seek Counsel
- **Question:** What should one do if asked to inquire of a familiar spirit?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 8:19 – “And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God?”

## Slide 16 – Q7: The High Priest vs. Mediums
- **"Peep and Mutter"**
  - Refers to the indistinct noises mediums use to mimic the dead.
  - In contrast, God speaks clearly through His Word.
- **The Heavenly High Priest**
  - We have a High Priest who lives to make intercession for us.
  - Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”
  - To bypass Jesus and consult a medium is an insult to His ministry. Why seek the dead when we have access to the Living God?

## Slide 17 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Broken Cistern**
  - If you were dying of thirst next to a clear, rushing mountain spring, would you turn away to drink from a muddy, stagnant puddle?
  - God is the Fountain of Living Waters (Jeremiah 2:13 – “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.”).
  - Spiritualism is a broken cistern.

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Command to Test
- **Question:** Is it possible to test every spirit?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 4:1 – “Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God.”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Discernment Required
- **Blind Faith is Not Bible Faith**
  - We are commanded to "try" (test/examine) the spirits.
  - Just as we assay metal to see if it is gold or pyrite (fool's gold), we must test supernatural manifestations.
- **Beyond Feelings**
  - We cannot test spirits by feelings ("it felt peaceful") or senses ("I saw it").
  - Senses can be deceived; the test must be objective.

## Slide 20 – Q9: The Standard of Judgment
- **Question:** By what are we to try them?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Law, Gospel, and Truth
- **The Absolute Standard**
  - Any spirit that contradicts God’s Law (the Ten Commandments) or the Testimony (Scripture/Prophets) is a lying spirit.
- **No Light**
  - Literally "no dawn." Following these spirits leads to eternal night.
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection**
  - True faith establishes the Law rather than voiding it (Romans 3:31).
  - The Holy Spirit writes the Law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
  - Therefore, a spirit that minimizes the Law is an enemy of the Holy Spirit.

## Slide 22 – Q10: Miracles Are Not Proof
- **Question:** Should we have any confidence in signs or wonders presented by those who would try to lead us away from God?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 13:2-3 – “And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods... thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet... for the Lord your God proveth you...”

## Slide 23 – Q10: The Test of Love and Truth
- **Miracles Can Be Counterfeit**
  - Satan and his angels possess supernatural power to heal and predict events.
  - A miracle is **not** proof of truth.
- **The Real Test**
  - Even if the miracle happens, if the message leads away from God's Law, the source is evil.
  - God allows this to "prove" (test) our love. Do we love the sensation of miracles more than the truth of God?
- **Walking by Faith**
  - John 20:29 – “Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.”

## Slide 24 – Q11: The Path of Safety
- **Question:** What course should one pursue under these circumstances?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 13:4 – “Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His voice, and ye shall serve Him, and cleave unto Him.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Obedience and Relationship
- **Keep His Commandments**
  - Spiritualism leads to lawlessness. Safety is found in loving God's Law.
  - Psalm 119:165 – “Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.”
- **Cleave Unto Him**
  - We are safe because we know the Ruler, not just the rules.
  - Through **Justification**, we are accepted; through **Sanctification**, we walk with Him.
  - A daily relationship with Christ makes the counterfeit obvious.

## Slide 26 – Q12: The Dead Know Nothing
- **Question:** We are directed to the "law and to the testimony," by which to try these spirits that assert to be voices from the dead. After one dies, how much does he know of what is going on among men?
- **Key Text:** Job 14:20-21 – “Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Exposing the Fraud
- **Unconscious of Earthly Events**
  - The Bible is explicit: A dead father does not know if his sons are honored or brought low.
- **The Implication**
  - If a "spirit" appears claiming to be a deceased relative and says, "I am watching you," that spirit is a liar.
  - The Bible says the real person "knoweth it not."
  - This simple truth about the state of the dead exposes Spiritualism as a fraud.

## Slide 28 – Q13: Memory and Consciousness
- **Question:** Does he know anything, or have any memory?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Sleeping Until the Resurrection
- **"The Dead Know Not Anything"**
  - Mental processes cease at death.
  - They are not currently enjoying a reward in heaven or suffering in hell; they are in the grave.
- **The Hope of Resurrection**
  - They are "asleep" in Jesus, waiting for His voice.
  - John 5:28-29 – “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come forth...”

## Slide 30 – Q14: Emotions Perish
- **Question:** What does the wise man add, that forever precludes the idea that the dead come back to earth to communicate with the living?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 9:6 – “Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: A Comforting Doctrine
- **No Portion Under the Sun**
  - The dead have no agency or influence in the land of the living.
- **Why This is Comforting**
  - The righteous dead are not in heaven grieving over the sins and sorrows of their loved ones.
  - They are resting peacefully, unconscious of time.
  - The next moment they perceive is the face of Jesus at His return.

## Slide 32 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Deep Surgery**
  - When a patient is under general anesthesia, they are unconscious.
  - They feel no pain, dream no dreams, and do not know how much time passes.
  - Waking up feels instantaneous.
  - **Application:** Death is a dreamless sleep until the Resurrection morning.

## Slide 33 – Q15: The True Identity of the Spirits
- **Question:** Then when miracles are performed by spirits purporting to be those of our dead friends, to what may we attribute them?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:14 – “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Preparing for the Final Conflict
- **Spirits of Devils**
  - These are fallen angels (demons) mimicking loved ones.
- **Global Deception**
  - They target "kings of the earth"—influencing global policy and leadership.
- **The Great Controversy**
  - The goal is to gather the world to the "battle of that great day."
  - By uniting the world under Spiritualism, Satan unites them in rebellion against God's Law.

## Slide 35 – Q16: Latter Day Apostasy
- **Question:** What will be characteristic of "last day" apostasies from the faith?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 4:1 – “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.”

## Slide 36 – Q16: Departure from the Faith
- **Seducing Spirits**
  - The deception appeals to emotions, curiosity, and the desire for connection.
- **Doctrines of Devils**
  - The core doctrine is the natural immortality of the soul, which negates the need for the resurrection.
- **Incompatibility**
  - One cannot hold to the biblical Gospel and Spiritualism simultaneously.
  - To embrace the "spirits" is to "depart from the faith."

## Slide 37 – Q17: Satan’s Disguise
- **Question:** How will Satan deceive the people?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 11:14 – “And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.”

## Slide 38 – Q17: The Angel of Light
- **Not a Monster**
  - Satan does not usually appear as a hideous being; that would deceive no one.
  - He appears as a being of glory, wisdom, and apparent love.
- **Misusing Scripture**
  - Like in the wilderness temptation (Matthew 4:6), he will quote Scripture but misapply it.
  - He will preach a love that requires no obedience.
- **The Safeguard**
  - Only those covered by Christ's righteousness and grounded in the Law can detect the counterfeit.

## Slide 39 – Q18: False Ministers
- **Question:** What role will his agents assume before the end?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 11:15 – “Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness.”

## Slide 40 – Q18: Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing
- **Ministers of Righteousness**
  - Satan’s agents may be pastors, priests, or respected leaders.
  - They will speak of justice, peace, and brotherhood.
- **The Litmus Test**
  - The test is not their title or appearance, but their fidelity to God's Law.
  - If they claim the Law is void or excuse sin, they are agents of the enemy.

## Slide 41 – Q18: Illustration
- **The Counterfeit Bill**
  - A counterfeit $100 bill looks almost exactly like a real one.
  - It has the right colors and portraits.
  - It is the subtle differences—visible only under close inspection—that reveal it is worthless.
  - **Application:** We must inspect all teachings under the close light of the Bible.

## Slide 42 – Q19: The Counterfeit Coming
- **Question:** Will Satan try to counterfeit the coming of Christ, by signs and wonders?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:23-24 – “Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.”

## Slide 43 – Q19: The Final Deception
- **"Lo, Here! Lo, There!"**
  - Satan will appear in different places as a majestic being, healing and blessing.
  - He will likely contradict Scripture by blessing Sunday and changing God's Law.
- **Biblical Contrast**
  - The true Christ comes in the clouds, visible to every eye (Revelation 1:7).
- **The Very Elect**
  - The deception will be so overpowering to the senses that only those anchored in the Word will be safe.
  - They rely on what the Bible *says*, not what they *see*.

## Slide 44 – Q20: The Destruction of the Wicked
- **Question:** After these signs and wonders are shown, what is immediately to take place?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:8 – “And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.”

## Slide 45 – Q20: Truth Triumphs
- **Spirit of His Mouth**
  - Represents the Truth of His Word. The lie cannot exist in the presence of absolute Truth.
- **Sanctuary Closed**
  - At this point, Christ's intercession has ceased.
  - Those who "received not the love of the truth" (2 Thess 2:10) are lost.
  - They preferred the pleasant deception of Spiritualism over the self-denying path of the Cross.

## Slide 46 – Q21: The Shout of Victory
- **Question:** What will those say then, who have maintained their love for the truth?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 25:9 – “And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”

## Slide 47 – Q21: Salvation Realized
- **"This is Our God"**
  - The faithful recognize Him because they have beheld Him by faith in the Sanctuary.
  - They know His character and His voice (John 10:4).
- **"We Have Waited"**
  - Patience is the characteristic of the saints (Revelation 14:12).
  - They did not run after "instant" signs; they waited for God's time.
- **His Salvation**
  - They stand justified by His blood and sanctified by His Spirit, ready to enter eternity.
