Chapter 149
# Support of the Ministry

This study explores the biblical principles of stewardship, tithing, and the support of the gospel work. From the standpoint of the "Great Controversy," money and property are not neutral; they are resources claimed by two opposing kingdoms. God claims them for the salvation of souls and the blessing of humanity; the enemy seeks to use them to foster selfishness and pride.

In the light of **Righteousness by Faith**, we understand that tithing is not a legalistic payment to purchase God’s favor. Rather, it is an outward evidence of a heart that has surrendered its sovereignty to Christ. It is an act of faith, acknowledging that God is the Owner of all things and that we are merely stewards of His goods.

### Q1. What are some of the dangers of the worldly minded?

> "But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition." 1 Tim. 6:9.

**Answer:**
The pursuit of wealth for its own sake is described here as a trap ("snare") that leads to spiritual ruin. The danger lies not in the money itself, but in the *will* to be rich—the heart's desperate grasp for security in created things rather than in the Creator.

*   **The Snare of Self-Sufficiency:** Wealth often whispers to the human heart that it does not need God. This is the antithesis of the gospel, which requires us to acknowledge our spiritual bankruptcy (Matthew 5:3) so that we may receive Christ’s righteousness.
*   **Destruction and Perdition:** These strong terms indicate eternal loss. When material gain displaces God as the supreme object of affection, it breaks the first commandment ("Thou shalt have no other gods before me").
*   **The Solution:** The antidote to the love of money is not poverty, but stewardship—recognizing that we own nothing and God owns everything.

**[ILL] The Anchored Ship:** A ship is made to float *on* the water, but if the water gets *into* the ship, it sinks. A Christian lives in the world and may have resources, but if the love of the world gets into the heart, the believer drowns in "destruction and perdition."

### Q2. What charge is given to those who have much of this world?

> "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy." 1 Tim. 6:17.

**Answer:**
Paul instructs Timothy not to flatter the wealthy, but to warn them against two specific spiritual diseases:
1.  **High-mindedness (Pride):** Thinking that having more makes one *better* than others. In the message of Righteousness by Faith, all stand on level ground at the foot of the cross. The rich man needs the blood of Christ just as desperately as the beggar.
2.  **Misplaced Trust:** Riches are "uncertain." Markets crash, thieves steal, and death separates man from his gold. Trust must be anchored in the "living God."

*   **God as the Giver:** We are permitted to enjoy God's blessings, but we must never love the gift more than the Giver.
*   **Sanctification:** *Sanctification* (the work of the Holy Spirit making us holy in character) involves breaking the power of selfishness. A man may be rich in gold but poor in grace; God desires us to be rich in faith (James 2:5).

### Q3. Who claims the gold and silver of earth?

> "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts." Haggai 2:8.

**Answer:**
This declaration establishes God’s absolute sovereignty. He is the Creator; therefore, He is the Owner.
*   **No Independent Ownership:** Humans do not truly "own" anything in the absolute sense; we are merely possessors or managers for a season.
*   **The Implications for Stewardship:** If the silver is God's, then how we spend it is a religious act. Every transaction is subject to His review. To use His resources to fund vice, vanity, or pride is to misappropriate funds that belong to the King of the Universe.

### Q4. Who owns all the cattle and fowls of the earth?

> "For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine." Ps. 50:10, 11.

**Answer:**
God’s ownership extends to the animate creation—the livestock and sources of food and trade.
*   **The Argument of Psalm 50:** God is telling His people that He does not need their sacrifices because He is hungry (v. 12). He owns it all already.
*   **Why We Give:** We do not give to God to enrich Him, for He owns the "cattle on a thousand hills." We give to acknowledge His sovereignty and to crush the selfishness in our own hearts. It is for *our* benefit that He asks for a return, that we might grow into the likeness of His generous character.

### Q5. Man, then, really owns nothing of this world. In what capacity does he hold property?

> "For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods." Matt. 25:14.

**Answer:**
Man holds property as a **Steward**.
*   **Definition of Steward:** A manager who oversees the affairs and goods of another person. He is accountable to the owner for how those goods are used.
*   **The Trust:** In the parable, the Master delivers "his goods" to the servants. Our time, our talents, our influence, and our money are "His goods."
*   **The Reckoning:** There is a day of accounting (the investigative judgment) where the Master will ask what we did with His property. Did we use it to advance His kingdom, or did we bury it in the earth of worldly pursuits?

**[ILL] The Cashier:** A bank cashier handles millions of dollars daily. It passes through his hands, but he does not become confused and think, "This is mine." He knows he is handling the bank's property. Christians are God's cashiers in this world.

### Q6. How does man have power to get wealth?

> "But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth." Deut. 8:18.

**Answer:**
Even the ability to work—our physical strength, our mental acuity, our business sense—is a direct gift from God.
*   **Preventing Pride:** This text warns against the boast, "My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth" (Deut. 8:17).
*   **Dependence:** Just as we are dependent on Christ for *spiritual* righteousness (Justification), we are dependent on Him for *physical* sustenance. Both the bread for the body and the Bread of Life come from the same hand.

---

### Q7. What, then, should be one's attitude towards God?

> "And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength." Luke 10:27.

**Answer:**
Our attitude should be one of supreme, wholehearted love.
*   **Love and Stewardship:** You cannot love God with "all your strength" while hoarding the *fruits* of that strength (your income) for yourself. True love manifests in giving (John 3:16).
*   **The Connection:** If God has the whole heart, He will have the wallet also. A converted heart leads to a consecrated purse.

---

### Q8. How may one show honor to God?

> "Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase." Prov. 3:9.

**Answer:**
We honor God by giving Him the **Firstfruits**—the very first portion of our income, not the leftovers.
*   **Priority:** Paying tithe and offerings first demonstrates that God is the priority in our lives. Giving what remains after all bills and luxuries are paid honors self, not God.
*   **Principle of Firstfruits:** In the ancient harvest, the first sheaf was waved before the Lord to consecrate the entire harvest. By giving the first portion to God, we invite His blessing upon the rest.

---

### Q9. What part of one's income does the Lord claim?

> "And all the tithe [tenth] of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord." Lev. 27:30.

**Answer:**
The Lord specifically claims **the Tithe (one-tenth)** of the increase.
*   **Definition of Tithe:** The word literally means "a tenth."
*   **"Is the Lord's":** Notice the verb tense. It *is* the Lord's. It does not *become* the Lord's when we put it in the plate. It is His while it is still in our paycheck.
*   **Holy:** To keep what is "holy" for common use is profanity. Just as the Sabbath is holy time, the Tithe is holy substance. We "keep" the Sabbath, and we "return" the tithe; both are acknowledgments of God's authority over time and matter.

---

### Q10. If one withholds from God that which belongs to Him, of what sin is he guilty?

> "Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings." Mal. 3:8.

**Answer:**
Withholding tithe is defined by Scripture as **robbery**.
*   **The Severity:** This is a startling charge. A man may be honest with his neighbors, pay his taxes to Caesar, and be a good citizen, yet be a robber in the eyes of Heaven because he embezzles God's funds.
*   **Righteousness by Faith Application:** A believer who has truly accepted Christ as Lord cannot persistently rob Him. The violation of the eighth commandment ("Thou shalt not steal") applies to God as well as man. The grace of Christ provides the power to overcome selfishness and be honest with God.

---

### Q11. How early in the history of the world do we read of tithe paying?

> "For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all." Heb. 7:1, 2.

**Answer:**
Tithing predates the Levitical law given at Sinai. Abraham, the "father of the faithful," paid tithe to Melchisedec long before the Jewish nation existed.
*   **Moral, Not Just Ceremonial:** This indicates that tithing is a moral obligation and a universal principle of worship, not merely a Jewish ceremonial law that ended at the cross. It was practiced by the patriarchs as part of their covenant relationship with God.

---

### Q12. Tithes were collected under the Melchisedec priesthood. Is that order of priesthood now in existence?

> "Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made a high priest forever after the order of Melchisedec." Heb. 6:20.

**Answer:**
Yes. Christ is our High Priest today in the heavenly sanctuary, and He is of the order of Melchisedec.
*   **The Logic:** Since Abraham (the father of the faithful) paid tithe to Melchisedec (the type of Christ), we (the spiritual children of Abraham) pay tithe to support the ministry of Christ (the Antitype).
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the earthly tabernacle required support, the work of the High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary involves a ministry on earth—the spreading of the gospel—which God designed to be supported by tithe.

---

### Q13. If we are Abraham's children indeed, what should we do?

> "Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham." John 8:39.

**Answer:**
We should do the works of Abraham.
*   **Faith and Works:** We are justified by faith alone, but saving faith is never alone—it produces works. If we claim the faith of Abraham (who believed God and it was counted for righteousness, Gen 15:6), we will demonstrate the works of Abraham (who gave a tenth of all).
*   **Consistency:** One cannot claim the covenant blessings of Abraham while ignoring the covenant duties of Abraham.

---

### Q14. Did Christ, when on earth, approve of the tithing system?

> "Ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone." Matt. 23:23.

**Answer:**
Yes. Jesus explicitly stated, "These ought ye to have done."
*   **The Balance:** Christ rebuked the Pharisees for their legalism—they were meticulous about tithing garden herbs while neglecting justice and mercy. However, He did *not* tell them to stop tithing. He commanded them to practice justice and mercy *and* not leave tithing undone.
*   **Gospel Order:** Tithing is not a substitute for a converted heart, but a converted heart does not neglect tithing.

### Q15. What did Paul say of those who ministered in the temple of the old dispensation?

> "Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?" 1 Cor. 9:13.

**Answer:**
Paul reminds the church that in the Old Testament sanctuary service, the priests were sustained entirely by the offerings and tithes brought to the temple. They did not farm or run businesses; they were set apart for holy service.

---

### Q16. What does he argue from this for the support of gospel ministers?

> "Even so [in like manner] hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel." 1 Cor. 9:14.

**Answer:**
Paul establishes a direct parallel ("Even so").
*   **The Pattern:** Just as the Levitical priests were supported by the tithe to minister in the type (the earthly sanctuary), the gospel ministers are to be supported by the tithe to minister in the antitype (pointing souls to the heavenly sanctuary).
*   **God's Ordinance:** This is not a human invention; the Lord has "ordained" this system. It frees the minister to devote his energies to prayer and the ministry of the Word (Acts 6:4).

---

### Q17. Who only were allowed to minister at the altar?

> "That no stranger which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the Lord." Num. 16:40.

**Answer:**
Only those specifically called and set apart (the seed of Aaron) could minister at the altar.
*   **Application:** The ministry is a sacred calling, not a common profession. The use of the tithe is restricted to the support of this specific work—the ministry of the Word and the work of the gospel. It is not for building repairs, school bills, or general charity, but for the "service of the altar."

---

### Q18. What constituted the living of the Levites?

> "And behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation." Num. 18:21.

**Answer:**
The **Tithe (the tenth)** was their inheritance.
*   **God as Their Portion:** The other tribes received land; Levi received the tithe. God told them, "I am thy part and thine inheritance" (Num 18:20). The tithe was God's property given to His workers.

---

### Q19. The tenth of the herds and of the increase of the field, God claims as His own. Lev. 27:30-32. What did the Saviour command on this point?

> "Then saith He unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." Matt. 22:21.

**Answer:**
Jesus draws a clear distinction between civil duties and religious duties.
*   **Dual Citizenship:** The Christian pays taxes ("tribute") to Caesar for the benefits of civil government (roads, protection). But he must also render to God what is God's.
*   **What is God's?** As established in previous questions, the Tithe is explicitly "the Lord's." Therefore, rendering tithe is a direct fulfillment of Christ's command in Matthew 22.

---

### Q20. Who ought to feel responsible for the support of the minister?

> "If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?" 1 Cor. 9:11.

**Answer:**
Those who receive the spiritual benefit of the gospel are responsible for supporting the messenger.
*   **Reciprocity:** Paul argues that if a minister feeds the flock with the bread of life (spiritual things), it is a small matter for the flock to feed him with material bread ("carnal" or fleshly things). This is a matter of fairness and gratitude.

---

### Q21. Does Paul enforce this doctrine as a duty?

> "For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things." Rom. 15:27.

**Answer:**
Yes, he calls it a "duty" (literally, a debt).
*   **Love's Obligation:** While our salvation is a free gift from God, the spreading of that message costs resources. Those who have been blessed by the "good news" have a moral debt to ensure that news can be carried to others.

---

### Q22. How much of the tithes does the Lord demand to be brought into the store-house?

> "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house." Mal. 3:10.

**Answer:**
God commands that **all** the tithe be brought.
*   **The Storehouse:** In the Old Testament, this was the treasury chambers of the temple (Neh. 13:12-13). In the New Testament economy, this represents the organized treasury of the church body, from which the gospel laborers are supported.
*   **The Purpose:** "That there may be meat [food] in mine house." God’s work should never be hindered by a lack of resources. When the people withhold tithe, the treasury is empty, and the work of warning the world is crippled.

---

### Q23. What will the Lord do for those who give Him His own?

> "And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts." Mal. 3:11.

**Answer:**
God promises protection and blessing. He will "rebuke the devourer" (Satan, the destroyer).
*   **The Mathematics of Faith:** Human logic says 100% is more than 90%. Faith recognizes that 90% with God’s blessing goes further and accomplishes more than 100% without it.
*   **The Covenant:** This is one of the few places in Scripture where God says, "Prove me now herewith" (Mal 3:10). He invites us to test His faithfulness.
*   **Spiritual Blessing:** While this verse speaks of material fruit, the greatest blessing of tithing is spiritual—freedom from the tyranny of selfishness and a closer partnership with Jesus Christ in the work of saving souls.

**[ILL] The Hose:** A garden hose that is blocked at the outlet will eventually burst or stop flowing at the source. A hose that stays open allows water to flow through it freely. God looks for channels through which His means can flow to the world. If we are open channels, He keeps the supply flowing.
