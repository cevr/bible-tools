### Q1. How does the Lord regard the things that have been devoted, or dedicated, to His service?

**“Every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.” Leviticus 27:28.**

**Answer:**

The Scriptures teach a distinct separation between the common and the holy. When an object, a sum of money, a time (like the Sabbath), or a building is "devoted" to God, it passes from common use into the sphere of the sacred. In this verse, the Lord declares such things "most holy." This principle applies with great force to the house of God today.

1.  **The Nature of Holiness:** To be holy means to be set apart exclusively for God's use. Just as the vessels in the ancient sanctuary were not to be used for ordinary cooking or drinking (Daniel 5:2–4, 23), the church building—dedicated to the worship of the Almighty—is not to be treated as a common meeting hall or a place of merchandise.
2.  **Ownership Transfer:** Dedication implies a transfer of ownership. Once a church is dedicated, it belongs to God, not to the congregation or the pastor. Treating it with casualness or disrespect is an infringement upon God’s property rights.
3.  **The Believer as a Devoted Thing:** In the New Testament, this principle extends to the believer. We are "bought with a price" (1 Corinthians 6:19–20). Through the Gospel, we become the temple of the Holy Ghost. Therefore, our bodies and minds are to be treated with the same reverence we would show to a physical sanctuary—kept clean from the defilement of sin and the world.

*   **Definition:** **Holiness:** The state of being set apart for God’s specific use; moral purity. In the sanctuary service, it refers to objects or people removed from common use to serve the Creator.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a beautiful crystal goblet that a King has set aside solely for his own use at his royal table. If a servant were to take that goblet and use it to feed a dog or dig in the dirt, it would be a grave insult to the King. The goblet itself is glass, but the *purpose* assigned to it by the King makes it "most holy." So it is with the church and with the Christian life—we are vessels set apart for the King of Kings.

### Q2. Did Christ exhibit regard for the sanctity of God's house?

**“And they come to Jerusalem; and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold doves; and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple. And He taught, saying unto them, Is it not written My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.” Mark 11:15–17.**

**Answer:**

Jesus, the Prince of Peace, displayed a holy zeal when He encountered irreverence in the Temple. His actions demonstrate that the Gospel of grace does not negate the law of reverence.

1.  **Cleansing the Sanctuary:** Christ’s act of cleansing the earthly temple was a type (a prophetic symbol) of His greater work. He desires to cleanse the "soul temple" of every believer from the traffic of worldly thoughts, pride, and selfishness.
2.  **Distraction from Worship:** The buying and selling may have been for "religious" purposes (sacrificial animals), but it turned the house of God into a marketplace. Noise, bargaining, and greed have no place where the voice of God is to be heard.
3.  **A House of Prayer:** Jesus emphasized the primary purpose of the building: *prayer*. It is the place of communion between the sinner and the Savior. When we fill the church with secular conversation, business discussions, or light joking, we interrupt the work of intercession and communion.
4.  **Christ's Authority:** By "casting out" the traffickers, Jesus showed His authority over the church. Today, He walks in the midst of the "seven golden candlesticks" (the churches, Revelation 1:12–13), observing whether our worship is pure or polluted with the spirit of the world.

*   **Definition:** **Sanctification:** The process of God cleansing the believer from sin and setting them apart for holy living. Just as Jesus cleansed the temple of buyers, the Holy Spirit cleanses the heart of sinful habits (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

**[ILL]**
If you were invited to meet with a head of state to plead for the life of your child, you would not bring items to sell to the other people in the waiting room. You would be focused, quiet, and earnest. The church is the audience chamber of the Monarch of the Universe, where we plead for the lives of sinners. The atmosphere should reflect the seriousness of this mission.

### Q3. How can it be proved that the words of Scripture, quoted by Christ, do not apply to the Jewish temple alone?

**“Even them [the sons of the stranger] will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon Mine altar; for Mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.” Isaiah 56:7.**

**Answer:**

The prophecy of Isaiah looks forward to the Gospel era, proving that the sanctity of God's house was not limited to the Old Covenant or the Jewish nation.

1.  **For All People:** The designation "house of prayer for all people" includes the Gentiles ("sons of the stranger"). This points to the Christian church, where the partition wall between Jew and Gentile is broken down by Christ (Ephesians 2:14).
2.  **Joyful Worship:** God promises to make them "joyful" in His house. True reverence is not a gloomy, depressing burden. It is the fruit of **Righteousness by Faith**. When we realize that our "burnt offerings and sacrifices" (which typify Christ's perfect sacrifice) are accepted by the Father, our hearts are filled with holy joy. We reverence the house because it is the place where we celebrate our acceptance in the Beloved.
3.  **Accepted Sacrifices:** Today, we do not offer animals, but we offer the "sacrifice of praise" (Hebrews 13:15) and the living sacrifice of our bodies (Romans 12:1). These are accepted only through the merits of Jesus, our High Priest.

*   **Definition:** **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation between God and man. In the Old Testament, it was illustrated by animal sacrifices; in the New Testament, it is accomplished by Christ’s death and His high priestly ministry in heaven.

### Q4. Give another prophetic statement of this matter, relating to the same time.

**“For, from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, My name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto My name, and a pure offering; for My name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.” Malachi 1:11.**

**Answer:**

Malachi predicts a time when the worship of the true God would extend globally ("from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same").

1.  **Universal Reverence:** God's name is to be "great" among the nations. This greatness is acknowledged through reverent worship. Where God is truly known, He is deeply feared and honored.
2.  **Incense and Pure Offering:** In the book of Revelation, "incense" represents the prayers of the saints mingled with the righteousness of Christ (Revelation 8:3–4).
    *   This is a beautiful picture of **Righteousness by Faith**: Our prayers (incense) are only acceptable because they are mixed with the sweet fragrance of Christ's merits.
    *   A "pure offering" signifies a heart cleansed by grace. God does not accept the worship of those who cherish sin (Psalm 66:18). The offering must be purified by the blood of Jesus.
3.  **"In Every Place":** Holiness is no longer tied to a specific mountain in Jerusalem (John 4:21, 23), but wherever true believers gather in Spirit and in Truth, that place becomes a "house of God," requiring the same reverence due to the ancient temple.

**[ILL]**
Think of a diplomat representing their country in a foreign land. Even though they are far from their capital city, their embassy is treated as sovereign territory. In the same way, every Christian church is an embassy of Heaven on earth. It represents the government of God in enemy territory (this world), and it demands the respect due to the Kingdom it represents.

### Q5. How should we conduct ourselves in the house of God?

**“But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of Thy mercy; and in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy temple.” Psalm 5:7.**

**Answer:**

David provides the perfect balance for Christian worship: an awareness of God's mercy and a sense of profound awe.

1.  **The Multitude of Mercy:** We cannot enter God’s presence based on our own goodness. We enter only because of His "multitude of mercy." This is the foundation of **Justification by Faith**. We come as beggars to a feast, clothed in the robe of Christ's righteousness, not our own.
2.  **In Thy Fear:** Because we realize the cost of that mercy—the life of the Son of God—our response is not flippancy, but "fear" (reverence). A casual attitude in church suggests we do not understand the price paid for our presence there.
3.  **Worship Toward the Holy Temple:** Even when in the earthly sanctuary, David looked "toward" the holy temple. Our eyes should be lifted to the Heavenly Sanctuary where Jesus now ministers for us (Hebrews 8:1–2). Our behavior on earth should reflect the solemnity of the judgment hour in heaven.

*   **Definition:** **Justification:** The legal act of God declaring a repentant sinner "righteous." It is an unmerited gift received by faith in Jesus (Romans 3:24). It gives us the "title" to heaven.

**[ILL]**
If a judge pardons a criminal who was sentenced to death, that criminal does not dance out of the courtroom making jokes. He leaves with a sense of humble gratitude and solemn joy, knowing his life was spared by grace. This is the "fear" and "mercy" David speaks of.

### Q6. Has Christ given us an inducement to worship Him in His house?

**“For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.” Matthew 18:20.**

**Answer:**

The greatest inducement (motivation) to attend church is the promised personal presence of Jesus Christ.

1.  **The Real Presence:** It is not the number of people, the quality of the choir, or the eloquence of the preacher that constitutes a church; it is the presence of Christ.
2.  **In My Name:** To gather in His name means to gather in accordance with His character and truth. It implies surrendering to His authority.
3.  **Christ in the Midst:** In the ancient sanctuary, the Shekinah glory dwelt above the mercy seat. Today, that glory is spiritual but no less real. If we truly believed Jesus was walking down the aisles and sitting in the pews, how would it change our posture, our dress, and our conversation? It would eliminate sleeping, texting, whispering, and criticism.

### Q7. If Christ is present, how ought His people to regard the place which He thus honors?

**“And the Captain of the lord's host said unto Joshua, loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.” Joshua 5:15.**

**Answer:**

When Joshua met the pre-incarnate Christ ("Captain of the Lord's host"), the ground became holy because of the Divine Presence.

1.  **Physical Acts of Reverence:** The command to remove his shoes shows that our internal attitude must be demonstrated by external actions. While we do not remove our literal shoes in Western culture, we must "remove" the dust of the world—our worldly business, politics, and social gossip—before entering the sanctuary.
2.  **Recognizing Authority:** Joshua was the leader of Israel, yet he had to humble himself before a greater Commander. In the church, all human distinctions fade. Rich and poor, leader and layperson, all bow before Christ.
3.  **Preparation:** We should prepare our hearts before the service begins. Rushing into the presence of God with a mind full of secular stress is like walking onto holy ground with muddy shoes.

**[ILL]**
In many Asian cultures, removing shoes before entering a home is a sign of respect—leaving the dirt of the street outside to keep the home pure. Spiritually, when we enter church, we should leave the "mud" of the work-week outside the door. We are entering the Father's house.

### Q8. What words of caution does the "Preacher" give us?

**“Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God.” Ecclesiastes 5:1.**

**Answer:**

Solomon, the "Preacher," warns against hasty and thoughtless worship.

1.  **"Keep Thy Foot":** This suggests guarding one's steps or conduct. It implies deliberation. We should not rush into worship carelessly.
2.  **Ready to Hear:** The verse continues, "be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools." The house of God is primarily a place to hear the voice of God from His Word.
3.  **The Sacrifice of Fools:** This refers to religious activity without heart obedience. It is offering lip service while the heart is far from God.
    *   *RBF Connection:* True obedience comes from the heart (Romans 6:17). External rituals without a surrendered heart are offensive to God. To sing hymns while harboring bitterness, or to pray while planning sin, is the "sacrifice of fools."

### Q9. Name one of the reasons why God rejected His chosen people.

**“For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight, saith the lord; they have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to pollute it.” Jeremiah 7:30.**

**Answer:**

One of the primary causes for the Babylonian captivity was the pollution of the Temple. This serves as a solemn warning to the remnant church.

1.  **Mixing the Holy and Profane:** The people brought idols ("abominations") into the very temple of God. Today, "idols" can be more subtle: fashion, the worship of intellect, political partisanship, or cultural entertainment styles that mimic the world.
2.  **Polluting the Sanctuary:** God considers the introduction of worldly elements into His worship as "pollution." The church is to be a light *to* the world, not a reflection *of* the world.
3.  **Sanctuary Message Application:** We are living in the time of the cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary (Daniel 8:14). If Jesus is cleansing the record of sin above, we should not be bringing the practice of sin into His church below.

*   **Definition:** **Abomination:** In Scripture, this often refers to idolatry or practices that are deeply offensive to God's character of love and purity.

### Q10. What instruction had the lord given His people regarding their treatment of His earthly dwelling place?

**“Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary; I am the Lord.” Leviticus 19:30.**

**Answer:**

God links the holiness of *time* (the Sabbath) with the holiness of *space* (the Sanctuary).

1.  **Twin Pillars of Worship:** The Sabbath and the Sanctuary are the two great institutions that preserve the knowledge of God. The Sabbath reminds us He is the Creator; the Sanctuary reminds us He is the Redeemer.
2.  **Reverence is commanded:** It is not a suggestion. "I am the Lord" indicates that this command rests on His sovereign authority.
3.  **Practical Reverence:** This includes:
    *   Entering quietly.
    *   Refraining from whispering/talking during the service.
    *   Dressing modestly to cover the nakedness of nature, glorifying God rather than self.
    *   Training children to respect the house of God.

### Q11. How are all required to serve God?

**“Serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear.” Hebrews 12:28.**

**Answer:**

The Apostle Paul summarizes the Christian's duty in light of the unshakable Kingdom we are receiving.

1.  **Acceptable Service:** Not all worship is acceptable (remember Cain and Abel). Acceptable service is defined by God, not by human preference. It must be according to truth and offered in the name of Jesus.
2.  **Reverence and Godly Fear:** The Greek word for "godly fear" implies caution and circumspection. It means we are careful not to offend a holy God.
3.  **The Source of Power:** The verse begins, "Let us have grace." We cannot manufacture this reverence on our own.
    *   *RBF Connection:* It is the grace of God entering the heart that produces true reverence. A man who realizes he has been saved from eternal death by the blood of Christ will naturally be reverent. A lack of reverence often indicates a lack of appreciation for the Gospel.

### Q12. In what frame of mind does David desire to worship? and what does he call the temple?

**“But as for me, I will come into Thy house in the multitude of Thy mercy; and in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy temple.” Psalm 5:7.**

**Answer:**

*(Note: While this verse was used in Q5, this question asks for specific details regarding David's mindset and the title of the building.)*

1.  **Frame of Mind:** David’s mindset is one of **humble dependence**. He does not come boasting of his victories or his kingly status. He comes relying on the "multitude of mercy." This is the mindset of every true believer—we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone.
2.  **Title of the Building:** He calls it "Thy holy temple." It is not "my church" or "our meeting house." It is *God's* Holy Temple.
    *   To call it "holy" means it is distinct from his palace or the other buildings in Jerusalem.
    *   Acknowledging it as God’s property changes how we treat the furniture, the hymnals, and the facility itself. We are guests in the King's house.

### Q13. Where, does he say, is God especially to be feared?

**“God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about Him.” Psalm 89:7.**

**Answer:**

While God is to be feared privately, there is a special emphasis on corporate reverence.

1.  **The Assembly of the Saints:** When the church gathers, it forms a corporate body—the Body of Christ. There is a unique manifestation of God's Spirit in the assembly (Acts 2:1–4).
2.  **Greatly to be Feared:** The text says *greatly*. The collective worship of God should be the most majestic, solemn, and joyful event of the week. It should exceed the reverence we show to earthly courts or dignitaries.
3.  **Those "About Him":** In the heavenly vision, the angels and elders who are "about Him" (around the throne) cover their faces and cry "Holy, Holy, Holy" (Isaiah 6:2–3). The church on earth is the outer court of that heavenly assembly. We should reflect the atmosphere of heaven.

*   **Definition:** **Saints:** Literally "holy ones." In the Bible, this refers to all true believers who have been set apart by God, not just a special class of super-Christians.

**[ILL]**
If you walked into a library, you would whisper out of respect for the readers. If you walked into a court of law, you would stand when the judge enters out of respect for the law. How much more, when we enter the assembly of the saints, should we show respect for the Judge of all the earth and the Author of our salvation?

### Q14. Should any performance which does not relate to the service of God, be conducted in a house dedicated to His service?

**NOTE. — It is God's plan that His people come together in His house to worship and praise Him, and to study His Holy Word. Within those sacred precincts on the Sabbath day, they are not to transact common business, or even sacred business that could be done on another day of the week. Far too often the people of God reserve for the Sabbath hours various activities which could be done on other days.**

**Answer:**

Based on the principles established in the previous scriptures (Leviticus 27:28, Mark 11:15-17), the answer is **No.**

1.  **Exclusive Use:** A building dedicated to God is for His service *only*. Common performances, secular concerts, political rallies, or mere social entertainment lower the standard of holiness and confuse the distinction between the church and the world.
2.  **The Sabbath Principle:** As the Note indicates, the sanctity of the *place* is often violated alongside the sanctity of *time*. Discussing church business finances, board meetings, or planning social events during the Sabbath hours within the sanctuary distracts the mind from the "pure offering" of worship.
3.  **The Focus of Worship:** The purpose of the gathering is to:
    *   Praise God.
    *   Study His Word.
    *   Seek the power of the Holy Spirit for victory over sin.
    *   Anything that does not contribute to these ends should be excluded from the sanctuary.

**[ILL]**
A hospital operating room is dedicated to saving lives. We would not hold a party or a board meeting in the operating room; it is kept sterile and ready for its life-saving work. The church is God's hospital for saving souls. It must be kept spiritually "sterile"—free from the germs of worldliness and commonness—so that the Great Physician can perform His work on the hearts of men.
