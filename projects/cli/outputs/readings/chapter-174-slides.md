## Slide 1 – Q1: Solomon’s Test of Pleasure

- **Question:** To what extent did the wise man test the pleasures of the world?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 2:10 – “And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not
  from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all
  my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.”
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 2:1 – “I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will
  prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is
  vanity.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Experiment of Hedonism

- **A Total Experiment:**
  - Solomon possessed the wealth and wisdom to conduct a complete test of human
    happiness.
  - He did not merely sample pleasure; he immersed himself in it, removing all
    restraints.
- **The Nature of the Human Heart:**
  - The heart was created to be the dwelling place of God.
  - When man separated from God, a void was created.
  - Solomon tried to fill this infinite void with finite things—riches,
    laughter, and entertainment.
- **The Futility of Self-Seeking:**
  - The carnal mind believes _more_ of the world will bring peace, but Scripture
    says the appetite is never satisfied.
  - Proverbs 27:20 – “Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man
    are never satisfied.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Bucket with a Hole:**
  - Imagine a bucket with a hole in the bottom.
  - You can pour the most expensive wines or sweetest waters into it, but it
    never fills up.
- **Spiritual Application:**
  - Solomon poured the world into his heart, but he had disconnected from the
    Source.
  - Jeremiah 2:13 – “For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken
    me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken
    cisterns, that can hold no water.”
  - Only Christ can fill the soul.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Result of the Search

- **Question:** How much true enjoyment did such a course afford?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 2:11 – “Then I looked on all the works that my
  hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold,
  all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.”
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 14:13 – “Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and
  the end of that mirth is heaviness.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Vanity and Vexation

- **Meaning of Vanity:**
  - The Hebrew word _hebel_ means "breath" or "vapor."
  - Worldly pleasures are fleeting and unsubstantial.
- **Vexation of Spirit:**
  - This signifies a "chasing after wind."
  - Instead of peace, the pursuit of pleasure brought frustration and inner
    turmoil.
- **The Mask of Laughter:**
  - Outward laughter often masks deep internal pain (Proverbs 14:13).
  - The "heaviness" that follows is the inevitable crash when the distraction
    ends and the soul is left alone with its guilt.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (Peace through Justification)

- **The Need for Peace:**
  - True peace comes only from being made right with God.
  - Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
    through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
- **Definition of Justification:**
  - God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of
    Christ’s merits, not their own works.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
    that is in Christ Jesus.”
  - Without this assurance, "fun" is merely an anesthetic against reality.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Who Enjoys Folly?

- **Question:** To whom alone is such mirth enjoyable?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 15:21 – “Folly is joy to him that is destitute of
  wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Spiritual Bankruptcty

- **Destitute of Wisdom:**
  - To be "destitute" means to be without resources.
  - The person who finds joy in sin is spiritually bankrupt and lacks the "mind
    of Christ."
  - 1 Corinthians 2:16 – “For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may
    instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.”
- **The Carnal Nature:**
  - The natural heart is at enmity with God and enjoys what God hates.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
  - If we love the world, it is a sign the heart needs a new birth (John 3:3).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Sanctification and New Tastes

- **A Change of Taste:**
  - Sanctification involves a transformation of our desires.
  - As we behold Christ, the "pleasures of sin for a season" lose their flavor.
  - Hebrews 11:25 – “Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of
    God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.”
- **Hungering for Righteousness:**
  - The believer hungers for God rather than folly.
  - Matthew 5:6 – “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
    righteousness: for they shall be filled.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Wise Man’s Conclusion

- **Question:** What conclusion did the wise man reach?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 2:13 – “Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as
  far as light excelleth darkness.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Light vs. Darkness

- **Darkness (Folly):**
  - Folly blinds the eyes.
  - The pleasure-seeker stumbles because they do not see the consequences or the
    reality of eternity.
- **Light (Wisdom):**
  - To walk in wisdom is to walk with Christ, who is the Light.
  - John 8:12 – “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
    world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the
    light of life.”
- **The Value of Sobriety:**
  - Living with "eyes in his head" (Eccl 2:14) allows one to navigate life
    safely.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **Walking in the Forest:**
  - **Night (Folly):** A man walking through a forest without a lantern will
    fall into a pit or walk off a cliff.
  - **Noon (Wisdom):** A man walking the same path in the light sees the dangers
    and avoids them.
- **Lesson:**
  - Sobriety is the daylight of the soul.
  - It allows us to see life through the lens of the Great Controversy between
    good and evil.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Sobriety vs. Levity

- **Question:** Why is sobriety preferable to levity?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 7:3 – “Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the
  sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.”
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 7:2 – “It is better to go to the house of mourning,
  than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the
  living will lay it to his heart.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: The House of Mourning

- **The Benefit of Reflection:**
  - Tragedy or mourning forces us to confront our mortality.
  - It leads to self-examination: "Am I right with God? What is my purpose?"
- **Feasting Breeds Forgetfulness:**
  - Constant entertainment is often designed to make us forget God and our
    accountability.
  - It keeps the mind in a stupor, preventing serious thought.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Godly Sorrow and Repentance

- **Godly Sorrow:**
  - Scripture speaks of a sorrow that leads to salvation.
  - 2 Corinthians 7:10 – “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not
    to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.”
- **Making the Heart Better:**
  - Realizing the cost of sin (the life of God’s Son) purifies the heart.
  - Levity rarely leads to the Cross; a sober realization of our need does.
  - Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
    blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of
    the Lord.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Warning to the Youth

- **Question:** Of what does the wise man bid the young to be mindful, even in
  the pursuit of pleasure?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 11:9 – “Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let
  thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
  heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these
  things God will bring thee into judgment.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Freedom and Accountability

- **The Balance:**
  - We have free will to "walk in the ways of our heart," but we cannot choose
    the consequences.
  - The reality of the Judgment creates a boundary for behavior.
- **The Judgment:**
  - All must appear before Christ; every secret thing is recorded.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:10 – “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of
    Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to
    that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Application (Sanctuary and Judgment)

- **Living in the Day of Atonement:**
  - Ancient Israel was to "afflict their souls" (be sober) while the sanctuary
    was cleansed.
  - Leviticus 23:27 – “Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall
    be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye
    shall afflict your souls...”
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - We live in the time when Christ is finishing His work in the heavenly
    sanctuary (Daniel 8:14).
  - The books are open (Daniel 7:9-10).
  - Sobriety means living with the awareness that our lives are being reviewed
    by Heaven.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Instructions to Titus

- **Question:** What injunction to sobriety does the apostle give in his epistle
  to Titus?
- **Key Text:** Titus 2:2, 6 – “That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate,
  sound in faith, in charity, in patience... Young men likewise exhort to be
  sober minded.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: A Universal Call to Holiness

- **Aged Men and Women:**
  - Called to be grave (dignified), temperate, and teachers of good things.
  - Experience should lead to spiritual maturity, not cynicism or gossip.
- **Young Men and Women:**
  - Called to be "sober-minded"—self-controlled and governed by the Spirit.
  - This opposes being impulsive or driven by passion.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Grace and Righteousness by Faith

- **How is this possible?**
  - We cannot produce sobriety by human effort alone. It is the work of Grace.
  - Titus 2:11-12 – “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
    to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
    should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world.”
- **Christ Living in Us:**
  - We yield to Christ, and He lives His sober, righteous life through us.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me...”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Advice to the Romans

- **Question:** What similar advice is given in the epistle to the Romans?
- **Key Text:** Romans 13:13 – “Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in
  rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and
  envying.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Walking in the Day

- **Walking Honestly:**
  - The Christian life should be transparent ("in the day").
  - "Rioting" (wild partying) and "chambering" (immorality) belong to the
    darkness.
- **Emotional Sobriety:**
  - Paul lists "strife and envying" alongside drunkenness.
  - Uncontrolled anger is as carnal as physical intoxication.
- **The Secret of Victory:**
  - Romans 13:14 – “But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision
    for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration (Putting on Christ)

- **The Beggar and the Robe:**
  - A beggar in dirty rags cannot attend a royal wedding by patching his
    clothes.
  - He must take them off and put on the King’s provided robe.
- **Application:**
  - Our own righteousness is like filthy rags.
  - When we "put on" Christ (His character and righteousness), our behavior
    changes because our covering has changed.
  - We overcome intemperance by being clothed with Him.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Peter’s Testimony

- **Question:** What testimony does the apostle Peter bear on this point?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:13 – “Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be
  sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
  revelation of Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Girding the Mind

- **Gird Up the Loins:**
  - Imagery of gathering up long robes to run or fight.
  - **Meaning:** Do not let thoughts drag in the mud of the world. Gather your
    thoughts and focus on Christ.
- **Hope to the End:**
  - Sobriety is not despair; it is focused hope on the Second Coming.
- **Future Grace:**
  - We are saved by grace now, but "grace to be brought" refers to the final
    deliverance and glorification when Jesus returns.
  - 2 Corinthians 12:9 – “And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee:
    for my strength is made perfect in weakness.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Necessity of Vigilance

- **Question:** Why is vigilance especially necessary?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 5:8 – “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the
  devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: The Great Controversy

- **The Reality of War:**
  - We are in a war zone against an intelligent, malicious enemy.
  - Satan seeks to "devour" souls through temptation, discouragement, and
    deception.
- **Resisting through Faith:**
  - Vigilance means being wide awake. Spiritual drowsiness is dangerous.
  - 1 Peter 5:9 – “Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same
    afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.”
  - We resist by claiming the blood of the Lamb.

## Slide 29 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Escaped Lion:**
  - If a lion escaped the zoo and was roaming your neighborhood, you would not
    be careless.
  - You would be alert ("sober") and watchful ("vigilant").
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The danger to our souls is just as real.
  - We must guard the avenues of the soul (senses and thoughts) to prevent the
    enemy from entering the temple of the heart.

## Slide 30 – Q11: The End is at Hand

- **Question:** What other consideration should lead us to sobriety?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 4:7 – “But the end of all things is at hand: be ye
  therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.”

## Slide 31 – Q11: Watching Unto Prayer

- **Urgency of the Time:**
  - The apostles expected the return of Christ; we see the signs fulfilled
    around us.
- **The Connection to Prayer:**
  - A sober mind is a praying mind.
  - Matthew 26:41 – “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the
    spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
- **Preparation:**
  - "Watching unto prayer" maintains a constant connection with Heaven.
  - God is preparing a people to stand in the final days—people with clear
    minds, surrendered to the Spirit, and separated from the intoxication of the
    world.
