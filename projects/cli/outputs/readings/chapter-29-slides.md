## Slide 1 – Q1: Sincerity vs. Truth
- Question: Does it make any difference what a man believes, if he is only sincere?
- Key Text: 2 Thessalonians 2:13 – “But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.”
- Key Text: Joshua 24:14 – “Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Function of Truth
- **Salvation involves two agencies:**
  - The Sanctification of the Spirit.
  - The belief of the truth.
- **How Truth Works:**
  - The Holy Spirit uses truth as the mold to shape a Christ-like character.
  - The Spirit cannot use error (e.g., believing the law is abolished) to produce holiness.
- **Sincerity is Not Enough:**
  - Saul of Tarsus was sincere when persecuting Christians (Acts 26:9 – “I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.”).
  - Sincerity in error can lead to destruction; only sincerity in the truth leads to safety.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Connection to Righteousness
- **Sanctification Defined:**
  - It is the ongoing work of God’s grace setting the believer apart from sin (1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:”).
- **The Necessity of Truth:**
  - False doctrines regarding God’s character or law lead to defects in human character.
  - We ultimately become like the god we worship.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Sincere Traveler:**
  - Imagine a traveler wanting to go to New York who sincerely believes a south-bound train will take him there.
  - He boards with peace and assurance, but he is moving away from his destination.
- **The Lesson:**
  - His sincerity does not change the direction of the train.
  - Sincerity cannot convert error into truth.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Determining Truth
- Question: How may we determine the truthfulness of any doctrine?
- Key Text: 1 Thessalonians 5:21 – “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.”
- Key Text: Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Standard of Judgment
- **The Divine Yardstick:**
  - Just as a ruler measures length, the Bible measures truth.
  - Every teaching or feeling must be tested by:
    - The **Law of God** (The Ten Commandments).
    - The **Testimony** (The inspired writings of the prophets).
- **Harmony of Scripture:**
  - True doctrine will not contradict the "law and the prophets."
  - If a teaching minimizes God's law, it must be rejected regardless of how popular it is.

## Slide 7 – Q2: The Spirit of Prophecy
- **Identifying the Remnant:**
  - In the last days, God's people are identified by the commandments and the testimony of Jesus.
  - Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”
  - Revelation 19:10 – “...worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”
- **Conclusion:**
  - True doctrine always aligns with the established testimony of God’s Spirit.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Bank Teller:**
  - Tellers do not study thousands of counterfeit bills to recognize fakes.
  - They study the genuine bill so thoroughly that they instantly recognize an imperfect copy.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The Bible is the genuine currency of truth.
  - Thorough study of the Word enables us to detect the counterfeit doctrines of the enemy.

## Slide 9 – Q3: The Foundation
- Question: Upon what foundation should every religious tenet rest?
- Key Text: Ephesians 2:20 – “And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;”
- Key Text: 1 Corinthians 3:11 – “For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Christ the Cornerstone
- **A Unified Foundation:**
  - The **Apostles** (New Testament) and **Prophets** (Old Testament) form one foundation.
  - The Bible is a unified book; we cannot discard the Old Testament.
- **The Center of Doctrine:**
  - **Atonement:** The work of Christ in reconciling God and man.
  - All true doctrine centers on Christ: His deity, death, resurrection, and high priestly ministry.
  - Any doctrine shifting focus to human works or traditions is a sandy foundation (Matthew 7:26-27).

## Slide 11 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Resting on the Rock:**
  - Because Christ is the foundation, our standing before God rests entirely on Him.
  - We are not built on our own merits, but on the merit of the Chief Cornerstone.
  - True religion is not high emotionalism or complex philosophy, but resting squarely on Jesus and His Word.

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Skyscraper:**
  - If a builder erects a skyscraper on shifting mud, the higher he builds, the more dangerous it becomes.
  - A religious life built on feelings or traditions rather than the Word of God is unstable and dangerous.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Scripture’s Profitability
- Question: What is mentioned first in the list of those things for which all Scripture is profitable?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 3:16 – “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:”

## Slide 14 – Q4: The Priority of Doctrine
- **First Doctrine, Then Life:**
  - "Doctrine" simply means "teaching."
  - Before one can be "instructed in righteousness" (sanctification), they must know God's definitions of right and wrong.
- **Knowing the True Christ:**
  - We cannot separate Christ from doctrine. Doctrine tells us who He is.
  - Without sound doctrine, we might worship "another Jesus" (2 Corinthians 11:4 – “For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached... ye might well bear with him.”).
- **Preparation:**
  - 2 Timothy 3:17 – “That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”
  - True doctrine is the necessary equipment for a righteous life.

## Slide 15 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Medical Student:**
  - A student must study the "doctrine" of anatomy before practicing surgery.
  - If he skips the books to "just experience" surgery, he endangers the patient.
  - Similarly, the Christian must know God's will (doctrine) to practice righteousness safely.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Advice to Timothy
- Question: What advice is given to Timothy while preparing for the gospel ministry?
- Key Text: 1 Timothy 4:13 – “Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.”
- Key Text: 1 Timothy 4:16 – “Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.”

## Slide 17 – Q5: Balance of Life and Truth
- **Thyself and The Doctrine:**
  - Paul commands attention to both the life ("thyself") and the teaching ("doctrine").
  - Truth without a holy life is hypocrisy.
  - A "good life" with false doctrine is deceptive.
- **Salvation Involved:**
  - Negligence in doctrine endangers salvation for both the teacher and the hearer.
- **Experience First:**
  - We must experience the transforming power of Christ ("thyself") before we can effectively share the doctrine.

## Slide 18 – Q6: The Charge
- Question: What remarkable charge is given him relative to his public work?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 4:1 – “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;”
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 4:2 – “Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Judgment and Preaching
- **The Context of Judgment:**
  - The charge is given in view of the Judgment of the living and the dead.
  - **Investigative Judgment:** Christ examines lives before His return (Daniel 7:9-10).
- **The Command:**
  - Preach the Word—not politics or philosophy.
  - The Word is the sword that reaches the heart (Hebrews 4:12).
- **The Method:**
  - Reprove and rebuke with "all longsuffering."
  - We must reflect Christ: firm in principle, yet tender with the sinner.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Why Imperative?
- Question: Why is this duty so imperative?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 4:3 – “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;”
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 4:4 – “And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Itching Ears and Fables
- **Rejection of Truth:**
  - Men naturally reject truth that calls for self-denial or obedience.
  - They desire "smooth things" (Isaiah 30:10) to validate their "lusts" (worldly desires).
- **Turning to Fables:**
  - Rejecting biblical truth (Creation, Sabbath, State of the Dead) leads to believing fables (Evolution, Spiritualism).
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Compromising doctrine surrenders ground to Satan, the father of lies.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Diabetic Patient:**
  - A patient might fire a doctor who forbids sugar and hire a "quack" who says, "Eat all the candy you want."
  - The patient feels happier with the quack, but his health is destroyed.
  - Heaping up teachers to validate sin leads to spiritual death.

## Slide 23 – Q8: Titus’s Instruction
- Question: How was Titus instructed to teach? And in what was he to be a pattern?
- Key Text: Titus 2:1 – “But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:”
- Key Text: Titus 2:7 – “In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Pattern of Good Works
- **Uncorruptness and Gravity:**
  - Handling God’s Word requires dignity ("gravity"), not lightness or jokes.
- **Faith and Works Union:**
  - **Justification:** We are imputed righteous.
  - **Sanctification:** We are imparted righteousness, leading to good works.
  - Titus was to show that sound doctrine produces a "pattern of good works."
- **Healthy Doctrine:**
  - "Sound" implies health. Pure doctrine leads to spiritual health; corrupt doctrine leads to spiritual disease.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Power of Doctrine
- Question: What is the power of sound doctrine?
- Key Text: Titus 1:9 – “Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Convincing Power
- **Silencing Opposition:**
  - A "gainsayer" is one who opposes truth.
  - The "faithful word" is the only weapon powerful enough to reach the conscience (John 16:8).
- **Holding Fast:**
  - We cannot help others stand if we are not standing firmly on the Rock ourselves.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - As the High Priest uses blood and incense in heaven, His ambassadors on earth use the Word to reconcile men to God.

## Slide 27 – Q10: Danger of False Teaching
- Question: What danger attends false teaching?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 2:18 – “Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Overthrowing Faith
- **A Specific Error:**
  - Some taught the resurrection was only spiritual and already past.
  - This destroyed the hope of Christ's return and physical restoration.
- **The Result:**
  - False teaching is a spiritual catastrophe.
  - "Overthrowing faith" means the collapse of the believer's spiritual house.
  - Today, errors regarding the law or sin can similarly overthrow faith in Jesus as a complete Savior.

## Slide 29 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Defective Compass:**
  - If a ship’s compass is slightly magnetized to point off-center, the ship may run aground.
  - The error in the instrument leads to shipwreck.
  - False doctrine leads to the "shipwreck" of the soul (1 Timothy 1:19).

## Slide 30 – Q11: True Discipleship
- Question: Who are the disciples of Jesus? And what gracious work is wrought for them?
- Key Text: John 8:31 – “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;”
- Key Text: John 8:32 – “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”

## Slide 31 – Q11: Freedom in the Word
- **Continuing in the Word:**
  - Discipleship is a daily, living connection ("abiding") in the Word.
- **Freedom from Sin:**
  - John 8:34 – “Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.”
  - The Truth liberates us from the power and slavery of sin.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The Gospel forgives the past (Justification) and liberates the present (Sanctification).
  - Knowing the truth about Christ's indwelling power breaks the chains of habit.

## Slide 32 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Dungeon Map:**
  - A prisoner in a dungeon is trapped despite his strength.
  - If a map showing a secret exit is slid under the door, the *truth* of that map sets him free.
  - The Bible is the map showing the way out of the prison house of sin.

## Slide 33 – Q12: Means of Sanctification
- Question: Through what are they to be sanctified?
- Key Text: John 17:17 – “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”

## Slide 34 – Q12: The Agent of Holiness
- **How We Change:**
  - Sanctification (becoming holy) is accomplished through the Truth.
  - We are not sanctified by emotionalism or social programs, but by the Word.
- **Sanctuary Symbolism:**
  - The **Table of Shewbread** in the Holy Place represented the Word.
  - Priests ate the bread to sustain ministry; we must "eat" the Word to sustain spiritual life (John 6:63).
- **Application:**
  - To neglect Bible study is to starve the soul of the very means God ordained for its holiness.

## Slide 35 – Q13: Vain Worship
- Question: Will God accept the homage of such as deliberately teach contrary to His will?
- Key Text: Matthew 15:9 – “But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”

## Slide 36 – Q13: Traditions of Men
- **Vain Worship:**
  - Worship based on human tradition rather than divine command is "vain" (empty/useless).
- **The Conflict:**
  - The Pharisees placed washing rituals above God's law.
  - Today, many place traditions (like Sunday observance) above God's commandments (the Sabbath).
- **Authority:**
  - True worship acknowledges God's supreme authority.
  - Placing man's word above God's is an act of rebellion.

## Slide 37 – Q14: Closing Ears to Truth
- Question: Can we close our ears to the truth, and remain innocent?
- Key Text: Proverbs 28:9 – “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.”

## Slide 38 – Q14: Rejection and Prayer
- **Willful Ignorance:**
  - God rejects the prayers of those who willfully despise His law.
  - The Law is a transcript of His character; to reject it is to reject Him.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the sanctuary, incense (prayer) was effective only when connected to the sacrifice.
  - Rejecting the covenant of obedience disconnects prayer from the spirit of true worship.
- **Faith vs. Presumption:**
  - To ask for favor while refusing to obey is presumption.
  - True faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).

## Slide 39 – Q15: Promise to the Obedient
- Question: What encouraging promise did our Saviour leave for those who should do the will of God?
- Key Text: John 7:17 – “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.”
- Key Text: Psalm 25:9 – “The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.”

## Slide 40 – Q15: The Condition of Knowledge
- **The Will to Obey:**
  - Understanding truth depends on the surrender of the will.
  - "If any man *wills to do* His will..."
- **Divine Guidance:**
  - God promises that if we honestly desire to obey Him at any cost, He will not leave us in darkness.
  - John 16:13 – “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth...”
- **Certainty:**
  - We need not depend on scholars; the Spirit guides the submissive heart.

## Slide 41 – Q15: Illustration
- **Tuning the Radio:**
  - To hear a clear signal, you must dial the radio precisely to the station.
  - If you refuse to turn the dial, you hear only static.
  - A willingness to obey is the "tuning" of the soul that receives Heaven's truth.

## Slide 42 – Q16: Fate of Blind Leaders
- Question: What will be the fate of the spiritually blind teacher, and of those whom he presumes to teach?
- Key Text: Matthew 15:14 – “Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”

## Slide 43 – Q16: Individual Responsibility
- **Shared Fate:**
  - If a leader is blind (teaching error) and the follower is blind (ignorant of the Word), **both** fall.
  - We are not excused because we "followed the pastor."
- **"Let Them Alone":**
  - When men are wedded to tradition and refuse light, we must sometimes leave them to their choice and seek those open to truth.

## Slide 44 – Q17: Entering the City
- Question: To whom will the gates of the heavenly city be opened?
- Key Text: Isaiah 26:2 – “Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.”
- Key Text: Revelation 22:14 – “Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.”

## Slide 45 – Q17: The Righteous Nation
- **Character and Truth:**
  - Entry is reserved for a "righteous nation."
  - This righteousness comes by the blood of Christ (Justification) and the work of the Spirit (Sanctification).
- **Keepers of the Truth:**
  - They do not just "know" the truth; they "keep" (obey/guard) it.
- **Conclusion:**
  - Doctrine is not an end in itself.
  - Its purpose is to prepare a cleansed, obedient people to live in the presence of a holy God.

## Slide 46 – Q17: Illustration
- **The Key and the Lock:**
  - A key must fit the lock perfectly to open the door.
  - If the key is bent or filed incorrectly (error), the door remains shut.
  - The "truth as it is in Jesus" is the key that fits the gates of Zion.
