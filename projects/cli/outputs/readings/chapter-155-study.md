### Q1. What constitutes backsliding, and how does God regard it?

**"Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove
thee; know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast
forsaken the Lord thy God, and that My fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God
of hosts." (Jeremiah 2:19)**

**Answer:**

To understand the gravity of this spiritual condition, we must first define the
term.

- **Definition:** **Backsliding** is a gradual or sudden turning away from a
  position of faith and obedience previously held. It represents a cooling of
  love for Christ and a return to the principles of the world.

In Jeremiah 2:19, the Lord reveals that backsliding is not merely a mistake; it
is an "evil thing and bitter" because it involves a breach of relationship—"thou
hast forsaken the Lord thy God." God does not view this lightly, for He knows
that the end result of sin is death (Romans 6:23). The text suggests two major
aspects of backsliding:

1.  **Loss of Reverence:** The root cause is identified: "My fear is not in
    thee." When the awe and reverence for God’s presence and His holy law fade
    from the heart, the life inevitably slides backward.
2.  **Inherent Consequence:** Sin carries its own punishment. "Thine own
    wickedness shall correct thee." When a man walks away from the Source of
    life, he walks into darkness and pain. God does not need to arbitrarily
    punish the backslider; the backslider punishes himself by separating from
    the only One who can give peace.

**[ILL] The Drifting Boat:** Imagine a rowboat fighting against a strong river
current. As long as the rower pulls on the oars (faith and active cooperation
with God), the boat moves forward or stays steady. But the moment the rower
stops, the boat does not merely stand still; it immediately begins to drift
backward downstream. The spiritual life is much the same; there is no neutral
ground. We are either advancing in the grace of Christ, or we are sliding back
toward the world.

### Q2. What is the tendency on the part of professed Christians?

**"And My people are bent to backsliding from Me." (Hosea 11:7)**

**Answer:**

The prophet Hosea uses the word "bent," which means "inclined" or "prone to."
This reveals a fundamental truth about human nature, even among God's covenant
people:

- **The Drag of the Flesh:** The carnal nature acts like gravity, constantly
  pulling the soul earthward. Without the counteracting power of the Holy
  Spirit, the natural tendency of the human heart is to drift away from God
  (Romans 8:7).
- **The Need for Constant Power:** Because we are "bent" toward backsliding, we
  cannot rely on a past experience, a past conversion, or yesterday’s faith. We
  need a present-tense connection with Christ.
- **The Warning:** This text warns against the danger of self-confidence. If we
  think we stand, we must take heed lest we fall (1 Corinthians 10:12).

**Righteousness by Faith:** This tendency proves that we can never be righteous
by our own power. If left to ourselves, we slide back. True righteousness is
found only by abiding in the Vine (John 15:4–5). Just as a bent branch must be
held straight by a brace, our crooked natures must be held in the righteousness
of Christ moment by moment.

### Q3. What is the reason of this tendency?

**"Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding?
They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. I hearkened and heard, but they
spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I
done? everyone turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle."
(Jeremiah 8:5, 6)**

**Answer:**

Jeremiah diagnoses the specific causes of "perpetual backsliding"—a state where
the soul remains in a fallen condition without recovery.

1.  **Holding Fast Deceit:** The backslider often lies to himself. He maintains
    the form of religion while denying the power thereof (2 Timothy 3:5). He
    convinces himself that "all is well" despite his disobedience.
2.  **Refusal to Repent:** The text says, "No man repented him of his
    wickedness, saying, What have I done?" True repentance involves stopping to
    examine one’s actions against the Law of God. When self-examination ceases,
    backsliding becomes permanent.
3.  **Headlong Presumption:** The sinner is compared to a "horse rushing into
    battle"—blindly charging forward without thinking of the danger. This
    represents a life lived on impulse and feeling rather than on principle and
    the Word of God.

**[ILL] The Broken Compass:** A hiker lost in the woods who refuses to look at
his compass because it contradicts his feelings will wander deeper into the
wilderness. The "deceit" is believing his intuition over the magnetic north. The
Bible is our compass; backsliding occurs when we "hold fast" to our own opinions
rather than the "Thus saith the Lord."

### Q4. How does the Lord regard the backslider?

**"Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt
treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord." (Jeremiah 3:20)**

**Answer:**

God uses the most intimate human relationship—marriage—to describe His covenant
with His people.

- **A Personal Betrayal:** Backsliding is not just breaking a rule; it is
  breaking a heart. It is spiritual adultery (James 4:4). God looks upon the
  backslider not merely as a criminal, but as a beloved spouse who has turned
  away to other lovers (the world, self, and sin).
- **The Depth of Love:** This metaphor reveals how deeply God loves us. He is
  the faithful Husband (Isaiah 54:5) who is grieved when His bride turns away.
  This should melt our hearts; we have not just violated a code, we have wounded
  the One who died for us.

---

### Q5. In order to have the favor of the Lord again, what must the backslider first do?

**"Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou has transgressed against the Lord
thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree,
and ye have not obeyed My voice, saith the Lord." (Jeremiah 3:13)**

**Answer:**

The first step back to God is **honesty**.

- **Acknowledgment:** "Only acknowledge thine iniquity." We cannot be healed
  until we admit we are sick. We cannot be forgiven until we admit we are
  guilty. This corresponds to the work of the Spirit, who comes to "reprove the
  world of sin" (John 16:8).
- **Confession:** In the earthly sanctuary service, the sinner had to lay his
  hand on the head of the sacrifice and confess his sin (Leviticus 4:29). There
  is no forgiveness without this specific acknowledgment that we have
  "transgressed against the Lord."
- **No Excuses:** God does not ask for explanations or justifications. He asks
  for a broken and contrite heart (Psalm 51:17).

**[ILL] The Doctor's Diagnosis:** If a patient has a deadly infection but
refuses to admit the symptoms, the doctor cannot prescribe the cure. The patient
might say, "It's just a scratch," while the poison spreads. Confession is simply
agreeing with God's diagnosis of our condition so that He can apply the remedy
of Christ's blood.

### Q6. What further work must be done to meet the requirements of God?

**"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let
him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for
He will abundantly pardon." (Isaiah 55:7)**

**Answer:**

While confession (acknowledgment) is the first step, **repentance** must follow.
Repentance is a change of mind that leads to a change of action.

1.  **Forsaking the Way:** It is not enough to say "I am sorry" while continuing
    in the same path of sin. True grace teaches us to deny ungodliness (Titus
    2:11–12). The "way"—the habits and lifestyle of sin—must be abandoned.
2.  **Forsaking the Thoughts:** Sin begins in the mind. Therefore, the
    "unrighteous man" must forsake his own reasoning and plans.
3.  **The Promise of Pardon:** When we return, God does not grudgingly forgive.
    He "abundantly pardons."
    - _Definition:_ **Justification:** This is the act where God declares the
      repentant sinner righteous. He removes the penalty of sin and imputes
      Christ's perfect record to the believer.

**Righteousness by Faith:** Notice that the sinner must _return_ to the Lord to
find this power. We cannot forsake our ways in our own strength. We come to
Christ _in order_ to be changed.

---

### Q7. Why is it necessary for the unrighteous to forsake their thoughts?

**"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith
the Lord." (Isaiah 55:8)**

**Answer:**

This verse highlights the vast gap between the fallen human mind and the divine
mind.

- **The Conflict:** The carnal mind is enmity against God (Romans 8:7). Human
  thoughts are naturally selfish, temporary, and flawed. God’s thoughts are
  eternal, selfless, and holy.
- **The Cure:** To stop backsliding, we must exchange our thoughts for God's
  thoughts. This happens through the study of the Word. As we "eat" the Word
  (Jeremiah 15:16), the mind of Christ is formed within us (Philippians 2:5).
- **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the Holy Place, the Table of Showbread represented
  the Word of God. The priest ate the bread, symbolizing the assimilation of
  God's truth. We must feed on His thoughts to replace our own.

---

### Q8. What is especially necessary to prevent backsliding?

**"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready,
but the flesh is weak." (Mark 14:38)**

**Answer:**

Jesus spoke these words in Gethsemane to disciples who were sleeping when they
should have been praying.

- **Watchfulness:** To "watch" means to be spiritually alert, like a sentry on a
  city wall. We must guard the avenues of the soul (the eyes and ears) against
  the entrance of evil.
- **Prayer:** Watching reveals the danger; prayer connects us to the Power that
  can defeat the danger.
- **The Weakness of the Flesh:** Even the converted "spirit" (the will that
  wants to do right) is housed in "flesh" (our fallen humanity) that is weak and
  easily overcome. Therefore, we cannot relax our vigilance for a moment.

**[ILL] The Campfire:** A campfire burns brightly as long as logs are added and
it is tended. If the camper falls asleep and neglects the fire, it naturally
dies down to cold ash. Prayer and watching are the tending of the spiritual
flame.

### Q9. What is necessary on the part of believers to show that they are not reprobates?

**"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know
ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be
reprobates? (2 Corinthians 13:5)**

**Answer:**

- **Definition:** A **Reprobate** is one who has failed the test, one who is
  rejected because they lack the genuine article of faith. In metallurgy,
  "reprobate silver" (Jeremiah 6:30) is dross that contains no precious metal.
- **The Test:** The test of Christianity is not: "Do I belong to the church?" or
  "Do I know the doctrines?" The test is: **"Is Jesus Christ in you?"**
- **The Indwelling Christ:** This is the central truth of the gospel—"Christ in
  you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27). If Christ is dwelling in the heart
  by faith, He will live out His life of obedience through us. Backsliding
  occurs when the inner presence of Christ is lost.
- **Self-Examination:** We are called to "prove" (test) ourselves. We must look
  at the fruits of our lives. Are they the fruits of the Spirit, or the works of
  the flesh?

---

### Q10. If one has the law of God in the heart, what will it do for him?

**"The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide." (Psalm
37:31)**

**Answer:**

Here is the secret of stability and the cure for backsliding.

- **The New Covenant:** The promise of the New Covenant is, "I will put my laws
  into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).
- **External vs. Internal:** If the Law is only on tables of stone or in a book,
  we may acknowledge it, but we will fail to keep it. But when the Law is **in
  the heart**—meaning, when the character of God is implanted in us by the Holy
  Spirit—obedience becomes natural and joyful.
- **The Result:** "None of his steps shall slide." The man with the law in his
  heart does not slip because his affections are in harmony with God's will. He
  delights to do God's will (Psalm 40:8).

**Righteousness by Faith:** This is not legalism. Legalism is trying to keep the
law to _get_ to heaven. Having the law in the heart is the result of Christ (the
Living Law) dwelling in us. It is the only way to stand upright in a slippery
world.

### Q11. In what particular does the Lord rebuke His people for their backslidings?

**"Even from the days of your fathers, ye are gone away from Mine ordinances,
and have not kept them. Return unto Me, and I will return unto you, saith the
Lord of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?" (Malachi 3:7)**

**Answer:**

- **Ordinances:** These are the statutes, decrees, and religious observances
  given by God to maintain the relationship with His people.
- **A Historical Pattern:** God notes that backsliding has been a long-standing
  issue ("from the days of your fathers").
- **Spiritual Blindness:** The people ask, "Wherein shall we return?" This
  indicates they were unaware of how far they had drifted. They thought they
  were fine. This is the Laodicean condition—"rich and increased with goods,"
  yet not knowing they are "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
  naked" (Revelation 3:17).

---

### Q12. When the people asked in what thing they should return to Him, what neglect did He point out?

**"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed
Thee? In tithes and offerings." (Malachi 3:8)**

**Answer:**

God points to a tangible, visible evidence of their backslidings: their
stewardship.

- **Robbery:** God considers the withholding of tithe (the holy tenth of income)
  and offerings as robbery. Why? Because "The earth is the Lord's" (Psalm 24:1).
  He gives us everything and asks for a portion back as an acknowledgment of His
  sovereignty.
- **The Heart Connection:** "For where your treasure is, there will your heart
  be also" (Matthew 6:21). When people stop returning tithe, it is a symptom
  that their hearts have grown cold and selfish. They have begun to trust in
  money rather than in God.
- **Sanctuary Support:** The tithe was designed to support the priesthood and
  the sanctuary service (Numbers 18:21). By withholding it, they were neglecting
  the very plan of salvation and the ministry of reconciliation.

---

### Q13. What remedy did the Lord propose, to rescue the people from their backslidings, and bring them where they could again have the blessings of Heaven?

**"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine
house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open
you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be
room enough to receive it." (Malachi 3:10)**

**Answer:**

The remedy is a return to practical obedience and faith.

- **The Challenge:** "Prove Me now." God invites us to test His faithfulness. He
  puts His character on the line.
- **The Action:** "Bring ye all the tithes." This requires faith. It requires
  the backslider to put God first, even when finances look tight. It is an act
  of breaking the idol of selfishness.
- **The Promise:** The blessing is not just financial; it is the opening of the
  "windows of heaven." This implies a pouring out of spiritual power and grace,
  similar to the Flood (where the windows of heaven were opened), but this time
  a flood of blessing.

**[ILL] The Pump:** In old hand-pumps for water wells, one often had to pour a
little water into the pump (priming it) before the water would flow from the
well. Faith is like that. We give God what is His—not to buy His favor, but to
align ourselves with the flow of His power.

### Q14. Why did some of the Lord's disciples leave Him?

**"And He said. Therefore said I unto you, That no man can come unto Me, except
it were given unto him of My Father. From that time many of His disciples went
back, and walked no more with Him." (John 6:65, 66)**

**Answer:**

This context (John 6) follows Jesus' teaching that men must "eat His flesh and
drink His blood."

1.  **Rejection of Spiritual Truth:** These disciples wanted a political Messiah
    to give them bread and power. When Jesus offered them spiritual life through
    sacrifice and union with Him, they were offended.
2.  **Unwillingness to submit:** Jesus emphasized that salvation is entirely of
    God ("given unto him of My Father"). The proud human heart dislikes total
    dependence on grace.
3.  **The Crisis point:** Backsliding often happens when truth is presented that
    cuts across our cherished ideas or selfish desires. When the cross is
    presented, many "walk no more with Him."

---

### Q15. Is there hope in the case of the backslider?

**"Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto Him, Take away all
iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips...
I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for Mine anger is turned
away from him." (Hosea 14:2–4)**

**Answer:**

Yes, there is abundant hope!

- **The Prescription:** God tells us exactly what to say. "Take away all
  iniquity." We don't just ask to escape the penalty; we ask to be delivered
  from the _sin itself_.
- **The Physician:** God says, "I will heal their backsliding." He treats
  backsliding as a disease that needs healing, not just a crime that needs
  punishment. He alone can cure the wandering heart.
- **Free Love:** "I will love them freely." We do not earn our return. We are
  accepted in the Beloved (Ephesians 1:6).

**Sanctuary Imagery:** "Render the calves of our lips" refers to the thank
offerings. Instead of animal sacrifices, we offer the sacrifice of praise and a
confessed life (Hebrews 13:15).

---

### Q16. Will there be special danger of backsliding in the last days?

**"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." (Matthew
24:12)**

**Answer:**

Jesus predicts the spiritual climate just before His return.

- **Iniquity Abounding:** The term "iniquity" means lawlessness. When the Law of
  God is set aside by society and even the religious world, the restraint
  against sin is removed.
- **Love Waxing Cold:** There is a direct link between the Law and Love. The Law
  is a transcript of God's love. When lawlessness prevails, true agape love
  chills and dies. Selfishness reigns.
- **The Danger:** The atmosphere of the world will be so charged with
  selfishness and sin that, like a chilling frost, it will threaten to freeze
  the spiritual life of even the elect.

---

### Q17. In view of this danger, what is everyone's duty?

**"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to
escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of
man." (Luke 21:36)**

**Answer:**

In the final crisis, our only safety lies in a specific posture of spirit.

1.  **Watch:** We must be aware of the signs of the times and the condition of
    our own souls. We must not be lulled to sleep by the world's entertainment
    or false security.
2.  **Pray Always:** This does not mean living on our knees, but maintaining an
    open channel of communication with Heaven. It is the "pray without ceasing"
    of 1 Thessalonians 5:17.
3.  **The Goal:** To "stand before the Son of man." In the judgment, who shall
    be able to stand? Only those who are clothed in the righteousness of Christ
    and who have been sanctified by His truth.

**Conclusion:** The backslider falls because he lets go of the hand of Christ.
The overcomer stands because he holds that hand tighter as the darkness deepens.
The remedy for backsliding is a daily, hourly reconsecration to God, bringing
our whole lives—thoughts, tithes, and time—to the foot of the Cross.

**[ILL] The Diver:** A deep-sea diver relies entirely on the air line connected
to the surface. If that line is twisted or cut, he dies. In the pressure of
these last days, prayer and faith are our air line to the Sanctuary above. We
must "pray always" to keep that line open.
