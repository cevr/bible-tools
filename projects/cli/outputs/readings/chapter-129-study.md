### Q1. What must we do, among other things, if we would love life, and see good days?

**“For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.” (1 Peter 3:10)**

**Answer:**
To enjoy the "good days" of peace in Christ and to walk in the path of life, the Scripture commands a strict guardianship over our speech. This instruction touches the very core of Christian character and happiness.

*   **Refraining from Evil:** This implies a conscious, Spirit-empowered restraint. To "refrain" means to hold back or curb. The natural heart is prone to criticism, gossip, and angry retorts. The believer, through the indwelling of Christ, must check these impulses before they cross the threshold of the lips (Psalm 141:3).
*   **No Guile:** Guile refers to deceit, cunning, or hypocrisy—saying one thing while meaning another. A Christian must be transparent and truthful. In the vision of the 144,000, who stand faultless before God, it is recorded, "And in their mouth was found no guile" (Revelation 14:5).
*   **The Source of Life:** We cannot love the spiritual life while harboring death in our tongues. If we desire the life of God, we must put away the language of the enemy.

[ILL] **The Bit and the Rudder:** The Apostle James compares the tongue to a small bit in a horse’s mouth or a small rudder on a large ship (James 3:3–5). Though small, it directs the entire course of the vessel. If the rudder is set toward "evil," the whole ship of life steers into storms. If the Holy Spirit controls the rudder, the life is steered into the harbor of "good days."

### Q2. What words has Paul left on record concerning corrupt communication, foolish talking and jesting?

**“Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.” (Ephesians 4:29)**
**“Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks.” (Ephesians 5:4)**

**Answer:**
The standard of Christian speech is purity, modeled after the conversation of heaven. Paul highlights three specific dangers that the believer must put away through the power of the Spirit:

1.  **Corrupt Communication:** The Greek word implies something rotten or putrid, like spoiled fruit. This includes vulgarity, gossip, and speech that degrades the listener. Such words grieve the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4:30).
2.  **Foolish Talking:** This refers to senseless, empty chatter that has no purpose and brings no glory to God. It distracts the mind from eternal realities.
3.  **Jesting:** While innocent cheerfulness is a blessing, "jesting" here refers to coarse humor, sexual innuendo, or making light of sacred things. This is "not convenient" (not fitting) for a saint.

**The Remedy—Sanctification of the Lips:**
Instead of these, our mouths should be filled with "giving of thanks" and words that minister grace to the hearers (Ephesians 4:29). **Sanctification** (the process by which the Holy Spirit makes us holy in character) includes the cleansing of our vocabulary. When the heart is filled with gratitude for what Christ has done, there is no room for corrupt speech.

[ILL] **The Filtered Stream:** Imagine a stream flowing from a mountain spring. If the source is pure, the water brings life to the valley. If a factory dumps poison into it, everything downstream dies. Our heart is the spring; our mouth is the stream. We cannot allow the "poison" of the world (jesting, corruption) to mix with the water of life we are called to share.

### Q3. What did the Saviour say about idle words?

**“But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.” (Matthew 12:36)**

**Answer:**
This is one of the most solemn warnings given by our Lord regarding the **Investigative Judgment** (the review of human lives in the heavenly sanctuary before Christ returns).

*   **The Definition of "Idle":** An idle word is a useless word—one that accomplishes no good, offers no encouragement, and bears no fruit. It is workless speech.
*   **The Record Books:** Christ teaches that our words are recorded. In the judgment, God looks not only at major crimes but at the wasted opportunities of our speech.
*   **The Need for Atonement:** This verse drives us to the foot of the cross. Who among us has not spoken idle words? This reveals our desperate need for **Justification** (God's declaration that we are righteous solely because of Christ's merits). We need Christ’s blood to blot out the record of our idle words and His Spirit to fill our mouths with purposeful words today.

[ILL] **The Tape Recorder:** If a recording device were hung around your neck, capturing every syllable you spoke for a week, would you be comfortable playing it back for a room full of people? In the judgment, the universe listens. Only the blood of Jesus can wash that tape clean.

### Q4. From what does he who keeps his mouth and tongue, keep his soul?

**“Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from troubles.” (Proverbs 21:23)**

**Answer:**
Self-control in speech is a preservative against sorrow.

*   **Prevention of Trouble:** A vast amount of human suffering—broken friendships, church divisions, domestic strife—stems from hasty, unguarded words. By "keeping" (guarding) the tongue, we spare our souls from the guilt and anxiety that follow rash speech.
*   **A Fruit of the Spirit:** This guarding is not merely human willpower; it is the fruit of "temperance" or self-control (Galatians 5:23). When we abide in Christ, He stands as a sentinel at the door of our lips.

### Q5. How is he who holds his peace, under certain circumstances, regarded by people of good sense?

**“Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.” (Proverbs 17:28)**

**Answer:**
Silence is often a greater evidence of wisdom than speech.

*   **The Wisdom of Restraint:** To speak requires knowledge; to listen requires wisdom. When one remains silent, they avoid exposing their own ignorance or folly.
*   **Christ’s Example:** When Jesus was accused falsely by the chief priests and elders, "he answered nothing" (Matthew 27:12). His silence was powerful. It testified to a character perfectly at rest in the Father’s will.
*   **Practical Application:** When provoked, or when we do not know all the facts, the most Christ-like action is often to close the lips.

### Q6. What influence have kind words and a wholesome tongue upon others?

**“A soft answer turneth away wrath.” (Proverbs 15:1)**
**“A wholesome tongue is a tree of life.” (Proverbs 15:4)**

**Answer:**
The tongue, sanctified by grace, becomes a minister of healing.

*   **The Soft Answer:** When met with anger, the natural reaction is to fight back. But the "soft answer" breaks the power of wrath. It takes two to make a quarrel; if one party responds with the meekness of Christ, the fire of contention dies for lack of fuel.
*   **Tree of Life:** This imagery points back to Eden and forward to the New Earth (Revelation 22:2). A wholesome tongue feeds the weary, heals the brokenhearted, and gives life to those spiritually dying. It is a channel for **Imparted Righteousness**—Christ’s love flowing through us to others.

[ILL] **Oil on Water:** When waters are turbulent and rough, sailors used to pour oil on the waves to calm them. A soft answer is like oil on the turbulent waters of an argument; it smoothes the surface and brings peace.

### Q7. What is the effect of grievous words?

**“Grievous words stir up anger.” (Proverbs 15:1)**
**“There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword.” (Proverbs 12:18)**

**Answer:**
In contrast to the wholesome tongue, the unsanctified tongue is a weapon of destruction.

*   **Stirring up Anger:** Harsh, critical, or demanding words act as an accelerant to conflict. They appeal to the worst passions in others.
*   **Piercings of a Sword:** Words can inflict invisible wounds that take years to heal. Sarcasm, sharp criticism, and belittling remarks stab the spirit.
*   **The Heart Condition:** A tongue that "pierces" reveals a heart that is not yet softened by the grace of Jesus. We cannot claim to love God while stabbing our brother with our words (1 John 4:20).

### Q8. Contrast the abiding future of the truthful, with the brief continuance of such as speak falsely?

**“The lip of truth shall be established forever; but a lying tongue is but for a moment.” (Proverbs 12:19)**

**Answer:**
Truth is an attribute of God and is therefore eternal; falsehood is an invention of Satan and is temporary.

*   **Established Forever:** Truth can stand the test of time and investigation. Those who speak truth are building on the Rock.
*   **Lying is Temporary:** A lie may succeed for a moment, but it requires more lies to sustain it, and eventually, it collapses. In the final judgment, all lies will be exposed.
*   **The Final Outcome:** The Bible warns that "all liars" shall have their part in the second death (Revelation 21:8). To speak truth is to align oneself with the eternal kingdom of God.

### Q9. Are words a sure index of the heart?

**“For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” (Matthew 12:34)**

**Answer:**
This is the central principle of **Righteousness by Faith**. Behavior modification alone (trying to fix the words) is insufficient because the mouth is merely the overflow valve of the heart.

*   **The Index:** Just as a thermometer reveals the temperature, words reveal the condition of the soul. If the words are bitter, the heart is bitter. If the words are worldly, the heart is worldly.
*   **The Remedy:** We cannot sweeten the water by painting the pump. We must go to the source. We need the "new heart" promised in the New Covenant (Ezekiel 36:26). When Christ dwells in the heart by faith, the words will naturally become Christ-like.
*   **Conversion:** A change in speech is often the first visible sign of a genuine conversion.

[ILL] **The Bucket in the Well:** If you drop a bucket into a well, what comes up is exactly what is down there. You cannot bring up fresh water from a salt-water well. When life "bumps" us, what spills out? If Christ is in the heart, grace spills out.

### Q10. What is said of the man who offends not in word?

**“If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.” (James 3:2)**

**Answer:**
James presents the control of the tongue as the highest test of spiritual maturity.

*   **A Perfect Man:** In Scripture, "perfection" often refers to maturity or completeness in Christian character. It does not mean we never make a mistake, but that the heart is fully surrendered and the life is under the Spirit's control.
*   **The Master Key:** The tongue is the hardest member to tame (James 3:8). James argues from the greater to the lesser: if a man has obtained victory over his tongue through the Holy Spirit, he has the spiritual strength to "bridle" (control) every other passion and appetite of the body.
*   **Victory is Possible:** This verse is a promise. It implies that by God’s grace, it *is* possible to reach a stage where we do not "offend" (stumble) in word.

### Q11. What is said of the professed Christian whose language is unbecoming?

**“If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, ... this man's religion is vain.” (James 1:26)**

**Answer:**
A profession of faith without a transformation of speech is a deception.

*   **Vain Religion:** The word "vain" means empty, useless, or profitless. A person may keep the Sabbath, pay tithe, and attend church ("seem to be religious"), but if they are slanderous, angry, or deceitful in speech, their religion has not saved them from their sins.
*   **The Bridle:** Just as a horse needs a bridle to be useful, our nature needs the restraint of the Holy Spirit. Without it, our "religion" is merely a form of godliness without the power (2 Timothy 3:5).

---

### Q12. Will our words have weight in the judgment?

**“For by thy words thou shalt be condemned, and by thy words thou shalt be justified.” (Matthew 12:37)**

**Answer:**
Yes, words are decisive evidence in the judgment.

*   **Evidence of Faith:** We are not saved *by* our words (we are saved by grace through faith, Ephesians 2:8), but our words testify whether our faith was genuine. A living faith produces a sanctified tongue.
*   **Justification and Condemnation:** In the judgment, our words serve as the external proof of our internal state. They show whether we were truly united with Christ (whose words are life) or remained in rebellion.
*   **The Heavenly Record:** This truth underscores the reality of the sanctuary in heaven, where our lives are reviewed. It calls us to repentance for every careless word and to a deep dependence on Christ's intercession.

### Q13. By these forcible scriptures, what startling truth is established?

**“Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” (Proverbs 18:21)**

**Answer:**
The tongue is not a neutral instrument; it is a tool of immense power for good or evil.

*   **Power of Death:** Words can kill a reputation, kill enthusiasm, kill hope, and even lead to physical violence. The "accuser of the brethren" (Revelation 12:10) uses human tongues to do his work.
*   **Power of Life:** Words can point a sinner to the Savior, bring comfort to the mourning, and speak peace to the storm.
*   **The Choice:** Every time we speak, we choose which power to unleash. Deuteronomy 30:19 says, "I have set before you life and death... therefore choose life."

### Q14. What should be the constant prayer of each heart?

**“Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.” (Psalm 19:14)**

**Answer:**
Recognizing our inability to tame our own tongues, this must be our daily petition.

*   **Harmony of Inner and Outer:** The prayer asks that *both* the outward words and the inward thoughts be acceptable. It acknowledges that God sees the heart.
*   **Acceptable to God:** The standard is not what is acceptable to society, but what is acceptable in "Thy sight." This is living Coram Deo—before the face of God.
*   **Strength and Redeemer:**
    *   **Redeemer:** We claim His blood to forgive our past sinful speech (Justification).
    *   **Strength:** We claim His power to keep us from sinning in the future (Sanctification).
    *   This prayer is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**—depending entirely on the Lord to produce in us that which is pleasing to Him.

[ILL] **The Watchman:** In ancient cities, a watchman stood at the gate to inspect everyone entering or leaving. We should install a "watchman" of prayer at the gate of our lips, asking God to approve every word before it is allowed to pass.
