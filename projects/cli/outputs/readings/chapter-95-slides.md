## Slide 1 – Q1: Vain Worship
- **Question:** Speaking of those who substitute a man made commandment for one of God's commandments, what kind of worship does Christ say they render?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:9 – “But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **The Definition of "Vain":**
  - Means empty, fruitless, or without effect.
  - Worship is not just outward praise; it is obedience and submission to God's will.
  - Worship that rejects God's explicit law in favor of tradition is not accepted by Heaven.
- **The Conflict of Authority:**
  - The Great Controversy is a battle over authority.
  - God’s law is the transcript of His character.
  - Setting aside God's law for human tradition places human wisdom above divine wisdom.
- **Doctrine vs. Commandments:**
  - True doctrine must be based on "Thus saith the Lord."
  - We must not elevate church decrees or customs to the status of binding doctrine.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Soldier and the General:**
  - Imagine a soldier who sings songs about his general and polishes his uniform.
  - However, when the general issues a specific battle order, the soldier ignores it to follow a private's order instead.
  - Is the salute genuine? No.
  - **Lesson:** We cannot honor God while willfully ignoring His commands. Disobedience proves the worship is empty.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Fifth Commandment
- **Question:** Concerning what commandment did Christ reprove the Pharisees on that occasion?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:4-6 – “For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother; ...but ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; and honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points
- **The "Corban" Tradition:**
  - Pharisees allowed men to declare property a "gift" (Corban) dedicated to God.
  - This excuse allowed them to deny financial help to aging parents, claiming the money was "holy."
  - Often, they kept the money for their own use, cloaking selfishness in religion.
- **The Principle of Evasion:**
  - They kept the *letter* of their own traditions while violating the *spirit* of God's law.
  - Religion became a method of avoiding duty rather than fulfilling it.
- **Modern Application:**
  - Many today say, "I dedicate every day to the Lord," using a pious phrase to excuse themselves from the specific obligation of the seventh-day Sabbath.

## Slide 6 – Q3: Making the Law Void
- **Question:** What was the result of their course?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:6 – “Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points
- **"None Effect":**
  - Tradition strips the law of its binding power.
  - Teaching that human custom supersedes the Bible implies God does not mean what He says.
- **The Danger of Tradition:**
  - Tradition becomes destructive when it opposes "Thus saith the Lord."
  - Example: Sunday keeping (a tradition) has displaced the biblical Sabbath for the majority of Christians.
- **Law and Gospel:**
  - If the law is voided, the Gospel is weakened.
  - The law points out sin (Romans 3:20); the Gospel provides the remedy.
  - We need the law to see our need for Christ’s transforming grace.

## Slide 8 – Q4: Offending the Leaders
- **Question:** What question did the disciples soon afterward ask Christ concerning what He had said?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:12 – “Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?”

## Slide 9 – Q4: Key Points
- **The Offense of Truth:**
  - The Pharisees were the religious "authorities" of the day.
  - Jesus offended their pride by bypassing their authority to appeal directly to the Ten Commandments.
- **Human Fear:**
  - The disciples feared "rocking the boat."
  - **Lesson:** Truth cannot be compromised for the sake of peace or to avoid offending those in error (Luke 12:51).

## Slide 10 – Q5: The Divine Decree
- **Question:** What answer did the Saviour make?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:13 – “But He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.”

## Slide 11 – Q5: Key Points
- **God's Planting:**
  - Institutions ordained by God: The Sabbath (Creation), Marriage (Creation), The Lord's Supper.
- **Man's Planting:**
  - Doctrines originating in the human mind, regardless of popularity or age.
  - If the Father did not plant it, it has no authority.
- **The Judgment:**
  - "Shall be rooted up" refers to the final harvest.
  - Only that which is built on the Rock of Scripture (Matthew 7:24-27) will stand.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Farmer and the Weeds:**
  - A farmer sees wheat he planted, but also large, impressive weeds he did not plant.
  - At the harvest, he does not spare the weed because it is tall or old.
  - He pulls it up because it is not wheat.
  - **Lesson:** Sunday sacredness is a "weed"—it is not found in the planting of the Lord and will be rooted up.

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Sabbath's Origin
- **Question:** Where and by whom was the Sabbath of the fourth commandment planted?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:11 – “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points
- **The Author:**
  - Planted by "The Lord" (Jehovah/Jesus) at Creation (John 1:1-3).
- **The Time:**
  - Established in Eden before sin and before the Jewish nation existed.
  - It is a gift to all humanity (Mark 2:27).
- **Three Divine Acts:**
  - **Rested:** God set the example.
  - **Blessed:** Filled it with spiritual life.
  - **Hallowed:** Set it apart for holy use.
  - No human can "un-hallow" what God has hallowed.

## Slide 15 – Q7: The Sunday Institution
- **Question:** Who claims to have planted the Sunday institution?
- **Key Text:** *Catholic Christian Instructed*, p. 204 – “Question - Has the church power to make any alterations in the commandments of God? Answer - Instead of the seventh day, and other festivals appointed by the old law, the church has prescribed the Sundays... and these we are now obliged to keep in consequence of God's commandment, instead of the ancient Sabbath.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points
- **The Claim of Power:**
  - The Papacy openly claims authority to change biblical laws.
  - Fulfillment of Daniel 7:25 (The power that would "think to change times and laws").
- **The Protestant Dilemma:**
  - Protestants claim *Sola Scriptura* (Bible Only).
  - Yet, by keeping Sunday, they obey a commandment of the Church, not the Bible.
- **The Choice:**
  - Do we follow the "plant" of the Father (Sabbath) or the "plant" of the Church (Sunday)?

## Slide 17 – Q8: Salvation Revealed
- **Question:** When is salvation to be brought to the people of God?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:5 – “Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Key Points
- **Salvation in the Last Time:**
  - Refers to final deliverance and the restoration of the earth at the Second Coming.
- **Kept by Power (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - We are "kept" (guarded) by God's power through faith.
  - We cannot keep ourselves from falling; we rely on His sustaining power.
  - The same power that holds the universe sustains the believer in obedience.

## Slide 19 – Q9: Sabbath Reform
- **Question:** When God's salvation is near to come, and the advent doctrine is being preached, for what will God pronounce a blessing on the people?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 56:1, 2 – “My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this... that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.”

## Slide 20 – Q9: Key Points
- **Context:**
  - Applies to the generation waiting for "salvation near to come" (Last Days).
- **Polluting the Sabbath:**
  - To treat the holy as common.
  - God calls for a restoration of the Sabbath to its rightful place.
- **Faith and Works:**
  - We lay hold of the covenant by faith.
  - The *fruit* of that faith is keeping the Sabbath and abstaining from evil.
  - Real faith always produces obedience (James 2:17).

## Slide 21 – Q10: The Stranger
- **Question:** Is this promise to be confined to the Jews at that time?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 56:6, 7 – “Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord... everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even them will I bring to My holy mountain...”

## Slide 22 – Q10: Key Points
- **Universal Sabbath:**
  - The "stranger" refers to Gentiles.
  - Under the New Covenant, all who join Christ are spiritual Israel (Galatians 3:29).
- **"Join Themselves":**
  - Implies a personal relationship, not just legal duty.
  - The Sabbath is a sign of loyalty for those who love the Lord.
- **The Covenant:**
  - God writes His law (including the Sabbath) in the heart of the believer (Hebrews 8:10).

## Slide 23 – Q11: A Better Name
- **Question:** What other promise has He given to the Gentiles who will then keep the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 56:5 – “Even unto them will I give in Mine house and within My walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.”

## Slide 24 – Q11: Key Points
- **Better than Sons and Daughters:**
  - Earthly lineages may end, but God’s family is eternal.
- **Assurance:**
  - A message of hope for those rejected by earthly families for accepting truth.
  - God promises a permanent home and an everlasting name.

## Slide 25 – Q12: The Call to Cry Aloud
- **Question:** What does God call upon His ministers to say to His professed people at this time?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:1 – “Cry aloud, and spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.”

## Slide 26 – Q12: Key Points
- **A Warning Message:**
  - Similar to the Third Angel's Message (Revelation 14).
  - It is not to be whispered; it must be heard.
- **"My People":**
  - Addressed to the church ("House of Jacob"), not the world.
  - Religious people need to see where they have drifted from God's law.
- **Purpose of Reproof:**
  - To heal, not condemn.
  - Identifying sin allows the patient to seek the Cure (Christ).

## Slide 27 – Q13: True Sabbath Keeping
- **Question:** After speaking of their lack of devotion in certain directions... what other wrong does He point out and offer a remedy for?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:13 – “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable...”

## Slide 28 – Q13: Key Points
- **"Turn Away Thy Foot":**
  - Stop trampling the Sabbath; stop treating it with indifference.
- **Not "Doing Thy Pleasure":**
  - Lay aside secular business, amusements, and worldly conversation.
- **A Delight (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - The legalist sees the Sabbath as a burden.
  - The believer who loves Christ calls it a "delight" because it is a day of communion with the Beloved.

## Slide 29 – Q14: The Promise
- **Question:** To those who will have courage to heed the appeal here given, what does the Lord promise?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:14 – “Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father...”

## Slide 30 – Q14: Key Points
- **Delight in the Lord:**
  - When we cease seeking our own pleasure, we find higher pleasure in God.
- **Ride on High Places:**
  - A symbol of victory and overcoming power.
  - Conquering selfishness in Sabbath-keeping leads to victory in other areas.
- **Heritage of Jacob:**
  - The inheritance of the New Earth.

## Slide 31 – Q15: Repairing the Breach
- **Question:** And what will those be called who turn from their transgressions?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:12 – “And thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, the restorer of paths to dwell in.”

## Slide 32 – Q15: Key Points
- **The Breach:**
  - A hole in the protective wall of God's Law.
  - Made by the "Little Horn" power changing the Sabbath (Daniel 7:25).
- **The Repairers:**
  - God raises a people in the last days (Revelation 14:12) to restore the Law.
- **Restorer of Paths:**
  - Leading people back to the "old paths" established in Eden.

## Slide 33 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Breach in the Dike:**
  - Imagine a city protected by a dike holding back the ocean.
  - If a hole (breach) appears, the city is in danger.
  - The "repairers" are those who rush to fill the gap with sandbags.
  - **Lesson:** The world is flooded with lawlessness; Sabbath-keepers stand in the gap, upholding God's standard.

## Slide 34 – Q16: Failure of Leadership
- **Question:** What does another prophet say that God's professed teachers will do?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 22:26 – “Her priests have violated My law, and have profaned Mine holy things; they have put no difference between the holy and profane... and have hid their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.”

## Slide 35 – Q16: Key Points
- **Hiding the Eyes:**
  - Willful ignorance of the biblical evidence for the Sabbath.
- **No Difference:**
  - Teaching that "every day is the same" erases the distinction God created between the common and the holy.
- **Profaning God:**
  - To ignore God's law is to dishonor God Himself.

## Slide 36 – Q17: Untempered Mortar
- **Question:** What does He say they have done to maintain their theories?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 22:28 – “And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord God, when the Lord hath not spoken.”

## Slide 37 – Q17: Key Points
- **Untempered Mortar:**
  - Cheap plaster/whitewash that looks good but has no strength to hold stones together.
- **The Application:**
  - Ministers use weak arguments (e.g., "redemption is greater than creation") to support Sunday.
  - They claim "Thus saith the Lord" for Sunday when "the Lord hath not spoken."

## Slide 38 – Q18: The Wall Falls
- **Question:** What does the Lord say will become of this wall thus daubed with untempered mortar?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 13:11 – “Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall; there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend.”

## Slide 39 – Q18: Key Points
- **The Collapse:**
  - Any religion not based on Scripture will eventually crumble.
  - The structure of Sunday sacredness, built on tradition, will not stand the test of the last days.

## Slide 40 – Q19: The Time of Hail
- **Question:** When are these hailstones to fall?
- **Key Text:** Job 38:22, 23 – “Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?”

## Slide 41 – Q19: Key Points
- **Literal Judgments:**
  - The "overflowing shower" refers to literal events at the end of time.
- **Reserved:**
  - God is holding back these judgments until the work of the Gospel is finished.
  - Linked to the "Time of Trouble" (Daniel 12:1).

## Slide 42 – Q20: The Seventh Plague
- **Question:** Under which of the seven last plagues will this battle take place?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:17-21 – “And the seventh angel poured our his vial into the air... and the cities of the nations fell... And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent.”

## Slide 43 – Q20: Key Points
- **The Seventh Plague:**
  - The literal fulfillment of Ezekiel's prophecy.
- **The Collapse:**
  - "Cities of the nations fell" includes the spiritual collapse of Babylon.
- **The Hail:**
  - The physical storm mirrors the spiritual reality: false doctrine (the wall) is destroyed by the reality of God's judgment.

## Slide 44 – Q21: The Hedge
- **Question:** In order to prepare His people for that terrible time, what does God expect His ministers to do?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 13:5 – “Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord.”

## Slide 45 – Q21: Key Points
- **Making up the Hedge:**
  - Teaching the full counsel of God, including the Ten Commandments.
  - The Law is the hedge that protects us from sin.
- **To Stand:**
  - "Who shall be able to stand?" (Revelation 6:17).
  - Only those covered by Christ's righteousness *and* sanctified to walk in obedience will be protected.
  - Teaching that "the law is abolished" leaves people defenseless.

## Slide 46 – Q22: False Hope
- **Question:** Instead of their trying to close the breach made in God's law... what will they do?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 13:6 – “They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying The Lord saith: and the Lord hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.”

## Slide 47 – Q22: Key Points
- **Lying Divination:**
  - Preaching "peace and safety" when there is no peace.
- **False Hope:**
  - Encouraging people to hope that God will accept partial obedience or tradition.
  - A dangerous deception that leaves the soul unprepared.

## Slide 48 – Q23: The Third Angel
- **Question:** During these closing scenes, what message will God send forth to call attention to His commandments?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:9, 12 – “If any man worship the beast... the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 49 – Q23: Key Points
- **The Warning:**
  - Warns against the Beast (Papacy), Image, and Mark (Sunday).
- **The Saints (Verse 12):**
  - **Keep the Commandments:** Including the Sabbath.
  - **Have the Faith of Jesus:** Not just faith *in* Jesus, but the quality of faith He possessed—total trust and obedience.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - They do not keep the law *to be* saved.
  - They keep it because they *are* saved and possess the "faith of Jesus" which works by love.

## Slide 50 – Q24: The Dragon's War
- **Question:** How are those of the remnant church treated?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 51 – Q24: Key Points
- **The Remnant:**
  - The final believers at the end of time.
- **The War:**
  - Satan hates them because their obedience rebukes his lawlessness.
  - By keeping the Commandments through Christ's power, they prove God's law can be kept.

## Slide 52 – Q25: The New Earth Sabbath
- **Question:** And when the earth is made new, and God's people are saved therein, how often will they all come to worship Him?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 66:23 – “And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord.”

## Slide 53 – Q25: Key Points
- **Eternal Institution:**
  - Kept in Eden (Creation).
  - Kept by the Remnant (History).
  - Kept in the New Earth (Eternity).
- **Universal Worship:**
  - "All flesh" will worship on God's holy day.

## Slide 54 – Q26: The Tree of Life
- **Question:** Will the tree of life also be restored to the saints?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 22:14 – “Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.”

## Slide 55 – Q26: Key Points
- **The Final Beatitude:** "Blessed are they..."
- **Obedience & Salvation:**
  - We are not saved *by* commandments (Legalism).
  - But the *fruit* of salvation is a life in harmony with God's law (Sanctification).
- **Two Requirements:**
  - **Title to Heaven:** Provided by Christ's blood (Justification).
  - **Fitness for Heaven:** Provided by the Spirit writing the law in the heart (Sanctification).

## Slide 56 – Q26: Illustration
- **Passport and Vaccine:**
  - A **passport** gives you the legal right to enter a country.
  - A **health certificate** shows you are fit to enter without endangering others.
  - **Application:**
    - Christ’s blood is our passport (Right to the Tree).
    - His Spirit producing obedience is our fitness (Entering the City).
    - We need both to enter the Kingdom.
