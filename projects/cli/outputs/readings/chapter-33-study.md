### Q1. Where, in the Bible, is given the first promise of the Saviour from sin?

**“And the Lord said unto the serpent,... I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
shalt bruise his heel." Genesis 3:14, 15.**

**Answer:** This verse is known as the _Protoevangelium_, or the "First Gospel."
Before our first parents were expelled from Eden, God gave them a promise that
kept them from despair.

1.  **The Gift of Enmity:** The text says God will "put enmity" (hatred or
    hostility) between the serpent (Satan) and the woman (the church). By
    nature, fallen man is at peace with Satan and at war with God (Romans 8:7).
    If God did not intervene, we would be eternal captives of the devil, fully
    content in our chains. This "enmity" against sin is a supernatural gift of
    grace. It is the first work of the Holy Spirit in the heart to make sin
    repulsive to us.
2.  **The Two Seeds:** This outlines the Great Controversy. There is the "seed
    of the serpent" (those who cling to sin) and the "Seed of the woman" (Christ
    and His people).
3.  **The Crushed Head:** This prophecies the complete destruction of Satan and
    sin. While Satan would "bruise the heel" of Christ (causing His suffering
    and death at the cross), that very act would be the means by which Christ
    crushes the serpent's head, destroying the power of death (Hebrews 2:14).

**[ILL]** Imagine a person bitten by a venomous snake, drifting into a deadly
sleep. They have no power to resist the poison. A physician arrives not only to
give the antidote but to wake the patient up and give them a hatred for the
snake that bit them. Without God "putting enmity" in our hearts, we would sleep
the sleep of death. This enmity is the beginning of our fight for holiness.

### Q2. Through whose descendant was the promised restoration to come through?

**“To thee [Abraham] will I give it, and to thy seed for ever." Genesis 13:15.**

**Answer:** God narrowed the line of the Messiah through Abraham. This promise
is part of the _Abrahamic Covenant_.

- **Covenant:** A solemn agreement or promise. In this case, God promised
  Abraham land and a Seed (descendant) through whom all nations would be
  blessed.
- **Restoration:** The promise was not just for earthly territory (Canaan), but
  for the restoration of the earth and the reversal of the curse of sin. Abraham
  looked for "a city... whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Abraham is the father of the faithful. He believed
  God's promise, and it was "counted unto him for righteousness" (Genesis 15:6).
  We participate in this restoration not by our lineage, but by having the faith
  of Abraham.

---

### Q3. Who was this promised seed?

**“He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which
is Christ." Galatians 3:16.**

**Answer:** The Apostle Paul clarifies that the ultimate fulfillment of the
covenant was not the Jewish nation as a whole, but one specific Person: Jesus
Christ.

1.  **Christ the Center:** All the promises of God find their "Yes" and "Amen"
    in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20). He is the true Heir of the world.
2.  **Our Connection:** We become heirs only by being connected to Him. "And if
    ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
    promise" (Galatians 3:29).
3.  **Union with Christ:** We cannot claim the promises of victory or eternal
    life apart from a vital, living connection with Jesus. It is His life in us
    that constitutes us as the "seed."

### Q4. What town was predicted to be the birthplace of the Christ?

**“And,.. he [Herod] demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said
unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea." Matthew 2:4-6. (See Micah 5:2.)**

**Answer:** Seven hundred years before His birth, the prophet Micah pinpointed
Bethlehem Ephratah as the place of the Messiah’s entry.

- **Bread of Life:** _Bethlehem_ means "House of Bread." It was fitting that
  Jesus, the "Bread of Life" which came down from heaven (John 6:35), should be
  born there.
- **Humility:** Bethlehem was "little among the thousands of Judah" (Micah 5:2).
  God often bypasses the centers of human power, pride, and prestige (like
  Jerusalem or Rome) to reveal His glory in humility. The King of Kings was born
  not in a palace, but in a stable, showing that true greatness is found in
  self-sacrificing love, not outward display.

---

### Q5. Of whom was Christ to be born?

**“Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
Immanuel." Isaiah 7:14.**

**Answer:** This verse predicts the _Incarnation_—the miracle of God becoming
man.

- **Incarnation:** The act of the Son of God taking on human flesh and nature
  (John 1:14).
- **The Virgin Birth:** This was necessary because Christ was not a new human
  personality created at conception, but the eternal Son of God entering
  humanity. He is the "Second Adam" (1 Corinthians 15:45, 47).
- **Immanuel:** This name means "God with us."
  - He is with us in our nature (Hebrews 2:14).
  - He is with us in our temptations (Hebrews 4:15).
  - He is with us to empower us to obey.
  - God did not send a subordinate; He came Himself to bridge the gulf sin had
    made.

**[ILL]** If a man stands on a high cliff and sees a friend drowning in the
raging sea below, shouting instructions is useless. He must dive into the
water—into the very element that is drowning his friend—to save him. Christ dove
into humanity to rescue us from the ocean of sin.

### Q6. What name was Joseph told to give the promised Son when He was born?

**“And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He
shall save His people from their sins." Matthew 1:21.**

**Answer:** The name _Jesus_ (Yeshua) means "Jehovah is Salvation." This verse
contains the very heart of the Adventist understanding of Righteousness by
Faith.

1.  **Saved FROM Sin:** Note clearly that He saves His people _from_ their sins,
    not _in_ their sins.
    - Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4).
    - To be saved _in_ sin would mean to be saved while still rebelling against
      God, which is impossible.
2.  **Justification and Sanctification:**
    - He saves us from the _penalty_ of sin (guilt) through His death
      (Justification).
    - He saves us from the _power_ of sin (dominion) through His indwelling life
      (Sanctification).
    - He will eventually save us from the _presence_ of sin at His coming
      (Glorification).
3.  **The Guarantee:** This constitutes a promise. If we submit to Him, He
    _shall_ save us. We do not have to overcome sin to come to Jesus; we come to
    Jesus to be delivered from sin.

**[ILL]** A doctor does not tell a leper, "I will declare you healthy, but leave
the leprosy rotting your flesh." A true savior cures the disease. Jesus does not
merely cover our sin with a legal fiction; He provides the remedy that heals the
heart and restores obedience.

### Q7. At His birth, what message did the angel bring to the shepherds abiding in the field?

**“And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings
of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the
city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord." Luke 2:10, 11.**

**Answer:** The message was "good tidings," or in the original Greek,
_evangelion_—the **Gospel**.

- **To All People:** The gospel is universal. It is not limited to a select few,
  but is open to "whosoever will" (Revelation 22:17).
- **Christ the Lord:** The babe was "Christ" (the Anointed One/Messiah) and
  "Lord" (Divine Ruler).
- **Sanctuary Connection:** These shepherds were likely watching the flocks
  destined for the temple sacrifices in Jerusalem. How fitting that the
  announcement came to them first: the Type (the sheep) met the Antitype (the
  Lamb of God) who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

---

### Q8. What was the song of praise that the host of angels sang that night?

**“And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good
will toward men." Verse 13, 14.**

**Answer:** The angels sang of the result of the plan of salvation.

1.  **Glory to God:** The plan of redemption vindicates God's character before
    the universe. Satan had accused God of being a tyrant; the cross proves God
    is love.
2.  **Peace on Earth:** Sin caused a separation between God and man. "Therefore
    being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
    Christ" (Romans 5:1).
3.  **Good Will:** God does not hate the sinner. He has "good will" toward us.
    He is "not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
    repentance" (2 Peter 3:9).

---

### Q9. What important prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled when Christ was born?

**“For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall
be upon His shoulder." Isaiah 9:6.**

**Answer:** Isaiah foresaw the dual nature of Christ: a "child born" (humanity)
and a "son given" (divinity, the gift of the Father).

- **The Government:** In the immediate sense, Christ rules the universe. But in
  the heart of the believer, this is a practical test of faith. Is the
  government of your life upon _His_ shoulder, or are you trying to carry it
  yourself?
- **Surrender:** To accept Christ is to resign the government of self. When He
  takes the burden of our lives, He carries the weight of our care, our guilt,
  and our future (Psalm 55:22). "My yoke is easy, and my burden is light"
  (Matthew 11:30).

---

### Q10. What descriptive names did Isaiah give to Him?

**“And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The
everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and
peace there shall be no end." Verses 6, 7.**

**Answer:** These titles reveal the all-sufficiency of our High Priest.

- **Wonderful:** He is beyond human comprehension; a mystery of godliness.
- **Counsellor:** He is our Advocate in the judgment. He has "the tongue of the
  learned" to speak a word to the weary (Isaiah 50:4). We need not depend on
  human wisdom when we have access to the Counsellor.
- **The Mighty God / Everlasting Father:** These titles prove the absolute Deity
  of Christ. He is one with the Father (John 10:30). Only One equal with the
  Lawgiver could redeem the transgressor of the Law.
- **Prince of Peace:** He is the only source of true peace for the troubled
  conscience.

### Q11. What did the godly Simeon say when he saw Jesus?

**“And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for Him after the
custom of the law, then took he Him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for
mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of
all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people
Israel." Luke 2:27-32.**

**Answer:** Simeon, led by the Spirit, recognized the Messiah in the form of a
helpless infant.

- **Salvation is a Person:** Simeon said, "Mine eyes have seen thy salvation."
  Salvation is not a theory or a list of rules; it is seeing and knowing Jesus.
- **Light to the Gentiles:** Simeon understood what the religious leaders had
  forgotten—that Israel was to be a light to the world, not a closed reservoir
  of blessing.
- **Custom of the Law:** Jesus was circumcised and presented in the temple. He
  was "made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law" (Galatians
  4:4-5). He met every requirement we failed to meet.

---

### Q12. Upon seeing Jesus, what were the words of the aged prophetess Anna?

**“And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake
of Him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem." Verse 38.**

**Answer:** Anna represents the faithful remnant who were watching and waiting.

- **Redemption:** This term means "to buy back" or "ransom." We had sold
  ourselves to sin; Christ came to pay the price.
  - _The Price:_ His own blood (1 Peter 1:18-19).
- **Evangelism:** Note that as soon as she saw Him, she "spake of Him to all."
  You cannot behold Christ and remain silent. A genuine experience with Jesus
  always leads to witnessing.

---

### Q13. What did the Wise Men from the East do when they had found Jesus?

**“When they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary His
mother, and fell down, and worshipped Him: and when they had opened their
treasures, they presented unto Him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh."
Matthew 2:11.**

**Answer:** While the Jewish priests were indifferent just a few miles away in
Jerusalem, Gentile philosophers traveled seeking the Truth.

1.  **Worship:** They fell down. Recognition of Christ's divinity humbles the
    heart.
2.  **The Gifts:**
    - **Gold:** A tribute to a King. It also represents faith and love "tried in
      the fire" (Revelation 3:18).
    - **Frankincense:** Used in the incense of the Sanctuary. It represents the
      fragrance of Christ’s righteousness and the prayers of the saints.
    - **Myrrh:** A bitter herb used for embalming. A prophetic indication that
      this King was born to die and suffer.
3.  **Giving:** True faith is not empty-handed. When we give our hearts to
    Christ, we also pledge our resources to His service.

### Q14. Why did Joseph flee to Egypt with Jesus and His mother?

**“And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to
Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and His mother, and
flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek
the young child to destroy Him." Verse 13.**

**Answer:** This event illustrates the intense conflict surrounding Christ from
His earliest days.

- **Divine Guidance:** God speaks to those who are listening. Joseph’s prompt
  obedience saved the child's life.
- **The Great Controversy:** Behind the jealousy of King Herod was the malice of
  Satan. The enemy knew that if this Child lived, his kingdom of darkness would
  end.
- **Out of Egypt:** This also fulfilled prophecy (Hosea 11:1), paralleling
  Israel’s exodus. Christ is the new Israel, succeeding where the nation failed.

---

### Q15. How does John the revelator describe this satanic urge to destroy Christ?

**“And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to
devour her child as soon as it was born." Revelation 12:4.**

**Answer:** This lifts the veil on the invisible spiritual war.

- **The Dragon:** Primarily represents Satan, but secondarily the earthly power
  used by Satan at that time—Pagan Rome (represented here by its puppet, Herod).
- **The Urge to Destroy:** Satan has always hated Christ. In the believer's
  life, the moment "Christ is formed in you" (Galatians 4:19), the dragon
  attempts to destroy that new spiritual life through temptation,
  discouragement, or persecution.

---

### Q16. By what means did Herod seek to kill Jesus?

**“Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding
wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in
all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under." Matthew 2:16.**

**Answer:** Herod employed a horrific slaughter of innocents to protect his
throne.

- **The Fruit of Self:** Herod represents the ultimate end of the "self"
  principle. When self is king, it will kill to maintain control.
- **The Contrast:** Herod killed others to save his earthly throne; Christ died
  Himself to save others for a heavenly throne. The world operates on the
  principle of force; Christ's kingdom operates on the principle of
  self-sacrificing love.

---

### Q17. After Herod's death, to what town did Joseph and his family move?

**“And He came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene." Verse 23.**

**Answer:** Nazareth was a despised town with a poor reputation (John 1:46), yet
here the Saviour spent roughly 30 years of His life.

- **Condescension:** The Creator of the universe consented to live in obscurity,
  poverty, and toil. He dignified labor.
- **Preparation:** He did not attend the schools of the rabbis or the centers of
  philosophy. He learned from God's word, nature, and the discipline of daily
  life. This shows us that we do not need worldly acclaim or high position to be
  close to God or to prepare for His work.

---

### Q18. How does the Bible describe the early life of Jesus?

**“And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the
grace of God was upon Him." "And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth,
and was subject unto them." Luke 2:40, 51.**

**Answer:** These verses are vital for understanding Christ's work for us in
**Sanctification**.

1.  **Subject to Parents:** Though He was the Commander of heaven, He obeyed His
    earthly parents. He kept the Fifth Commandment perfectly.
2.  **Perfect Development:** Jesus did not just die for us; He _lived_ for us.
    He passed through childhood and youth without sinning.
    - He wove a robe of perfect righteousness for children and teenagers.
    - He knows the temptations of youth and can succor (help) those who are
      tempted (Hebrews 2:18).
3.  **Imparted Grace:** Because He overcame in the home and in the workshop, He
    can impart that same spirit of obedience and patience to us today.

**[ILL]** A child trying to write a letter may make a mess of the ink and paper.
The father takes the child's hand in his own and guides the pen to form perfect
letters. Christ's life on earth allows Him to guide our hands in writing a life
of obedience.

### Q19. At the Feast in Jerusalem, how did Joseph and Mary lose Jesus when He was twelve years old?

**“But they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day's journey;
and they sought Him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And when they found
him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking Him." Verses 44-45.**

**Answer:** They lost Christ through assumption and association with the crowd.

- **"Supposing Him to have been in the company":** They took His presence for
  granted while they engaged in social talk.
- **Practical Lesson:** Many Christians today lose the sense of Christ's
  presence not by open rebellion, but by becoming absorbed in worldly business
  or careless conversation. We can travel a whole day in the "company" of church
  rituals or social circles and yet be far from Jesus.
- **The Remedy:** They had to retrace their steps to find Him. We must return to
  the point where we lost Him—usually through neglect of prayer or surrender—and
  seek Him with all our hearts.

---

### Q20. What was Jesus doing when they later found Him?

**“And it came to pass, that after three days they found Him in the temp le,
sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them
questions." Verse 46.**

**Answer:** They found Him in the Temple (the Sanctuary), focused on spiritual
things.

- **"About My Father's Business":** (Verse 49). Even at twelve, Jesus understood
  His mission.
- **Sanctuary Focus:** Jesus is always found in connection with the Sanctuary
  work. Today, if we wish to find Jesus, we must look by faith into the Heavenly
  Sanctuary where He now ministers as our High Priest (Hebrews 8:1-2). He is
  there, handling the "Father's business" of blotting out our sins and
  perfecting our characters.

---

### Q21. What impact did His questions and answers have upon the spiritual leaders of Israel?

**“And all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers."
Verse 47.**

**Answer:** The teachers of the law were used to dry traditions and legalistic
hair-splitting. Jesus brought a freshness and depth to the Scriptures that
pierced their hearts.

- **True Wisdom:** Christ spoke from a heart in tune with God. He showed the
  spiritual depth of the Law—that it is a law of love, not just cold
  restriction.
- **Light in Darkness:** Had these leaders been humble, this "Light" would have
  saved the nation. But spiritual pride often blinds us to the simple truth of
  God's word.

---

### Q22. How does Scripture summarize Christ's childhood and youth?

**“And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."
Verse 52.**

**Answer:** This describes a balanced, holy life.

1.  **Wisdom:** Intellectual and spiritual growth.
2.  **Stature:** Physical health and development. (The body is the temple of the
    Holy Spirit).
3.  **Favour with God:** Spiritual communion.
4.  **Favour with Man:** Social grace. He was kind, cheerful, and helpful.

**RBF Conclusion:** This perfect life is what God offers to credit to our
account (Justification) and to reproduce in us by His Spirit (Sanctification).
As we behold Him in His life and early years, we are "changed into the same
image from glory to glory" (2 Corinthians 3:18).
