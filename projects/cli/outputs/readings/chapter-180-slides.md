## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Perfection and Rest)

- **A Finished Perfection**
  - At Creation, God declared His work "very good" (Genesis 1:31 – “And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.”).
  - There was no defect, sin, or decay.
  - God is the author of perfection; sin is the intruder.

  - (Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”)
- **Standing in Christ**
  - Because the work is "finished," the believer stands clothed in Christ’s righteousness.
  - We do not work to earn pardon; we receive the finished pardon by faith.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **Paid in Full**
