### Q1. How many must meet the test of the judgment?
“I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked." Eccl. 3:17.

**Answer:**
The judgment is universal; it includes every moral agent who has ever lived. While the world often sees injustice—where the wicked prosper and the righteous suffer—Scripture assures us that God has an appointed time to review every case.

*   **The Scope:** No one is exempt. From the king on the throne to the humblest servant, all must pass under the review of the King of Kings (2 Corinthians 5:10).
*   **The Reason:** God acts to vindicate His law and His character. The judgment proves that His ways are just and that He has done everything possible to save humanity.
*   **Two Classes:** Ultimately, humanity is divided into only two groups: the "righteous" (those who are in Christ) and the "wicked" (those who have rejected His grace).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a great university entrance exam. Every student, regardless of their background, wealth, or popularity, must submit their paper for grading. The professor does not grade based on how the student looks, but on what is written on the page. So it is with God; He is no respecter of persons (Acts 10:34), and every life will be reviewed.

### Q2. Will any besides the human family be judged?
“And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, He hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day." Jude 6.

**Answer:**
Yes, the judgment extends beyond humanity to the angelic host.

*   **The Origin of Sin:** Sin began with Lucifer and the angels who followed him in rebellion (Revelation 12:7–9). They had light and glory but chose self-exaltation.
*   **Accountability:** High position does not excuse rebellion. These fallen angels are currently "reserved" in darkness, meaning their final sentence is yet to be executed, but their case is pending the "judgment of the great day."
*   **The Great Controversy:** This highlights that the judgment is cosmic in scale. It settles the dispute between Christ and Satan before the watching universe.

**[ILL]**
If a high-ranking general commits treason, he is not immune to the court-martial simply because of his rank. In fact, his higher rank makes his betrayal more serious. The fallen angels, who stood in the very presence of God, are held accountable for leaving their "first estate."

### Q3. With which class will the judgment begin?
"For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?" 1 Peter 4:17.

**Answer:**
The judgment begins with the "house of God"—the church, or those who have professed the name of Christ.

*   **Investigative Judgment:** In the typical service of the earthly sanctuary, the Day of Atonement was for Israel, not the Gentile nations (Leviticus 16). Likewise, the judgment investigates the lives of those whose names are written in the Book of Life to see if their faith is genuine.
*   **Why Believers First?** God must determine who is qualified to receive the "reward" of the resurrection of life before He returns.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** This is not a judgment to earn salvation by works, but a review to see if the believer is clothed in the righteousness of Christ. Only those who have the "wedding garment" (Matthew 22:11–12)—Christ’s imputed and imparted righteousness—can stand.

**Definition:**
*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of judgment taking place in heaven *before* Christ returns, where the records of professed believers are reviewed to determine their fitness for the kingdom.

**[ILL]**
When a company undergoes a financial audit, the auditors check the company's own books first, not the books of the competition. God begins His audit with His own "family"—those who claim to be His children—to see if their profession matches their character.

---

### Q4. Out of what will they be judged?
“A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him; thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened." Dan. 7:10.

**Answer:**
Judgment is rendered based on the records contained in the books of heaven. This scene depicts the heavenly courtroom.

*   **The Evidence:** God does not judge arbitrarily. He uses "books" (plural). Revelation 20:12 mentions the "Book of Life" and books recording works.
*   **The Standard:** We are judged by our works—not as the *merit* for salvation, but as the *evidence* of faith. A life of obedience is the fruit of a heart renewed by grace (James 2:17–18).
*   **Transparency:** The opening of books indicates that the judgment is conducted openly, witnessed by thousands of angels, ensuring the universe sees that God is just.

**[ILL]**
In a modern court, the stenographer keeps a precise transcript of everything said. If a defendant claims to be innocent, the transcript is read back. The books of heaven are God’s perfect transcript of every life—every thought, word, and deed is recorded there.

### Q5. Will there be a resurrection of all the dead?
“For the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." John 5:28 (Acts 24:15).

**Answer:**
Yes, all who have died will be resurrected, but not all at the same time, nor to the same destiny.

*   **Two Resurrections:** Jesus clearly distinguishes between the "resurrection of life" (for the righteous) and the "resurrection of damnation" (for the wicked).
*   **Pre-Determination:** Notice that when they come out of the grave, their destiny is already fixed. This proves that a judgment (investigation) must have taken place *while they were sleeping in the grave* to decide which resurrection they qualify for.

**[ILL]**
Consider a harvest. The farmer separates the wheat from the tares (weeds). They both grew in the same field, but at the harvest, they are treated differently based on what they *are*. The resurrection reveals what the soul became during its time of probation.

---

### Q6. What first occurs when the voice of Christ is heard?
“For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first." 1 Thess. 4:16.

**Answer:**
The first event at the Second Coming is the resurrection of the "dead in Christ."

*   **Priority of the Saints:** The righteous dead are raised before the living righteous are caught up.
*   **The Voice:** It is the voice of the Son of God, the Archangel (Michael, the Chief Messenger), that breaks the bonds of death.
*   **The Verdict Executed:** The fact that they rise *first* confirms they have passed the Investigative Judgment and have been accounted worthy of eternal life.

**[ILL]**
When a dignitary visits a city, the loyal citizens are often invited to the reception first. Christ calls His sleeping saints from the "dusty beds" of the earth to meet Him before dealing with the rebellious world.

---

### Q7. In what condition are the saints when raised from the dead?
“For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed." 1 Cor. 15:52.

**Answer:**
They are raised in a state of incorruption and immortality.

*   **Glorification:** This is the final step of salvation.
    1.  **Justification:** We are declared righteous (freedom from the penalty of sin).
    2.  **Sanctification:** We are made righteous (freedom from the power of sin).
    3.  **Glorification:** We are made physically perfect (freedom from the presence of sin).
*   **Victory:** The "sting of death" is removed. The body that was sown in weakness is raised in power (1 Corinthians 15:43).

**[ILL]**
A caterpillar spins a cocoon and seems to die. But when it emerges, it is a butterfly—beautiful and free from its earth-bound crawl. The resurrection changes our mortal, decaying bodies into glorious bodies like Christ's.

### Q8. Are the righteous and the wicked raised together?
“And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection." Rev. 20:4, 5.

**Answer:**
No, they are not raised together. There is a time interval of one thousand years (the Millennium) between the two resurrections.

*   **First Resurrection:** This is for the "blessed and holy" (Rev 20:6). It occurs at the Second Coming.
*   **Second Resurrection:** This is for "the rest of the dead" (the wicked). It occurs after the thousand years.
*   **Separation:** This separation underscores the vast difference between the character of the saved and the lost.

**[ILL]**
Imagine two trains leaving a station. The "Life Express" leaves in the morning, carrying passengers to a holiday destination. The "Judgment Train" leaves much later, carrying prisoners to sentencing. They are distinct events for distinct groups.

---

### Q9. Why have these been separated from the others before the voice of Christ is heard?
“But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage." Luke 20:35.

**Answer:**
They are separated because they have been "accounted worthy" through the investigative judgment that took place before Christ returned.

*   **Accounted Worthy:** No human is worthy by their own merits. We are "accounted" worthy only through faith in Jesus Christ.
*   **The Examination:** Before the Second Advent, the books were opened. Those found abiding in Christ—having their sins confessed and forsaken—were marked for the first resurrection.
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the earthly sanctuary, only those who afflicted their souls on the Day of Atonement were "clean" (Leviticus 16:30). Those who ignored the High Priest were "cut off."

**Definition:**
*   **Accounted Worthy:** Being viewed by God as righteous because Christ’s life stands in place of the sinner’s life.

**[ILL]**
To travel internationally, you need a visa. The visa is granted *before* you board the plane. When the plane arrives, those with visas are allowed entry; those without are separated. The judgment grants the "visa" for heaven before the "plane" (Jesus) arrives.

### Q10. What takes place with the living righteous at the second advent?
“Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump." 1 Cor. 15:51, 52; 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

**Answer:**
The righteous who are alive when Christ returns will be "translated" (taken to heaven without seeing death).

*   **Instant Change:** They move from mortality to immortality in a "twinkling of an eye."
*   **Sealed Character:** While their bodies are changed instantly, their characters had to be developed beforehand. They must have the "seal of God" (Revelation 7:3) before the trumpet sounds.
*   **Victory over Sin:** These believers have lived through the final time of trouble; they have demonstrated that God's grace is sufficient to keep them from falling (Jude 24).

**[ILL]**
Think of Enoch and Elijah in the Old Testament. They were taken to heaven without dying. They are types (examples) of the final generation of believers who will be translated when Jesus comes.

---

### Q11. Why are these separated from among the living wicked, and thus changed?
“Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man." Luke 21:36.

**Answer:**
They are separated because they maintained a vigilant connection with Christ.

*   **Watch and Pray:** This implies an active, conscious dependence on God. They did not fall into spiritual sleep.
*   **Standing Before the Son of Man:** To "stand" means to be acquitted in judgment. Psalm 1:5 says, "The ungodly shall not stand in the judgment."
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Their worthiness comes from escaping the corruption of the world through the power of the Holy Spirit. They have allowed Christ to live His life in them.

**[ILL]**
During a flood, emergency boats rescue those who are waiting on the rooftops, signaling for help. Those who ignored the warnings and stayed inside are left behind. The "watching" makes the difference.

---

### Q12. How far will this investigation of cases extend?
“For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." Eccl. 12:14 (Matt. 12:36, 37).

**Answer:**
The judgment is exhaustive. It covers "every secret thing."

*   **Hidden Sins:** Humans judge by outward appearance, but God judges the motives and the hidden life.
*   **Idle Words:** Matthew 12:36 warns that even "idle words" are judged, for words reveal the condition of the heart.
*   **The Good News:** This also means every secret prayer, every unseen act of kindness, and every tear shed in repentance is recorded and remembered by God.
*   **The Need for Cleansing:** Because the judgment is so deep, our cleansing must be deep. We cannot merely polish the outside; we need the "law written in the heart" (Hebrews 8:10).

**[ILL]**
A house may look freshly painted on the outside, but a structural inspector goes into the basement and checks the foundation for rot. God is the inspector of the soul; He checks the foundation of our character.

---

### Q13. When and where are the open and the secret things recorded?
“Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the lord, and that thought upon His name." Mal. 3:16 (Rev. 20:12).

**Answer:**
These things are recorded in heaven, in the "book of remembrance," as they occur in real-time.

*   **God's Attention:** The text says the Lord "hearkened and heard." God is intimately interested in the conversation and conduct of His people.
*   **A Book for the Righteous:** This specific book records the faithfulness of God's people—their testimony, their struggles, and their victories.
*   **Purpose:** These records are not for God's information (He knows all), but for the universe, to demonstrate the justice of His decisions.

**[ILL]**
Think of a parent who keeps a scrapbook of their child’s life—every award, every photo, every milestone. God keeps a "scrapbook" of those who fear Him because He delights in them.

---

### Q14. By whom is this record made?
“Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?" Eccl. 5:6 (Matt. 18:10).

**Answer:**
Angels act as the recording secretaries of heaven.

*   **The Guardian Angel:** Every person has an angel attending them (Matthew 18:10). These angels are witnesses to our daily lives.
*   **Accuracy:** We cannot plead "it was an error" (a mistake/accident) if the angel has recorded it as a willful sin. The record is precise.
*   **Solemnity:** Knowing that a holy watcher is recording our words should lead us to "keep the door of our lips" (Psalm 141:3).

**[ILL]**
In a court deposition, a court reporter types every word spoken. Later, you cannot deny what you said because the record stands. Angels are the court reporters of the heavenly sanctuary.

### Q15. Who opens the judgment, and presides over it?
” I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit... A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him; thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened." Dan. 7:9, 10.

**Answer:**
The "Ancient of Days," God the Father, presides over the judgment.

*   **The Setting:** This is the great throne room scene in Daniel 7. The "casting down" of thrones refers to placing seats or setting up the court.
*   **The Authority:** The Father is the ultimate Lawgiver. He presides to ensure the law is upheld.
*   **Sanctuary Antitype:** This corresponds to the High Priest going into the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement to cleanse the sanctuary.

**[ILL]**
Imagine the Supreme Court coming into session. When the Chief Justice enters, everyone stands, and silence falls. The entry of the Ancient of Days signals the most solemn moment in history.

---

### Q16. Who ministers to the Lord, and assists in the judgment?
“Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him." Dan. 7:10. "And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands." Rev. 5:11.

**Answer:**
Millions of angels minister to the Lord and assist in this work.

*   **Witnesses:** Since angels have observed the lives of men, they are present to verify the records.
*   **Interest:** The angels are deeply interested in our salvation (1 Peter 1:12). They rejoice when a sinner repents (Luke 15:10), and they are present to see the final vindication of the saints.

**[ILL]**
In a large trial, there is a jury and there are witnesses. The angels serve as the heavenly assembly, witnessing the proceedings to ensure that the outcome is understood and accepted by the loyal universe.

---

### Q17. Who else is brought before the Father at this time?
“I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him near before Him." Dan. 7:13.

**Answer:**
Jesus Christ, the "Son of Man," is brought before the Father.

*   **Not the Second Coming:** Note the direction of movement. He does not come *to the earth* here; He comes *to the Ancient of Days* in heaven.
*   **Mediator:** He appears as our Advocate. He enters to represent those who have committed their cases to Him.
*   **The Change of Ministry:** This represents Christ moving from the Holy Place to the Most Holy Place to begin the final work of atonement and judgment (in 1844).

**[ILL]**
If you are on trial, you don't want to stand alone before the judge. You want your attorney to step forward and approach the bench on your behalf. Christ steps forward to represent us before the Father.

### Q18. What is Christ's special work there before the Father and His angels?
“He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels." Rev. 3:5.

**Answer:**
Christ’s work is to act as Advocate, confessing the names of the overcomers and blotting out their sins.

*   **Advocacy:** "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John 2:1).
*   **The Process:**
    1.  Christ presents His blood as the covering for the repentant sinner.
    2.  If the sinner has been faithful, their sins are **blotted out** from the record.
    3.  If the professed believer turned back to sin and did not repent, their name is **blotted out** of the Book of Life.
*   **Condition:** The promise is to "he that overcometh." We overcome not by our power, but by the "blood of the Lamb" (Rev 12:11).

**Definition:**
*   **Blotting out of Sins:** The final erasure of the record of sin from the heavenly books, occurring just before probation closes. It is the antitype of the Scapegoat ceremony (Leviticus 16).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a ledger of debt. If the debt is paid, the accountant draws a line through it or erases it completely—it no longer exists against you. Christ’s blood allows the record of our sins to be erased forever.

---

### Q19. Where will Christ receive His kingdom?
“And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve Him." Dan. 7:14 (Luke 19:12, 15) (Rev. 11:15).

**Answer:**
Christ receives His kingdom in heaven, at the conclusion of the judgment, before He returns to earth.

*   **The Sequence:** First the judgment (Dan 7:10), then the coronation/reception of the kingdom (Dan 7:14).
*   **The Kingdom:** This is the Kingdom of Glory. He receives the right to rule as the "Son of Man" who has redeemed His people.

**[ILL]**
A prince travels to a far country to be invested with kingly authority. Once the ceremony is complete and he is crowned, he returns to his territory to claim his subjects. Christ is currently receiving the kingdom; He will soon return to claim it.

---

### Q20. When He comes to earth, what title will He bear?
“And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written King of Kings, and Lord of Lords." Rev. 19:16.

**Answer:**
He will bear the title "King of Kings, and Lord of Lords."

*   **Absolute Sovereignty:** This title indicates that all earthly power is subject to Him. The time of His humiliation is over; He now reigns supreme.
*   **Victor:** He rides a white horse (Rev 19:11), symbolizing His victory over sin, death, and Satan.

---

### Q21. What will be His mission to the earth?
“For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every man according to his works." Matt. 16:27 (Rev. 22:12).

**Answer:**
His mission is to execute the judgment—to bring the "reward" decided during the investigative phase.

*   **Executive Judgment:** The investigation is past; now is the execution.
*   **Rewards:**
    *   For the Righteous: Eternal life and entrance into the Kingdom.
    *   For the Wicked: Destruction (sudden destruction comes upon them, 1 Thess 5:3).

**[ILL]**
On payday, the boss hands out the envelopes. The calculation of hours and wages was done beforehand; the handing out of the envelope is the executive act. Christ comes to bring our "wages."

---

### Q22. Where will the Saviour take His people?
“In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also." John 14:2, 3.

**Answer:**
He takes them to the "Father's house"—heaven (the New Jerusalem)—for the thousand years.

*   **The Promise:** Christ does not remain on earth immediately at the Second Coming. He takes the saints *to* the place He prepared.
*   **Reunion:** The focus is "that where I am, there ye may be also." Being with Jesus is the true reward.

---

### Q23. During the one thousand years that intervene between the two resurrections, what will the saints do?
“And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus... and they lived and reigned [in the sense of judging] with Christ a thousand years." Rev. 20:4.

**Answer:**
The saints will reign with Christ and participate in a work of judgment.

*   **Reviewing the Records:** While the wicked are dead on the desolate earth, the righteous in heaven review the books regarding the lost (wicked humans and fallen angels).
*   **Vindication:** God allows the saved to see *why* certain people (perhaps loved ones or famous leaders) are not in heaven. They will see the secret sins and the rejection of grace that led to their loss.
*   **Agreement:** This ensures that when the final fire comes, all God's people will say, "True and righteous are thy judgments" (Rev 16:7).

**[ILL]**
It is like a jury deliberating to confirm a sentence. The judge has rendered the verdict, but the jury (the saints) reviews the evidence to understand the justice of the decision.

---

### Q24. Who will thus be judged by the saints?
“Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world [the wicked]? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?" 1 Cor. 6:2, 3 (Dan. 7:21, 22).

**Answer:**
The saints will judge "the world" (the lost) and "angels" (the fallen angels/demons).

*   **Judging Angels:** This is profound. Humans, who were made "a little lower than the angels" (Psalm 8:5), will, through Christ, sit in judgment over the highest order of created beings who fell.
*   **Union with Christ:** Because the saints are united with Christ (the Judge), they share in His judicial work.

---

### Q25. When will the saints judge the world?
“Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come." 1 Cor. 4:5.

**Answer:**
This judgment takes place *after* the Lord comes, during the millennium.

*   **Present Duty:** Now is not the time for us to judge motives or condemn others. We cannot read the heart.
*   **Future Privilege:** God has appointed a specific time for this work. Until then, we must attend to our own salvation with fear and trembling.

**[ILL]**
A medical student is not allowed to perform surgery until they have graduated and are fully qualified. We are not qualified to judge hearts now; we must wait until we are glorified and hold the mind of Christ fully.

---

### Q26. How will the decision of the saints be executed?
“And out of His [Christ's] mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God." Rev. 19:15.

**Answer:**
The judgment is executed by the "sharp sword" of Christ's word and the "fire" of God's wrath.

*   **Final Destruction:** At the end of the 1,000 years, the wicked are raised (Second Resurrection). They surround the Holy City (Rev 20:9).
*   **Fire from Heaven:** Fire comes down from God and devours them. This is the "second death."
*   **Cleansing:** This fire purifies the earth of sin, sinners, and the root of sin (Satan).

---

### Q27. Why is the execution of the judgment thus given to Christ?
” For as the Father hath life in Himself , so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man." John 5:26, 27.

**Answer:**
Authority is given to Christ *because* He is the "Son of man."

*   **Sympathy and Justice:** Because Jesus lived as a man, was tempted as a man, and suffered as a man, He is uniquely qualified to judge humanity. No one can say to Him, "You don't understand what it was like to be human."
*   **The Bridge:** He is the ladder connecting heaven and earth. He is both the Savior and the Judge.

**[ILL]**
If you were being tried, you would wish for a judge who had lived through your exact circumstances and struggles. Jesus is that Judge.

---

### Q28. How will the opening of the investigative judgment be made known to the world?
“And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come." Rev. 14:6, 7.

**Answer:**
The opening of the judgment is announced by a special message—the First Angel’s Message.

*   **"Is Come":** The angel does not say the judgment *will* come, but that the hour *is* come. This points to a specific time in history (1844, the end of the 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14) when the investigative judgment began in heaven.
*   **A Global Movement:** This message is to be preached to "every nation." It calls the world to return to the worship of the Creator (keeping His commandments, including the Sabbath) in light of the judgment.
*   **Urgency:** Knowing the court is in session should lead us to search our hearts and seek the covering of Christ's righteousness immediately.

**[ILL]**
The town crier used to run through the streets announcing important news. The Three Angels' Messages are God's final "town crier" warning, alerting the world that the heavenly court is in session and the end is near.
