### Q1. What injunction regarding purity did Paul give Timothy?

**"Keep thyself pure." 1 Tim. 5:22, last clause.**

**Answer:**

The command to "keep thyself pure" is not merely a suggestion for physical hygiene, but a spiritual imperative for every believer, particularly those who minister in holy things. In the context of the **Sanctuary** message, the priests who served in the earthly tabernacle were required to wash at the laver before entering the Holy Place (Exodus 30:19–21). If they failed to cleanse themselves, they died. This was a type (symbol) of the spiritual purity required of those who are "kings and priests unto God" (Revelation 1:6) in the New Covenant.

Purity involves the whole being—body, mind, and soul. To be "pure" means to be unmixed, free from foreign or contaminating substances. In the Christian life, this means freedom from the contamination of sin and the physical habits that cloud the mind and weaken the will.

*   **Personal Responsibility:** The text says, "Keep *thyself*." While God provides the power, the believer must exercise the will to choose purity.
*   **A Prerequisite for Service:** God cannot use a vessel that is filled with defilement (2 Timothy 2:21).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A surgeon preparing for a delicate operation scrubs his hands thoroughly. He does not do this to be praised for his cleanliness, but because he knows that introducing even a microscopic germ into the patient's body could cause death. Similarly, a Christian keeps himself pure not to earn salvation, but because he carries the life of Christ within him, and sin or defilement is fatal to that spiritual life.

### Q2. To what extent should all be kept pure?

**"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." 2 Cor. 7:1.**

**Answer:**

This verse outlines the scope and the method of true **Sanctification**.

1.  **The Scope:** "All filthiness of the flesh and spirit." This includes physical habits (flesh) and thoughts/motives (spirit). God claims the entire man. We cannot harbor a "pet sin" in the body while claiming a pure heart; the two are inseparably linked.
2.  **The Method (Righteousness by Faith):** Notice the verse begins, "Having therefore these promises." We do not cleanse ourselves *in order* to get God's favor; we cleanse ourselves *because* we have already received His gracious promises of adoption (see 2 Corinthians 6:17–18).
    *   **Justification:** God accepts us as His children.
    *   **Sanctification:** Because we are His children, we partake of His nature and expel sin from our lives.
3.  **The Goal:** "Perfecting holiness." Holiness is wholeness for God. It is the restoration of the image of God in man.

**Definition—Sanctification:** The ongoing process by which the Holy Spirit separates a believer from sin and sets them apart for God’s holy use, resulting in a character that reflects Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a beautiful crystal vase intended to hold pure water. If the vase is filled with mud, it cannot fulfill its purpose. Pouring fresh water in while the mud remains only creates a dirty mixture. To "perfect holiness" is to empty the vase of the mud (filthiness of the flesh) and wash it clean so it can hold the pure water of life (the Spirit).

### Q3. Can one indulge in the use of anything filthy or polluting, and still be pure?

**"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you." 2 Cor. 6:17.**

**Answer:**

The answer is a definitive "No." The command "touch not" implies that even contact with defiling substances compromises the separation God requires. This verse echoes the call to come out of Babylon (Revelation 18:4). A believer cannot walk with the world in its destructive habits and walk with God in the sanctuary of holiness at the same time (Amos 3:3).

*   **The Condition:** "Come out... be separate... touch not."
*   **The Promise:** "I will receive you."

In the context of health and temperance, "the unclean thing" represents anything that acts as a poison to the body or a narcotic to the brain. To indulge in toxic substances is to voluntarily unite oneself with corruption.

**Righteousness by Faith Application:**
Victory over "unclean things" (like tobacco, alcohol, or harmful drugs) is not achieved by mere human willpower. It is achieved by a "faith which worketh by love" (Galatians 5:6). When a man realizes that Christ died to save him from these chains, he yields his will to Christ. Christ then lives His life of purity *through* the believer (Galatians 2:20).

### Q4. What will the Lord do to those who defile the temple of God?

**"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." 1 Cor. 3:17.**

**Answer:**

This is one of the most solemn warnings in Scripture regarding physical stewardship.

1.  **The Body as a Temple:** In the Old Testament, God dwelt in the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary between the cherubim. In the New Covenant, the Holy Spirit dwells within the believer (1 Corinthians 6:19). The mind is the "sanctuary" of the soul, where the conscience (the law of God) resides.
2.  **The Consequence of Defilement:** To defile the body with poisons (intemperance) is an act of sacrilege. It is taking the vessel dedicated to God and filling it with that which destroys God’s workmanship.
3.  **Divine Justice:** "Him shall God destroy." This is not an arbitrary punishment, but a natural result. If we destroy the physical machinery God gave us to sustain life and communicate with Him, we eventually destroy ourselves. God cannot sustain those who persistently choose death.

**Definition—The Temple of God:** The human body, specifically the higher powers of the mind and nerve centers, designed to be the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit (Romans 8:9–11).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a tenant rents a house and proceeds to smash the windows, tear down the walls, and dump toxic waste in the living room, the landlord is not only aggrieved but will evict the tenant to save the property. Our bodies are the "house" owned by God. If we tear them down with intemperance, we are destroying God's property.

### Q5. What article in common use is defiling to the user?

**"Chemists, botanists, and physicians unite in pronouncing tobacco one of the most deadly poisons known. No other poison, with the exception of prussic acid, will cause death so quickly... The active principle of tobacco, that is, nicotine, a heavy, oily substance... A pound of tobacco contains, on an average, three hundred and eighty grains of this deadly poison..." (See full text in source).**

**Answer:**

The specific article identified here is **tobacco**. While society may classify it as a recreational luxury, science and Scripture (by principle) classify it as a "deadly poison."

*   **The Poison:** Nicotine is a potent toxin. As noted in the text, it is used to kill insects and snakes.
*   **The Spiritual Implication:** If a substance is a poison that kills life, using it for pleasure is a violation of the Sixth Commandment ("Thou shalt not kill") directed against oneself. It is a slow suicide.

We must also consider the **Sanctuary** aspect: The incense offered in the earthly sanctuary represented the prayers of the saints (Revelation 8:3–4). The "incense" of tobacco smoke is a counterfeit offering, a "strange fire" (Leviticus 10:1) that pollutes the human temple and offers a stench rather than a sweet savor.

### Q6. What are some of the symptoms of tobacco poisoning?

**Dr. B. W. Richardson... says: "Smoking produces disturbances (a). In the blood... (b). In the stomach... (c). Of the heart... (d). Of the organs of sense... (e). In the brain... (f). Of the nervous filaments... (g). In the mucous membrane... (h). On the bronchial surface..." (See full text in source).**

**Answer:**

The detailed list of symptoms—affecting the blood, heart, eyes, ears, brain, and nerves—demonstrates that tobacco attacks the very machinery God created to sustain life.

*   **The Brain and Nerves:** Most critical is the effect on the brain (point *e*) and nerves (point *f*). The brain is the only medium through which God can communicate with man. If the nerves are paralyzed and the brain clouded by narcotics, the Holy Spirit's "still small voice" cannot be clearly heard.
*   **Physical Theology:** We cannot have clear spiritual perceptions with a poisoned brain. To be "temperate in all things" (1 Corinthians 9:25) is essential for the Christian who wishes to run the race and win the crown.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A radio receiver must be tuned perfectly to pick up a distant signal. If the internal wiring is corroded or damaging static is introduced, the message is lost. The brain is our receiver for Heaven's signals. Tobacco introduces "static" and damages the wiring, making it difficult to discern the will of God.

### Q7. What does the apostle exhort all to do concerning their former habits?

**"That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God." l Peter 4:2.**

**Answer:**

This is a call to a radical change of allegiance.

1.  **Two Masters:** One can live to the "lusts of men" or to the "will of God." One cannot serve both (Matthew 6:24).
2.  **The Transformation:** Conversion implies a turning away. If a man was a slave to tobacco or stimulants before knowing Christ, his new life in the Spirit requires a departure from those "lusts."
3.  **"The Rest of His Time":** Life is short. The remaining time we have is too precious to waste on habits that shorten our days and cloud our minds.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
The "will of God" is our sanctification (1 Thessalonians 4:3). We do not overcome these habits to *become* God's children, but we overcome them by the power of the indwelling Christ *because* we are His children. He provides the "will and the do" (Philippians 2:13).

### Q8. What reason does he give for this advice?

**"For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries." 1 Peter 4:3.**

**Answer:**

The apostle argues that we have spent enough time already serving sin. The "will of the Gentiles" refers to the lifestyle of those who do not know the true God—a lifestyle characterized by sensory gratification and lack of self-control.

*   **Abominable Idolatries:** While we may not bow to statues, an **idol** is anything that takes the supreme place in our affections or controls our will. For the addict, the cigarette or the cup of stimulant becomes a god. It dictates their schedule, their mood, and their spending.
*   **Repentance:** True repentance involves looking at the "time past" with sorrow for the waste, and determining that the future will be different by God's grace.

### Q9. With whom was tobacco using first known?

**"Originating with the Indians of America... the natives carried with them lighted fire brands, and puffed smoke from their mouths and noses... [Columbus's sailors] declared that they 'saw the naked savages twist large leaves together, and smoke like devils.'" (See full text in source).**

**Answer:**

History reveals that tobacco use originated in heathenism. It was often used in pagan rituals to induce trance-like states or to commune with spirits ("smoke like devils").

*   **Spiritual Lineage:** The customs of the heathen are often designed by the enemy of souls to degrade the image of God.
*   **Christian Distinctiveness:** God’s people are called to be a "peculiar people" (1 Peter 2:9), distinct from the world. Adopting the habits of pagan culture—especially those that degrade the body—is a step backward into spiritual darkness. "Learn not the way of the heathen" (Jeremiah 10:2).

### Q10. How are all exhorted to glorify God?

**"For ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's." 1 Cor. 6:20.**

**Answer:**

This verse contains the most powerful motivation for health reform: **Redemption**.

1.  **Property Rights:** We are not our own. We have been "bought" (redeemed) by the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18–19). Because He purchased us, He owns us—body and spirit.
2.  **The Definition of Sin:** Using tobacco, tea, coffee, or alcohol is essentially damaging property that does not belong to us. It is robbing God of the service and health due to Him.
3.  **Glorifying God:** To glorify God means to reflect His character. We glorify Him in our body when we keep it in the best possible condition to serve Him and our fellow men.

**Definition—Atonement:** The reconciliation of man to God through the sacrifice of Jesus. Because He gave His life for us, our lives now belong to Him.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you borrowed a friend's expensive car, you would be careful not to scratch it or put sugar in the gas tank, out of respect for the owner. Our bodies are "on loan" from God, purchased at the infinite cost of the Cross. Pouring poisons into them shows a lack of respect for the Owner and the Price paid.

### Q11. What course will those take who are looking for the Saviour?

**"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself even as He is pure." 1 John 3:2, 3.**

**Answer:**

The Second Coming of Christ is the "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13) that motivates purity.

1.  **Preparation for Translation:** Those living when Christ returns will be translated without seeing death (1 Thessalonians 4:17). This requires a special preparation—a character cleansing that reflects Jesus.
2.  **"Purifieth Himself":** This does not mean we save ourselves, but that we actively cooperate with the Holy Spirit in the work of removing sin. We remove the obstacles (bad habits); He provides the power.
3.  **"As He is Pure":** Christ is the standard. Did Jesus use narcotics? Did He enslave His will to chemical stimulants? No. To be "like Him" when He appears, we must strive to be like Him now in character and habit.

**Righteousness by Faith:**
Faith is not passive. "Every man that *hath this hope*... purifieth himself." The hope of the Advent inspires the work of reform. We believe Jesus is coming to take us to a pure heaven; therefore, by His grace, we begin to live the life of heaven here on earth.

### Q12. (Implicit Context regarding Tea and Coffee from Source Text)

*(Note: While the user provided text regarding tea and coffee within the source material, no specific question was attached to it. However, the source material leads into the final question about "anything that defileth." We address the nature of these substances here as part of the broader context of intemperance.)*

**Summary of Source Teaching on Tea and Coffee:**
The text cites Dr. Roberts and Dr. Kellogg to establish that tea and coffee contain **theine** and **caffeine** (identified as poisons similar to strychnine in the source). The spiritual application is consistent with tobacco:
1.  **Digestion:** These substances retard digestion and paralyze God-given functions.
2.  **Nervous System:** They produce artificial excitement followed by depression ("nervousness and peevishness").
3.  **Temperament:** They can cause a "fretful and lachrymose" mood, affecting the Christian's witness. A "persecuted saint" complex caused by caffeine withdrawal is not the fruit of the Spirit.

**Principle:** "Total abstinence from all stimulants and narcotics is the only rule which should be accepted by a thorough-believing temperance man or woman."

### Q13. When the saints are gathered at last into the city of God, who will be kept out?

**"And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life." Rev. 21:27.**

**Answer:**

The final test for entry into the New Jerusalem is absolute purity—made possible by the blood of the Lamb.

1.  **"Anything that Defileth":** As established in the previous questions, tobacco, alcohol, and narcotic stimulants (including tea and coffee as referenced in the text) defile the body temple. They create unnatural appetites and enslave the will.
2.  **"Maketh a Lie":** Artificial stimulants make a lie; they make the user feel strong when they are weak, or calm when they are actually chemically sedated. They give a false sense of well-being while destroying the nerves.
3.  **The Lamb's Book of Life:** Only those who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 7:14) enter. This washing includes the cleansing of our habits. We cannot cling to our "defilements" and cling to the Cross at the same time.

**The Conclusion of the Matter:**
The gospel offers complete restoration. Jesus does not just forgive the *guilt* of sin (Justification); He breaks the *power* of sin (Sanctification). If a man is enslaved to tobacco or stimulants, the Great Physician offers a cure. By surrendering the will to God, claiming the promises, and cooperating with Divine power, the "temple" can be cleansed, and the believer can stand ready for the coming of the Lord.

**[ILL] Illustration:** When a king visits a city, the streets are swept, the garbage is removed, and decorations are put up. The King of Kings is coming soon. Shall He find the "city" of our soul filled with the refuse of tobacco, the debris of stimulants, and the filth of self-indulgence? Or shall He find a temple swept and garnished, ready for His habitation? (See Matthew 24:42–44).
