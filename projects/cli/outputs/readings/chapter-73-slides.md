Here is the slide deck for the Bible study "The Two Laws," formatted in
Markdown.

## Slide 1 – Title: The Two Laws

- **Topic:** Distinguishing the Moral Law from the Ceremonial Law
- **Key Theme:** Understanding Law, Grace, and the Gospel
- **Scripture Focus:** Ecclesiastes 12, Colossians 2, Matthew 5, Hebrews 9

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Standard of Judgment

- **Question:** By what are all men to be judged at last?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14 – “Let us hear the conclusion of the
  whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole duty
  of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
  whether it be good or whether it be evil.”
- **Key Text:** James 2:12 – “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be
  judged by the law of liberty.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (The Moral Law)

- **The Standard:** God uses the **Moral Law** (Ten Commandments) to test
  character, just as a builder uses a plummet (Amos 7:7, 8).
- **The Scope:** The law detects “every secret thing,” including inner motives
  and thoughts (Hebrews 4:12 – “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and
  sharper than any twoedged sword... and is a discerner of the thoughts and
  intents of the heart.”).
- **Law of Liberty:**
  - For the sinner: It is a yoke of bondage.
  - For the believer in Christ: It is a delight and a guide to living freely in
    righteousness (Psalm 119:45 – “And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy
    precepts.”).

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Investigative Judgment)

- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - This is the phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Lives of professed believers are reviewed to see who has remained in Christ
    (Daniel 7:9-10; 2 Corinthians 5:10).
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The judgment is not to condemn the righteous, but to vindicate God’s
    government and His people.

---

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration (The Mirror)

- **The Mirror:** Imagine a mirror. If your face is dirty, the mirror reveals
  the dirt, but it cannot wash it off.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The Law is God’s mirror (James 1:23-25).
  - It reveals our sin (dirt) in the light of God’s holiness.
  - We do not break the mirror for telling the truth.
  - Instead, the mirror drives us to the "soap and water"—Christ’s cleansing
    blood.

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Temporary Law

- **Question:** With what other law were the people of God for a time concerned,
  which is not to judge them?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 2:14-17 – “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances
  that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
  nailing it to His cross; and having spoiled principalities and power, He made
  a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Let no man therefore judge
  you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or
  of the sabbath days; which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of
  Christ.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points (Ceremonial Law)

- **Handwriting of Ordinances:** This refers to the **Ceremonial Law**
  (sacrifices, feast days, priesthood).
- **"Against Us":** It was a constant witness to the debt of sin, requiring
  blood sacrifices that could not take away sin (Hebrews 10:4 – “For it is not
  possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.”).
- **Nailed to the Cross:** When Jesus died, the Type met the Antitype. The veil
  was torn (Matthew 27:51), signifying the end of the sacrificial system.

---

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration (Shadow vs. Body)

- **Shadow vs. Body:** A shadow is cast by a solid object. The ceremonial system
  was a shadow cast backward from the Cross.
- **Type and Antitype:**
  - **Type:** The symbol (Passover lamb).
  - **Antitype:** The reality (Jesus Christ).
- **The Lesson:** If you are waiting for a friend, you look at his photo. When
  he arrives, you put the photo down and embrace him. To ignore Jesus to keep
  the ceremonial law is like ignoring the friend to stare at the photo.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Designating the Two Laws

- **Question:** What terms are employed, for the sake of convenience, to
  designate these two laws?
- **Key Concepts:**
  - “The first is called 'the moral law,' summarily contained in the Decalogue.”
  - “The second is known as the 'ceremonial or typical law' of the Jewish
    dispensation.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Distinction)

- **The Moral Law (Decalogue):**
  - Eternal, spiritual, and universal (Romans 7:12).
  - Defines sin.
- **The Ceremonial Law (Levitical):**
  - Temporary, ritualistic, pointing forward to the Cross (Galatians 3:19).
- **Why Distinguish?** Failing to distinguish leads to confusion: thinking the
  Ten Commandments are abolished, or trying to impose feast days on Christians.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Relation to Sin

- **Question:** What is the relation of the moral law to sin?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the
  law; for sin is the transgression of the law.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Defining Sin)

- **The Detector:** You cannot know what sin is without the law (Romans 3:20 –
  “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his
  sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”).
- **The Nature of Rebellion:** Sin is _anomia_—lawlessness. It is rebellion
  against God's government.
- **The Remedy:** God does not change His law to accommodate our weakness; He
  changes our hearts to accommodate His law (Hebrews 8:10).

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Early Existence of the Law

- **Question:** How early in the history of our world was this law applicable?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 2:13, 14 – “For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And
  Adam was not deceived; but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Pre-Sinai)

- **In Eden:** The Moral Law existed before Sinai. Adam and Eve were created
  with the law on their hearts.
- **The Proof:** Eve was in "transgression." Since “where no law is, there is no
  transgression” (Romans 4:15), the law must have been binding in Eden.
- **Universal Obligation:** It binds all humanity, not just the Jews.

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Scope of the Law (Love)

- **Question:** Since this law was binding on man previous to his fall, what did
  it cover?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 22:35-39 – “Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked
  Him a question, tempting Him, and saying, Master, which is the great
  commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
  with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the
  first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it: Thou shalt love
  thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the
  prophets.”

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Law of Love)

- **Two Tables:**
  - First four commandments: Love to God.
  - Last six commandments: Love to man.
- **God’s Character:** God is Love (1 John 4:8); therefore, His law is a law of
  love.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot manufacture this love. It is shed abroad
  in our hearts by the Holy Ghost (Romans 5:5). True obedience is love in
  action, empowered by Christ.

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Origin of Ceremonial Laws

- **Question:** When and for what reason were laws of a ceremonial or typical
  nature introduced?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 4:3, 4 – “And in process of time it came to pass, that
  Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel,
  he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the
  Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering.”
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:4 – “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent
  sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God
  testifying of his gifts.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Remedial System)

- **Added Because of Transgression:** The Ceremonial Law was a remedial system
  (Galatians 3:19).
- **Before vs. After Sin:** Before sin, there was no death or sacrifice. After
  sin, man needed a way to approach a holy God.
- **Cain vs. Abel:**
  - Cain brought fruit (works of his own hands).
  - Abel brought blood (faith in Christ’s atonement).
- **Atonement:** Reconciliation made typically through animal sacrifices,
  pointing to the true Atonement by Christ.

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Giving the Moral Law

- **Question:** How was the moral law communicated to the people at Sinai?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 4:12, 13 – “And the Lord spake unto you out of the
  midst of the fire... And He declared His covenant, which He commanded you to
  perform, even ten commandments.”

---

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Divine Majesty)

- **Spoken by God:** God Himself spoke the Ten Commandments audibly.
- **Majesty:** The mountain shook with fire and smoke.
- **Lesson:** This emphasized the holiness of the law and the need for a
  Mediator (Exodus 20:18, 19).

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: Giving the Ceremonial Law

- **Question:** How was the ceremonial law communicated to them?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 1:1, 2 – “And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake
  unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, Speak unto the
  children of Israel, if any man of you bring an offering...”
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 7:37, 38 – “This is the law of the burnt offering...
  meat offering... sin offering... which the Lord commanded Moses in Mount
  Sinai...”

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Private Instruction)

- **Method:** Given privately to Moses, who then instructed the people.
- **Content:** Dealt with specific procedures of the sanctuary service (burnt
  offerings, sin offerings, trespass offerings).

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: Writing the Moral Law

- **Question:** On what, and by whom, was the moral law written?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 4:12, 13 – “The Lord spake unto you... and He
  declared unto you... ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of
  stone.”

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (Finger of God)

- **Written by God:** The only part of Scripture written directly by God's
  finger (Exodus 31:18).
- **On Stone:** Symbolizes permanence and durability.
- **New Covenant:** God promises to write this same law on the "fleshy tables of
  the heart" (2 Corinthians 3:3; Hebrews 8:10).

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: Writing the Ceremonial Law

- **Question:** In what, and by whom, was the ceremonial law written?
- **Key Text:** Nehemiah 9:14 – “And commandedst them precepts, statutes, and
  laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant.”
- **Key Text:** Nehemiah 8:1 – “And they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the
  Book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded to Israel.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (Book of the Law)

- **Written by Moses:** Recorded by a man.
- **In a Book:** Recorded in a scroll, placed _beside_ the ark (Deuteronomy
  31:26), distinct from the tables of stone _inside_ the ark.

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Completeness of the Decalogue

- **Question:** Were the ten commandments a distinct and complete law by
  themselves?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 5:22 – “These words the Lord spake unto all your
  assembly in the mount... with a great voice; and He added no more. And He
  wrote them in two tables of stone...”

---

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points (A Complete Unit)

- **"He Added No More":** The Decalogue is a complete, rounded unit.
- **Summary of Duty:** No other laws share the same status as these ten words
  spoken directly by Jehovah.

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Ceremonial Ordinances

- **Question:** Was the ceremonial law composed of rules or ordinances?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:15 – “Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even
  the law of commandments contained in ordinances.”

---

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points (Partition)

- **Ordinances:** Paul calls this system the "law of commandments contained in
  ordinances."
- **Middle Wall:** These ritual regulations created a "middle wall of partition"
  between Jew and Gentile.
- **Abolished:** Christ abolished this distinction, making salvation accessible
  to all through faith.

---

## Slide 31 – Q14: Nature of the Moral Law

- **Question:** What is the nature of the moral law?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 19:7 – “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the
  soul.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q14: Key Points (Perfect Standard)

- **Perfect:** It has no flaw and requires absolute righteousness.
- **Converting the Soul:** By revealing sin, the law acts as a "schoolmaster" to
  bring us to Christ (Galatians 3:24).
- **Sanctification:** To be sanctified is to be brought into conformity to this
  perfect law through the indwelling of Christ.

---

## Slide 33 – Q15: Limitation of Ceremonial Law

- **Question:** Was perfection to be secured by the ceremonial law?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:9 – “Which was a figure for the time then present in
  which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did
  the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q15: Key Points (Ritual vs. Reality)

- **Inability to Save:** The blood of bulls and goats could never take away sins
  (Hebrews 10:4).
- **External Only:** It dealt with the "purifying of the flesh" (Hebrews 9:13)
  but could not produce internal righteousness.
- **Need for Christ:** Only the Holy Spirit, applying the blood of Jesus, can
  cleanse the conscience.

---

## Slide 35 – Q16: Prophecy of Magnification

- **Question:** How did the prophet Isaiah say that Christ would treat the moral
  law when He should appear on earth as the great teacher?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 42:21 – “The Lord is pleased for His righteousness' sake;
  He will magnify the Law, and make it honorable.”

---

## Slide 36 – Q16: Key Points (Magnifying the Law)

- **Meaning of Magnify:** To show in larger detail; to reveal hidden features.
- **Illustration:** A microscope does not destroy a leaf; it reveals its
  intricate structures.
- **Christ's Mission:** He came to show that the law is not a cold code, but a
  living principle of love.

---

## Slide 37 – Q17: Christ's Fulfillment

- **Question:** How did Christ fulfill this prophecy?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:17 – “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or
  the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” (See also John 15:10;
  1 Peter 2:22).

---

## Slide 38 – Q17: Key Points (Depth and Obedience)

- **Spiritual Depth:** In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught that hate is
  murder and lust is adultery (Matthew 5). He moved the demands to the heart.
- **Perfect Obedience:** Jesus lived in perfect obedience to the Father’s
  commandments.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Christ’s perfect history of law-keeping is credited to us (Justification).
  - His life is lived out in us (Sanctification).

---

## Slide 39 – Q18: Duration of Ceremonial Law

- **Question:** How long was the ceremonial law to continue?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:10 – “Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers
  washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
  reformation.”

---

## Slide 40 – Q18: Key Points (Expiration Date)

- **Time of Reformation:** The ceremonial system was imposed only until the
  coming of Christ.
- **The Tutor:** Once the Seed (Christ) had come, the temporary tutor was no
  longer needed (Galatians 3:19).

---

## Slide 41 – Q19: The Time of Reformation

- **Question:** When was this time of reformation?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:11, 12 – “But Christ being come a high priest of good
  things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle... neither by the
  blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered in once into the
  holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.”

---

## Slide 42 – Q19: Key Points (Heavenly Sanctuary)

- **Shift in Priesthood:** From the earthly Levitical priesthood to the
  Priesthood of Melchizedek (Christ).
- **Shift in Sanctuary:** From the earthly temple to the Heavenly Sanctuary.
- **Focus:** We now look to the throne of God where Jesus pleads His own blood.

---

## Slide 43 – Q20: Effect of the Cross

- **Question:** How did Christ's death affect the ceremonial law?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 2:14 – “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances
  that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way,
  nailing it to His cross.”
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:15 – “Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even
  the law of commandments contained in ordinances.”

---

## Slide 44 – Q20: Key Points (Paid in Full)

- **Nailed to the Cross:** Legal requirements for animal sacrifices were
  satisfied and cancelled.
- **The Veil Torn:** God signified that the earthly house was no longer His
  dwelling place (Mark 15:38).
- **Illustration:** When a debt is paid, the promissory note is cancelled. The
  ceremonial law was the note; Christ paid the debt.

---

## Slide 45 – Q21: Object of Ceremonial Law

- **Question:** What was the object of the ceremonial law?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:1 – “For the law having a shadow of good things to
  come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices,
  which they offered year by year, continually, make the comers thereunto
  perfect.”

---

## Slide 46 – Q21: Key Points (Shadows)

- **Shadow of Good Things:** It was an educational tool to teach the cost of sin
  and the way of salvation.
- **Limitation:** It could not make the worshiper perfect.
- **Result:** Now that the "good things" (Christ) have come, the shadow is
  unnecessary.

---

## Slide 47 – Q22: Paul on the Moral Law

- **Question:** What does Paul say of the holiness and spirituality of the moral
  law?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment
  holy, and just, and good.”
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:14 – “For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am
  carnal, sold under sin.”

---

## Slide 48 – Q22: Key Points (The Carnal Nature)

- **Character of the Law:** Holy, just, good, and spiritual.
- **The Problem:** The fault is not in the law, but in the "carnal" (fleshly)
  nature of man.
- **Enmity:** The carnal mind is at enmity with God and cannot obey (Romans
  8:7).
- **The Solution:** We need a spiritual birth to love the law (Romans 7:22).

---

## Slide 49 – Q23: Faith and the Moral Law

- **Question:** How does faith in Christ affect our relation to the moral law?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:31 – “Do we then make void the law through faith? God
  forbid; yea, we establish the law.”

---

## Slide 50 – Q23: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Not Void:** Faith is not a license to sin. Grace is not permission to ignore
  God’s government.
- **Establishing the Law:**
  - **Forensically (Justification):** Faith accepts Christ's perfect law-keeping
    in our place.
  - **Experientially (Sanctification):** Faith invites the Holy Spirit to write
    the law on our hearts.
- **Result:** We keep the law, not to _be_ saved, but because we _are_ saved
  (John 14:15).

---

## Slide 51 – Q24: Dependence on Ceremonial Law

- **Question:** How does dependence on the ceremonial law affect our relation to
  Christ?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:2 – “Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be
  circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.”

---

## Slide 52 – Q24: Key Points (Rejection of Grace)

- **Works vs. Grace:** Returning to the ceremonial law (shadows) for salvation
  is a rejection of Christ (Substance).
- **Insufficiency:** It implies His sacrifice was not enough.
- **Salvation:** We are saved by grace alone, through faith alone.

---

## Slide 53 – Q25: Endurance of Moral Law

- **Question:** How long does Christ say that the moral law is to endure?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:18 – “Verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth
  pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
  fulfilled.”

---

## Slide 54 – Q25: Key Points (Eternal Foundation)

- **Jot and Tittle:** Not even the smallest marking of the law will be altered.
- **Permanence:** God's law is the foundation of His throne.
- **Stability:** To abolish the law would be to abolish God's government and
  allow anarchy in the universe.

---

## Slide 55 – Q26: The Sabbath

- **Question:** To which code of laws does the Sabbath commandment belong?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:2, 3 – “And on the seventh day God ended His work
  which He had made... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it;
  because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and
  made.”

---

## Slide 56 – Q26: Key Points (Moral vs. Ceremonial Sabbath)

- **Creation Ordinance:** Established _before_ sin entered the world; therefore,
  not a shadow of redemption.
- **Location:** Enshrined in the heart of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8-11).
- **Distinction:**
  - Ceremonial "yearly sabbaths" (feasts) were nailed to the cross (Colossians
    2:16).
  - The weekly Sabbath of the Lord remains for the people of God (Hebrews 4:9).
