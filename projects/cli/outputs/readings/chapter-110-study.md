### Q1. In answering the petition of the thief on the cross, what promise did the Saviour make him?

**“And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.” Luke 23:43.**

**Answer:**
The promise Jesus made to the dying thief is one of the most beautiful assurances of salvation in all of Scripture. In the midst of His own agony, while bearing the sins of the world, the Saviour paused to grant eternal life to a repentant sinner.

*   **The Assurance of Acceptance:** The thief had no time to perform good works, be baptized, or offer sacrifices. He was nailed to a cross, helpless to "do" anything. His salvation proves the great doctrine of **Justification by Faith**.
    *   **Justification:** God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous, not because of their own deeds, but solely because of the merits of Jesus Christ credited to them (Romans 3:24–28).
*   **The Certainty of the Promise:** Jesus used the word "Verily" (truly/assuredly). He pledged that the thief would be in "Paradise." This promise was not based on the thief's past life, which was sinful, but on Christ's power to save to the uttermost (Hebrews 7:25).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** This scene perfectly illustrates that we are saved by looking to Christ. As the Israelites looked to the bronze serpent and lived (Numbers 21:9; John 3:14–15), the thief looked to the Lamb of God. His faith laid hold of Christ's righteousness, and at that moment, he was fitted for heaven.

**[ILL] The Helpless Debtor:** Imagine a man who owes a debt of millions and is thrown into prison with no way to pay. A wealthy King comes, pays the full debt, and opens the door. The prisoner did not "earn" his release; he simply accepted the King’s payment. The thief on the cross was that debtor. He brought nothing but his need; Christ supplied everything.

### Q2. What noted tree is in Paradise?

**“To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.” Rev. 2:7.**

**Answer:**
To understand the promise made to the thief, we must locate "Paradise" using Scripture, rather than tradition. This text identifies a specific landmark within Paradise: the **Tree of Life**.

*   **Restoration of What Was Lost:** In Eden, Adam and Eve lost access to the tree of life because of sin (Genesis 3:22–24). Paradise is the restoration of that lost Eden.
*   **The Condition:** The right to eat from this tree is given to "him that overcometh."
    *   **Overcoming:** This is not achieved by human willpower alone, but by the "faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12). To overcome means to gain victory over sin through the indwelling power of Christ (1 John 5:4).
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the budding rod of Aaron was kept in the earthly sanctuary (Numbers 17:8), the true Tree of Life is preserved in the heavenly sanctuary, the dwelling place of God.

### Q3. By what river is the tree of life?

**“And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river was there the tree of life.” Rev. 22:1, 2.**

**Answer:**
Scripture interprets Scripture. By linking Revelation 2:7 with Revelation 22:1–2, we find the exact location of Paradise.

*   **The Location:**
    1.  The Tree of Life is in Paradise (Rev. 2:7).
    2.  The Tree of Life is on either side of the river coming from the **Throne of God** (Rev. 22:1–2).
    3.  Therefore, **Paradise is where God's Throne is**—the third heaven (2 Corinthians 12:2, 4).
*   **Not a "Waiting Room":** This disproves the idea that Paradise is a separate spiritual compartment (sometimes called "Abraham's Bosom") distinct from heaven. Paradise is the very presence of the Father.
*   **The Implication:** If Jesus went to Paradise on the day He died (Friday), He must have gone into the presence of the Father at the Throne of God on that very day.

**[ILL] The Map:** If a map tells you the "Royal Oak Tree" is in the "King's Garden," and another page tells you the "Royal Oak Tree" is directly in front of the "Palace," you know for a fact that the Garden and the Palace are in the same place. Scripture maps Paradise directly to God's Throne.

### Q4. How long after Christ's crucifixion, did His resurrection take place?

**“Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day.” 1 Cor. 15:3, 4.**

**Answer:**
Here we establish the timeline of the gospel.

*   **The Facts:**
    *   **Friday:** Christ died and was buried.
    *   **Sabbath:** He rested in the tomb.
    *   **Sunday (Third Day):** He rose from the dead.
*   **The Significance of the Burial:** The text emphasizes that He was "buried." His body did not go to heaven on Friday; it was laid in Joseph’s new tomb.
*   **Sanctuary Connection:** On the Day of Atonement, the blood was shed (death), but the High Priest had to take that blood *into* the sanctuary to minister. Christ died on the cross (the altar in the outer court/earth), but His ministry in the heavens began after His resurrection.

### Q5. What did He say to Mary on the day of His resurrection?

**“Jesus saith unto her, Touch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father.” John 20:17.**

**Answer:**
This text provides the crucial key to resolving the "thief on the cross" difficulty.

*   **The Conflict:**
    *   If Jesus meant "This very Friday you will be with Me in heaven," then Jesus must have gone to heaven on Friday.
    *   But here, on **Sunday morning**, Jesus plainly tells Mary, "I have **not yet** ascended to My Father."
*   **The Harmony:** Since Christ is the Truth and cannot lie (Titus 1:2), He was not in Paradise (the place of God's Throne) on Friday. He was in the grave.
*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the promise "Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise" could not mean they would *be* there that Friday. It must mean something else regarding *when* the promise was made.

**[ILL] The Locked House:** If a father tells his son, "I promise you today, we will go to Disneyland," but the father stays home for three more days to finish work, did he lie? No. The promise was made *on that day*, but the trip happens later. If Jesus had gone to heaven Friday, He would have contradicted His own words to Mary on Sunday.

### Q6. What was really the thief's request?

**“And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into Thy kingdom.” Luke 23:42.**

**Answer:**
The thief’s theology was surprisingly accurate. He did not ask to go to heaven immediately at death.

*   **The Thief's Hope:** He looked forward to the time when Christ would come into His **Kingdom**.
*   **Understanding the Kingdom:** The thief recognized that the cross was not the end. By the Holy Spirit's illumination, he saw through the shame of the crucifixion and believed that Jesus would one day return as King.
*   **Faith vs. Sight:** To the natural eye, Jesus was a dying criminal. To the eye of faith, He was the Lord of Glory. This is the essence of **Sanctification**—having the mind of Christ. The thief had begun to think God's thoughts.

### Q7. When had Christ said that He would take His followers to Himself?

**“And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” John 14:3.**

**Answer:**
Jesus had previously established *when* the reunion with His people would take place.

*   **The Promise:** "I will come again."
*   **The Timing:** He does not receive His people one by one at death. He receives them *at His coming*.
*   **The Preparation:** Christ is currently in the heavenly sanctuary, preparing a place for us (Hebrews 8:1–2). This work involves the **Investigative Judgment**—blotting out the record of sins so that His people may stand faultless.
    *   **Atonement:** The work of reconciling God and man. This is finalized in the heavenly sanctuary before Christ returns.

### Q8. When and how will all the righteous, both living and dead, be with Christ?

**“For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.**

**Answer:**
This passage definitively settles the doctrine of the **State of the Dead** and the timing of the reward.

*   **The Order of Events:**
    1.  The Lord descends (Second Coming).
    2.  The Trumpet sounds.
    3.  The dead in Christ rise (Resurrection).
    4.  The living are caught up (Translation).
    5.  "So"—in this manner—"shall we ever be with the Lord."
*   **Implications for the Thief:** The thief is currently among the "dead in Christ." He is sleeping in the grave, unconscious of the passing time (Ecclesiastes 9:5), waiting for that trumpet call. To him, the next moment after closing his eyes in death will be seeing Jesus coming in glory.
*   **Conditional Immortality:** The Bible teaches that man is mortal. We put on immortality only at the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:51–54). We do not possess it inherently as a disembodied soul.

**[ILL] The Deep Sleep:** When a man undergoes surgery, he is given anesthesia. He closes his eyes, and the next instant—to his consciousness—he wakes up in the recovery room, though hours have passed. Death for the believer is a sleep. The thief closed his eyes on the cross; his next conscious thought will be the joy of the Resurrection morning.

### Q9. Why did Christ use the word "today" in His answer to the thief?

**Answer:**
The apparent difficulty in Luke 23:43 is solved by understanding the context and the original Greek structure.

*   **The Punctuation Problem:** The original Greek text of the New Testament was written in continuous capital letters without spaces or punctuation (commas, periods). Punctuation was added by translators centuries later based on their theological understanding.
    *   **Option A (Translators' Choice):** "Verily I say unto thee, [comma] today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise." (Implies immediate entry).
    *   **Option B (Scriptural Harmony):** "Verily I say unto thee today, [comma] shalt thou be with Me in Paradise." (Emphasizes the time of the promise).
*   **Why "Today"?** Consider the scene. It was the darkest day in history. Jesus was dying, rejected by His nation, forsaken by His disciples, and mocked by the religious leaders. He looked like anything *but* a King who could grant eternal life.
*   **The Power of the Statement:** By saying, "I say to thee *today*," Jesus was saying:
    *   "Today, while I hang on this cross..."
    *   "Today, while I appear defeated and powerless..."
    *   "Today, when the world rejects Me..."
    *   **"I assure you right now: You will be with Me in Paradise."**
*   **Consistency:** By placing the comma *after* "today," the verse harmonizes perfectly with:
    1.  Jesus not ascending until Sunday (John 20:17).
    2.  The reward being given at the resurrection (1 Thess 4:16).
    3.  The thief's request for the future Kingdom (Luke 23:42).

**[ILL] The Courtroom Verdict:** Imagine a judge sentencing a criminal. If the governor calls and says, "I tell you today, you will be pardoned," he means the pardon is certified *today*, even if the prisoner isn't released from the cell until next week. Jesus certified the thief's pardon on that dark Friday, guaranteeing a future glory.
