## Slide 1 – Title Slide

- **Topic:** The Sabbath in the New Testament
- **Theme:** Evidence from the Gospels, Acts, and the Revelation
- **Focus:** The Example of Jesus, the Practice of the Apostles, and the Lord’s
  Day

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Order of the Days

- **Question:** In what order do the Sabbath and the first day stand in the
  week?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 28:1 – “In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn
  toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to
  see the sepulcher.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Unbroken Cycle:**
  - God established the weekly cycle at Creation (Genesis 2:1–3).
  - The order remained unchanged throughout the Old Testament and down to the
    time of Christ.
  - The Sabbath is the seventh day; Sunday is the first day.
- **No Sacred Transition:**
  - There is no indication that the sanctity of the Sabbath was transferred to
    the day that followed it.
  - The Sabbath ended before the first day began.
  - One is the holy rest day; the other is a working day.
- **A Fixed Memorial:**
  - Like a birthday, the Sabbath commemorates a specific historical fact: God’s
    finished work of Creation.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Row of Books:**
  - Imagine a row of seven books.
  - The seventh book is bound in gold; the first six are bound in common
    leather.
  - If you move the first book (Sunday) to the end of the row, you change the
    order, but not the nature of the book.
  - It remains a common book.
  - Only the day God "gilded" (the seventh) possesses the inherent value He
    placed upon it.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Women’s Observance

- **Question:** After the crucifixion, what day was kept by the women who
  followed Jesus?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:56 – “And they returned, and prepared spices and
  ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **Obedience in Crisis:**
  - Even in grief, with Jesus dead, these faithful women remembered the Law of
    God.
  - True love for Jesus manifests in obedience (John 14:15 – “If ye love me,
    keep my commandments.”).
- **"According to the Commandment":**
  - Luke wrote this decades after the resurrection.
  - He does not call it an "old Jewish custom" but points to the eternal moral
    Law (Exodus 20:8–11).
- **Faith and Patience:**
  - These women illustrate the "patience of the saints" (Revelation 14:12).
  - They rested in trust, waiting for God’s time, rather than engaging in
    anxious labor.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Loyal Soldier:**
  - A loyal soldier does not stop obeying standing orders just because the
    general has fallen.
  - He is even more meticulous to honor the leader's memory by adhering to the
    last command given.
  - These women honored the Lord of the Sabbath by keeping the Sabbath of the
    Lord, even while He lay in the tomb.

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Identifying the Commandment

- **Question:** What day is the Sabbath "according to the commandment"?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:10 – “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord
  thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **Specific Identity:**
  - God specifies "_the_ seventh day," not just "a" seventh day or one day in
    seven.
  - It is a specific segment of time made holy by God’s presence.
- **God’s Property:**
  - It is "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."
  - It belongs to Jehovah, not to the Jews exclusively.
  - Substituting another day infringes upon God's sovereignty.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - This law was placed inside the Ark of the Covenant in the Most Holy Place.
  - Just as the Ark was the center of the sanctuary, the Law is the foundation
    of God's government.
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** Having this law written on the heart (Hebrews
    8:10).

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Benefactor's Check:**
  - If a wealthy benefactor writes a check for a specific person, only that
    person can cash it.
  - If the check is made out to "John," "James" cannot claim it.
  - God placed His blessing on the Seventh Day.
  - We cannot claim that blessing on the First Day; the "check" was not written
    for that day.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: The First Day

- **Question:** How did the holy women regard the first day of the week?
- **Key Text:** Luke 24:1 – “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in
  the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had
  prepared, and certain others with them.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **A Day for Labor:**
  - The women treated Sunday as a day for secular activity: traveling, carrying
    burdens, applying spices.
  - They did not regard it as sacred.
- **No Instruction of Change:**
  - If Jesus had changed the Sabbath to Sunday, they would have rested.
  - Instead, they "opened for business" on Sunday morning.
- **Consistency:**
  - Scripture teaches: Six days for labor, the seventh for rest.
  - Keeping Sunday is a tradition of men, not a commandment of God (Matthew
    15:9).

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Shopkeeper:**
  - If a shopkeeper closes for a holiday to honor the king but opens wide for
    business the next morning, his actions show which day he considers holy.
  - The women "closed shop" on Sabbath and went to work on Sunday.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Christ’s Custom

- **Question:** What was the custom of Christ in regard to the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Luke 4:16 – “And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought
  up; and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and
  stood up for to read.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Christ Our Righteousness)

- **Our Perfect Example:**
  - 1 John 2:6 – “He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
    even as he walked.”
  - To be a Christian is to follow Christ's steps.
- **Righteousness Imputed:**
  - Jesus lived a life of perfect obedience _for us_.
  - His perfect Sabbath-keeping is credited to our account when we are
    justified.
- **Righteousness Imparted:**
  - Christ lives in the believer by the Holy Spirit (Galatians 2:20).
  - He is "the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever" (Hebrews 13:8).
  - The indwelling Christ will lead the believer to keep the Sabbath just as He
    did.

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Master Artist:**
  - A master artist guides the hand of his apprentice to follow his strokes.
  - Jesus painted a perfect life on the canvas of time, including a "Sabbath
    rest."
  - If we are His students, we should not paint over His work with a different
    color.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: Prophecy of Jerusalem

- **Question:** In predicting the overthrow of Jerusalem, and the necessity of
  fleeing from Judea before that time, what did He enjoin upon His disciples
  regarding the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:20 – “But pray ye that your flight be not in the
  winter, neither on the Sabbath day.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **A Look into the Future:**
  - Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70, nearly 40 years after the resurrection.
  - Jesus implies the Sabbath would still be sacred to His people decades later.
- **Practical Holiness:**
  - Flight would disrupt holy rest and communion.
  - God cares for the spiritual well-being of His people even in tribulation.
- **Victory through Prayer:**
  - We are to bring future trials to God.
  - It is an act of faith to pray, "Lord, arrange my life so I do not have to
    break Thy Sabbath."

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Father's Instruction:**
  - If a father tells his son, "When you build your house years from now, do not
    build the roof in the rainy season," it implies:
    1. The son will build a house.
    2. The rainy season will still exist.
  - Jesus implies the Sabbath will still exist and be precious to His people
    long after His ascension.

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: Apostolic Terminology

- **Question:** What title does Inspiration give to the day on which the Jews
  met in the synagogues?
- **Key Text:** Acts 15:21 – “For Moses of old time hath in every city them that
  preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **No Redefinition:**
  - Years after the cross, the Holy Spirit (through Acts) still calls the
    seventh day "the Sabbath."
  - Sunday is consistently called "the first day of the week."
- **Continuity:**
  - The Jerusalem Council (c. A.D. 49) recognized the weekly cycle of reading
    Scripture on the Sabbath.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: Paul’s Commission

- **Question:** To whom was Paul especially commissioned to preach?
- **Key Text:** Acts 9:15 – “But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way; for he is a
  chosen vessel unto me, to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the
  children of Israel.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **The Apostle to the Gentiles:**
  - If the Sabbath were only a "Jewish institution," Paul was the specific
    messenger to announce its end.
  - Instead, Paul consistently preached on the Sabbath.
  - He taught that Gentiles are "grafted in" to the spiritual stock of Israel
    (Romans 11:17).

---

## Slide 24 – Q9: Paul’s Practice

- **Question:** On what day did he and Barnabas go into the synagogue at
  Antioch?
- **Key Text:** Acts 13:14 – “But when they departed from Perga, they came to
  Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat
  down.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points

- **Utilizing the Day:**
  - Paul used the Sabbath for worship and evangelism.
  - It was the day people were free from labor and gathered to hear the Word.
- **Validation:**
  - By attending, Paul validated the day as the appropriate time for the study
    of Scripture.

---

## Slide 26 – Q10: The Gentiles’ Request

- **Question:** After the sermon had been preached by Paul, and the Jews had all
  left the synagogue, what did the Gentiles request of the apostles?
- **Key Text:** Acts 13:42 – “And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue,
  the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next
  Sabbath.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points

- **The Missing Opportunity:**
  - If Sunday were the "Christian Sabbath," Paul could have said, "Come back
    tomorrow, the Lord's Day."
  - He did not.
- **Gentile Hunger:**
  - These Gentiles wanted to hear the Word of God.
  - They understood that the proper time for this assembly was the "next
    Sabbath."

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Restaurant Special:**
  - If a customer asks, "Can I have this meal next Friday?" and the restaurant
    serves it daily, the waiter would say, "Come back tomorrow!"
  - The fact that they waited a week shows they understood the Sabbath was the
    appointed time for assembly.

---

## Slide 29 – Q11: The Result

- **Question:** What was the result of this request of the Gentiles?
- **Key Text:** Acts 13:44 – “And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole
  city together to hear the word of God.”

---

## Slide 30 – Q11: Key Points

- **Massive Assembly:**
  - A mixed multitude (Jews and Gentiles) gathered.
  - The Sabbath was the rally point for the Gospel.
- **Universal Scope:**
  - The Sabbath was made for "man" (Mark 2:27), not just the Jew.
  - It provides the time necessary to digest the "word of God."

---

## Slide 31 – Q12: Prayer by the River

- **Question:** On what day did the women at Philippi hold their prayer
  meetings?
- **Key Text:** Acts 16:13 – “And on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a
  river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto
  the women which resorted thither.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q12: Key Points

- **Nature’s Sanctuary:**
  - There was no synagogue in Philippi.
  - Paul and his companions still treated the Sabbath as holy.
- **Christian Practice:**
  - This was a Christian gathering where Lydia was converted.
  - It proves Sabbath observance apart from Jewish buildings or liturgy.
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - The river side provided a place for cleansing and quiet, fitting for a day
    of sanctification (Ezekiel 20:12).

---

## Slide 33 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Altar in the Wilderness:**
  - A man who only attends church to be seen will stop when he is alone.
  - A man who loves God will build an altar even in the desert.
  - Paul kept the Sabbath by the river because the Sabbath was in his heart.

---

## Slide 34 – Q13: Intentional Waiting

- **Question:** What shows that upon his arrival in the city, the apostle waited
  for the Sabbath before attempting to hold a meeting?
- **Key Text:** Acts 16:12 – “...and we were in that city abiding certain days.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q13: Key Points

- **Key Text:** Acts 17:1, 2 – “They came to Thessalonica... and Paul, as his
  manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out
  of the Scriptures.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q14: Key Points

- **"As His Manner Was":**
  - Just as Jesus had a "custom" (Luke 4:16), Paul had a "manner."
  - The servant follows the Master.
- **Reasoning from Scripture:**
  - True Sabbath keeping involves the intellect and the heart.
  - It is the day to be established in the faith through the Word.

---

## Slide 38 – Q15: Working Days

- **Question:** How did the apostle spend the working days of the week when at
  Corinth?
- **Key Text:** Acts 18:3 – “And because he was of the same craft, he abode with
  them, and wrought; for by their occupation they were tent makers.”

---

## Slide 39 – Q15: Key Points

- **Honest Labor:**
  - The Commandment says: "Six days shalt thou labor" (Exodus 20:9).
  - Paul worked as a tentmaker to support his ministry.
- **Working on Sunday:**
  - Paul's work week included the first day of the week.
  - There is no record of him treating Sunday as holy.
- **Sanctification of Work:**
  - Righteousness by faith makes a man faithful in secular duties
    (Sunday–Friday) as well as sacred duties (Sabbath).

---

## Slide 40 – Q16: Sabbath Activities

- **Question:** What did he do on the Sabbath days?
- **Key Text:** Acts 18:4 – “And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and
  persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q16: Key Points

- **Every Sabbath:**
  - A regular, rhythmic pattern of ministry.
- **Jews and Greeks:**
  - Greeks (Gentiles) were present and persuaded on the Sabbath.
  - The idea that "Sabbath is for Jews, Sunday is for Gentiles" is contrary to
    the book of Acts.

---

## Slide 42 – Q17: Duration of Ministry

- **Question:** How long did he continue this work?
- **Key Text:** Acts 18:11 – “And he continued there a year and six months,
  teaching the word of God among them.”

---

## Slide 43 – Q17: Key Points

- **The Math of Evidence:**
  - Paul was in Corinth for 18 months.
  - 18 months × 4 weeks = **Approx. 78 Sabbaths**.
  - We have a record of nearly 80 Sabbath services held by the Apostle to the
    Gentiles in one city.
- **Overwhelming Proof:**
  - Contrast: Only one religious meeting on the first day is recorded in Acts
    (Acts 20:7), which was a Saturday night farewell meeting.
  - The weight of New Testament history is on the side of the seventh-day
    Sabbath.

---

## Slide 44 – Q18: The Lord’s Day

- **Question:** On what day was John in the Spirit?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 1:10 – “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and
  heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.”

---

## Slide 45 – Q18: Key Points

  - We must let the Bible define its own terms.

---

## Slide 46 – Q19: Lord of the Sabbath

- **Question:** Who is Lord of the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Mark 2:28 – “Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the
  Sabbath.”

---

## Slide 47 – Q19: Key Points

- **Biblical Definition:**
  - Jesus clearly answers: "The Son of man is Lord... of the Sabbath."
- **Logical Conclusion:**
  - If the "Lord's Day" is the day the Lord claims...
  - And Christ is Lord of the Sabbath...
  - Then the Sabbath is the Lord's Day.
- **Freedom in Christ:**
  - Jesus made the Sabbath for man's benefit (Mark 2:27).
  - To accept Him as Lord is to accept the gift of His Sabbath—a day of freedom,
    not legalism.

---

## Slide 48 – Q19: Illustration

- **The Lord of the Palace:**
  - If a King declares himself "Lord of the Palace," then the Palace is the
    "Lord's House."
  - You cannot point to the barn and say, "That is the Lord's House."
  - Jesus claimed the Sabbath. He never claimed the first day.

---

## Slide 49 – Q20: God’s Claim

- **Question:** Who else besides Christ claims the Sabbath as His day?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:13 – “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath,
  from doing thy pleasure on My holy day...”

---

## Slide 50 – Q20: Key Points

- **"My Holy Day":**
  - Jehovah calls the Sabbath "My holy day."
- **Unity of the Godhead:**
  - The Father calls it His; the Son calls Himself its Lord.
- **True Observance:**
  - We are to call the Sabbath a "delight."
  - We delight in the Lord, and therefore we delight in His day.

---

## Slide 51 – Q21: Creation Rights

- **Question:** Why does God call it His day?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:11 – “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
  the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the
  Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

---

## Slide 52 – Q21: Key Points

- **God’s Seal:**
  - The Sabbath contains God's Name (The Lord), Title (Maker), and Territory
    (Heaven and Earth).
- **Resting in His Work:**
  - God rested to set an example of satisfaction in finished work.
  - **Application:** In the Gospel, we rest in the finished work of Christ.
  - The Sabbath is the outward sign of the inward rest of faith (Hebrews
    4:9–10).

---

## Slide 53 – Q22: Christ the Creator

- **Question:** But how did God create the world?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 1:2 – “...His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all
  things, by whom also He made the worlds.”

---

## Slide 54 – Q22: Key Points

- **Christ the Agent:**
  - God created all things _through_ Jesus Christ (John 1:1–3).
- **The Conclusion:**
  - Since Christ made the worlds, Christ rested on the seventh day.
  - Therefore, the Sabbath is a Christian institution, made by Christ before
    sin.
- **Creation and Redemption:**
  - The Power that created the world is the Power that recreates the sinner (2
    Corinthians 5:17).
  - By keeping the Sabbath, we acknowledge Christ as both Creator and Redeemer.

---

## Slide 55 – Q22: Illustration

- **The Architect:**
  - A genius architect builds a cathedral. Years later, he returns to restore
    it.
  - The same genius that built it is required to restore it.
  - Christ built the universe and established the Sabbath.
  - He came to earth to restore the soul.
  - The Sabbath stands as the monument to His power to both build and rebuild.
