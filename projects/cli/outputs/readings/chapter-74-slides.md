## Slide 1 – Q1: Christ the End of the Law

- **Question:** To the believer what does Christ become? “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth.” Rom. 10:4.
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 10:4 – “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Goal and Function)

- **The Meaning of “End” (*Telos*)**
  - The Greek word *telos* signifies a “goal,” “purpose,” or “culmination,” not necessarily a termination.
  - Christ is not the destroyer of the law (Matthew 5:17 – “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.”).
  - He is the *goal* toward which the law points.
- **The Function of the Law**
  - The moral law acts as a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.
  - Galatians 3:24 – “Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”
  - It reveals God’s holiness and man’s sinfulness (Romans 3:20 – “...for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”).
  - The law diagnoses the problem but cannot provide the cure.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Justification Defined**
  - The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is righteous solely because of the merits of Jesus Christ.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”
- **The Believer’s Privilege**
  - We stop looking to our own works for salvation (legalism).
  - We look to Christ, who offers *imputed righteousness*—His perfect life credited to our account.
  - Romans 4:22 – “And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Telescope and the Star**
  - Imagine a telescope representing the Law.
  - Its purpose is not to be looked *at* (focusing on the brass and glass), but to be looked *through*.
  - If used correctly, the telescope focuses our vision on the Star (Christ).
  - We do not throw away the telescope, but we understand its "end" or purpose is to reveal the glory of the Star.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Meaning of “End” in Scripture

- **Question:** In what sense is the word end (Greek, telos) sometimes used in the Scriptures? Object, intention, or design? “Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord.” James 5:11.
- **Key Text:**
  - James 5:11 – “Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Design and Character)

- **Scripture Interpreting Scripture**
  - The “end of the Lord” in Job’s life was not the cessation of God, but the *outcome* or *purpose* of the trials.
  - The purpose was to show that the Lord is “very pitiful, and of tender mercy.”
- **The Consistency of God**
  - God’s law is a transcript of His character.
  - Psalm 19:7 – “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.”
  - Since God does not change (Malachi 3:6), His law does not cease.
  - The design of the law is realized when a sinner is transformed into the image of Jesus.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Architect’s Blueprint**
  - Consider a blueprint for a house.
  - When the house is built, the blueprint has reached its “end” (*telos*).
  - The blueprint is not destroyed; its purpose is fulfilled in the physical building.
  - Christ is the living realization of the written law.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Object of the Law

- **Question:** What was the object of the law? “And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.” Rom. 7:10.
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 7:10 – “And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Life and Death)

- **Ordained to Life**
  - God created man to live in harmony with His law.
  - Obedience is the condition of existence; had Adam remained obedient, the law would have guaranteed life.
  - Matthew 19:17 – “...if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.”
- **Found to be Unto Death**
  - Because “all have sinned” (Romans 3:23), the broken law condemns the transgressor.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
  - The law acts as a diagnostic tool: it reveals the fatal disease but offers no cure.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Sanctuary Application

- **The Schoolmaster and the Sanctuary**
  - By slaying our hope in self-righteousness, the law drives us to seek life elsewhere.
  - **Sanctuary Insight:**
    - The Law was inside the Ark, demanding righteousness.
    - Above it was the Mercy Seat, sprinkled with atoning blood.
    - The law condemns, but the blood interposes to offer life.
  - The object of the law is to drive us to the Mercy Seat (Christ).

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Builder’s Level**
  - A builder uses a level to ensure a wall is straight.
  - If a wall is crooked, the level reveals the error but cannot fix it.
  - The level declares, “This is crooked; it must come down.”
  - The law is the spiritual level: it exposes our sin and prompts us to call for the Master Builder (Jesus) to rebuild us.

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Goal of the Commandment

- **Question:** What further is the end, or object, of the law? “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart.” 1 Tim. 1:5.
- **Key Text:**
  - 1 Timothy 1:5 – “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points (Love and Sanctification)

- **Charity (Agape)**
  - This is self-sacrificing, principled love—the principle of God’s government.
  - 1 John 4:8 – “He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”
- **A Pure Heart**
  - The law requires inward purity, not just outward compliance.
  - Psalm 51:10 – “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.”
- **Sanctification Defined**
  - The process by which the Holy Spirit imparts the nature of Christ to the believer.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Apple Seed**
  - If you plant an apple seed, the “end” or object is not just the sapling or leaves.
  - The object is the fruit—the apple.
  - The “seed” of the commandment is planted in the heart to bear the fruit of the Spirit (Love).
  - Without the fruit of love, the purpose of the commandment is not yet realized.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Defining Love

- **Question:** What is charity, or love? “Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” Rom. 13:10 (1 John 5:3).
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.”
  - 1 John 5:3 – “For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Love as Action)

- **Love Works No Ill**
  - True love is active; it does not steal, kill, or covet.
  - One cannot claim "Christian love" while willfully breaking God's commandments.
- **Fulfilling, Not Replacing**
  - To “fulfill” means to fill up with meaning and action, not to abolish.
  - John 15:10 – “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.”
  - There is no genuine love for God that results in rebellion against His government.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Two Rails of a Train**
  - A train needs two rails to run effectively: "The Law" and "Love."
  - **Rail 1 (Law alone):** Heavy, grinding, leads to legalism.
  - **Rail 2 (Love alone):** Without definition, leads to sentimentalism and sin (derailment).
  - The Christian life moves forward only when Love is the power moving us along the tracks of God’s commandments.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Why Christ Was Sent

- **Question:** Why did God send His Son to the world? “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us.” Rom. 8:3, 4.
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 8:3 – “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points (The Law’s Inability)

- **What the Law Could Not Do**
  - The law acts like a mirror; it shows the dirt but cannot wash it off.
  - It has no power to save or strengthen the sinner.
- **Weakness of the Flesh**
  - The fault is not in the law (Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.”).
  - The fault is in our fallen nature ("the flesh") which is antagonistic to God.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”

## Slide 20 – Q6: Key Points (Christ’s Victory)

- **Condemning Sin in the Flesh**
  - Christ took "the likeness of sinful flesh" yet remained without sin.
  - He broke the power of sin in human nature.
  - **Atonement:**
    - Includes payment for sin (Cross) and removal of sin (Sanctuary/Priesthood).
    - Hebrews 2:17 – “Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest...”

## Slide 21 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Man in the Pit**
  - A man is trapped in a deep pit with two broken arms ("weak through the flesh").
  - A rope (The Law) is thrown down. The rope is good and strong, but the man cannot grab it.
  - The rope cannot save him because of his weakness.
  - Christ does not just throw a rope; He climbs into the pit, takes the man in His arms, and carries him out.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Enabled by Christ

- **Question:** Then what is one enabled to do through Christ? “That the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us.” Rom. 8:4 (see margin of Revised Version).
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 23 – Q7: Key Points (Imparted Righteousness)

- **Fulfilled IN Us**
  - **Imputed Righteousness:** Christ’s record credited *for* us (Title to heaven).
  - **Imparted Righteousness:** Christ’s life lived *in* us (Fitness for heaven).
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me...”
- **Victory Over Sin**
  - Through the indwelling Spirit, the believer is empowered to obey.
  - Philippians 4:13 – “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.”
  - The commandments are kept as the *fruit* of salvation, not the root.

## Slide 24 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Glove Analogy**
  - A glove has the form of a hand (like the law has the form of righteousness), but it is "weak" and powerless on its own.
  - It cannot turn a page or lift a weight.
  - If a living hand is inserted into the glove, the glove can do everything the hand does.
  - We are the glove; Christ is the Hand. When He lives in us, the "righteousness of the law" is fulfilled because He is doing the work.
