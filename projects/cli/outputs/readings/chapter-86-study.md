### Q1. In what way is the true God distinguished from all false gods?

**Scripture:** “The Lord is the true God, He is the living God, and an
everlasting king... The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even
they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. He hath made the
earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath
stretched out the heavens by His discretion.” (Jeremiah 10:10-12)

**Answer:** The distinguishing characteristic of the true God is His creative
power. In the great controversy between truth and error, the Bible draws a sharp
line: false gods are things that are _made_, but the true God is the _Maker_ of
all things.

1.  **The Living God vs. Perishing Idols:** Jeremiah contrasts the "living God"
    with gods that "shall perish." An idol has no life in itself; it must be
    carried, protected, and maintained by human hands. The true God, however, is
    the source of all life (Acts 17:25).
2.  **Creative Power as Authority:** God’s right to rule—His sovereignty as
    "everlasting king"—is founded upon the fact that He created the territory
    over which He rules. He owns the earth because "He hath made the earth by
    His power."
3.  **Power to Create is Power to Save:** This is essential to the Gospel. The
    same power that called light out of darkness in Genesis 1 is required to
    shine the light of the knowledge of God into a dark, sinful heart (2
    Corinthians 4:6). If God were not the Creator, He could not be the Redeemer,
    for redemption is a work of re-creation (Psalm 51:10).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a magnificent painting in a gallery. People
might admire the frame or the lighting, but the artist stands apart from the
painting. An idol is like a figure painted _inside_ the canvas—it is part of the
creation. The true God is the Artist standing _outside_ the canvas; He is not
part of the creation but the One who designed and crafted the whole piece. Only
the Artist can restore the painting if it is damaged; the painted figures cannot
fix themselves.

### Q2. How did Paul explain to the idolatrous Athenians the identity of the true God?

**Scripture:** “Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto you,
God that made the world and all things therein.” (Acts 17:23, 24)

**Answer:** When Paul stood on Mars' Hill, surrounded by intellectuals and
philosophers, he did not begin with complex arguments about tradition. He went
straight to the foundation of reality: Creation.

1.  **The Unknown God Revealed:** The Athenians sensed there was a divinity they
    did not know. Paul identified this "Unknown God" as the Creator. He argued
    that a God who made the "world and all things therein" cannot be contained
    in temples made by human hands, nor does He need anything from humans.
2.  **The Basis of Worship:** Worship is due to God specifically because He is
    our Origin. If we evolved by chance or were made by a lesser deity, we would
    owe the Supreme God nothing. But because "in Him we live, and move, and have
    our being" (Acts 17:28), our entire existence belongs to Him.

- **Definition - Worship:** To ascribe worth, honor, and glory to a superior
  being. In Scripture, true worship is the response of the created being to the
  love and power of the Creator (Revelation 4:11).

### Q3. What did the apostles tell the idolaters at Lystra?

**Scripture:** “Turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven,
and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein.” (Acts 14:15)

**Answer:** The message of the apostles is consistent throughout the New
Testament: salvation involves turning away from "vanities" (empty, useless
things) to the Living Creator.

1.  **The Call to Repentance:** The apostles called the people to a radical
    change of direction ("turn from"). In the context of **Righteousness by
    Faith**, repentance is not merely feeling sorry; it is turning away from
    reliance on self and idols to rely wholly on the Living God.
2.  **The First Angel's Message:** This verse parallels the final warning given
    to the world in the last days. The First Angel of Revelation 14 calls all
    distinct nations to "Worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
    and the fountains of waters" (Revelation 14:7).
3.  **The Harmony of Scripture:** From Jeremiah to Acts to Revelation, the
    command is the same: Recognize the Creator. To deny the Creation account or
    the Creator's memorial is to turn away from the very foundation of the
    Gospel.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a man is drowning, he does not need a statue of a
lifeguard; he needs a living lifeguard who can swim. Idols and false systems of
religion (salvation by works) are like statues—they look religious but cannot
save. The "Living God" is the active Rescuer who made the sea and has power over
it.

### Q4. What is the reason given in the fourth commandment for keeping the Sabbath holy?

**Scripture:** “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
that in them is, and rested the seventh day.” (Exodus 20:11)

**Answer:** The Sabbath is not an arbitrary rule; it is the seal of God's
creative authority. The Fourth Commandment provides the logical "why" for the
duty of worship.

1.  **The Memorial of Creation:** Just as we celebrate a birthday to remember
    the beginning of a life, the Sabbath is celebrated weekly to remember the
    beginning of the world. It keeps the truth of Creation fresh in the mind.
2.  **God's Rest:** God did not rest because He was tired (Isaiah 40:28). He
    "rested" (Hebrew _shabath_, meaning ceased or desisted) because His work was
    perfect and complete. He took delight in His work.
3.  **The Seal of God:** A king's seal contains three elements: His Name (The
    Lord thy God), His Title (Creator/Maker), and His Territory (Heaven and
    earth). The Fourth Commandment is the only one of the ten that contains the
    seal of the living God.

**[ILL] Illustration:** When a builder finishes a great cathedral, he places a
cornerstone or a plaque on the building with his name and the date of
completion. If you remove that plaque, you might forget who built it. The
Sabbath is the "plaque" on the cathedral of time, testifying that "God built
this."

### Q5. What is the Sabbath to those who keep it holy?

**Scripture:** “And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and
you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God.” (Ezekiel 20:20)

**Answer:** The Sabbath is a "sign." In the Bible, a sign is a mark of
identification and a token of a covenant relationship.

1.  **A Sign of Knowledge:** The text says, "that ye may know." Keeping the
    Sabbath is not a legalistic burden; it is an educational experience. By
    pausing our own works every seventh day to contemplate God's works, we grow
    in our knowledge of His character.
2.  **A Sign of Loyalty:** In a world that largely ignores the Creator or
    worships on days dedicated to tradition, keeping the seventh-day Sabbath is
    a visible sign of loyalty to the King of Heaven. It marks the believer as a
    worshiper of the true God.
3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the Ten Commandments
    were placed inside the Ark of the Covenant, in the Most Holy Place, directly
    under the Mercy Seat. This shows that the Sabbath is central to God's
    government and is covered by Christ’s mercy.

- **Definition - Covenant:** A solemn, binding agreement between God and man.
  God promises salvation and power; man responds with faith and obedience
  (Hebrews 8:10).

### Q6. How important is it that we come to know God?

**Scripture:** “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17:3)

**Answer:** Knowing God is not merely intellectual theology; it is the very
essence of salvation and eternal life.

1.  **Experiential Knowledge:** In Scripture, to "know" (Greek _ginosko_)
    implies intimate relationship and experience, not just data. We know God by
    experiencing His power to forgive, to cleanse, and to sustain us.
2.  **The Channel of Life:** We cannot have spiritual life apart from Christ (1
    John 5:12). Therefore, anything that helps us "know" God better—like the
    Sabbath—is a conduit of life.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We are saved by faith, but faith implies
    trusting a Person. You cannot trust someone you do not know. The Sabbath
    provides the necessary time to cultivate this relationship so that our faith
    may be genuine and our righteousness may be of Him, not ourselves
    (Philippians 3:9).

### Q7. Is there any danger that the people of God may forget Him?

**Scripture:** “Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping His
commandments, and His judgments, and His statutes.” (Deuteronomy 8:11)

**Answer:** Yes, there is a grave danger of spiritual amnesia, which inevitably
leads to disobedience.

1.  **Forgetting Leads to Breaking:** The text links "forgetting the Lord"
    directly with "not keeping His commandments." When we lose sight of the
    Lawgiver's majesty and love, we lose the motive to obey His law.
2.  **The Effect of Prosperity:** The context of Deuteronomy 8 warns that when
    people become wealthy and comfortable, they tend to take credit for their
    own success (Deuteronomy 8:17). They forget they are creatures dependent on
    a Creator.
3.  **The Sabbath as the Remedy:** God instituted the Sabbath to counteract this
    forgetfulness. It is a weekly "stop" sign that forces us to acknowledge that
    we did not create the world, nor do we sustain it. It calls us back to
    humility.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A man with Alzheimer's disease eventually forgets his
own family. It is a tragedy of the mind. But "spiritual Alzheimer's" is a
tragedy of the soul—we forget our Father. The Sabbath is the weekly medicine
prescribed to prevent this spiritual memory loss.

### Q8. What other reason is given for keeping the Bible Sabbath?

**Scripture:** “Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between Me
and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that
doth sanctify you.” (Exodus 31:13)

**Answer:** Here is the deepest spiritual meaning of the Sabbath: it is the sign
of **Sanctification by Faith**.

1.  **The Creator is the Sanctifier:** This verse connects creation with
    holiness. The same God who created the world (commemorated by the Sabbath)
    is the "Lord that doth sanctify you."
2.  **Works vs. Grace:** If a man could make himself holy by his own works, he
    would not need a sign of God's power. But by resting on the Sabbath, we
    acknowledge that we cannot save ourselves. We cease from our own labor and
    trust in God's work to make us holy.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith Application:** True Sabbath-keeping is the opposite
    of legalism. Legalism says, "I work to be saved." The Sabbath says, "I rest
    in God's finished work." We are as helpless to recreate our hearts as we
    were to create the universe. The Sabbath is a weekly pledge that we trust
    God to finish the work of grace in us (Philippians 1:6).

- **Definition - Sanctification:** The process by which God makes a believer
  holy, purifying their heart and character to reflect Jesus. It is the work of
  a lifetime, accomplished by the Holy Spirit dwelling within (1 Thessalonians
  5:23).

### Q9. What special reason did Israel have for keeping the Sabbath?

**Scripture:** “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and
that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a
stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath
day.” (Deuteronomy 5:15)

**Answer:** While Exodus 20 points to Creation, Deuteronomy 5 points to
**Redemption**.

1.  **Double Obligation:** Believers are obligated to God twice: first because
    He made them (Creation), and second because He bought them back
    (Redemption).
2.  **Freedom from Bondage:** In Egypt, the Israelites were slaves and likely
    forced to work seven days a week. God liberated them and gave them the
    Sabbath as a badge of their freedom. A slave has no rest; a free son of God
    has the Sabbath.
3.  **The Spiritual Application:** Egypt is a symbol of sin (Revelation 11:8).
    Pharaoh represents Satan. Every converted Christian has been "brought out"
    of the slavery of sin. Therefore, every Christian keeps the Sabbath not only
    because God made the world, but because God has saved them from the tyranny
    of sin.

### Q10. As God brought the Israelites out of bondage in Egypt, so He brings us out of the bondage of sin. Why did He bring His people out of Egypt?

**Scripture:** “He brought forth His people... and gave them the lands of the
heathen;... that they might observe His statutes, and keep His laws.” (Psalm
105:43-45)

**Answer:** This text answers the purpose of salvation. We are not saved _in_
our sins, but _from_ our sins, so that we may live a life of loving obedience.

1.  **Liberty is for Obedience:** God did not set Israel free so they could live
    lawless lives. He set them free so they could "observe His statutes." True
    liberty is not the freedom to do whatever we want (which is slavery to
    passion), but the power to do what is right.
2.  **The Law and the Gospel:** Here we see the perfect blend of Law and Gospel.
    - _The Gospel:_ God brings them out (Grace).
    - _The Law:_ That they might keep His statutes (Obedience).
    - Grace precedes obedience, but obedience is the sure result of grace.
3.  **Victory over Sin:** Through the power of the indwelling Christ, the
    believer is enabled to keep God's law. The Sabbath is the sign of this
    victory—a rest from the struggle of sin, resting in the power of the Savior.

- **Definition - Justification:** God's gracious declaration that a repentant
  sinner is righteous, based solely on the merits of Christ's sacrifice, not our
  works (Romans 3:24). This provides our "title" to heaven.

---

### Q11. What does the word "sabbath" mean?

**Answer:** The word "Sabbath" comes from the Hebrew _shabbath_, which literally
means **"Rest"** or **"Cessation."**

1.  **Ceasing from Labor:** Physically, it means stopping the ordinary toil for
    livelihood. This protects man from being consumed by materialism and work.
2.  **Spiritual Rest:** Theologically, it points to the "rest" of faith (Hebrews
    4:9-10). It is a cessation from spiritual anxiety. We stop trying to earn
    our way to heaven and rest in the perfect righteousness of Christ.
3.  **Restoration:** In the plan of God, the Sabbath is not merely idleness. It
    is active engagement with God. It is a day to be refreshed (Exodus 31:17).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A bow that is always bent will eventually lose its power
or break. It must be unstrung to retain its strength. The Sabbath is God's way
of "unstringing the bow" of human life so that we may be renewed physically,
mentally, and spiritually.

### Q12. Was it God's plan that the Seventh day Sabbath be used as a day for public worship?

**Scripture:** “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the Sabbath
of rest, an holy convocation.” (Leviticus 23:3)

**Answer:** Yes, the Sabbath is designed for corporate worship and fellowship,
not just individual relaxation.

1.  **A Holy Convocation:** The word "convocation" implies a calling together,
    an assembly. God designed that His people should gather to encourage one
    another, hear His Word, and offer united praise.
2.  **Example of Jesus and Paul:** Jesus made it His "custom" to go to the
    synagogue on the Sabbath (Luke 4:16). Paul also reasoned in the synagogue
    "every Sabbath" (Acts 18:4).
3.  **Foregleam of Heaven:** The weekly gathering of God's people on the Sabbath
    is a small picture of the great gathering in heaven, where "from one Sabbath
    to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord"
    (Isaiah 66:23).

- **Definition - Atonement:** The work of reconciling God and man. The sanctuary
  service shows how sin is transferred from the sinner to the substitute
  (sacrifice), and ultimately blotted out, restoring the universe to oneness
  with God. The Sabbath gathering celebrates this at-one-ment.
