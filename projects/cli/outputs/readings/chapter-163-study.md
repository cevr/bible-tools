### Q1. Who is exalted above all that exists?

"For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth; thou art exalted far above all gods." Ps. 97:9.
"Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth." Ps. 57:5.

**Answer:**

The Scriptures declare unequivocally that Jehovah, the self-existent God, occupies the position of supreme authority and honor. He is not merely "higher" in a physical sense, but He is transcendent in character, power, and holiness. In the great controversy between good and evil, the central issue is sovereignty—who is the rightful Ruler of the universe?

1.  **Supreme Authority:** God is the "Most High." While there are powerful beings (angels) and earthly rulers ("gods" in a lower sense), none compare to the Infinite One.
2.  **Universal Glory:** His glory is not confined to a temple made with hands; it fills the heavens and the earth.
3.  **The Nature of True Exaltation:** God’s exaltation is not born of pride, for God is love (1 John 4:8). He is exalted because He *is* goodness, truth, and life itself. To acknowledge His highness is simply to acknowledge reality.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Sovereignty:** The supreme power and authority of God to rule over His creation (1 Chronicles 29:11–12).

[ILL] **The Sun and the Candle:**
Imagine a small candle claiming it is the brightest light in the universe. When the sun rises at dawn, the candle’s flame becomes invisible in the brilliance of the day. So it is with all created beings—human or angelic—when compared to the Creator. We are but flickering lights; He is the source of all light. To exalt Him is to recognize the Sun.

### Q2. Why should God be thus exalted?

"Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshipeth thee." Neh. 9:6.

**Answer:**

God’s right to rule and be worshipped is founded upon two great pillars: **Creation** and **Preservation**.

1.  **Creator Rights:** Because He made us, we belong to Him (Psalm 100:3). He designed the laws of our being; therefore, only He knows how we can function best.
2.  **Sustainer of Life:** The text says He "preservest them all." We do not have life inherent in ourselves; we borrow breath from Him moment by moment. If He withdrew His Spirit, all flesh would perish together (Job 34:14–15).
3.  **The Response of the Host:** The angels ("host of heaven"), who see His character most clearly, respond not with fear, but with worship. They see that His infinite power is matched by infinite love.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
Because God is the Creator, He is the only One capable of *re-creation*. The gospel is the power of God to create a clean heart in a sinner (Psalm 51:10; 2 Corinthians 5:17). We exalt Him when we stop trying to "fix" our own sinful natures and allow the Creator to do His work of sanctification in us.

[ILL] **The Author and the Character:**
A character in a book cannot claim to have written the story. The character owes its very existence, its name, and its description to the author. For the character to rebel and say, "I made myself," is absurdity. We are the characters; God is the Author of life.

### Q3. How high is Christ exalted?

"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour." Acts 5:30, 31.

**Answer:**

The exaltation of Christ is the turning point of history. After the depths of His humiliation at the cross, the Father has raised Him to the highest position in the universe.

1.  **From the Cross to the Throne:** The world gave Christ a cross of shame; the Father gave Him a throne of glory. He is now at the "right hand" of power.
2.  **Two Titles:**
    *   **Prince (Ruler):** He has the authority to command our allegiance.
    *   **Saviour (Deliverer):** He uses His authority to rescue us from sin.
3.  **The Purpose of Exaltation:** Notice the verse continues (in v. 31) to say He is exalted *to give* repentance and forgiveness. He is not exalted to crush sinners, but to minister to them as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.

**Sanctuary Connection:**
In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest bore the names of Israel on his breastplate. Today, Jesus is exalted in the true Heavenly Sanctuary. He uses His high position to plead the merits of His blood for every repentant soul (Hebrews 7:25). His exaltation is our assurance of acceptance.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation by which God and man are brought back into oneness through Christ’s sacrifice and priestly ministry (Romans 5:11).

[ILL] **The Lifeguard on the Tower:**
A lifeguard sits on a high tower not to look down on people with arrogance, but to have the best vantage point to see who is drowning and to save them. Christ is raised high so that He might be a "Prince and a Saviour" to all who call upon Him.

### Q4. Who will be exalted by God?

"He that shall humble himself shall be exalted." Matt. 23:12.

**Answer:**

This is the fundamental paradox of the Kingdom of Heaven: the way up is down.

1.  **The Law of the Kingdom:** In worldly kingdoms, men scramble over one another to reach the top. In Christ’s kingdom, greatness is measured by service and self-abnegation (Mark 10:43–44).
2.  **The Pattern of Christ:** We are called to have the "mind of Christ," who humbled Himself to the point of death, and *therefore* God highly exalted Him (Philippians 2:5–9).
3.  **Divine Passive:** The verse says he "shall be exalted." We do not exalt ourselves; God does it in His time and way.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
The first step in receiving Christ’s righteousness is acknowledging that we have none of our own. As long as we are "rich and increased with goods" (Revelation 3:17) in our own eyes, God can do nothing for us. Justification is only for the one who humbles himself to admit he is a sinner in need of a Saviour (Luke 18:13–14).

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Justification:** God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is accounted righteous because of Christ’s merits, not their own works (Romans 3:24).

[ILL] **The Empty Cup:**
You cannot fill a cup that is already full. If a man is full of pride and self-sufficiency, the water of life cannot enter. He must first be emptied—humbled—before he can be filled with the Spirit of God.

---

### Q5. What, then, must precede exaltation?

"Before honor is humility." Prov. 15:33.

**Answer:**

Humility is not merely a suggestion; it is a prerequisite. God cannot entrust spiritual power or eternal honor to a proud heart, for pride turns a blessing into a curse (as seen in the fall of Lucifer).

1.  **Preparation for Service:** Moses spent 40 years in the desert learning humility before he could lead Israel. God must break our self-confidence so we learn to lean on His omnipotence.
2.  **The Fear of the Lord:** The first part of Proverbs 15:33 says, "The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom." True humility comes from seeing the greatness of God. When we see Him as He is (Isaiah 6:1–5), we see ourselves as we are, and humility is the natural result.

[ILL] **The Foundation:**
In constructing a skyscraper, the builders must first dig deep into the earth. The higher the building is to rise, the deeper the foundation must be laid. Humility is the digging process—painful and lowly—but necessary to support the weight of glory God wishes to bestow.

---

### Q6. What is the foundation of true humility?

"Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up." 1 Cor. 13:4.

**Answer:**

True humility is not self-hatred; it is self-forgetfulness born of love (Charity).

1.  **The Nature of Love:** Divine love (*agape*) looks outward to the needs of others and the glory of God. Pride looks inward at self.
2.  **Not "Puffed Up":** Pride is essentially being filled with "wind"—empty conceit. Love is solid and substantial. It does not need to brag ("vaunteth not") because it finds its satisfaction in blessing others.
3.  **The Cure for Pride:** The only way to permanently kill pride is to be filled with the love of Christ. When we love Him supremely, self dies.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit by which the believer is made holy in character, learning to love as Christ loves (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

---

### Q7. What is necessary, therefore, in order that we may obtain exaltation?

"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 18:4.

**Answer:**

Jesus points to a little child as the model for the Christian believer.

1.  **Teachability:** A child acknowledges their ignorance and is willing to be taught. The proud man thinks he already knows.
2.  **Dependence:** A child trusts their parents for food, shelter, and protection. The believer must live in moment-by-moment dependence on the Father.
3.  **Simplicity:** A child is without guile or political maneuvering. They are transparent.

**Practical Application:**
To "humble himself as a little child" means to accept God’s Word just as it reads, to obey without debating, and to trust God’s promises even when the path is dark. It is the death of intellectual pride.

[ILL] **The Father's Hand:**
When crossing a busy, dangerous street, a child does not rely on his own speed or wisdom. He grips his father's hand tightly. The "greatest" Christian is not the one who works the hardest, but the one who grips Christ’s hand the tightest.

---

### Q8. In what only should we desire to be exalted?

"For thou [Lord] art the glory of their strength: and in thy favor our horn shall be exalted." Ps. 89:17.

**Answer:**

Our exaltation must never be separate from God. It is found only *in* Him.

1.  **"The Glory of Their Strength":** The believer does not say, "I am strong." He says, "The Lord is my strength." (Psalm 27:1).
2.  **The Horn:** In the Bible, a "horn" symbolizes power and victory. Our horn is exalted only "in Thy favor" (or righteousness).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We have no righteousness of our own to present. We are accepted only in the Beloved (Ephesians 1:6). Our standing before God is based entirely on Christ’s merits imputed to us.

*   **Definition:**
    *   **Imputed Righteousness:** The credit of Christ’s perfect life given to the believer, granting them a title to heaven (Romans 4:22–24).

### Q9. What means does God sometimes employ to keep us from self exaltation?

"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure." 2 Cor. 12:7.

**Answer:**

God loves us too much to allow us to be destroyed by pride. Sometimes, He permits affliction to keep us safe.

1.  **The Danger of Privilege:** Paul had received incredible visions ("abundance of revelations"). Spiritual privilege brings a high risk of spiritual pride.
2.  **The "Thorn":** We do not know exactly what Paul’s thorn was (likely a physical ailment, perhaps poor eyesight), but it was painful and humiliating.
3.  **God’s Purpose:** God did not send the messenger of Satan, but He *permitted* it for a redemptive purpose: to keep Paul dependent. Paul learned that "My grace is sufficient for thee" (2 Cor 12:9). Weakness became his safety.

[ILL] **Ballast in the Ship:**
A ship carrying a great height of sails must also carry heavy ballast (weights) deep in its hull. Without the ballast, the ship would capsize in the wind. Our trials and "thorns" are the ballast that keeps us upright when the winds of success or popularity blow.

### Q10. By what means may self exaltation be overcome?

"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." 2 Cor. 10:4, 5.

**Answer:**

The battle against pride is fought in the mind ("imaginations," "thoughts").

1.  **Not Carnal Weapons:** Willpower alone, psychology, or self-punishment cannot destroy pride. We need spiritual weapons.
2.  **Pulling Down Strongholds:** Pride is a fortress built in the mind. It argues against God’s law and God’s character.
3.  **Captive Thoughts:** Victory over sin is possible. We are called to bring *every* thought into obedience to Christ. This is the essence of the sanctified life—a mind constantly surrendered to the control of the Holy Spirit.

**How to do this:**
When a proud or sinful thought arises, we must instantly take it to Christ in prayer: "Lord, take this thought. I cannot handle it. Replace it with Thy Spirit." This is fighting with spiritual weapons.

---

### Q11. What are these weapons of our warfare?

The girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the sandals of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the sword of the Spirit. Eph. 6:13-17.

**Answer:**

Paul lists the panoply of heaven. Notice that every piece represents Christ and His work, not our own abilities.

1.  **Truth:** Not just doctrine, but sincerity of heart.
2.  **Breastplate of Righteousness:** This protects the vital organs (the heart). It is the righteousness of Christ covering the believer.
3.  **Shield of Faith:** Trust in God’s promises extinguishes the "fiery darts" of doubt and temptation.
4.  **Sword of the Spirit (The Word):** This is the only offensive weapon. Jesus used it in the wilderness: "It is written" (Matthew 4:4).

**Sanctuary Connection:**
Just as the priest in the sanctuary had special garments for ministry, the believer is clothed in Christ. We eat the bread (Word/Sword) and walk in the light (Truth). These weapons are effective because they connect us to the Power Source in the heavenly sanctuary.

### Q12. What caused Satan's fall, and brought into existence all the sin and evil which are in the world?

"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High." Isa. 14:12-14.

**Answer:**

The origin of sin is the "mystery of iniquity" (2 Thess 2:7), but its root is clearly identified as self-exaltation.

1.  **The Five "I Wills":** Lucifer’s fall began with "I." He focused on himself rather than God.
2.  **Coveting God’s Place:** He was not content with being the highest created angel; he wanted to be "like the Most High"—not in character (love), but in position and power.
3.  **The Great Controversy:** This act of pride introduced rebellion into the universe. All sin today—selfishness, hatred, disobedience—stems from this original seed of self-exaltation. To exalt self is to join the rebellion; to humble self is to join Christ.

[ILL] **The Planet and the Sun:**
Lucifer was like a glorious planet reflecting the light of God. But the planet desired to become a sun—to generate its own light and have others orbit around it. In trying to become a sun, he became a wandering star, reserved for darkness (Jude 13).

---

### Q13. What is the most striking example of self exaltation found in the annals of history?

"Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.

**NOTE:** Satan exalted himself above the stars of God, i.e., the angels, and wanted to be equal with Christ; but the "man of sin," the papacy, has gone beyond this, and exalted himself even above the God of the universe by presuming to change His eternal and immutable law. Dan. 7:25.

**Answer:**

Prophecy identifies a power arising in history that manifests the very spirit of Lucifer.

1.  **The Man of Sin:** This is not just one individual, but a system (the "mystery of iniquity") that operates within the church ("temple of God"). Historicist Bible students have long identified this with the Papal system, which claims the prerogatives of God on earth.
2.  **Exaltation above God:** How can a power exalt itself *above* God? By claiming the authority to alter God's law.
    *   God says: "The seventh day is the Sabbath."
    *   This power says: "We substitute the first day."
    *   To change a law requires authority equal to or greater than the lawgiver. By attempting to change the Ten Commandments (Daniel 7:25), this power claims authority superior to the Creator.
3.  **The Contrast:** Christ, the true Vicar of God, came to *magnify* the law (Isaiah 42:21). The antichrist power comes to *change* it.

---

### Q14. What will be the end of self exaltation?

"Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased." Matt. 23:12.
"For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon everyone that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low." Isa. 2:12.

**Answer:**

The final judgment will rectify the universe. All false hierarchies will be leveled.

1.  **Universal Abasement:** In the light of the Second Coming, human pride, titles, wealth, and power will mean nothing. Men will hide in the rocks from the glory of the Lord (Isaiah 2:19).
2.  **The End of Sin:** Since sin originated in pride, the eradication of sin requires the total abasement of pride.
3.  **The Warning:** We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement. Now is the time to afflict our souls (humble ourselves) so that our sins may be blotted out (Leviticus 23:27–29). Those who hold onto pride cannot pass the scrutiny of the Judgment.

[ILL] **The Mountain and the Valley:**
Prophecy describes the preparation for the Lord's coming: "Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low" (Luke 3:5). The mountains represent the proud powers of earth; the valleys represent the humble. God's bulldozer is coming to level the ground.

---

### Q15. When will the humble be exalted?

"Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it." Ps. 37:34.

**Answer:**

The exaltation of the saints is future, certain, and permanent.

1.  **"Wait on the Lord":** We are not to seek exaltation now. Now is the time for service, cross-bearing, and patience.
2.  **Inherit the Land:** "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth" (Matthew 5:5). The New Earth is the reward for those who refused to fight for position in this old earth.
3.  **Final Victory:** When sin is destroyed ("wicked cut off"), God will lift up His people. They will be kings and priests unto God (Revelation 1:6), not because of their ambition, but because of His grace.

**Conclusion:**
The path to the throne passes through the valley of humility. Let us look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith, who "endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God" (Hebrews 12:2).
