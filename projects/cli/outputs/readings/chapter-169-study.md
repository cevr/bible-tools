### Q1. What is the first commandment which contains a promise?

"Honor thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise." Ephesians 6:2.

**Answer:**

The Apostle Paul here refers directly to the **Decalogue** (the Ten Commandments) given by God on Mount Sinai, specifically the fifth commandment. This verse teaches us several important truths about God’s law and His character:

*   **The Law is Still Binding:** By quoting the commandment in the New Testament, Paul confirms that the moral law was not abolished at the cross but remains the standard of Christian living (Romans 3:31).
*   **A Commandment of Relationship:** The first four commandments deal with our love for God; the last six deal with our love for our neighbor. The command to honor parents is the "hinge" between the two. It is the first commandment regarding human relationships.
*   **God is a Rewarder:** God does not merely issue orders as a tyrant. He is a loving Father who attaches blessings to obedience. He wants us to see that His law is designed for our happiness and well-being (Deuteronomy 10:13).

When a child learns to respect the authority of their parents, they are learning the first lesson in respecting the authority of God. This prepares the heart for **Sanctification**—the process by which the Holy Spirit helps us grow in holiness and obedience (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]** Think of a road sign that says, "Speed Limit 50." That is a law. Now imagine a sign that says, "Stay on this path to find buried treasure." That is a command with a promise. The Ten Commandments are not just rules to stop us from having fun; they are a map leading us to the treasure of a happy, peaceful life.

### Q2. What is the promise connected with that commandment?

"Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee." Exodus 20:12.

**Answer:**

The promise attached to the fifth commandment is twofold, applying both to this life and the life to come:

1.  **Temporal Blessing:** In the immediate context of Israel, this promised a stable, long life in the land of Canaan. In a general sense, children who respect their parents tend to avoid the reckless, rebellious behaviors that often shorten life (Proverbs 4:10).
2.  **Spiritual Inheritance:** In the plan of salvation, the "land" God gives us ultimately points to the **New Earth**. Those who learn obedience and respect in the home are developing the character necessary to live in God's eternal kingdom.

This commandment highlights the principle of **Righteousness by Faith**. We cannot manufacture a heart that truly honors others on our own; our natural heart is selfish. We need Jesus to write this law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). When we submit to Christ, He gives us His spirit of humility and love, enabling us to honor our parents and authorities genuinely.

**[ILL]** A great tree stands strong against the wind because it has deep roots. If you cut the roots, the tree falls and dies quickly. Honoring father and mother is like watering the roots of your life. It anchors you in wisdom and stability, allowing you to grow tall and live long.

### Q3. What promise is made to children if they will hearken to the Lord?

"Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord." Psalm 34:11.

**Answer:**

Here, the Lord acts as a tender Shepherd and Teacher. The word "hearken" means more than just to hear a sound; it means to listen with the intention of obeying.

*   **The Invitation:** God says, "Come." He does not drive us away because of our ignorance or youth; He invites us close. This is the essence of the **Gospel**—God calling sinners to Himself (Matthew 11:28).
*   **The Subject:** He promises to teach us "the fear of the Lord." This is the most important subject in the universe, for it is the foundation of all true knowledge.
*   **The Teacher:** God Himself, through His Word and His Spirit, undertakes the education of the willing child. We do not have to figure out righteousness on our own.

**Definition:**
*   **Gospel:** The "Good News" that Jesus has died for our sins, risen for our justification, and now lives to make us holy and restore us to God (1 Corinthians 15:1–4).

**[ILL]** Imagine a master musician offering to give free lessons to a child who wants to learn the violin. The child does not need to know how to play yet; they only need to be willing to listen and follow the master’s instructions. God is the Master Musician of life, and He offers to teach us the melody of heaven.

### Q4. What is the fear of the Lord?

"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments." Psalm 111:10.

**Answer:**

Many misunderstand the "fear of the Lord" as being terrified of God, like being afraid of a monster. However, Scripture defines it differently:

1.  **Reverential Awe:** It is a deep, holy respect for God’s authority, power, and love. It is the attitude of a created being recognizing their Creator (Revelation 14:7).
2.  **Hatred of Evil:** "The fear of the Lord is to hate evil" (Proverbs 8:13). When we truly know God, we love what He loves and turn away from sin.
3.  **Practical Obedience:** The text says, "A good understanding have all they that **do** His commandments." Wisdom is not just knowing facts; it is living in harmony with God's law.

This connects directly to **Righteousness by Faith**. True faith always leads to obedience. If we say we have faith but refuse to keep God's commandments, we do not truly have the "fear of the Lord" or biblical wisdom (James 2:17–20). The Holy Spirit gives us the power to obey, making the "fear of the Lord" a joy, not a burden.

**[ILL]** A child does not play with fire. Is it because they hate the fire? No, they may enjoy its warmth. They respect the fire because they know its power can burn them. Similarly, the "fear of the Lord" means we respect God’s law because we know that sin (breaking the law) burns and destroys, while obedience brings safety and warmth.

### Q5. How is a wise child, even though poor, regarded by the Lord?

"Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished." Ecclesiastes 4:13.

**Answer:**

Heaven measures worth differently than earth does.
*   **The World's View:** The world values position ("king"), age ("old"), and wealth.
*   **God's View:** God values a teachable spirit ("wise child").

The key phrase here is "who will no more be admonished." The king is foolish because he has become proud and refuses to listen to correction. The child is "better" because the child is humble and willing to learn.

This illustrates the condition necessary for salvation. We must be willing to be admonished (corrected) by the Holy Spirit.
*   **Justification** (being declared righteous) is only possible for those who admit they are sinners and need a Savior (Luke 18:13–14).
*   The "foolish king" represents those who trust in their own righteousness and refuse the robe of Christ’s righteousness.

**[ILL]** Imagine two cups. One is a golden goblet, very expensive, but it is sealed shut with a lid that cannot be removed. The other is a simple clay cup, but it is open and clean. Which one can the thirsty man use? Only the open one. God can use a poor, teachable child, but He can do nothing with a proud, stubborn heart, even if it belongs to a king.

### Q6. What tender words did the Saviour speak in behalf of children?

"Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto Me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven." Matthew 19:14.

**Answer:**

The disciples thought the Master was too busy or too important to be bothered with children. Jesus rebuked this attitude.

*   **"Suffer them":** This is old English for "Allow them" or "Let them come."
*   **"Of such is the kingdom":** Jesus teaches that the Kingdom of Heaven is made up of those who possess childlike traits: simplicity, trust, dependence, and humility.

We are saved by **Grace through Faith** (Ephesians 2:8). A child trusts their parents completely for food, shelter, and protection. They do not worry about "earning" their dinner; they receive it as a gift. In the same way, we must come to Jesus, trusting completely in His merit, not our own works, for salvation. This is the heart of the Adventist understanding of the Gospel: we are helpless without Him, but safe in His care.

**[ILL]** If you hold out your hand to a toddler, they will instinctively reach up and grab it, trusting you to lead them. They don't ask for a map or a contract. To enter the Kingdom of Heaven, we must take Jesus’ hand with that same instant, questioning-nothing trust.

***

### Q7. What did He do to the children to show that He loved them?

"And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them." Mark 10:16.

**Answer:**

Jesus did not merely speak kind words from a distance; He became personally involved.
*   **"Took them up in His arms":** This shows His power to support and carry us.
*   **"Put His hands upon them":** This signifies the imparting of His Spirit and life.
*   **"Blessed them":** As our High Priest, He pronounces a blessing upon us that the world cannot take away.

This action foreshadows Christ's work in the **Heavenly Sanctuary**. Just as He blessed the children on earth, He now ministers in the presence of God for us (Hebrews 7:25). He takes our prayers, covers our imperfections with His righteousness, and sends down the blessing of the Holy Spirit.

**[ILL]** When a shepherd finds a lamb that is tired or has wandered, he does not shout at it to walk faster. He picks it up and carries it on his shoulders (Isaiah 40:11). Jesus carries His children—young and old—through the trials of this life.

***

### Q8. How may all receive the Lord's blessing now?

"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive." Matthew 21:22.

**Answer:**

The channel through which we receive Christ's blessing is prayer, and the hand that grasps the blessing is faith ("believing").

1.  **The Condition:** "Believing." Faith is not just an intellectual agreement; it is taking God at His word. It is claiming His promises as present realities.
2.  **The Scope:** "All things." This refers to everything necessary for our spiritual life and salvation. We may confidently ask for pardon, for the Holy Spirit, and for victory over sin (1 John 5:14–15).
3.  **The Assurance:** "Ye shall receive." God’s throne is a throne of grace, not reluctance.

**Definition:**
*   **Faith:** Trusting God enough to act on what He says, even when we cannot see the outcome. "Faith is the substance of things hoped for" (Hebrews 11:1).

**[ILL]** Imagine you have a check (cheque) signed by the wealthiest person in the world. The money is yours, but it does you no good if you keep it in your pocket. You must go to the bank and present it. God’s promises are the checks; prayer is presenting them to the bank of Heaven; faith is the confidence that the funds will be released.

### Q9. If children do this, and as they grow older, keep all of God's commandments, what is promised?

"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." Revelation 22:14.

**Answer:**

This is the final promise of the Bible, pointing us to the Holy City, the New Jerusalem.

*   **"Blessed are they that do...":** Salvation is by grace, but the *evidence* of salvation is a transformed life that obeys God. We do not obey *to get* saved; we obey because we *are* saved and love our Redeemer (John 14:15).
*   **"Right to the tree of life":** Adam and Eve lost access to this tree because of disobedience (sin). Through the Second Adam (Jesus), the right to the tree is restored. This signifies the gift of immortality.
*   **"Enter in through the gates":** This implies citizenship. Only those whose characters are in harmony with the Law of that city—the Ten Commandments—can live there happily.

**The Great Controversy** ends here. Sin is gone. The law of God is written on the hearts of His people, and they live in His presence forever. This is the goal of the Sanctuary message: the complete cleansing of the universe and the restoration of man to God's image.

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification (Imparted Righteousness):** The work of God within us, changing our hearts so that we actually become like Jesus in character, enabling us to "do His commandments" naturally and joyfully.

**[ILL]** A passport gives a traveler the right to enter a country. A counterfeit passport will be rejected at the border. Our "passport" to heaven is the righteousness of Christ—both His title (Justification) which clears our record, and His fitness (Sanctification) which changes our character. When we possess Him, we have the right to enter the City.
