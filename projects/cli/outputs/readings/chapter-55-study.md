### Q1. What was shown upon the opening of the first seal?
“And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals,... a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer." (Revelation 6:1, 2)

**Answer:**

The opening of the first seal reveals the spiritual condition of the Christian church during the apostolic age (the first century). This symbol establishes the standard against which all subsequent history is measured.

1.  **The Symbol of the White Horse:**
    *   **Purity of Doctrine:** In the Bible, white represents purity and righteousness (Isaiah 1:18; Revelation 19:8). This horse represents the church in its pristine purity, freshly commissioned by Christ, carrying the unadulterated "gospel of the kingdom" (Matthew 24:14).
    *   **Righteousness by Faith:** The riders of this era preached that salvation is found in Christ alone. They did not rely on Jewish ceremonial laws or pagan philosophy, but on "Christ our righteousness" (Jeremiah 23:6). The message was clear: justification is a free gift of grace received by faith (Romans 3:24–25).

2.  **Conquering and to Conquer:**
    *   **The Power of the Word:** The rider holds a bow, a weapon of warfare, but his warfare is spiritual. The early church, empowered by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, went forth with irresistible power. In a single generation, the gospel was preached to the then-known world (Colossians 1:23).
    *   **The Crown (Stephanos):** The rider is given a crown of victory. Despite persecution, the early church was triumphant because it held fast to the Head, which is Christ.

3.  **Sanctuary Connection:**
    *   This period corresponds to the lighting of the lamps in the Holy Place. The light of the gospel shone brightly, illuminating a darkened world with the truth of Christ’s high priestly ministry.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a clear, mountain spring bursting forth from the rock. The water is crystal clear, life-giving, and powerful as it rushes down the mountain. This is the church of the first century—pure water of life flowing from the Rock of Ages. As the stream (history) continues, we will see pollutants (errors) entering the water, but here at the source, it is pure.

### Q2. What went out upon the opening of the second seal?
“And when he had opened the second seal,... there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword." (Revelation 6:3, 4)

**Answer:**

As we move into the second period (roughly A.D. 100 to 313), the color changes from white to red. This signifies a corruption of the faith and the entrance of serious error.

1.  **The Red Horse – Corruption and Bloodshed:**
    *   **Loss of Purity:** Red is the color of sin (Isaiah 1:18) and blood. The church began to compromise with the pagan world to avoid persecution and gain popularity. The mystery of iniquity was already at work (2 Thessalonians 2:7).
    *   **Internal Strife:** The text says peace was taken from the earth. When the church loses the "peace of God" which comes from resting solely in Christ’s righteousness, it often turns to political power and internal fighting. Theologians began debating philosophy rather than preaching the simple gospel.

2.  **The Great Sword:**
    *   **Persecution:** This period covers severe persecutions under the Roman Caesars (such as Diocletian). However, the "sword" also suggests the church beginning to wield secular power or desire the sword of the state to enforce its decrees, a fatal error that would grow in the subsequent seals.

3.  **A Warning on Righteousness by Faith:**
    *   **Sanctification:** *Sanctification* is the process of being made holy by the indwelling Spirit (1 Peter 1:2). When the church stopped teaching that the Spirit empowers us to live obediently, and instead began adopting worldly customs, the "red" of sin began to stain her garments. We cannot conquer sin while holding hands with the world (James 4:4).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you mix a few drops of red dye into a glass of pure water, the water is no longer clear. It may still look like water, but its nature has changed. The "Red Horse" era represents the church allowing the "dye" of worldly ambition and pagan philosophy to tint the pure water of the gospel.

### Q3. What was the color of the symbol under the third seal?
“And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo, a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand." (Revelation 6:5)

**Answer:**

The third seal covers the period from the time of Constantine (approx. A.D. 313) to the rise of the Papacy in A.D. 538. The contrast is stark: from white (purity) to black (darkness).

1.  **The Black Horse – Spiritual Darkness:**
    *   **Truth Obscured:** Black represents the absence of light. During this time, the Bible was moved to the background, and human tradition took the lead. The "falling away" predicted by Paul was fully underway (2 Thessalonians 2:3).
    *   **Absorption of Paganism:** The church adopted pagan festivals, image worship, and philosophy to make Christianity more palatable to the heathen.

2.  **The Pair of Balances:**
    *   **Commercialism in Religion:** Balances are used for weighing and commerce. This represents the church beginning to treat salvation as a transaction. Righteousness was no longer viewed as a free gift from Christ (Romans 6:23), but something to be weighed out based on human works and penance.
    *   **Legalism vs. Grace:** This is the antithesis of Righteousness by Faith. The "balances" suggest the terrible error that we can offer God our own merits to outweigh our sins. The Bible teaches that our best works are "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6) and only the weight of Christ’s merit can save us.

3.  **The Warning:**
    *   **Definition:** *Apostasy* is a deliberate turning away from the truth. This seal warns us that when we replace the Bible with human logic, spiritual darkness is the inevitable result.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a marketplace where a merchant sells bread. He uses scales to weigh the money against the goods. The church during this era turned the House of God into a marketplace, trying to "sell" the grace of God in exchange for penance, pilgrimage, and money, rather than pointing sinners to the free gift at the Cross.

### Q4. What change was seen in the symbol of the fourth seal?
“And when he had opened the fourth seal,... behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth." (Revelation 6:7, 8)

**Answer:**

This seal represents the long period of the Dark Ages (A.D. 538 to the Reformation), where the Papal power exercised supreme authority. The color is "pale"—the color of a corpse or a dying plant.

1.  **The Pale Horse – Spiritual Death:**
    *   **The Absence of the Gospel:** The "pale" color indicates that the spiritual life of the church had been nearly extinguished. The Bible was chained in monasteries and forbidden to the common people. Without the "bread of life" (John 6:35), the people spiritually starved.
    *   **Syncretism:** The religion of this era was a sickly blend of Christianity, paganism, and Judaism.

2.  **Death and Hell (The Grave):**
    *   **Persecution:** This period saw the Inquisition and the martyrdom of millions who refused to bow to church dogma. "Hell" here is the Greek word *Hades*, meaning the grave. The apostate church became a persecuting power, believing it was doing God service by killing His true children (John 16:2).
    *   **The "Daily" Taken Away:** In the language of Daniel 8, the "daily" (Christ's high priestly ministry in heaven) was obscured by an earthly priesthood. Men were taught to look to earthly priests for forgiveness rather than to Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary (1 Timothy 2:5).

3.  **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
    *   When a system teaches that you must punish your body, pay money, or pray to saints to be saved, it is a system of spiritual death. Life only comes from union with Christ. "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life" (1 John 5:12).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A plant that is shut up in a dark cellar turns pale and yellowish; it has no chlorophyll, no life-vigor. During the Dark Ages, the "Sun of Righteousness" was shut out from the people by a ceiling of human tradition, and the church turned into a pale, dying plant.

### Q5. On the opening of the fifth seal, what was seen under the altar?
“And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held." (Revelation 6:9)

**Answer:**

The fifth seal brings us to the time of the Reformation (starting around the 1500s). The darkness is breaking, and the focus shifts to the cost of faithfulness.

1.  **Under the Altar:**
    *   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the earthly sanctuary, the blood of the sacrifice was poured at the base of the altar of burnt offering (Leviticus 4:7). The martyrs are represented here symbolically; their lives (blood) were poured out as an offering to God for the sake of the truth.
    *   **Symbolic Language:** This is not teaching that disembodied souls are conscious under a physical altar in heaven. It is a figure of speech, similar to God telling Cain, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground" (Genesis 4:10).

2.  **Slain for the Word:**
    *   These faithful ones died because they valued the "Word of God" above the traditions of men. They possessed the "testimony" of Jesus.
    *   **Definition:** *The State of the Dead.* The Bible teaches that the dead "know not any thing" (Ecclesiastes 9:5) and sleep until the resurrection. This passage is a dramatic representation of justice demanding vindication for God's slaughtered saints.

**[ILL] Illustration:** In a court of law, evidence "speaks." We say, "The facts cry out for justice." The blood of the martyrs is the evidence of the cruelty of the apostate power, and in this seal, that evidence is brought before God's throne during the Reformation era as the Bible is reopened.

---

### Q6. What were these martyrs represented as doing?
“And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" (Revelation 6:10)

**Answer:**

This cry, "How long?" has been the plea of God's suffering people throughout the ages.

1.  **The Cry for Justice:**
    *   God is a God of justice. He does not ignore the suffering of His people. This cry marks the beginning of the time when God begins to examine the books—a prelude to the Investigative Judgment.
    *   **Vindication of Character:** The martyrs were killed as "heretics" and criminals. They are asking for God to vindicate their names and show that they were actually the true believers.

2.  **The "Earth Dwellers":**
    *   In Revelation, "them that dwell on the earth" usually refers to those who have set their affections on this world and oppose God's truth. The martyrs' cry is a call for God to end the reign of sin and establish His kingdom of righteousness.

---

### Q7. What was done for these martyrs because they thus cried?
“And white robes were given unto everyone of them; and it was said unto them, That they Should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled." (Revelation 6:11)

**Answer:**

This is a beautiful assurance of salvation and vindication.

1.  **White Robes Given:**
    *   **Christ's Righteousness:** The white robe represents the imputed righteousness of Christ (Zechariah 3:3–5; Revelation 19:8). Although the world called them heretics and stripped them of their earthly dignity, God declares them righteous.
    *   **Definition:** *Justification.* This is God's legal declaration that the believer is righteous because of Jesus. The martyrs are declared saved and secure.

2.  **Rest for a Little Season:**
    *   They are to continue to "rest" (sleep in the grave) a little longer. This confirms they are not currently in heaven, for if they were in heaven enjoying bliss, they would not be crying out for vengeance. They wait for the "better thing"—the resurrection at the last day (Hebrews 11:39–40).

3.  **The "Fellow Servants":**
    *   Persecution was not over. There would be others (perhaps referring to the final persecution under the Mark of the Beast) who would also stand faithful unto death. God waits until the number of His elect is complete.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A soldier dishonorably discharged for disobeying an unjust order is stripped of his rank. Years later, the King reviews the case, declares the soldier a hero, and awards him a medal of honor. The soldier may have died in disgrace, but the King’s record (the white robe) clears his name for all history.

### Q8. What was first seen on the opening of the sixth seal?
“And I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake." (Revelation 6:12)

**Answer:**

The sixth seal introduces the physical signs that herald the end of the age. These are historical markers pointing to the proximity of the Second Coming.

1.  **The Great Earthquake (Lisbon, 1755):**
    *   **Historical Fulfillment:** On November 1, 1755, one of the most extensive earthquakes in recorded history centered on Lisbon, Portugal. Its effects were felt over 4 million square miles, including Europe, Africa, and America.
    *   **Prophetic Significance:** Jesus predicted "earthquakes in divers places" as the "beginning of sorrows" (Matthew 24:7–8). This event shook the complacency of the world and sparked a renewed interest in the study of prophecy and the end times.

2.  **God's Alarm Clock:**
    *   Just as the Reformation (Fifth Seal) restored the Bible, the Sixth Seal events are designed to wake the world to the reality that this earth is not permanent. It calls men to prepare to meet their God (Amos 4:12).

---

### Q9. What was to follow the great earthquake?
“And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood." (Revelation 6:12)

**Answer:**

Following the earthquake, the prophecy points to signs in the heavens.

1.  **The Dark Day (May 19, 1780):**
    *   **Historical Fulfillment:** Twenty-five years after the earthquake, an inexplicable darkness covered large parts of New England. It was so dark at noon that candles had to be lit, and animals went to roost. The following night, the moon appeared red as blood.
    *   **Biblical Confirmation:** This fulfills Joel 2:31: "The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come."

2.  **Significance:**
    *   These signs occurred exactly in the timeframe predicted—after the severe persecution of the "1260 years" (which ended in 1798) had been cut short (Matthew 24:29). They served as a solemn announcement that the "time of the end" had arrived.

**[ILL] Illustration:** When a theater play is about to end, the house lights often flicker or dim to warn the audience that the finale is approaching. The Dark Day was nature's "dimming of the lights," warning the world that the drama of human history is nearing its close.

### Q10. What was the next event under this seal?
“And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind." (Revelation 6:13)

**Answer:**

The sequence continues with the third great sign.

1.  **The Falling of the Stars (November 13, 1833):**
    *   **Historical Fulfillment:** This refers to the Great Meteoric Shower of 1833, the most extensive and spectacular display of falling stars ever recorded. It was seen across the entire North American continent.
    *   **Context:** This event occurred right as the Great Advent Awakening was beginning. It gave a mighty impetus to the preaching of William Miller and others who were proclaiming that "the hour of His judgment is come" (Revelation 14:7).

2.  **The Fig Tree Analogy:**
    *   Jesus used the fig tree to teach a lesson about readiness: "When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye... know that it is near, even at the doors" (Matthew 24:32–33).

---

### Q11. What was to follow the sign of falling stars?
“And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together: and every mountain and island were moved out of their places." (Revelation 6:14)

**Answer:**

We now stand between the falling of the stars (1833) and this next event. This verse describes the actual Second Coming of Christ.

1.  **The Receding Heavens:**
    *   The atmosphere will part to reveal the King of Kings descending. This is the "shaking" not just of earth, but of heaven (Hebrews 12:26).
    *   **The Great Displacement:** Every mountain and island moving indicates a global cataclysm that reshapes the surface of the earth at the voice of God.

2.  **The Reaction of the Lost:**
    *   Verses 15-17 describe the kings of the earth and the rich men hiding in the rocks, crying "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne."
    *   **The Great Question:** They ask, "For the great day of his wrath is come; and **who shall be able to stand?**"

3.  **Righteousness by Faith – The Answer:**
    *   Who can stand? Only those who are "clothed in white raiment" (Revelation 3:5).
    *   Those who have the law of God written in their hearts (Hebrews 8:10) and the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12).
    *   Victory over sin is not just a theory; it is the necessary preparation to stand in the presence of a Holy God without being consumed.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A scroll rolls up quickly and snaps shut. The sky, which has acted as a curtain hiding the spiritual realm from our eyes, will suddenly roll back. For those who know the Shepherd, seeing Him is joy. For those who have clung to sin, the purity of His presence is a consuming fire (Hebrews 12:29).

### Q12. After the sealing work brought to view in Rev. 7, which takes place under the sixth seal, how is the seventh seal introduced?
“And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." (Revelation 8:1)

**Answer:**

The seventh seal marks the climax of the history of redemption.

1.  **Silence in Heaven:**
    *   **The Departure of the Hosts:** Heaven is usually filled with the sound of praise (Revelation 4:8). Why silence? Because the King and all His angels have left the courts of glory to come to earth to gather the elect (Matthew 25:31).
    *   **Prophetic Time:** In prophecy, a "day" represents a year (Ezekiel 4:6). Therefore, an "hour" is about two weeks, and "half an hour" is approximately one week (7 days). This may represent the time it takes for Christ to descend and gather His people.

2.  **The Solemnity of the Event:**
    *   This silence emphasizes the awe-inspiring nature of the Second Advent. The intercession in the sanctuary has ceased. The time for salvation is past. The focus of the entire universe is on this one event: the rescue of the Bride of Christ.

3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:**
    *   **Definition:** *Atonement Completed.* The High Priest comes out of the Most Holy Place to bless the waiting people. The work of removing sin is finished.

4.  **Practical Application:**
    *   If heaven is silent, watching this event, how should we be living? "What manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?" (2 Peter 3:11). We must ensure that our sins are blotted out now, before that silence begins.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a great bustling city that suddenly goes quiet because everyone has rushed to the gates to welcome a returning hero. The silence of the city speaks louder than the noise. Heaven's silence shouts the importance of the Second Coming—it is the event for which all creation has been groaning and waiting (Romans 8:22).
