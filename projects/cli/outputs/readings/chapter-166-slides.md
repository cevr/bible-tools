## Slide 1 – Q1: Foundations of Home

- **Question:** Where were the foundations of home laid?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:8 – “And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in
  Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: A Divine Institution

- **God as Architect**
  - The home is not a human invention; it is a divine institution established
    before sin.
  - Along with the Sabbath, it is one of the two “twin institutions” from Eden.
  - God did not leave Adam to wander; He provided a sanctuary called home,
    showing His intense interest in our domestic life.
- **Environment and Character**
  - God placed man in a garden to uplift his thoughts through nature.
  - The atmosphere we create in our homes today—physically and
    spiritually—directly impacts character development.

## Slide 3 – Q1: A Model of Heaven

- **A Type of the Heavenly**
  - Just as the earthly sanctuary was a pattern of the heavenly sanctuary, the
    home is to be a “little heaven on earth.”
  - **Hebrews 8:5** – “Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things,
    as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle:
    for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern
    shewed to thee in the mount.”
- **The School of Sanctification**
  - The home is the primary place for sanctification (being made holy).
  - **1 Thessalonians 4:3** – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”
  - Here we learn patience, unselfishness, and service, fitting us for the
    society of angels.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Master Builder**
  - Imagine a master builder who uses the strongest materials for the foundation
    to ensure stability.
  - God laid the foundation of human society—the family—in the perfect soil of
    Eden.
  - If a builder’s foundation is cracked, the building is unstable.
  - **Lesson:** If we ignore God’s original plan for the home (love, purity,
    obedience), the structure of our lives and society will crumble.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Completing the Plan

- **Question:** In carrying out His perfect plan! what was still needed?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:18 – “And the Lord God said, It is not good that the
  man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Need for Connection

- **Not Good to be Alone**
  - Even in a perfect world, solitude was declared “not good.”
  - Humanity reflects the social nature of the Godhead.
  - **Genesis 1:26** – “And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
    likeness...”
- **"Help Meet"**
  - A helper comparable to him.
  - Eve was not made from Adam’s head to rule, nor his feet to be trampled, but
    from his side to be near his heart.
  - This union represents a blending of lives in service to God.

## Slide 7 – Q2: A Type of Christ and the Church

- **The Spiritual Parallel**
  - Marriage is the deepest earthly illustration of the union between Christ and
    His people.
  - **Ephesians 5:30** – “For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of
    his bones.”
- **Justification and Faith**
  - Just as Adam accepted Eve, Christ accepts the repentant sinner, covering
    them with His righteousness.
  - **Romans 5:1** – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
    through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
  - A happy home requires the surrender of "self" and the exercise of faith that
    works by love.
  - **Galatians 5:6** – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
    thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Two Hands**
  - Consider the human body: the right hand and left hand are distinct, yet
    "meet" for one another.
  - They do not compete; they wash, protect, and help each other.
  - If one is injured, the other comforts it.
  - **Lesson:** A godly home is a partnership of mutual service, animated by the
    Spirit of Christ, where neither seeks to rule over the other.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Children as a Heritage

- **Question:** Is the home complete without children?
- **Key Text 1:** Psalm 127:3 – “Lo, children are a heritage of the Lord: and
  the fruit of the womb is his reward.”
- **Key Text 2:** Proverbs 17:6 – “Children's children are the crown of old men;
  and the glory of children are their fathers.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: A Sacred Trust

- **A Gift from God**
  - Children are not a burden or hindrance, but a “heritage” (gift) from
    Jehovah.
  - Parents stand in the place of God to their children during early years; the
    parent's character is the child's first textbook.
- **The Family Altar**
  - The father acts as the priest of the household.
  - By leading morning and evening worship, he points his "heritage" to the Lamb
    of God.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Transformation of the Heart**
  - Parents cannot change a child's heart; only the Holy Spirit can.
  - Parents must first possess Christ’s righteousness themselves, then present
    their children to God in faith.
  - **Isaiah 49:25** – “But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty
    shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I
    will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy
    children.”
- **Goal of Discipline**
  - True discipline is not mere behavior modification.
  - It seeks the transformation of the heart through the power of grace.

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Gardener**
  - A gardener can water soil and prune branches, but he cannot make the seed
    grow; only God gives life.
  - However, if the gardener neglects the plant, it will die or run wild.
  - **Lesson:** Children are tender plants in the Lord's garden. Parents are
    under-gardeners who remove weeds (bad influences) and provide love, trusting
    God to produce the fruit.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Possessions vs. Happiness

- **Question:** Does the happiness of home depend upon the abundance of things
  possessed?
- **Key Text 1:** Luke 12:15 – “And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of
  covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
  which he possesseth.”
- **Key Text 2:** Proverbs 15:17 – “Better is a dinner of herbs where love is,
  than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: The Fallacy of Materialism

- **Happiness is a Condition of the Heart**
  - Possessions often bring anxiety and cannot heal a broken heart or forgive
    sin.
  - **Proverbs 15:17** teaches that poverty with love is infinitely superior to
    luxury with strife.
  - Love is the atmosphere of heaven; without it, a palace is a prison.
- **Seeking the Kingdom**
  - **Matthew 6:33** – “But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
    righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”

## Slide 15 – Q4: Christ the Center (Sanctuary Theme)

- **The Bread of Life**
  - In the Sanctuary, the table of shewbread represented Christ as the
    sustenance of His people.
  - A family that feeds on Christ—trusting His merits—is spiritually rich.
- **True Riches**
  - **Revelation 3:18** – “I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire,
    that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed,
    and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes
    with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.”

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Cold Lantern**
  - Imagine a beautiful lantern, gold-plated and intricately carved, but with no
    flame inside. It is cold and useless in the dark.
  - Compare it to a simple clay lamp that burns with a bright, warm flame.
  - **Lesson:** A home filled with expensive things but lacking Christ’s love is
    like the cold, golden lantern—dark and cheerless.

## Slide 17 – Q5: The Undesirable Home

- **Question:** May a home be undesirable under some circumstances?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 21:19 – “It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than
  with a contentious and an angry woman.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: The Ruin of Contentiousness

- **The "Wilderness" Home**
  - While the verse mentions a woman, the principle applies to any family member
    (husband, wife, child).
  - Constant bickering and criticism destroy the "sanctuary" nature of the home.
- **The Root of the Problem**
  - Contentions come from pride and the unrenewed heart.
  - **Proverbs 13:10** – “Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well
    advised is wisdom.”

## Slide 19 – Q5: The Cure (Imparted Righteousness)

- **A New Heart Needed**
  - We cannot fix a bad temper by willpower alone; we need a change of nature.
  - **Philippians 2:13** – “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and
    to do of his good pleasure.”
- **The Prayer of Surrender**
  - "Lord, take my heart; for I cannot give it. It is Thy property. Keep it
    pure, for I cannot keep it for Thee." (_Christ's Object Lessons_)
- **The Result**
  - **Galatians 5:22-23** – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
    longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against
    such there is no law.”

## Slide 20 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Leaky Roof**
  - The Bible compares a contentious spouse to a "continual dropping in a very
    rainy day."
  - **Proverbs 27:15** – “A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a
    contentious woman are alike.”
  - **Lesson:** An angry spirit is a "spiritual leak" that destroys rest. You
    cannot just "catch the water" (manage anger); you must let God repair the
    roof by rebuilding the character through grace.
