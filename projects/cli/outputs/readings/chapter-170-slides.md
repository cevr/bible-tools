## Slide 1 – Title Slide

- **Topic:** The Marriage Institution
- **Scripture Theme:** "From the beginning it was not so." (Matthew 19:8)
- **Introduction:**
  - We look back to Eden, the pattern of all that is pure and holy.
  - The home on earth is to be a symbol of the home in heaven.
  - As we approach the end of time, we must restore the "old waste places" regarding the home (Isaiah 58:12).

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Twin Institutions

- **Question:** What was one of the first institutions founded for the benefit of the human race?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:22 – “And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Origin & Type)

- **Twin Institutions of Eden:**
  - Marriage and the Sabbath are the two institutions established before the fall of man.
  - Both were given to secure man's happiness and holiness.
- **Divine Origin:**
  - Marriage is not a human evolution or social contract; God officiated the first wedding.
- **Equality and Unity:**
  - Eve was taken from Adam’s side (rib), not his head to rule him, nor his feet to be trampled.
  - She stands under his arm for protection and near his heart for love.
- **A Type of Christ:**
  - Adam sleeping while Eve was formed typifies Christ dying (sleeping) to give birth to the Church (Ephesians 5:25–32).

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Two Gems of Eden**
  - Imagine a traveler leaving a burning city (Eden lost) with only two precious gems.
  - These gems are the **Sabbath** and **Marriage**.
  - If polished and kept according to God's instruction, they reflect the light of heaven.
  - If marred by sin or human tradition, they lose their luster.
  - We are called to restore the brilliance of these original gifts.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Purpose of Marriage

- **Question:** Why did God establish the marriage institution?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 1:27, 28 – “So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it.”
  - Isaiah 45:18 – “For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens... He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited...”
  - Genesis 2:18 – “And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (God’s Objectives)

- **Preservation of the Race:**
  - The earth was to be populated with holy beings reflecting God's image.
  - The home is the nursery for training children in the Lord (Ephesians 6:4 – “And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.”).
- **Companionship:**
  - "It is not good that the man should be alone."
  - Man, made in God's image, requires communion and social connection.
- **Mutual Help:**
  - "Help meet" means a helper suitable for him.
  - Husband and wife strengthen each other in the battle of life and the Christian walk.

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: Divine Mathematics

- **Question:** To accomplish this two fold purpose, how many companions did God in the beginning ordain that man should have?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 2:24 – “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.”
  - Ephesians 5:31 – “For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (One Flesh)

- **Monogamy is the Standard:**
  - God provided one wife for one man.
  - "They **two** shall be **one**."
- **Meaning of "Cleave":**
  - Suggests being glued together; a bond stronger than the parental tie.
  - This unity is impossible between three or more people.
- **Application: Righteousness by Faith**
  - We cannot serve two masters; the church cannot have two husbands.
  - Loyalty in marriage reflects our singular loyalty to Christ.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **[ILL] The River**
  - Two streams can merge to form one mighty river, flowing with power toward the ocean.
  - If that river is constantly divided into smaller channels, it turns into a swamp.
  - God designed marriage as a focused, deep channel of love between two, not a swamp of divided affections.

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Origin of Polygamy

- **Question:** With whom did polygamy originate?
- **Key Text:** John 8:44 – “Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth...”

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (The Counterfeit)

- **Lamech the Rebel:**
  - The first recorded polygamist was Lamech, of the line of Cain (Genesis 4:19, 23).
  - Lamech was both a murderer and a polygamist.
- **Satan’s Counterfeit:**
  - Polygamy is a counterfeit of God's design, born of lust and rebellion.
  - Satan distorts creation to destroy the image of God in the home.

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: Corruption of the Antediluvians

- **Question:** What effect did the polygamous example of Lamech's descendants have on the children of God?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:1, 2 – “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Unequal Yoking)

- **Compromise:**
  - The "sons of God" (Seth’s line) intermarried with the "daughters of men" (Cain’s line).
  - Choice was based on appearance ("fair") rather than character.
- **Result:**
  - "Took them wives of all which they chose" implies plurality and uncontrolled desire.
  - Mingling with the world destroyed the spirituality of the home.
- **[ILL] Ink in Water:**
  - A drop of ink in pure water makes the water dark; the ink does not become clear.
  - Compromise lowers the standard of holiness.

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: Did God Approve?

- **Question:** Does this reference to wife plurality among those who were called "the sons of God," prove that the Lord had adopted Satan's plan?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:12 – “And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted His way upon the earth.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Judgment)

- **God’s Way vs. Corruption:**
  - The text states they corrupted *His way*.
  - God’s way was monogamy; their corruption was polygamy.
- **The Consequence:**
  - God sent the Flood to cleanse the earth of this corruption.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Sin cannot exist in God’s presence. The Flood was a type of the final cleansing, removing the stain of sin from the earth.

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: Noah’s Example

- **Question:** What was Noah's character? and considering the emergency, how many wives did he and his sons take with them into the ark?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 6:9 – “Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.”
  - Genesis 7:13 – “In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points (The Remnant)

- **Character of the Remnant:**
  - Noah was "just" (justified) and "perfect" (wholehearted).
  - He walked with God, in harmony with God's will.
- **Preservation of Monogamy:**
  - Only eight people were saved—four monogamous couples.
  - The remnant who survive the judgment return to the original platform of truth.

---

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Definition of "House"

- **Question:** Who knows but what they had other wives not good enough to be permitted to enter the ark?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 7:1 – “And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before this generation.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points

- **Total Preservation:**
  - God invited Noah’s "house."
  - If there were other wives, they were not recognized by God as part of the true family.
- **Divine Selection:**
  - God saved only the family unit that reflected His order.
  - Any relationships outside His plan were washed away with the world.

---

## Slide 20 – Q9: Abraham and the Godly Seed

- **Question:** After the flood, when Satan, in trying to overthrow God's plan, had again led men into idolatry and polygamy, why did the Lord choose as the progenitor of a spiritual race, a man who had but one wife?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Malachi 2:15 – “And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.”
  - Genesis 12:5 – “And Abram took Sarai his wife... and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan...”

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points

- **Godly Seed:**
  - Malachi explains that God made them "one" to produce "godly seed."
  - A divided home is poor soil for raising righteous children.
- **The Covenant Foundation:**
  - The covenant of grace began with Abraham and his one lawful wife, Sarai.
  - God restored the Edenic plan for the father of the faithful.

---

## Slide 22 – Q10: Sarah and Hagar

- **Question:** When, through lack of faith, it seemed that God's promise of a son could not be fulfilled because of Sarai's age, what prevalent evil custom of that day did she induce Abram to adopt, hoping thereby to secure the promised heir?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 16:3 – “And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points (Faith vs. Works)

- **A Failure of Faith:**
  - Impatience led to adopting human customs instead of trusting God's miracle.
- **The Old Covenant (Works):**
  - Galatians 4 reveals Hagar represents the attempt to inherit the promise through human effort (flesh).
  - Helping God out through human schemes leads to disaster.
- **[ILL] The Mechanic:**
  - Trying to "force" a fix with a hammer on a delicate engine only causes damage. Abraham tried to force the promise, resulting in centuries of conflict.

---

## Slide 24 – Q11: Status of Hagar

- **Question:** Did this shameful proceeding make Hagar the wife of Abram?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 16:8 – “And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points

- **Divine Terminology:**
  - Scripture persists in calling Hagar the "bondwoman" or "maid."
  - God never recognized Ishmael as the heir of the covenant.
- **Adultery, Not Marriage:**
  - From the New Testament standpoint (Matthew 19), this was a violation of the seventh commandment.
  - Abraham was a sinner in need of grace, caught in the culture of his time.

---

## Slide 26 – Q12: The Call to Perfection

- **Question:** What is the very next recorded experience of Abram's which shows that he was not perfect, like Enoch and Noah?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 17:1 – “And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before Me, and be thou perfect.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points

- **Reproof:**
  - The command "be thou perfect" implies Abraham was not currently perfect in his walk.
  - He had deviated from trust in God through the Hagar incident.
- **Sanctification:**
  - God called him back to wholeheartedness.
  - True sanctification requires turning away from human inventions.

---

## Slide 28 – Q13: Abraham’s Repentance

- **Question:** Did he follow the example of Cain, the progenitor of murderers and polygamists, and try to justify or excuse himself?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 17:3 – “And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him...”

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Key Points (Submission)

- **Humility:**
  - Unlike Cain, Abraham fell on his face and accepted the rebuke.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We are not saved because we have never sinned, but because we repent and believe.
  - Following this repentance, God changed his name to Abraham, signifying a new character.

---

## Slide 30 – Q14: Casting Out the Bondwoman

- **Question:** When Ishmael was about sixteen years old, and Sarah requested Abraham to "cast out this bondwoman and her son" (Gen. 21:10), what instruction did the Lord give which shows that He had not changed His original plan, one wife for one man?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 21:12 – “...In all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.”
  - Genesis 21:14 – “And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar... and sent her away...”

---

## Slide 31 – Q14: Application (The Two Natures)

- **Restoring the Home:**
  - God validated Sarah as the only rightful wife.
  - The "intruder" had to be removed to restore peace and order.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The "bondwoman" (works of the flesh) must be cast out so the "freewoman" (grace) can reign.
  - We cannot harbor compromise alongside the life of Christ.

---

## Slide 32 – Q15: God Hates Divorce

- **Question:** Had Hagar really been the wife of Abraham during these sixteen years, would he ever have "sent her away" with the divine permission?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 19:6 – “Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”

---

## Slide 33 – Q15: Key Points

- **Logical Proof:**
  - God hates "putting away" (Malachi 2:16).
  - If God joined Hagar to Abraham, He would not have commanded her dismissal.
- **Annulment of Sin:**
  - God commanded the separation because the union was sinful, not a true marriage.

---

## Slide 34 – Q16: Guarding the Next Generation

- **Question:** After Abraham had profited by his bitter experience (Gen. 21:11), what did God say of him; and how was it in part fulfilled?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 18:19 – “For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment...”
  - Genesis 24:3, 4 – “And I will make thee swear by the Lord... that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites... But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q16: Key Points

- **Learned Lesson:**
  - Abraham returned to the "way of the Lord."
- **Protecting Isaac:**
  - He ensured Isaac did not make the same mistake.
  - Isaac is the only patriarch who remained monogamous his whole life.

---

## Slide 36 – Q17: Isaac’s Charge to Jacob

- **Question:** What was Isaac's last charge to Jacob, when the latter was about to leave home?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 28:1, 2 – “And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. Arise... and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q17: Key Points

- **The Singular Command:**
  - "Take thee **a** wife" (singular).
- **The Unequal Yoke:**
  - The prohibition against the Canaanites warns against marrying those who do not love God.

---

## Slide 38 – Q18: Jacob’s Polygamy

- **Question:** But did not Jacob have two wives?
- **Reference:** See Genesis 29.
- **Key Points:**
  - **Deceiver Deceived:** Jacob deceived Isaac; Laban deceived Jacob. He reaped what he sowed (Galatians 6:7).
  - **Human Maneuvering:** Like Abraham, Jacob tried to secure happiness through human effort.
  - **Permissive Will:** God did not abandon Jacob, but allowed him to suffer the natural consequences. This is not an endorsement.

---

## Slide 39 – Q19: Jacob’s Misery

- **Question:** Did Jacob enjoy his polygamous life?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 47:9 – “And Jacob said unto Pharaoh... Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers...”

---

## Slide 40 – Q19: Key Points

- **Result of Polygamy:**
  - Rivalry between sisters.
  - Bartering for affection (Genesis 30).
  - Hatred of Joseph by his brothers.
- **Lesson:**
  - Sin may be forgiven, but the scars and sorrow often remain.

---

## Slide 41 – Q20: David’s Example

- **Question:** Was David blessed of God because he was a polygamist?
- **Key Text:** 2 Samuel 12:9-11 – “Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in His sight? ...Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house... Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house...”

---

## Slide 42 – Q20: Key Points

- **Violation of Law:**
  - David "despised the commandment."
  - Deuteronomy 17:17 had explicitly forbidden kings to multiply wives.
- **The Fruit:**
  - Dysfunction, rape (Amnon and Tamar), murder (Absalom killing Amnon), and rebellion.
  - God judged the action as "evil," not blessed.

---

## Slide 43 – Q21: Occasion for Blasphemy

- **Question:** Because of David's evil example, what occasion did the Lord say had been given polygamists and other evil doers?
- **Key Text:** 2 Samuel 12:14 – “Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.”

---

## Slide 44 – Q21: Key Points

- **Reputation of God:**
  - When leaders sin, enemies mock the truth.
  - Skeptics still use David’s wives to attack biblical morality.
- **Our Responsibility:**
  - We are our brother's keeper.
  - Our lives must demonstrate the power of the Gospel to keep us pure.

---

## Slide 45 – Q22: David’s Repentance

- **Question:** How, then, was David "a man after God's own heart," polygamy and murder being violations of "the commandment of the Lord?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Psalm 32:5 – “I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.”
  - Psalm 51:17 – “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.”

---

## Slide 46 – Q22: Key Points (Gospel Application)

- **Sincerity of Repentance:**
  - David was a man after God's heart because of his deep repentance, not his perfection.
  - When confronted, he immediately confessed.
- **Justification:**
  - A murderer and adulterer can be washed clean by the blood of the Lamb.
  - **Note:** Guilt was removed, but consequences (the sword) remained.

---

## Slide 47 – Q22: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Broken Vase**
  - You may glue a broken vase back together so it holds water (forgiveness).
  - However, the cracks remain visible (consequences).
  - David’s life was mended by grace, but the cracks of his polygamy caused leaks in the kingdom.

---

## Slide 48 – Q23: Solomon’s Fall

- **Question:** Was Solomon blessed because he was a polygamist?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 11:4, 9 – “For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods... And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel...”

---

## Slide 49 – Q23: Key Points

- **Total Apostasy:**
  - Polygamy led directly to idolatry (shrines to Chemosh and Molech).
- **The Warning:**
  - If the wisest man who ever lived could not handle polygamy without losing his soul, no man today can violate God’s law and survive spiritually.

---

## Slide 50 – Q24: Difficult Texts (Part 1)

- **Question:** What are the principal texts used in attempting to justify polygamy by divine precept? and what may be said of them?
- **Text 1:** Exodus 21:10 – “If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.”
  - **Explanation:** This is a labor law protecting servants. Context implies "another betrothed." If a father changes his mind about a betrothal, he must still provide for the first girl. It regulates a social mess; it does not command polygamy.

---

## Slide 51 – Q24: Difficult Texts (Part 2)

- **Text 2:** Deuteronomy 25:5 – “If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband’s brother shall... take her to him to wife.”
  - **Explanation:** The "Levirate Law." A specific property law to keep the family name and inheritance alive in Israel (e.g., Boaz and Ruth). It was not a license for lust.

---

## Slide 52 – Q24: Difficult Texts (Part 3)

- **Text 3:** Isaiah 4:1 – “And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.”
  - **Explanation:** A prophecy of a curse caused by war (men falling by the sword).
  - **Spiritual Application:** In the last days, false churches (women) claim Christ's name to remove reproach but trust in their own works (bread/apparel). A picture of false Christianity.

---

## Slide 53 – Q25: New Testament Testimony

- **Question:** What further testimony is given by prophets, Christ, and the apostles relative to the enduring nature of God's original plan?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Mark 10:6-9 – “But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female... What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”
  - Ephesians 5:33 – “Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself...”
  - 1 Timothy 3:2 – “A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife...”

---

## Slide 54 – Q25: Key Points

- **Christ Points Backward:**
  - Jesus swept away traditions and permissions ("hardness of hearts") and pointed to Eden: "From the beginning it was not so."
- **Paul Points Forward:**
  - Church leaders must be "the husband of one wife."
  - Marriage is a "great mystery" of Christ and the Church; since there is one Christ, the type must be monogamous.

---

## Slide 55 – Q26: Conclusion

- **Question:** What then, is the inevitable conclusion regarding polygamy?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 7:29 – “Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.”

---

## Slide 56 – Q26: Key Points

- **Man’s Inventions:**
  - Polygamy, divorce, and modern deviations are human inventions.
  - God made man upright with a perfect plan: One man, one woman, for life.
- **The Call:**
  - God is calling a people to stand on the platform of eternal truth.
  - We must uphold the sanctity of the marriage institution, proving that God’s law is a law of love and liberty.
