## Slide 1 – Q1: The Good Shepherd

- Question: Who is emphatically the good shepherd?
- Key Text: John 10:11 – “I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Great Pattern:**
  - Jesus distinguishes Himself from all earthly priests or kings.
- **The Owner of the Flock:**
  - We belong to Him by **Creation**: “It is he that hath made us... we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture” (Psalm 100:3).
  - We belong to Him by **Redemption**: He “purchased” the church with His own blood (Acts 20:28).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We do not obey cold rules; we follow a Person.
  - **Justification:** We enter through Him, the Door (John 10:9).
  - **Sanctification:** We walk in the path He treads. To be a Christian is to follow the Shepherd (Revelation 14:4).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Shepherd’s Voice:**
  - A stranger trying to call a flock will cause them to scatter because the voice is unfamiliar.
  - When the true shepherd whispers, even in the dark, the sheep follow immediately.
- **Application:**
  - The “voice” of the Good Shepherd is found in His Word.
  - It speaks peace to the conscience and calls us away from the dangerous cliffs of sin.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Extent of Sacrifice

- Question: To what extent did Christ sacrifice for the sheep?
- Key Text: John 10:11 – “The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Total Sacrifice:**
  - The foundation of the gospel is that the Shepherd gave His life.
- **Sanctuary Symbolism:**
  - Christ is uniquely both the High Priest (Shepherd) and the Victim (the Lamb).
  - In the earthly service, the sinner brought a lamb; in the plan of salvation, God provided the Lamb (John 1:29).
- **Substitutionary Atonement:**
  - Since the “wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23), the law demanded the life of the transgressor.
  - Christ stepped between the wolf (death) and the sheep, taking the penalty so the sheep might live.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **David and the Lion:**
  - David risked his life fighting a lion and a bear to save a lamb (1 Samuel 17:34–35).
- **Christ’s Greater Work:**
  - Christ did more than risk His life; He voluntarily laid it down.
  - He died not merely as a martyr, but as a Substitute, bearing the weight of the world’s guilt in Gethsemane and Calvary.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Hireling

- Question: Will false shepherds do this?
- Key Text: John 10:13 – “The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.”
- Key Text: Isaiah 56:11 – “Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **The Hireling Spirit:**
  - Motivated by wages (money, prestige, power) rather than love.
  - When ministry becomes dangerous or unpopular ("the wolf coming"), the hireling abandons the truth to protect himself.
- **Self-Seeking:**
  - Isaiah describes them as looking “to their own way.”
  - This is the essence of sin: placing self above God and His law.
  - They dilute the truth to maintain popularity or income.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Sinking Ship:**
  - A captain who loves his passengers stays with the sinking ship to save them.
  - A captain who only cares for his paycheck is the first in the lifeboat.
- **Modern Wolves:**
  - The “wolf” today may be ridicule, loss of employment, or social pressure.
  - The true shepherd stands firm for God’s law, come what may.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Provision of Food

- Question: Will the true shepherd see that the sheep are provided with food?
- Key Text: Acts 20:28 – “Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **Divine Commission:**
  - The Holy Ghost makes men “overseers” to watch over the safety and health of the flock.
- **Purchased Possession:**
  - The sheep are “purchased with [God’s] own blood.”
  - Mistreating or starving the flock is a sin against the Owner, Christ.
- **Essential Nutrition:**
  - Spiritual life requires the “bread of life.”
  - Without it, the church becomes weak and unable to resist temptation.

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Proper Food

- Question: With what kind of food will he feed the flock?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 4:1-2 – “I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; Preach the word...”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **Preach the Word:**
  - Not politics, philosophy, or comedy.
  - The faithful shepherd opens the Bible and explains the Scriptures (Luke 24:27).
- **The Scroll of Prophecy:**
  - References to Revelation 10 and Ezekiel 3 imply “eating the scroll.”
  - A minister must have a personal experience of **Sanctification** through the Word (John 17:17) before leading others.
- **Judgment Context:**
  - Paul’s charge is given in light of Christ’s appearing.
  - Preaching must prepare people for the **Investigative Judgment** and to stand before God.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration

- **Sawdust vs. Milk:**
  - If a mother feeds her child candy and sawdust instead of milk and bread, the child will become diseased or starve.
  - Pastors who preach entertainment or human theories feed the flock “sawdust.”
  - The soul needs the “sincere milk of the word” (1 Peter 2:2) to grow into the likeness of Christ.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Setting an Example

- Question: Will the true shepherd set a good example to the flock?
- Key Text: Titus 2:7 – “In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity...”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points

- **A Pattern of Good Works:**
  - This relates to **Imparted Righteousness**.
  - It is not enough to have correct theology; the life must demonstrate the Gospel’s power to transform character.
- **Visual Theology:**
  - People read the leader's life more than they listen to his sermons.
  - Preaching health reform while being intemperate destroys the work.
- **Victory over Sin:**
  - The shepherd must demonstrate that Christ’s grace is sufficient to overcome pride, appetite, and selfishness (1 Corinthians 9:27).

## Slide 17 – Q7: Warning of Danger

- Question: Will he warn the sheep of coming danger?
- Key Text: Ezekiel 33:7 – “So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Watchman:**
  - The watchman stands on the wall to spot approaching danger.
  - He transmits God’s warnings found in Scripture (“hear the word at My mouth”).
- **The Three Angels’ Messages:**
  - The specific warning for the last days (Revelation 14:6–12):
    - The hour of God’s judgment.
    - The fall of Babylon.
    - Warning against the Mark of the Beast.
- **Love Warns:**
  - To see a sword coming and remain silent is an act of hatred, not love.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Broken Bridge:**
  - If a bridge is washed out on a dark night, a faithful watchman will wave a light and shout to stop cars.
  - If he sits quietly to avoid being “negative” or disturbing the drivers, he is responsible for the crash.

## Slide 20 – Q8: Responsibility of the Watchman

- Question: What does the Lord say to the watchman or shepherd who does not warn the wicked?
- Key Text: Ezekiel 33:8 – “...if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points

- **Personal Responsibility:**
  - Every man dies for his own iniquity; the wicked are not excused by the leader's silence.
- **Ministerial Accountability:**
  - God holds the silent shepherd accountable for the loss of the soul (**Bloodguiltiness**).
  - Ministry is a matter of life and death, eternal gain or eternal loss.
- **Paul’s Defense:**
  - “I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God” (Acts 20:26–27).

## Slide 22 – Q9: Blind Leaders

- Question: What does our Saviour call false shepherds?
- Key Text: Matthew 15:14 – “Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points

- **Spiritual Blindness:**
  - In Matthew 15, Pharisees placed tradition above the Commandments of God.
  - A leader who sets aside the Ten Commandments for popularity is spiritually blind.
- **The Result:**
  - “Both shall fall into the ditch”—implies ruin and loss of salvation.
- **The Command:**
  - “Let them alone.”
  - If a leader persistently rejects plain Bible truth, the true sheep must separate and not follow him.

## Slide 24 – Q10: False Comfort

- Question: Do such warn the flock of coming danger?
- Key Text: Isaiah 56:10 – “His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.”
- Key Text: Jeremiah 6:14 – “They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points

- **Dumb Dogs:**
  - A watchdog that does not bark at a thief is useless.
  - A preacher silent on popular sins (Sabbath-breaking, pride, worldliness) is a “dumb dog.”
- **"Peace, Peace" (Cheap Grace):**
  - False shepherds promise forgiveness without requiring repentance or a change of life.
  - True peace only comes when sin is confessed and forsaken (Proverbs 28:13).
- **Healing Slightly:**
  - Treating the symptoms of unhappiness without addressing the root cause: rebellion against God’s law.

## Slide 26 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Deceptive Doctor:**
  - Imagine a doctor telling a patient with a deadly infection, “You are fine, just take this painkiller.”
  - The patient feels better temporarily but eventually dies.
  - A true shepherd performs the painful surgery of exposing sin to save the life.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Distinguishing True and False

- Question: Has the Lord given us another means by which to distinguish between true and false shepherds?
- Key Text: Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Standard of Truth:**
  - The Ten Commandments and the Testimony of the Word test all teachers.
  - If a shepherd teaches the Law is abolished, there is “no light in them” (no matter their education).
- **Causing Stumble at the Law:**
  - Malachi 2:8 warns of priests who “caused many to stumble at the law.”
  - They make obedience seem impossible or unnecessary.
- **Harmony of Law and Gospel:**
  - A true shepherd shows that the Law reveals our need for Christ.
  - Christ empowers us to keep the Law—writing it in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).

## Slide 29 – Q12: Prophecy and the End Time

- Question: Will the shepherds who are unfaithful give to the flock the sense of those prophecies relating to "the time of the end"?
- Key Text: Isaiah 29:11 – “And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points

- **"It is Sealed":**
  - Many refuse to preach on Daniel and Revelation, claiming they are too difficult or "sealed."
- **Learned Ignorance:**
  - Isaiah depicts scholars admitting they cannot understand the prophetic word.
- **Result—Human Religion:**
  - When prophecy is neglected, fear of God is “taught by the precept of men” (Isaiah 29:13).
  - The church drifts into tradition and emotionalism.
- **The Advent Message:**
  - The unsealing of Daniel occurred at the “time of the end” (post-1798).
  - Faithful shepherds *must* teach these prophecies to prepare for the Second Coming.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Turning from Truth

- Question: Was there to come a time when people would not listen to Bible truth?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 4:3-4 – “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine... and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points

- **Itching Ears:**
  - People desire novelty, entertainment, and affirmation rather than duty or self-denial.
- **Heaping Teachers:**
  - Congregations hire pastors who tell them what they *want* to hear.
  - A worldly church demands a worldly pastor.
- **Turning to Fables:**
  - When truth is rejected, myths fill the vacuum.
  - Examples: Natural immortality of the soul, Sunday sacredness, or salvation in sin.

## Slide 33 – Q14: Rejecting Plain Words

- Question: Will such like to have plain words spoken to them?
- Key Text: Isaiah 30:10 – “Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points

- **Rejection of "Right Things":**
  - The carnal heart (Romans 8:7) finds the straight testimony of truth offensive.
- **Preference for Deceit:**
  - It is fearful when people prefer a comforting lie over an uncomfortable truth.
  - This prepares the way for final deceptions.
- **The True Shepherd’s Duty:**
  - He must speak “right things” in love.
  - He must love the soul more than he loves the soul’s approval.

## Slide 35 – Q15: God's Judgment on Shepherds

- Question: What does the Lord say further concerning false shepherds?
- Key Text: Jeremiah 50:6 – “My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray...”
- Key Text: Ezekiel 34:10 – “...I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock...”

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points

- **Shepherds Causing Error:**
  - The people are lost *because* of their leaders.
- **God Against the Shepherds:**
  - God will remove the unfaithful shepherds and take over the work Himself.
- **The Gathering (Remnant):**
  - “I... will both search My sheep, and seek them out” (Ezekiel 34:11).
  - God is calling His sheep out of false folds (Babylon) into the one true fold of Bible truth.

## Slide 37 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Negligent Babysitter:**
  - If a babysitter neglects the children and eats their food, the parents’ return is a day of reckoning.
  - The hireling is dismissed, and the parents care for the children.
  - Christ is returning to relieve the hirelings and gather His scattered flock.

## Slide 38 – Q16: Tampering with Prophecy

- Question: What is to be the future of those who "add unto" or "take away from " the words of prophecy?
- Key Text: Revelation 22:18-19 – “If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues... And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life...”

## Slide 39 – Q16: Key Points

- **Integrity of Scripture:**
  - “Adding” (tradition) or “Taking Away” (modernism) alters the map to heaven, causing souls to be lost.
- **The Plagues:**
  - Distorting the message brings the **Seven Last Plagues** (Revelation 16).
- **Eternal Loss:**
  - Removal from the **Book of Life** is the second death.
  - In the day of God’s anger, titles and positions offer no protection.

## Slide 40 – Q17: The Faithful Shepherd’s Reward

- Question: What promise has Peter left on record for faithful shepherds?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 5:4 – “And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.”

## Slide 41 – Q17: Key Points

- **The Appearing:**
  - The reward is given at the Second Coming, focused on the “Chief Shepherd’s” return.
- **The Crown of Glory:**
  - Unlike earthly fame or money which “cankers” (James 5:3), this crown never fades.
  - Daniel 12:3 – “They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament... for ever and ever.”

## Slide 42 – Conclusion

- **Pray for Your Shepherds:**
  - Pray they may be faithful watchmen who feed the flock with the pure Word.
- **Test All Things:**
  - Use the Law and the Testimony as your standard.
- **Follow the Chief Shepherd:**
  - Do not rely on human leaders for salvation.
  - Look to Jesus Christ and follow Him.
