## Slide 1 – Q1: The Christian's Anchor

- **Question:** To what is the Christian's hope likened?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 6:18, 19 – "That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil."

## Slide 2 – Q1: Sure and Steadfast

- **The Anchor:** The Bible likens our hope to an anchor.
  - It secures the believer during the storms of life and temptation so they do not drift.
- **Sure and Steadfast:**
  - Unlike earthly anchors that grip shifting sand, our anchor is cast upward.
  - It does not depend on our fluctuating feelings or weak performance.
  - It depends on the "immutable" (unchangeable) promise of God.
  - Malachi 3:6 – "For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed."
- **Consolation and Refuge:**
  - We are like those who have fled to a City of Refuge to escape condemnation.
  - We flee to Christ to escape the guilt of sin.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Within the Veil (Sanctuary Connection)

- **"Within the Veil":**
  - This refers to the entrance into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Our hope is anchored in Christ, our High Priest, who ministers there for us.
- **Christ's Ministry:**
  - Hebrews 9:11-12 – "But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands... Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us."
  - Hebrews 9:24 – "For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us."

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Ship in the Storm:**
  - Imagine a ship caught in a violent hurricane.
  - If the captain throws the anchor onto the deck of his own ship, it provides no stability.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - An anchor must grapple with something *outside* the ship.
  - If we place hope in our own works, feelings, or strength (the "deck" of our lives), we will drift.
  - We must cast our hope outside of ourselves, hooking it securely into the Throne of God "within the veil."

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Blessed Hope

- **Question:** What is the Christian's hope called?
- **Key Text:** Titus 2:13 – "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **The Glorious Appearing:**
  - The "blessed hope" is the literal, visible, personal return of Jesus Christ.
  - It is not merely death or a spirit-existence, but the event that ends the reign of sin.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – "For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first."
- **The Great God and Saviour:**
  - Titus 2:13 affirms the deity of Christ.
  - We wait for the Creator Himself to claim His possession.
- **Focus of the Heart:**
  - The believer finds no permanent satisfaction in this world.
  - The heart longs for the restoration of all things at the Second Advent.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Waiting Bride:**
  - A bride separated from her groom by a long war does not merely hope for a letter.
  - Her "blessed hope" is the day he walks through the door for a reunion.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The church is the bride; Christ is the Bridegroom.
  - Our hope is His personal presence, not just His gifts.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Timing of the Reward

- **Question:** At what time did Paul expect to realize this hope?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 4:8 – "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing."

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **"At That Day":**
  - Paul expected his reward at the Second Coming, not at the moment of death.
  - The crown is currently "laid up" (reserved) in heaven.
- **The State of the Righteous:**
  - The righteous dead sleep in Jesus until the resurrection morning.
  - John 14:3 – "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."
- **The Righteous Judge:**
  - Believers need not fear the judgment.
  - The Judge is also the Saviour who covers them with His robe of righteousness (Isaiah 61:10).

## Slide 10 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Crown of Righteousness:**
  - This crown represents the victory of the gospel, not human merit.
- **Imputed Righteousness (Title to Heaven):**
  - Romans 4:22, 24 – "And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness... But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead."
- **Imparted Righteousness (Fitness for Heaven):**
  - God works *in* us to enable us to love His appearing and obey His law.
  - Philippians 2:13 – "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Hope of the Wicked

- **Question:** What is said of the hope of the wicked?
- **Key Text:** Job 8:13, 14 – "So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be as a spider's web."

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Spider's Web:**
  - A web may be intricate and beautiful, but it has no structural strength.
  - It is swept away by a single stroke; it cannot withstand the storm.
- **False Assurance:**
  - Hypocrites may feel saved based on self-righteousness or presumption.
  - This hope collapses in the judgment (Matthew 7:26-27).
- **Forgetting God:**
  - The root of false hope is forgetting God's law and justice.
  - Jeremiah 6:14 – "They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace."

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The House on Ice:**
  - A man builds a beautiful house on a frozen lake in winter.
  - It feels solid for a season.
  - When spring comes, the foundation melts, and the house sinks.

- **Question:** What will be accomplished by him who hath the Christian's hope?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:3 – "And every man that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself, even as He is pure."

## Slide 15 – Q5: Purity and Victory

- **The Effect of Hope:**
  - Biblical hope is active, not passive.
  - Expecting to live in a sinless heaven leads to living a holy life now.
- **"Purifieth Himself":**
  - We cooperate with God's work of sanctification (2 Corinthians 7:1).
  - We choose to put away known sin and separate from worldliness.
- **"Even as He is Pure":**
  - The standard is Jesus Christ, not the culture or other members.
  - 2 Peter 1:4 – "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **Meeting the King:**
  - If invited to meet a King or President, you would wash, groom, and dress your best.
  - You prepare yourself for their presence.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**

- **Question:** In what may the child of God abound?
- **Key Text:** Romans 15:13 – "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost."

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Source:**
  - "The God of hope" gives this gift; it is not a human temperament.
- **Joy and Peace in Believing:**
  - Faith leads to joy and peace.
  - This filling results in "abounding" (overflowing) hope.

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points

- **No Disappointment:**
  - Worldly hopes (money, fame) often end in shame.
  - Christian hope never leads to shame because Jesus is faithful.
- **Internal Evidence:**
  - The Holy Spirit sheds God's love abroad in our hearts.
  - This internal witness gives assurance that we belong to Him.
- **Boldness:**
  - Because we are not ashamed, we confess Christ before men.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Waiting Child:**
  - A child waiting for a parent to pick them up is not ashamed.
