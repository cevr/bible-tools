### Q1. What is said of those who worship the beast and his image and receive his mark?

“If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

**Answer:**

The most solemn warning in the entire Bible is found in the Third Angel’s Message. It warns against a false system of worship—the beast and his image—and alerts us to the terrible consequence of rejecting God's authority.

1.  **The Nature of the Warning:** This message draws a line in the sand. In the final conflict of earth's history, there will be no neutral ground. Every individual will align either with the government of God, symbolized by His seal (the Sabbath), or the government of the apostate power, symbolized by the mark of the beast (false worship and human tradition).
2.  **Wrath Without Mixture:** Throughout history, God’s judgments have always been "mixed" with mercy. Even in the Flood and the destruction of Sodom, mercy was offered until the last moment. However, this verse speaks of a time when mercy is withdrawn. The "wine of the wrath of God" represents the direct consequences of sin when the restraining Spirit of God is fully removed from the rebellious.
3.  **The Necessity of Righteousness:** Who can stand when mercy is no longer pleading? Only those who are covered by the righteousness of Christ. This is not merely a legal covering, but a transformative reality. Those who escape this wrath are described in verse 12 as those who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Their characters have been brought into harmony with God's law through the indwelling power of Christ.

**Definitions:**
*   **Wrath of God:** God's active opposition to sin and His final decision to allow sin to reap its full, destructive wages (Romans 6:23).
*   **Without Mixture:** Pure justice without the tempering influence of mercy or grace.

**[ILL]** Imagine a doctor who gives a patient medicine mixed with syrup to make it palatable and healing. This is God’s dealing with us during probation—judgment mixed with mercy. But if the patient persistently rejects the cure and chooses poison, a time comes when the doctor steps back. The cup the patient then drinks is the pure, unmixed result of their own choice—poison that leads to death.

### Q2. What is the wrath of God?

“And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God. ... And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth forever and ever.” (Revelation 15:1, 7)

**Answer:**

The Scriptures define this specific outpouring of wrath as the "seven last plagues."

1.  **The Fullness of Indignation:** The phrase "filled up" indicates that the cup of iniquity is full. The world has reached the limit of God's forbearance. Just as the Amorites' iniquity eventually became "full" (Genesis 15:16), so the world will eventually fill its cup of rebellion.
2.  **Vindication of God:** These plagues are not an arbitrary temper tantrum by the Creator. They are the necessary vindication of His law. They demonstrate to the universe the true nature of sin and the justice of God in finally destroying it.
3.  **The Need for Shelter:** Just as the Israelites were sheltered by the blood on the doorpost during the plagues of Egypt, God's people will be sheltered by the "blood of the Lamb." But this shelter must be entered *before* the plagues begin.

**[ILL]** A dam holds back a mighty river, protecting the valley below. For years, the engineers reinforce the dam (God’s restraining grace). But if the inhabitants of the valley persistently demand the removal of the dam, eventually the engineers step aside. The flood that follows is the natural result of the water's power, unleashed because the protection was rejected.

### Q3. Will there be any service in the heavenly temple while these plagues are being poured out?

“And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.” (Revelation 15:8)

**Answer:**

This is one of the most critical points in understanding the plan of salvation and the sanctuary service.

1.  **End of Intercession:** In the earthly sanctuary service, the high priest went into the Most Holy Place once a year. When he came out, the work of atonement was finished. Revelation 15:8 shows us the heavenly antitype. When the temple fills with smoke, Christ’s ministry as our High Priest ceases. He steps out from between the Father and man.
2.  **No Man Able to Enter:** Currently, we have "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus" (Hebrews 10:19). The door of mercy is open. But when this event occurs, that door shuts. There is no longer a Mediator to plead for pardon.
3.  **The Importance of Character:** Since there is no Mediator during the plagues, God's people must stand in the sight of a holy God without an Intercessor. This does not mean they are sinless in their own strength, but that their sins have been blotted out and their characters fully solidified in Christ’s righteousness. They have partaken of the "latter rain" and are sealed against sin.

**Definitions:**
*   **Intercession:** The act of Jesus pleading the merits of His sacrifice on behalf of sinners in the presence of God (Hebrews 7:25).
*   **Probation:** The period of time granted to humanity to choose God and be transformed by His grace.

**[ILL]** Consider a court case. While the trial is ongoing, the defense attorney argues for the client, offering evidence and appeals. But once the judge bangs the gavel and reads the final verdict, the attorney sits down. The case is closed. No new evidence can be submitted. We are currently in the trial; soon the gavel will fall.

### Q4. Will probation have been closed for a period when Christ comes?

“He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly.” (Revelation 22:11, 12)

**Answer:**

Yes. Before Christ returns in the clouds of glory, there is a solemn decree that fixes the eternal destiny of every human being.

1.  **A Fixed Condition:** This decree marks the "Close of Probation." It is the point of no return. The character a person possesses at this moment remains their character forever.
2.  **Sanctification is a Present Work:** Many believe they will be made holy *when* Christ comes. But this text proves that we must be holy *before* He comes. The coming of Christ does not change character; it only fixes it. We must be "sanctified wholly" (1 Thessalonians 5:23) by the power of the Spirit *now*, while the High Priest is still ministering.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** To be declared "righteous still" and "holy still" means the believer has allowed Christ to live out His life in them fully. They have not only received imputed righteousness (forgiveness) but have cooperated with imparted righteousness (sanctification) to the point where they would rather die than sin.

**Definitions:**
*   **Sanctification:** The process of God’s grace imparting the life of Christ to the believer, resulting in obedience and holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]** When a potter puts a clay vessel into the kiln, the fire does not change the shape of the pot; it permanently hardens the shape it already has. If the pot is crooked when it goes into the fire, it comes out crooked and unchangeable. If it is molded perfectly by the potter's hand before the fire, it comes out permanently beautiful. We are the clay; now is the time of molding. The close of probation is the fire that fixes our shape.

### Q5. What will be the first plague, and on whom will it fall?

“And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.” (Revelation 16:2)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Target:** The plagues are not indiscriminate. The first plague specifically targets those who have rejected God's seal (the Sabbath) and accepted the mark of the beast (human authority in worship).
2.  **The Nature of the Plague:** "Noisome" means foul or offensive; "grievous" means painful. This physical ailment reflects the spiritual corruption within. Those who thought to save their lives by compromising with the beast power now find their lives made miserable by that very compromise.
3.  **God’s Protection:** It is implied that those who do *not* have the mark—the faithful remnant—are shielded from this sore. Psalm 91:3 promises deliverance from the "noisome pestilence."

---

### Q6. How many will worship the beast?

“And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life.” (Revelation 13:8)

**Answer:**

1.  **Universal Apostasy:** Eventually, the entire world will be polarized into two camps. There will be no "non-religious" bystanders. Everyone will worship either the Creator or the beast.
2.  **The Book of Life:** The only safety is to have one's name retained in the Book of Life. This is the registry of those who have accepted Jesus Christ, who have confessed their sins, and who are clothed in His righteousness.
3.  **Victory by Faith:** To refuse to worship the beast when the whole world is doing so requires a faith that endures seeing Him who is invisible (Hebrews 11:27). It requires the "faith of Jesus"—the same quality of trust and dependence on the Father that Christ possessed.

**[ILL]** In a strong current, dead fish float downstream with the water. It takes a living fish to swim upstream against the current. In the last days, the current of popular opinion and coercion will be overwhelming. Only those alive in Christ (Galatians 2:20) will be able to swim against the stream.

---

### Q7. What will constitute the second plague?

“And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea.” (Revelation 16:3)

**Answer:**

1.  **Total Devastation of the Sea:** The sea turns into a coagulated, rotting substance like the blood of a corpse.
2.  **Economic Collapse:** The sea is the highway of nations and the source of much of the world's food and economy. This plague strikes at the heart of global commerce and sustenance, showing the frailty of the world system that the wicked trusted in.

---

### Q8. What will be the third plague?

“And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.” (Revelation 16:4)

**Answer:**

1.  **Fresh Water Destroyed:** The second plague struck the oceans; the third strikes the fresh water sources—rivers and springs.
2.  **Essential for Life:** Humans can survive weeks without food, but only days without water. This plague brings humanity to the brink of extinction.
3.  **Dependence on God:** For the wicked, there is no water. But for the righteous, the promise is sure: "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure" (Isaiah 33:16). God provided water from a rock for Israel; He will provide for His people again.

---

### Q9. Why will the Lord give them blood to drink?

“For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.” (Revelation 16:6)

**Answer:**

1.  **Retributive Justice:** The angel of the waters declares God's righteousness. The punishment fits the crime. The wicked enacted laws to kill God's people (Revelation 13:15) and have historically shed the blood of the martyrs.
2.  **Intent is Guilt:** Even if the wicked in the last generation have not yet physically martyred the saints, they have agreed with the decree to do so. In God's eyes, the intent to murder is equivalent to the act (1 John 3:15). They thirsted for the blood of the saints; now they have blood to drink.

**[ILL]** If a man attempts to shoot another but the gun jams, the law still charges him with attempted murder. The intent was there. The wicked in the last days fully intend to wipe out the Sabbath-keeping remnant. God judges them based on that murderous intent.

---

### Q10. What will the fourth plague bring?

“And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. And men were scorched with great heat.” (Revelation 16:8, 9)

**Answer:**

1.  **Solar Intensity:** The sun, which normally warms and gives life, becomes an instrument of torture.
2.  **A Rebuke to False Worship:** The "mark of the beast" involves the enforcement of Sunday observance—a day historically associated with sun worship. God uses the very object of their false reverence (the sun) to punish them.
3.  **No Repentance:** Verse 9 notes that despite this agony, they "blasphemed the name of God... and repented not to give him glory." This proves that probation has closed. Suffering no longer leads to repentance; it only hardens the heart of those who have permanently rejected the Spirit.

---

### Q11. What will be the effect of the fifth?

“And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain.” (Revelation 16:10)

**Answer:**

1.  **Targeting the Authority:** This plague strikes the "seat" (throne or center of authority) of the beast. It reveals the powerlessness of the antichrist system to protect its own followers.
2.  **Supernatural Darkness:** Like the plague of darkness in Egypt (Exodus 10:21-23), this is a darkness that can be felt. It represents the spiritual darkness they chose, now made physical.
3.  **Terror and Pain:** The combination of the sores (from the first plague), the heat (from the fourth), and now this terrifying darkness causes the wicked to gnaw their tongues in agony. Yet, they still curse God.

---

### Q12. What promise applies at this time to those who have loved the truth?

“A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.” (Psalm 91:7-10)

**Answer:**

1.  **Absolute Security:** In the midst of falling thousands, the child of God is safe. This is not because of their own strength, but because they have made the Most High their "habitation."
2.  **Abiding in Christ:** To make God your habitation means to live in constant communion with Him. "Abide in me, and I in you" (John 15:4).
3.  **The Blood of the Covenant:** Just as the blood on the doorposts in Egypt kept the destroyer out, the blood of Christ applied to the heart—and the seal of God in the forehead—protects the believer from the seven last plagues.

**[ILL]** During a raging hurricane, a sturdy storm shelter offers peace and safety. The storm destroys everything outside, but inside the shelter, there is calm. Christ is that shelter. If we are "in Christ" by faith, the storm of God's wrath passes over us, falling only on those outside the shelter.

### Q13. What takes place under the sixth plague?

“And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared.” (Revelation 16:12)

**Answer:**

1.  **Symbolic Euphrates:** In ancient times, the River Euphrates supported the literal city of Babylon. In prophecy, waters represent "peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues" (Revelation 17:15). The drying up of the Euphrates symbolizes the withdrawal of human support for "Babylon the Great" (the false religious system).
2.  **Kings of the East:** This points to the deliverance of God's people. In history, Cyrus came from the east, dried up the literal Euphrates, and conquered Babylon to free Israel. Christ is the true "King of the East" (coming like lightning from the east, Matthew 24:27) who comes to conquer spiritual Babylon and deliver His saints.
3.  **Armageddon:** This plague prepares the world for the final battle of Armageddon—not a political war in the Middle East, but the final spiritual conflict between the forces of Christ and the forces of Satan.

### Q14. When the seventh angel pours out his vial, what is heard?

“And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.” (Revelation 16:17)

**Answer:**

1.  **"It is Done":** This declaration marks the absolute conclusion of earth's history of sin. It mirrors Christ’s words on the cross, "It is finished." The great controversy is effectively over; the victory is won.
2.  **The Voice of Authority:** This voice comes from the throne. It is the voice of God the Father confirming the work is complete.

---

### Q15. Whose is this voice?

“The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation; He shall mightily roar upon His habitation; He shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.” (Jeremiah 25:30)

**Answer:**

The voice belongs to the Lord God Almighty.

1.  **The Roar of the Lion:** God is often described as the "Lion of the tribe of Judah." A lion roars before it strikes. This represents the terrible majesty of God asserting His rightful authority over a rebellious planet.
2.  **Treading the Grapes:** This imagery connects to Revelation 14:19-20, describing the "winepress of the wrath of God." It signifies the final judgment where evil is crushed.

---

### Q16. What then takes place?

“And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.” (Revelation 16:18)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Great Earthquake:** This is the physical dismantling of the earth’s surface. The "foundations of the earth" are shaken (Isaiah 24:18-20).
2.  **Complete Upheaval:** Every island flees away and mountains are not found (Revelation 16:20). The topography of the sin-cursed earth is broken up in preparation for the recreation of the New Earth.

---

### Q17. What accompanies the earthquake?

“And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.” (Revelation 16:21)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Hail of Judgment:** Hailstones weighing a talent (approx. 75-100 lbs) fall from the sky.
2.  **Law and Penalty:** In the Old Testament, the penalty for blasphemy and idolatry was stoning (Leviticus 24:16). Here, the law of God, which men have trampled upon, demands execution. God Himself "stones" the rebellious earth with great hail.
3.  **Final Hardness of Heart:** Even under this crushing judgment, men blaspheme. This confirms that God is just in destroying them; they are beyond redemption.

---

### Q18. What will the people of God do in this time?

“The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.” (Joel 3:16)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Hope of His People:** While the earth is crumbling and the wicked are perishing, the righteous are calm. Their hope is not in earthly bunkers or human strength, but in the Lord.
2.  **Supernatural Strength:** The text says the Lord will be their "strength" (or harbor/refuge). They have already been "sealed" by the Holy Spirit. Their faith, tested in the fire of smaller trials, now holds firm in the final crisis.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith Realized:** This is the culmination of the gospel. A group of human beings, sinful by nature but transformed by grace, stand amidst the wreck of a world, trusting wholly in the merits of Jesus. They have "overcome by the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 12:11).

**[ILL]** When a ship is in a storm, the passengers are terrified. But if the Captain is the Master of the ocean, and the anchor holds firm within the veil, the ship is safe. The world is the storm; Christ is the Anchor.

---

### Q19. To prepare the people for this terrible time, what will the Lord send beforehand?

**Answer:**

The Third Angel's Message (Revelation 14:9-12).

1.  **The Final Warning:** God never executes judgment without first sending a warning. The Third Angel's Message is God's last appeal to humanity.
2.  **Content of the Message:** It warns against false worship (the beast), reveals the true standard of righteousness (commandments of God and faith of Jesus), and prepares a people to stand when the plagues fall.

---

### Q20. At the expiration of this message, what will take place?

**Answer:**

The close of probation, and the seven last plagues.

1.  **The End of Opportunity:** When the Third Angel's voice dies away, the work of the gospel is finished. The door of the ark is shut.
2.  **Urgency:** This highlights the incredible urgency of the present moment. We are living in the time of the message; soon comes the time of the result.

---

### Q21. What will then come upon those who have rejected that message?

“Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord; and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.” (Amos 8:11-12)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Famine for the Word:** Today, Bibles are cheap and accessible. The gospel is preached freely. But a time is coming when the Spirit will be withdrawn. Men will desperately want a word of hope or guidance from God, but they will not find it.
2.  **Too Late:** They do not seek the Word to obey it (repentance), but to escape the consequences of their sin (fear). But the time for salvation has passed.
3.  **Value the Bible Now:** This prophecy calls us to store the Word of God in our hearts *now* while it is available. "Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee" (Psalm 119:11).

---

### Q22. When the people shall thus cry for the bread of life, what will the Lord say to them?

“Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all My counsel, and would none of My reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.” (Proverbs 1:24-26)

**Answer:**

1.  **God's Long-Suffering:** Notice the text says God *called*, *stretched out His hand*, *counseled*, and *reproved*. He did everything possible to save them.
2.  **The Rejection:** The people "refused," "regarded not," and "set at nought" His love.
3.  **The Result:** The language of God "laughing" is not cruelty; it is the expression of the absurdity of the situation. It is the divine irony that created beings thought they could exist without the Source of Life. When they finally face the reality they chose, their fear is absolute, and God can no longer help them because they have destroyed their own capacity for faith.

---

### Q23. How does the Saviour represent the condition of such?

“When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are.” (Luke 13:25)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Shut Door:** This recalls the days of Noah. When God shut the door of the ark, no amount of pounding or crying could open it (Genesis 7:16).
2.  **"I Know You Not":** This is the most tragic phrase in Scripture. Salvation is based on a relationship—knowing and being known by Christ (John 17:3).
3.  **Relationship vs. Profession:** These people call Him "Lord, Lord." They claim to be Christians. But they never surrendered their will to Him. They never allowed His righteousness to replace their sinfulness. They sought the kingdom, but not the King.

**Definitions:**
*   **To Know God:** In Scripture, this implies intimate, covenant relationship and experience, not just intellectual knowledge (Adam "knew" Eve).

**[ILL]** You cannot buy fire insurance for your house *after* it has already burned down. You cannot build a relationship with a stranger in the moment of crisis if you ignored him for a lifetime. We must know Jesus *now*.

---

### Q24. Is not the third angel's message, then, an important one for this generation?

**Answer:**

It is the message of life and death. It is the "present truth" (2 Peter 1:12) for this hour. It is the only message that prepares a people to stand blameless before God without an intercessor, covered by the robe of Christ's righteousness, protected in the day of slaughter, and ready to meet their Lord in peace. To ignore it is to choose the plagues; to accept it is to choose the seal of the living God.
