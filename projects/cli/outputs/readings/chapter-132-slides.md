## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s View of Pride
- **Question:** How does God look upon pride?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 8:13 – “The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Nature of Pride
- **The Root of Rebellion:**
  - Pride is not merely a flaw; it is the essence of sin and the spirit of Satan.
  - Isaiah 14:13–14 – “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the most High.”
- **The Barrier to Faith:**
  - Pride acts as an iron gate against the Holy Spirit.
  - A proud heart feels no need for a Saviour, repentance, or the atonement provided in the sanctuary.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Righteousness by Faith is trusting wholly in Christ for salvation.
  - Pride is the opposite of faith because it trusts in self.
  - Habakkuk 2:4 – “Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Poisoned Tree:**
  - Imagine a tree that looks healthy on the outside, but its roots are soaking up poison.
  - Eventually, the fruit becomes toxic.
  - **Lesson:** Pride is poison in the root system of the heart.
  - Even if outward actions look "good," if the motive is self-glory, the fruit is unacceptable to God.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Deception of Pride
- **Question:** How does pride in the heart operate on the possessor?
- **Key Text:** Obadiah 3 – “The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high: that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?”

## Slide 5 – Q2: False Security
- **Self-Deception:**
  - Like the Edomites in their mountain fortresses, pride makes a sinner feel safe in their own morality.
  - They feel secure while in danger of eternal loss.
- **The Laodicean Condition:**
  - Pride blinds us to our spiritual nakedness.
  - Revelation 3:17 – “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”
- **Resistance to Conviction:**
  - The proud heart asks, "Who shall bring me down?"
  - This attitude prevents the Holy Spirit from convicting the heart of sin (John 16:8).
- **Key Insight:**
  - We can only receive Christ's righteousness when we admit our own deeds are "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration
- **Refusing the Light:**
  - Consider a man walking on a cliff's edge in the dark.
  - A guide offers a light, but the man proudly refuses, believing he knows the way.
  - **Lesson:** His confidence does not save him; it ensures his fall.
  - Pride is the refusal of the Light of the World (John 8:12).

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Error of the Pharisees
- **Question:** In what way were the proud Pharisees deceived?
- **Key Text:** Luke 16:15 – “And He said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Self-Justification vs. God’s Justification
- **Outward vs. Inward:**
  - Men judge by appearance; God judges the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).
  - Good deeds done for self-glory are an "abomination" because they use holy things for self-worship.
- **Understanding Justification:**
  - **Self-Justification:** Declaring oneself righteous based on performance.
  - **True Justification:** A legal act where God declares a sinner righteous solely through Christ.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”
- **The Fundamental Error:**
  - Human esteem is an abomination because it suggests human effort can satisfy God's holy Law.
  - Only the renewed heart can produce the love the Law requires (Romans 8:7).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Counterfeit Coin:**
  - You can polish a counterfeit coin until it shines like gold.
  - It may fool a stranger or a child.
  - However, when taken to the bank (the judgment), the expert sees it is base metal.
  - **Lesson:** God looks past the polish of our outward profession to the metal of our character.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Great Reversal
- **Question:** What does the Saviour say of those who exalt themselves through their pride of heart?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:11 – “For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Principles
- **The Law of the Kingdom:**
  - The world promotes self-exaltation; the Kingdom of Grace operates on self-sacrificing love.
  - Climbing the ladder of pride is descending into darkness.
- **The Example of Christ:**
  - Philippians 2:8 – “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”
  - Because He humbled Himself, God highly exalted Him.
- **Emptying the Vessel:**
  - God cannot fill a vessel that is already full of self.
  - We must be emptied (abased) so the Holy Spirit can fill us.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Well Buckets:**
  - Two buckets in a well are connected by a rope.
  - For one to go down into the water to be filled, the other must go up.
  - **Lesson:** We cannot be filled with "living water" unless we go down into humility.
  - If we insist on staying "high," we remain empty.

## Slide 13 – Q5: True Greatness
- **Question:** What did He say to those disciples of His whom He found disputing as to who should be greatest among them?
- **Key Text:** Mark 9:35 – “And He sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Sanctified Service
- **The Cure for Ambition:**
  - The desire to be "first" causes strife and division.
  - The remedy is to voluntarily take the position of a servant.
- **Understanding Sanctification:**
  - Sanctification is becoming more like Jesus.
  - Since Jesus is a servant, sanctification means growing in the spirit of service.
- **Practical Application:**
  - Instead of asking, "How can people serve me?" we must ask, "How can I lift the burden of others?"
  - Galatians 6:2 – “Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Wolf vs. The Family:**
  - In a wolf pack, the leader fights to the top to eat first.
  - In a loving family, parents often eat last to ensure children are fed.
  - **Lesson:** The wolf represents the kingdom of force and pride.
  - The parent represents the Kingdom of God.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Humility of a Child
- **Question:** In what way did He illustrate true humility to His disciples?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:2, 3 – “And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of them, and said... Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Characteristics
- **Conversion Required:**
  - We must "turn around" from self-reliance to God-reliance.
- **Traits of the Child:**
  - **Helplessness:** Trusts parents completely for provision.
  - **Teachable:** Believes without cynical questioning.
  - **No Merit:** Has no career achievements to boast of.
- **Connection to Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We must accept salvation as a child accepts a gift.
  - We cannot "earn" heaven; we depend entirely on the merits of our Father.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration
- **The Lifeguard:**
  - A drowning man must stop struggling to be saved.
  - If he tries to "help" the lifeguard by swimming his own way, he may drown them both.
  - **Lesson:** We must humble ourselves, stop our own struggling, and let Christ carry us.

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Contrite Heart
- **Question:** Among all those who profess to love the Lord, toward whom will He favorably look?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 66:2 – “To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Spiritual Conditions
- **Poor in Spirit:**
  - Recognizing spiritual bankruptcy; we have no righteousness of our own (Matthew 5:3).
- **Contrite Spirit:**
  - A heart "crushed" or broken over the pain sin has caused God.
  - Not just fear of punishment, but grief over rebellion against Love.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - We are in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
  - Leviticus 23:27 – “Also on the tenth day of this seventh month... ye shall afflict your souls.”
  - Now is the time for deep soul-searching and humility.

## Slide 21 – Q8: The Dwelling Place of God
- **Question:** With whom will the Lord dwell?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 57:15 – “I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Imparted Righteousness
- **Two Sanctuaries:**
  - God dwells in the "high and holy place" (Heavenly Sanctuary).
  - He also dwells in the "humble spirit" (Sanctuary of the heart).
- **The Purpose:**
  - He dwells with us "to revive."
  - Sin kills; God’s presence brings life.
- **Christ in You:**
  - Colossians 1:27 – “To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”
  - When pride leaves, the Spirit enters to impart the life of Jesus for victory over sin.

## Slide 23 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Dewdrop:**
  - The sun is a massive ball of fire millions of miles away.
  - Yet, a tiny dewdrop can reflect the entire image of the sun.
  - **Lesson:** The High and Lofty One can be reflected in the lowliest human heart that is open to Him.

## Slide 24 – Q9: Grace and Humility
- **Question:** While thus honoring the humble, what course will He take with the proud?
- **Key Text:** James 4:6 – “But He giveth more grace. Wherefore He saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: The Mechanics of Grace
- **God Resists the Proud:**
  - Pride is incompatible with God’s character and government.
  - God must resist the proud just as a doctor resists a disease.
- **Grace Definition:**
  - Grace is not just forgiveness; it is enabling power (2 Corinthians 12:9).
  - The humble admit helplessness; God responds with power.
- **Victory:**
  - When we say, "Lord, I cannot defeat this enemy," He fights for us.
  - 2 Chronicles 20:15 – “Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Illustration
- **Water and the Valley:**
  - Water always flows to the lowest point.
  - It bypasses the mountain peaks and settles in the valleys.
  - **Lesson:** To receive the "living water" of grace, we must go low. We must be the valley, not the peak.

## Slide 27 – Q10: Exaltation in Due Time
- **Question:** What will the Lord do for him who humbles himself?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 5:6 – “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: Submission and Trust
- **Under the Mighty Hand:**
  - God's hand may press us through discipline or trials.
  - Humility accepts this shaping process; pride rebels.
- **In Due Time:**
  - We often want vindication now. God knows the perfect time.
  - Joseph waited years in a dungeon; Jesus endured the cross before exaltation.
- **True Exaltation:**
  - Not worldly fame, but character perfection.
  - Revelation 1:6 – “And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: The Day of the Lord
- **Question:** In the time of man's final exaltation (1 Thess. 4:16, 17) what will befall the proud and lofty?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 2:12 – “For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon everyone that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low.”

## Slide 30 – Q11: The End of Pride
- **The Final Judgment:**
  - At the Second Coming, all human distinctions (wealth, rank, power) vanish.
  - Pride, the source of rebellion, must be eradicated for peace to be restored.
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - We live in the time of judgment.
  - Daniel 5:27 – “TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.”
  - Now is the time to humble our souls before the High Priest completes His work.

## Slide 31 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Storm:**
  - In a hurricane, stiff oak trees often snap because they resist the wind.
  - Grass and bending willows bow low and survive.
  - **Lesson:** In the coming storm of the Day of the Lord, only those who bow before God will stand.

## Slide 32 – Q12: God Alone Exalted
- **Question:** Who alone will then be exalted?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 2:17 – “And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.”

## Slide 33 – Q12: The Song of the Redeemed
- **Righteousness by Faith Triumphant:**
  - Salvation is "of the Lord" (Jonah 2:9).
  - Human merit plays no part; Christ justifies and sanctifies.
- **The Song of Moses and the Lamb:**
  - The redeemed do not sing of their own works.
  - Revelation 15:3–4 – “Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty... for thou only art holy.”
- **The Result:**
  - When self is dethroned and Christ is enthroned, the result is perfect peace.

## Slide 34 – Q12: Illustration
- **Sun and Stars:**
  - When the sun rises, the stars fade from view.
  - The stars are there, but the sun's glory outshines them completely.
  - **Lesson:** In eternity, God's glory will be so bright that no human glory will be visible. We will be happy to be hidden in Christ.
