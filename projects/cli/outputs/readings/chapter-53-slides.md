## Slide 1 – Q1: The Dragon Symbol
- **Question:** What symbol is introduced in Rev. 12:3?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:3 – “And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and, behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Spirit and The Agent
- **The Spirit Behind the Symbol:**
  - The dragon is primarily identified as Satan.
  - Revelation 12:9 – “And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.”
- **The Earthly Agent:**
  - In prophecy, dragons represent earthly powers used by Satan.
  - Jeremiah 51:34 – “Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me... he hath swallowed me up like a dragon...”
  - Ezekiel 29:3 – “...Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers...”
  - Contextually, this applies to **Pagan Rome**, the power ruling when Christ was born.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Nature of Conflict
- **The Conflict:**
  - The color red denotes bloodshed and persecution in Satan’s war against God’s people.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - This is the cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan regarding the character of God, His law, and His sovereignty.
  - Satan operates through earthly governments to challenge God's government.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Puppet and the Master**
  - A puppet master remains hidden behind the curtain, but the puppet on stage moves according to his will.
  - While the Roman Empire (the puppet) was the visible force oppressing the world, the hands pulling the strings belonged to Satan (the master).
  - Satan hates the image of God in humanity and uses political powers to attack it.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Time of Application
- **Question:** At what time in the world's history did this symbol apply?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:1 – “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Woman and the Sun
- **The Symbol:** The Woman represents the Church, the bride of Christ.
  - Jeremiah 6:2 – “I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.”
  - 2 Corinthians 11:2 – “For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.”
- **Clothed with the Sun:**
  - Represents the New Testament church in the full light of the gospel.
  - She shines with the brilliance of Christ, the "Sun of Righteousness."
  - Malachi 4:2 – “But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings...”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Moon, Stars, and Justification
- **The Moon Under Her Feet:**
  - Represents the Old Testament sacrificial system. It has no light of its own but reflects the Sun (Christ).
  - It is foundational but surpassed by the reality of Christ.
- **Crown of Twelve Stars:**
  - Represents the twelve apostles, the spiritual fathers of the NT church.
- **Righteousness by Faith (Justification):**
  - The church is "clothed" with Christ’s righteousness, not her own.
  - Isaiah 61:10 – “...for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness...”
  - Romans 3:22 – “Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Dragon’s Intent
- **Question:** What did the dragon design to do to the child about to be born to the church?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:4 – “And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Target and Motivation
- **The Target:**
  - The "Man Child" is Jesus Christ.
  - Satan aimed to destroy the Saviour before His mission could break the power of sin.
- **The Motivation:**
  - Satan's hatred is directed against the **Law of God**.
  - Jesus came to magnify the law and show that obedience is possible through dependence on the Father.
  - Isaiah 42:21 – “The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Rebel General**
  - Imagine a rebel general who knows the rightful King has a cure for a deadly plague used to control the people.
  - The general will stop at nothing to destroy the Cure-bearer before He enters the city.
  - Satan, the rebel, sought to destroy Christ, the Cure for sin, to maintain his claim that God’s law is unjust.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Child’s Destiny
- **Question:** What became of the child?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:5 – “And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to His throne.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Ascension and Ministry
- **Caught Up:**
  - Refers to Christ's ascension to the Heavenly Sanctuary.
  - Acts 1:9 – “And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.”
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Christ entered the Holy Place to begin His work as High Priest and Mediator.
  - Hebrews 8:1–2 – “...We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points
- **Rule with a Rod of Iron:**
  - Indicates absolute authority. He is a Lamb to the repentant, but a King to the rebellious.
  - Psalm 2:9 – “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.”
- **Mediation:**
  - Jesus stands between the Holy God and sinful man.
  - 1 Timothy 2:5 – “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Attempt on Christ’s Life
- **Question:** Who sought to slay Christ as soon as He was born?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 2:16 – “Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under...”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points
- **Historical Fulfillment:**
  - Herod the Great acted as a representative of **Pagan Rome** (the Dragon).
  - He used the civil power of the state to attempt to destroy the spiritual deliverer.
- **Method of the Enemy:**
  - Force, violence, and state decrees are the dragon’s tools.
  - Christ’s kingdom advances by love, truth, and free choice.
- **Providence:**
  - God protected His Son; no earthly power can thwart the plan of salvation.

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Beast from the Sea
- **Question:** What symbol was next seen by the prophet?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:1 – “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Identity and Blasphemy
- **Identity:**
  - Represents the **Papacy** (Civil-Religious system) rising from the ruins of Pagan Rome.
- **The Sea:**
  - Represents multitudes and populated areas (Europe).
  - Revelation 17:15 – “...The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.”
- **Name of Blasphemy:**
  - Defined as man claiming the power to forgive sins (Mark 2:7) or claiming to be God (John 10:33).
  - This power claims the prerogatives of God and institutes an earthly priesthood that obscures Christ’s heavenly ministry.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Source of Power
- **Question:** From what did this government receive its seat and power?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:2 – “And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points
- **Transfer of Authority:**
  - The Papacy received its authority from the Dragon (Pagan Rome).
  - Constantine moved the capital to Constantinople (AD 330), leaving the Bishop of Rome to fill the void in the West.
- **Historical Confirmation:**
  - Justinian’s decree (AD 533) and the defeat of the Ostrogoths (AD 538) gave the Papacy civil power.
  - Though claiming to be the church of Christ, its "seat" and "authority" came from the political empire that sought to kill Christ.

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Deadly Wound
- **Question:** What was to happen to this beast?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:3 – “And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Wound and Healing
- **The Wound:**
  - Loss of civil power and political supremacy.
  - The inability to enforce religious decrees through the state.
- **The Healing:**
  - A predicted restoration of global influence.
  - The union of church and state is restored.
- **World Wondering:**
  - The world looks to this power for moral and political leadership today.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Venomous Creature**
  - A venomous creature may be struck a heavy blow that renders it unconscious or seemingly dead.
  - If the life is not extinguished, it may revive, and its bite becomes dangerous again.
  - The "life" of this beast is the union of church and state; when that union is restored, the beast lives again.

## Slide 23 – Q9: Cause of the Wound
- **Question:** How was this wounding to be brought about?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:10 – “He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points
- **Divine Retribution:**
  - God’s law of sowing and reaping applies to nations.
  - This power used the "sword" of the state to persecute; it would be brought down by the "sword" of the state.
- **The Agency:**
  - War and captivity (military force) inflicted this specific political wound.

## Slide 25 – Q10: Persecution of Saints
- **Question:** Had the papacy led others into captivity?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:7 – “And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Victory and Faith
- **War with the Saints:**
  - For 1260 years, millions were martyred for holding to the Bible alone.
- **Spiritual Victory:**
  - Though "overcome" physically, they were victorious spiritually.
  - Revelation 12:11 – “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - True faith produces a character that prefers death to disobedience.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “...I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Timing of the Wound
- **Question:** When was the papal head wounded by being taken into captivity?
- **Historical Note:** In 1798, the French army under Berthier abolished the papacy in Rome and carried Pope Pius VI captive.

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points
- **Prophetic Timing:**
  - The deadly wound occurred in **1798**.
  - This marks the end of the 1260-year prophecy (538 AD – 1798 AD).
- **Loss of Sovereignty:**
  - The church lost its status as a sovereign political power capable of enforcing its will on other nations.

## Slide 29 – Q12: The Second Beast
- **Question:** At that time what additional symbol was seen by the prophet?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:11 – “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Identity and Origin
- **Identity:**
  - Represents the **United States of America**.
  - Seen rising exactly as the first beast went into captivity (1798).
- **"Out of the Earth":**
  - Unlike the sea (crowded nations), "earth" represents a relatively uninhabited area.
  - The US arose in the New World, away from the crowded, war-torn monarchies of Europe.
- **Providence:**
  - God provided a refuge where the church could find freedom to spread the final gospel message.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Historical Growth
- **Question:** Has the United States "come up" sufficiently to warrant the application of the prophecy to this country?
- **Key Text:** (Historical application based on Rev 13:11)

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points
- **Rapid Rise:**
  - The Greek word for "coming up" implies growing like a plant.
  - The US grew from a few colonies in 1776 to a global superpower.
- **Fulfillment:**
  - No other nation fits the specifications:
    - Rising in the New World.
    - Appearing around 1798.
    - Growing into a dominant world power.

## Slide 33 – Q14: The Lamb-like Horns
- **Question:** What do the "two horns like a lamb" represent?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:11 – “...and he had two horns like a lamb...”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Principles of Liberty
- **Lamb-like Character:**
  - Symbolizes youth, innocence, and gentleness.
  - Mimics the spirit of Christ in the political sphere: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (2 Corinthians 3:17).
- **Two Horns:**
  - Represents **Civil Liberty** (Republicanism) and **Religious Liberty** (Protestantism).
  - The absence of crowns indicates a government without a king and a church without a pope.
- **Application:**
  - True righteousness is voluntary. A "Lamb-like" government protects the conscience.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Flower and the Sun**
  - The sun cannot be forced to shine, nor a flower forced to bloom.
  - Likewise, the heart cannot be forced to love God.
  - The "Lamb-like" principles protect the garden of the heart so that faith may grow freely, without the iron boot of the state crushing it.

## Slide 36 – Q15: The Change of Voice
- **Question:** Notwithstanding the lamb-like pretensions of this power, what is it ultimately to do?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:11 – “...and he spake as a dragon.”

## Slide 37 – Q15: Key Points
- **Speaking:**
  - A nation "speaks" through its laws and legislative acts.
- **The Dragon's Voice:**
  - As seen earlier, the dragon represents the use of force and persecution.
- **The Contradiction:**
  - While retaining the *appearance* of a lamb (professing Christianity), the nation will eventually deny the power thereof.
  - 2 Timothy 3:5 – “Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.”

## Slide 38 – Q16: The Image to the Beast
- **Question:** What will he say?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:14 – “Saying unto them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.”

## Slide 39 – Q16: Key Points
- **The Image:**
  - A replica of the Papal system: Apostate Protestantism uniting with the State.
  - It seeks government aid to enforce religious decrees.
- **Ecumenical Danger:**
  - Requires fragmented churches to unite on common points and seek civil power.
- **Sanctification vs. Force:**
  - Legalism (the Dragon) tries to force the law from the outside.
  - The Gospel (the Lamb) writes the law on the heart through the Spirit.

## Slide 40 – Q17: Persecution Returns
- **Question:** When the image to the beast has been formed in the United States, what will follow?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:15 – “And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.”

## Slide 41 – Q17: Key Points
- **Giving Life:**
  - The active use of civil penalties to punish dissenters.
- **The Death Decree:**
  - The conflict over worship becomes a matter of life and death.
  - Parallels Daniel 3: Refusing to bow to the golden image.
- **The Final Test:**
  - Reveals those who trust in Christ's righteousness.
  - Colossians 3:3 – “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”

## Slide 42 – Q18: Deception by Miracles
- **Question:** How are the people to be led to form the image to the beast?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:14 – “And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast.”

## Slide 43 – Q18: Key Points
- **Spiritualism:**
  - Satan works with "lying wonders."
  - 2 Thessalonians 2:9 – “Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders.”
- **False Evidence:**
  - People will be convinced by their senses ("I saw a miracle") rather than Scripture.
- **Sanctuary Safeguard:**
  - We must be grounded in the Most Holy Place experience—the Law of God and the Atonement—to detect counterfeits.

## Slide 44 – Q18: Illustration
- **The Counterfeit Bank Note**
  - A counterfeit note may look perfect to the eye and feel crisp to the touch.
  - Only those who know the specific security markers can detect the fraud.
  - The Bible is our detector; miracles alone are not proof, for even Egyptian magicians mimicked Moses.

## Slide 45 – Q19: Extent of Power
- **Question:** How much power will be exercised in the matter?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:12 – “And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.”

## Slide 46 – Q19: Key Points
- **Global Authority:**
  - The US exercises "all the power" to enforce homage to the Papacy.
- **Forced Worship:**
  - The issue is worship.
  - The world is led to honor the "man of sin" by observing his institutions (specifically the Sunday sabbath).

## Slide 47 – Q20: The Mark of the Beast
- **Question:** What will the two-horned beast power try to enforce on the people?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:16 – “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads.”

## Slide 48 – Q20: Key Points
- **The Forehead:**
  - Represents the mind and conscience.
  - Hebrews 10:16 – “...I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them...”
- **The Hand:**
  - Represents actions, labor, or convenience.
  - Ecclesiastes 9:10 – “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might...”
- **The Contrast:**
  - God’s Seal is only in the forehead (Rev 7:3)—it requires settled conviction.
  - The Beast accepts the hand—mere outward compliance.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The man living by faith cannot be coerced. To accept the Mark is to break God's Law to obey man.

## Slide 49 – Q21: Economic Boycott
- **Question:** How far is this to be carried?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:17 – “And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”

## Slide 50 – Q21: Key Points
- **No Buy or Sell:**
  - Faithful believers are cut off from earthly support.
  - They must depend totally on God: Isaiah 33:16 – “...bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.”
- **The Logic of Persecution:**
  - When arguments fail, force is the last resort of false religion.
- **The Time of Trouble:**
  - This trial refines the saints and proves their faith is not for material gain, but out of love for their Redeemer.
