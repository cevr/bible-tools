Here is the slide deck for the "Day of the Lord" Bible study.

## Slide 1 – Q1: Character of the Day of the Lord
- **Question:** What is the character of the "day of the Lord?
- **Key Text:** Zephaniah 1:14, 15 – “The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord; the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: A Time of Accounting
- **Not a Secret Rapture:** The Scriptures present this not as a time of universal peace, but as a solemn period of divine intervention.
- **Divine Justice:** It marks the transition from human probation to the execution of God’s justice.
- **A Day of Wrath:**
  - This is not an emotional outburst, but the settled, righteous antagonism of a holy God toward sin.
  - For those clinging to sin, their "shelter of lies" is swept away (Isaiah 28:17 – “Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.”).
- **Urgency:** The repetition "it is near, it is near" indicates that the time to make peace with God is now.

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Only Safety
- **Hope for the Humble:** While the "mighty man" cries bitterly, there is hope for the meek.
- **Seeking the Hiding Place:**
  - Zephaniah 2:3 – “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth... seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.”
  - This hiding place is found only in Christ Jesus.
- **Definition – Day of the Lord:** A prophetic time involving God's direct intervention to judge sin, deliver His people, and purify the earth (Joel 2:11; 2 Peter 3:10).
- **Definition – Probation:** The time granted to humanity to choose between God and rebellion before the final judgment is fixed.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Building Inspector:**
  - Imagine an inspector coming to examine a house foundation.
  - To the homeowner who built to code with solid materials, the inspection is a day of validation.
  - To the builder who cut corners and used rotten wood, the arrival is a day of "trouble and distress."
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The day of the Lord reveals what our characters are truly built of.
  - We must build on the solid Rock of Christ, not the shifting sand of self (Matthew 7:24–27).

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Sixth Seal
- **Question:** Under which of the seven seals does this time of wrath begin?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Revelation 6:12 – “And I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal.”
  - Revelation 6:17 – “For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?”

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Question of Standing
- **The Transition:** The first five seals cover church history (persecution and apostasy); the sixth seal shifts focus to cosmic signs of the Second Coming.
- **The Great Question:** "Who shall be able to stand?"
  - To stand before a holy God requires a holy character, which fallen humanity cannot generate alone.
- **Justification (Legal Right):**
  - God’s declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ’s merits.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”
- **Sanctification (Fitness):**
  - The imparted righteousness of Christ working in us to subdue sin.
  - Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)
- **Washed Robes:**
  - The only ones who can stand are those who have "washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 7:14).
- **Christ in Us:**
  - Believers do not trust in their own works.
  - They allow Christ to live His life of perfect obedience within them.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Deep Sea Diver:**
  - A diver cannot stand at the bottom of the ocean in their natural state; the pressure would crush them.
  - They must be encased in a specialized suit to withstand the pressure.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The "pressure" of God’s infinite holiness consumes sin instantly.
  - Only those "encased" in Christ—clothed in His righteousness and filled with His Spirit—can stand in that great day without being consumed.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Signs in the Heavens
- **Question:** What signs were to appear in the heavens under this seal?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:12, 13 – “The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Historical Fulfillment
- **God's Alarm Clock:** These signs were specific alerts that the "time of the end" had begun.
- **The Dark Day (May 19, 1780):**
  - A supernatural darkness covered New England and the Atlantic coast.
  - The sun was darkened, and the moon appeared as blood, fulfilling the prophecy.
- **The Falling of the Stars (November 13, 1833):**
  - The most spectacular meteoric shower ever recorded occurred.
  - It fulfilled the image of a fig tree casting untimely figs.
- **Purpose:** To signal that the investigative judgment was drawing near.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Order of Events
- **Question:** What great events were these signs to precede?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:29, 30 – “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points
- **The Sequence:**
  1.  **The Tribulation:** The 1260 years of papal supremacy (Dark Ages), cut short before 1798.
  2.  **The Signs:** The Dark Day (1780) and Falling Stars (1833) occurred "immediately after" the tribulation but before the end.
  3.  **The Second Coming:** The appearance of the Son of Man.
- **Two Reactions:**
  - **The Lost:** They mourn because they see the King but have no relationship with Him.
  - **The Saved:** They look up with joy.
  - Luke 21:28 – “And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Road Sign:**
  - Road signs like "Bridge Out - 1 Mile" are placed *before* the danger, not at it.
  - If you see the sign, you have time to stop. If you ignore it until you reach the chasm, it is too late.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - God gave the celestial signs (1780, 1833) to wake up the world *before* the end comes.
  - We must prepare now, while there is still time.

## Slide 14 – Q5: The Seventh Seal
- **Question:** Under which of the seven seals will the Lord come to earth?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 8:1 – “And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Silence in Heaven
- **Why Silence?**
  - Heaven is usually filled with praise. The silence occurs because the angelic hosts have left to accompany Jesus to earth.
  - Matthew 25:31 – “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory.”
- **Prophetic Time:**
  - In prophecy, a day represents a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6).
  - "Half an hour" is 1/48th of a day, representing about one literal week.
  - This suggests the duration of the Second Coming event itself.

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Wrath of God
- **Question:** How is the wrath of the day of the Lord to be manifested?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:1 – “And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Plagues & The Sanctuary
- **"Filled Up":** This phrase implies completion. These are final judgments on a world that has rejected the gospel.
- **Sanctuary Context:**
  - The plagues fall *after* probation closes.
  - Revelation 15:8 – “And the temple was filled with smoke... and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.”
  - This means Christ’s intercessory ministry has ceased.
- **Preparation Needed:**
  - Because there is no Intercessor during this time, God’s people must have the "seal of God."
  - Their characters must be cleansed *before* this time begins.

## Slide 18 – Q7: The Thief and the Garment
- **Question:** Are the most of these plagues to be poured out before the Lord comes?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:12-15 – “And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates... Behold, I come as a thief: Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Spiritual Nakedness
- **Sequential Plagues:** The text places Christ's warning during the sixth plague, just before the final battle (Armageddon).
- **Garments Symbolize Character:**
  - **Filthy garments:** Self-righteousness (Isaiah 64:6).
  - **White raiment:** The righteousness of Christ (Revelation 3:18).
- **Keeping the Garment:**
  - It is not enough to profess faith; we must "keep" our garments.
  - This implies an active vigilance against the stains of the world.
  - Revelation 3:5 – “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment...”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Temple Guard:**
  - In the ancient temple, the Captain of the guard made rounds at night.
  - If a Levite guard was found sleeping at his post, the Captain could strip off his clothes or set them on fire.
  - The guard would wake up in shame and nakedness.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - We are watchmen. If we sleep in spiritual apathy or secret sin, we risk being found "naked" when the Captain of our Salvation appears.

## Slide 21 – Q8: The Event of His Coming
- **Question:** What great event will take place at His coming?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: The First Resurrection
- **Audible and Visible:** The coming is not secret; it involves a "shout," "voice," and "trump."
- **The Resurrection of the Righteous:**
  - The "dead in Christ" rise first with glorified bodies (1 Corinthians 15:52).
  - This is the "First Resurrection" (Revelation 20:6).
- **The Separation:**
  - This event separates humanity forever: those who accepted the Life-giver vs. those who rejected Him.
  - The living righteous are caught up together with the resurrected saints.

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Millennium
- **Question:** How long after the righteous will the wicked be raised to life?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:4, 5 – “And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: The State of the Earth
- **The Timeline:**
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – Righteous are raised/taken to heaven.
  - 2 Thessalonians 2:8 – Living wicked are destroyed by the brightness of His coming.
  - Revelation 20:5 – The wicked dead stay in their graves for 1,000 years.
- **Desolate Earth:** The earth becomes a "bottomless pit" or abyss with no human inhabitants.
- **Work of the Saints:** The righteous reign with Christ in heaven, reviewing the records of judgment (1 Corinthians 6:2–3).

## Slide 25 – Q10: Satan Released
- **Question:** When the wicked come up again on the earth, what will they be incited to do?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:7, 8 – “And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: The Final Deception
- **The Second Resurrection:** At the end of the 1,000 years, the wicked are raised.
- **Satan Loosed:** He is "loosed" because he now has people to deceive again.
- **Fixed Character:**
  - The wicked awake with the same rebellious spirit they had when they died.
  - They are easily deceived into attacking the Holy City (New Jerusalem), proving that a second probation would not change their hearts.

## Slide 27 – Q11: The Final Fire
- **Question:** What will then take place?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:9 – “And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Executive Judgment
- **The Great White Throne:** Before the fire, every knee bows to acknowledge God's justice (Philippians 2:10–11).
- **Hell Fire:**
  - This is the biblical "hell fire"—a future event on the surface of the earth.
  - **"Devoured":** The text says the fire *consumes* them.
- **Purpose of the Fire:**
  - The goal is the eradication of sin, not the eternal perpetuation of it in torture.
  - Malachi 4:1 – “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven... and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble... that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Chaff and the Wheat:**
  - When a farmer burns chaff after harvest, the purpose is to clear the field.
  - He does not keep the chaff burning forever; he burns it *up*.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - God’s fire cleanses the universe. It does its work of destruction and then goes out, leaving a purified earth.

## Slide 30 – Q12: The Second Death
- **Question:** What is this lake of fire called?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 21:8 – “The lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”

## Slide 31 – Q12: Key Points
- **First vs. Second Death:**
  - **First Death:** A sleep resulting from Adam's fall; all are resurrected from this.
  - **Second Death:** The penal death for personal, unrepented sin. It is final.
- **God's Justice and Love:**
  - God is not a cruel tyrant who tortures enemies eternally.
  - He respects their choice to be separated from Him (the Source of Life).
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: The Earth Reserved
- **Question:** To what are the present heavens and earth reserved?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:7 – “But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Cleansing by Fire
- **Kept in Store:** Just as the ancient world was cleansed by water (Flood), the present world is reserved for cleansing by fire.
- **Perdition:** This refers to destruction or ruin. The fire targets "ungodly men" and the curse of sin.
- **Certainty:** The "same word" that created the world holds it for this final event.

## Slide 34 – Q14: Melting with Fervent Heat
- **Question:** But will the day of the Lord reach to, and include, the burning of the earth?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:10 – “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also; and the works that are therein shall be burned up.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: A New Beginning
- **Total Purification:** The intense heat erases every trace of sin, disease, and death.
- **The Promise:**
  - 2 Peter 3:13 – “Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.”
- **Practical Application:**
  - Since the material world will burn, we should focus on character—the only thing we take to heaven.
  - 2 Peter 3:11 – “Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Silversmith:**
  - A silversmith puts ore into the crucible and applies intense heat to burn away the dross (impurities).
  - The heat continues until only pure silver remains.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The fire of the last day is a cosmic crucible.
  - It burns up the "dross" of sin, leaving behind a purified planet where the righteous will dwell with God forever.
