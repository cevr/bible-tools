### Q1. What did an Old Testament prophet predict of Christ?

**“And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an
ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles trust.” Isaiah 11:10 (Romans
15:12).**

**Answer:** The prophet Isaiah points us to the central figure of all history:
Jesus Christ.

- **The Root of Jesse:** This identifies the humanity and lineage of Christ.
  Jesse was the father of King David. Jesus is the "Son of David" according to
  the flesh (Romans 1:3), fulfilling the covenant promise that a King would rise
  from David's line to reign forever. This proves that our Saviour is a real
  man, a Brother who understands our frame (Hebrews 2:17).
- **An Ensign of the People:** An "ensign" is a banner, a standard, or a flag
  lifted high on a battlefield. It is a rallying point. Christ, lifted up on the
  cross and now ministering in the heavenly sanctuary, is the center to whom all
  must gather for safety and salvation (John 12:32).
- **The Object of Trust:** The text predicts that even the Gentiles—those
  previously "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel" (Ephesians 2:12)—would
  place their trust in Him. Salvation is not based on genealogy, but on
  **faith**.

**Theological Term:**

- **Faith:** The assent of the mind to God's truth and the yielding of the will
  to God's power. It is trusting God’s word because of who He is (Hebrews 11:1,
  6).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a chaotic battlefield where soldiers are
confused and scattered. Suddenly, the commander raises the regiment's flag high
on a hill. Every soldier knows that to survive and win, they must run to that
flag. Christ is that flag. In the confusion of this sinful world, we look to
Him, rally to Him, and find safety under His banner of love.

### Q2. What were the apostles, who first trusted in Christ, to become?

**“That we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted in Christ.”
Ephesians 1:12.**

**Answer:** The purpose of trusting in Christ extends far beyond merely escaping
punishment; it is to restore the image of God in man.

- **The Praise of His Glory:** In Scripture, God's "glory" is His character
  (Exodus 33:18–19; 34:6–7). To be to the "praise of His glory" means that when
  the universe looks at a believer, they should see a reflection of God's
  character—His love, justice, and purity.
- **Witnesses of His Power:** The apostles and early believers were the
  "firstfruits." Their transformed lives proved that the Gospel could take
  rough, sinful men and make them into saints.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We do not trust Christ merely to get to heaven; we
  trust Him so that He can live His life through us (Galatians 2:20). The
  highest honor a believer can give to God is to let Christ's righteousness be
  perfectly reproduced in their mortal flesh.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A master artist paints a portrait. The glory of the
painting is not the canvas or the paint itself, but the skill of the artist
revealed in the work. We are the canvas; Christ is the Artist. When we trust
Him, we become a masterpiece that brings praise to His skill and grace, showing
the universe what the Master can do with broken materials.

### Q3. What did the Ephesians do upon hearing the message of truth?

**“In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of
your salvation.” Ephesians 1:13.**

**Answer:** This verse establishes the divine order of conversion: Hearing, then
Trusting.

1.  **Hearing the Word of Truth:** Faith is not a feeling; it is an intelligent
    response to the Word of God. "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the
    word of God" (Romans 10:17). We cannot trust a God we do not know, and we
    know Him through His Word.
2.  **The Gospel of Salvation:** The message they heard was the "Gospel"—the
    good news that Jesus has conquered sin and death, and that His victory is
    ours by faith.
3.  **Placing Trust:** Upon seeing the evidence of God's love in the Gospel, the
    Ephesians surrendered. True faith is the hand that accepts the gift God
    offers. It is an active reliance on the merits of Jesus.

**Theological Term:**

- **Gospel:** Literally "Good News." It is the revelation of God's plan to save
  man from the penalty of sin (death) and the power of sin (dominion) through
  the life, death, resurrection, and high priestly ministry of Jesus Christ
  (Romans 1:16–17).

### Q4. What returns did they receive from their proposed trust?

**“In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
promise.” Ephesians 1:13.**

**Answer:** When a soul genuinely trusts in Christ, God responds by giving the
Holy Spirit.

- **The Seal of Ownership:** A seal indicates ownership and authenticity. When
  we believe, God gives us His Spirit to mark us as His own property (2 Timothy
  2:19). The world, the flesh, and the devil have no more claim on us.
- **The Seal of Likeness:** A seal leaves an impression in wax. The Holy Spirit
  works to impress the image of Christ upon the human heart. The "sealing" is a
  settling into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so that we
  cannot be moved.
- **The Earnest of Inheritance:** The verse continues (v. 14) to call the Spirit
  the "earnest" or down-payment of our inheritance. The peace, joy, and victory
  over sin we experience now through the Spirit are a foretaste of the life to
  come.

**Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the oil (symbolizing the
Spirit) was kept in the lamps of the Holy Place to give light. Similarly,
Christ, our High Priest in heaven, pours His Spirit into us so we may shine as
lights in this dark world (Zechariah 4:2–6; Matthew 5:14).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Think of a king sending an important letter. He pours
hot wax onto the fold and presses his signet ring into it. The wax takes the
exact shape of the ring. The Holy Spirit softens our hearts (like the wax) so
that the character of Christ (the King's image) can be perfectly impressed upon
us.

### Q5. To whom does the gospel become the power of God?

**“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto
salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first and also to the Greek.”
Romans 1:16.**

**Answer:** The Gospel is not merely good advice; it is the omnipotent energy of
God.

- **Power (Dunamis):** The Greek word implies dynamite—explosive power. The
  Gospel breaks the chains of habit and the bondage of hereditary tendencies. It
  does not just tell a man to be good; it gives him the _power_ to become good.
- **Unto Salvation:** This includes salvation from the _penalty_ of sin
  (justification) and the _power_ of sin (sanctification). God's plan is to
  restore man to perfect obedience to His law.
- **Conditioned on Faith:** The power is available to "everyone," but it is
  effective only in "everyone that believeth." The electricity is in the wire,
  but the light only turns on when the switch of faith is flipped.

**Theological Term:**

- **Justification:** The legal act where God declares a repentant sinner
  righteous. He pardons their past sins and imputes (credits) the perfect life
  of Christ to their account (Romans 3:24–26).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A man has fallen into a deep, slippery pit. He cannot
climb out; his own strength is useless. A strong rope is lowered (the Gospel).
The power to pull him out lies entirely in the engine or person at the top, not
in the man. However, the man must choose to grab the rope and hold on (faith).

### Q6. But suppose one halts in his faith or trust; how is he regarded by the Lord?

**“Now the just shall live by faith; but if any man draw back, My soul shall
have no pleasure in him.” Hebrews 10:38.**

**Answer:** The Christian life is a continuous walk, not a one-time event.

- **Living by Faith:** We do not just begin by faith; we must _live_ by it every
  moment. This means a daily, hourly dependence on Christ for wisdom, strength,
  and righteousness.
- **Drawing Back:** To "draw back" is to cease trusting Christ and return to
  reliance on self or the world. It is to interrupt the flow of grace. God has
  "no pleasure" in this because He knows that separated from Him, we are lost
  and will return to the slavery of sin.
- **Perseverance:** The doctrine of "Righteousness by Faith" teaches that the
  faith which justifies is also the faith that persists. As Jesus said, "No man,
  having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of
  God" (Luke 9:62).

**Theological Term:**

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God's grace within the believer,
  setting them apart for holy use and transforming their character to be like
  Jesus (1 Thessalonians 4:3). It is a daily dying to self and living to Christ.

### Q7. By what does one gain the victory over the world?

**“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory
that overcometh the world, even our faith.” 1 John 5:4.**

**Answer:** Victory over sin and the world is the birthright of every born-again
believer.

- **Born of God:** This refers to the "new birth" (John 3:3–5). When a person
  surrenders to Christ, they receive a new nature. The old nature loves the
  world; the new nature loves God and His law.
- **Overcoming the World:** The "world" represents the lust of the flesh, the
  lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (1 John 2:16). The believer is not a
  slave to these things.
- **Victory through Faith:** How do we overcome? Not by struggling alone, but by
  faith. Faith lays hold of Christ's victory. We believe that He has conquered,
  and we claim His power to conquer in us. As we maintain our trust in Him, His
  Spirit empowers us to say "no" to temptation.

**Righteousness by Faith:** We must never think, "I will overcome sin, and then
I will be holy." No, we look to Jesus, and in looking, we are changed. The
victory is _His_, given to us as a gift which we accept by faith.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A small child is being bullied by a large enemy. The
child cannot win a fight. But if the child holds the hand of his strong father,
the enemy flees. The child's "victory" is simply his trust in holding his
father's hand.

### Q8. In the struggles with temptations, if one trusts in Jesus, how will he show it?

**“These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the
world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the
world.” John 16:33.**

**Answer:** The evidence of trust is peace amidst the storm.

- **Peace in Me:** The world offers tribulation—stress, persecution, and
  temptation. But Jesus offers a peace that "passeth all understanding"
  (Philippians 4:7). This peace comes from knowing that our High Priest is in
  control and that our life is hid with Christ in God.
- **Good Cheer:** A trusting Christian is not morose or fearful. We are of "good
  cheer" because the battle has already been won by our Captain.
- **"I Have Overcome":** Jesus lived a human life and faced every temptation we
  face, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15). Because He overcame, He can give us the
  power to overcome. His victory is the guarantee of ours.

**Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the peace offering
represented the peace of reconciliation with God. Christ is our Peace Offering.

### Q9. But is there not some other help in the work of overcoming, besides a silent trust in Christ?

**“And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb, and by the word of their
testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.” Revelation 12:11.**

**Answer:** While trust (faith) is the root, it produces visible fruit and
active cooperation with God. This verse gives us the threefold secret of victory
in the Great Controversy:

1.  **The Blood of the Lamb (The Merit):** This is the foundation. We overcome
    the accuser (Satan) primarily because Jesus died for us. His blood cleanses
    our conscience and gives us the legal right to be called children of God. We
    always rely on His merit, never our own.
2.  **The Word of Their Testimony (The Confession):** Faith must be spoken and
    acted upon. We overcome by actively confessing Christ before men and sharing
    what He has done for us. A silent faith is a dying faith. We must use the
    Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, against Satan as Jesus did ("It is
    written").
3.  **Loved Not Their Lives (The Surrender):** This implies total
    self-sacrifice. Victory comes when we are dead to self-preservation and
    selfishness. When we are willing to sacrifice everything—even life
    itself—for the truth, Satan loses his power over us.

**Theological Term:**

- **Atonement:** The work by which God and man are reconciled (at-one-ment). It
  involves Christ's sacrifice on the cross (providing the blood) and His
  ministry in the sanctuary (applying the blood) to blot out sin.

**[ILL] Illustration:** In a court of law, the accused is set free because (1)
The fine has been paid by a benefactor (The Blood), (2) The accused admits the
truth and claims the benefactor's help (The Testimony), and (3) The accused
commits to a new life, abandoning the old criminal ways (Surrender).

### Q10. But besides receiving power to overcome our foes, are there not temporal benefits to be derived from trusting in Jesus?

**“For she said within herself, If I may but touch His garment, I shall be
whole. But Jesus turned Him about, and when He saw her, He said, Daughter, be of
good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from
that hour.” Matthew 9:21, 22. (See also Mark 10:52 and Luke 17:19).**

**Answer:** Yes, God cares for our bodies as well as our souls.

- **The Touch of Faith:** The crowd pressed around Jesus, but only one woman
  _touched_ Him with the intent of faith. She believed that contact with Him
  would bring life.
- **Temporal Blessings:** Jesus spent much of His ministry healing the sick,
  giving sight to the blind, and feeding the hungry. He is the Creator and
  Sustainer of life. When we trust Him, we can bring our physical needs, our
  anxieties, and our daily cares to Him. "Casting all your care upon Him; for He
  careth for you" (1 Peter 5:7).
- **Wholeness:** The Greek word for "made whole" often implies both physical
  healing and spiritual salvation. The miracle of physical healing was an
  illustration of the greater miracle of cleansing the soul from the leprosy of
  sin.

**Practical Application:** While God does not promise that we will never be sick
or poor, He promises that "all things work together for good to them that love
God" (Romans 8:28). Trusting Jesus brings a peace that promotes physical health
(Proverbs 17:22) and assures us that our daily bread will be provided (Matthew
6:33).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Thousands of wires may hang near a power line, but only
the one that actually touches the line conducts the electricity. Many people
"crowd" Jesus by simply knowing about Him or attending church, but it is the
specific touch of personal faith that draws the power of blessing into the life.
