## Slide 1 – Chapter 8: Creation and Redemption
- This study explores the link between the physical creation of the universe and the spiritual re-creation of the soul.
- **Three Angels’ Messages:** The God who calls for our worship in the last days is the Creator (Revelation 14:6–12).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** The power that spoke worlds into existence is the only power capable of creating a clean heart in a sinner.

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Foundational Truth
- **Question:** What grand truth is revealed in the first verse in the Bible?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:1 – “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points
- **The Source of All Reality:** The universe is the purposeful act of an infinite Mind, not the result of chance.
- **Creation *Ex Nihilo*:** God created "out of nothing" (Hebrews 11:3 – “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.”).
- **Implications for the Sinner:**
  - God owns the heavens and the earth by right of creation.
  - He has the right to rule and the right to our obedience.
  - God called light out of darkness (Genesis 1:3); He alone can shine light into the human heart (2 Corinthians 4:6).

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Master Artist:**
  - Imagine an artist who paints a beautiful portrait.
  - The canvas, paint, and image belong to him because he created them.
  - The painting has no life separate from the artist.
- **Application:** We belong to God by right of creation. We are His workmanship.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: True vs. False Gods
- **Question:** What Bible contrast is repeatedly drawn between the true God and false gods?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 10:11-16 – “Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. The portion of Jacob is not like them, for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The Lord of hosts is His name.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points
- **The Test of Divinity:** The distinguishing mark of the true God is creative power. Any "god" that did not make the heavens will perish.
- **The Call of Judgment:** Revelation 14:7 calls the world to "worship Him that made heaven, and earth."
  - **Key Text:** Revelation 14:7 – “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”
- **The Portion of Jacob:** We do not worship a distant concept, but the personal Architect of the universe.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Statue of the Fireman:**
  - If you were trapped in a burning building, a carved statue of a fireman could not save you.
  - Even if beautiful, it has no breath and no power.
  - You need a living fireman with the power to act.
- **Application:** False gods are like statues; the Creator is the living Rescuer.

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Agent of Creation
- **Question:** Through whom did God work in the creation of all things?
- **Key Text:** John 1:1-3 – “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points
- **The Divinity of Christ:** Jesus is fully God, eternal and uncreated. He was "with God" and "was God."
- **The Power of the Word:** In Genesis, "God said..." In John, this "Word" (Logos) is a Person. Jesus is the expression of the Father's power.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The One who died on Calvary is the One who designed the galaxies.
  - If the Creator is your Saviour, no sin is too strong for Him to conquer.

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Definition
- **The Word (Logos):** A title for Jesus Christ.
- It indicates that He is the self-expression of God’s mind and power, both in Creation and in Redemption.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Provider of Redemption
- **Question:** Through whom is our redemption provided?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:8-9 – “But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points
- **God’s Initiative:** God loved us "while we were yet sinners." He does not wait for us to make ourselves good.
- **Justified by His Blood:**
  - God declares the sinner righteous because Jesus paid the penalty (death).
  - Romans 3:26 – “To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.”
- **Saved from Wrath:** Christ saves us from the inevitable result of sin (separation and death) by taking our place.

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Definitions
- **Justification:** The act of God declaring a repentant sinner to be righteous, based on Christ's perfect life and sacrificial death credited to their account.
- **Redemption:** Literally "buying back." The process of freeing a slave by paying a ransom. Christ's blood is the price.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: Creator and Redeemer
- **Question:** What passage of Scripture speaks of the Creator as Redeemer?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 43:1 – “But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and He that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points
- **Double Ownership:** God says, "I made you, and I bought you back."
- **Personal Care:** He calls us "by name." The Creator of the stars knows the individual trials of the heart.
- **The Guarantee of Success:** Because He "formed" us, He knows our specific temperament and weaknesses. He knows exactly how to apply grace to heal us.
- **No Fear:** If the Creator says, "You are mine," no enemy can remove us from His hand (John 10:28).

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration
- **The Toy Boat:**
  - A boy carved a toy boat, but it drifted away and was lost.
  - Later, he saw it in a store window and bought it back with his own money.
  - As he held it, he said, "You are twice mine. I made you, and now I have bought you."
- **Application:** This is what Jesus says to the redeemed sinner.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: Creation in the Heart
- **Question:** Which prayer of David reveals that God's redemptive work of man is a creative work?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 51:10 – “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points
- **More than Repair:** David uses the word *bara* (create), the same word used in Genesis 1:1.
- **The New Birth:**
  - The carnal mind cannot be "fixed"; it must be replaced.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
  - Conversion is a supernatural act of creation.
- **Sanctification:** "Renewing a right spirit" is the daily work of the Spirit, keeping the heart in tune with God.

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: Head of the Church
- **Question:** Where are we told that Christ, the active agent in creation, is also the head of the church?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 1:16-18 – “For by Him were all things created... all things were created by Him, and for Him: And He is before all things, and by Him all things consist. And He is the head of the body, the church...”

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points
- **By Him All Things Consist:** Christ holds the universe together. If He withdrew His power, atoms and galaxies would disintegrate.
- **Head of the Church:** Just as He sustains nature, He sustains the spiritual life of the church (His body).
- **Preeminence:** Christ must be first in the cosmos and first in our individual lives. He must be Lord of all.

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Head and the Body:**
  - The brain controls the physical body.
  - If the connection between head and hand is severed, the hand is paralyzed.
- **Application:** A Christian or church disconnected from Christ (the Head) has no spiritual life or power to do good.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: God’s Workmanship
- **Question:** What scripture clearly shows that it is God's creative power which transforms the believer?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:10 – “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points
- **Created Unto Good Works:** We are not created *by* good works, but *unto* them. Works are the fruit, not the root.
- **Righteousness by Faith vs. Legalism:**
  - Legalism tries to do works to create a standing with God.
  - The Gospel says God creates us anew, and the natural result is obedience.
- **God's Plan:** God has "ordained" a path of obedience for us, fulfilling His design for humanity.

---

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration
- **The Sculptor:**
  - A sculptor takes a rough stone and chisels it into a beautiful statue.
  - The stone does not shape itself; it yields to the artist.
- **Application:** We are the stone; God is the Sculptor. Our part is to yield; His part is to shape the character.

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: Sustaining the Stars
- **Question:** Who is it that keeps the stars in their places in the heavens?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 40:25-26 – “...Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points
- **"Not One Faileth":** Because of God's strength, every star keeps its appointed path.
- **Sovereign Power:** If God can manage the complexity of billions of stars, ensuring they do not collide, He is "strong in power."
- **Comfort:** God uses this fact to comfort His people. If He can take care of the universe, He can take care of you.

---

## Slide 27 – Q10: Keeping the Believer
- **Question:** What can the same Creator do for you and me?
- **Key Text:** Jude 24-25 – “Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.”

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points (Sanctuary & Victory)
- **Able to Keep:** We cannot stop sinning in our own strength, but He *is able*. The victory is in His ability.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The text speaks of being presented "faultless" before His glory.
  - This mirrors the High Priest's work to cleanse the people so they may stand before God.
- **Righteousness Imparted:** This is practical godliness—power for the present to live a life that brings joy to God.

---

## Slide 29 – Q10: Illustration
- **The Toddler:**
  - A toddler on a rocky path will fall if left alone.
  - If a strong father holds the child's hand, the child is safe.
  - The child is kept from falling not by their own grip, but by the father's grip.
- **Application:** Our "grip" is faith; His grip is omnipotence.

---

## Slide 30 – Q11: The Power Available
- **Question:** How much of this power is available to help us in our need?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 1:19-20 – “And what is the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of His mighty power, Which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His own right hand in the heavenly places.”

---

## Slide 31 – Q11: Key Points
- **Resurrection Power:** The standard of measurement for power available to a Christian is the power that raised Jesus from the dead.
- **To Us-ward Who Believe:** This power is not locked in heaven; it is accessible to us by faith.
- **Victory over Spiritual Death:**
  - If God can raise a dead body, He can raise a soul dead in sins (Ephesians 2:1).
  - No habit or addiction can withstand resurrection power.

---

## Slide 32 – Q12: The Sustainer
- **Question:** Who sustains the universe and keeps it each moment?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 1:17 (R.V. margin) – “And He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.”

---

## Slide 33 – Q12: Key Points
- **Continuous Dependence:** The universe is not a clock wound up and left to run. It requires moment-by-moment divine power.
- **Spiritual Parallel:**
  - We depend on Him for every breath.
  - We cannot remain righteous for a moment without constant communion with Him.
  - John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches... for without me ye can do nothing.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q13: The Memorial
- **Question:** Of what great truth is the Seventh-day Sabbath a memorial and a sign?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 8:6 – “But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q13: Key Points
- **Identifying the True God:** The true God is the Creator (Jeremiah 10). The Sabbath is the memorial of that fact.
- **"We By Him":**
  - Keeping the Sabbath acknowledges we are not self-made.
  - It is a weekly act of surrender to the sovereignty of the Creator.

---

## Slide 36 – Q14: Sabbath and Redemption
- **Question:** The Sabbath is a memorial of Creation. Is it also a sign of God's power to redeem us?
- **Key Text 1:** Exodus 20:8-11 – “Remember the Sabbath day... for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day...”
- **Key Text 2:** Ezekiel 20:12 – “Moreover also I gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q14: Key Points (Sabbath & RBF)
- **Memorial of Creation:** It points back to the finished work of Creation (Exodus 20).
- **Sign of Sanctification:**
  - It signifies that "I am the Lord that sanctify them" (Ezekiel 20).
  - Sanctification is the work of re-creation in the heart.
- **Resting in Grace:**
  - Just as God rested from Creation, and Christ rested in the tomb after Redemption, we rest in Christ.
  - The Sabbath is a symbol of **Righteousness by Faith**—ceasing from our own works and trusting God's power to make us holy.

---

## Slide 38 – Q14: Definition
- **Sign/Seal:** An external mark that indicates internal reality or ownership.
- The Sabbath is God's mark of authority and the believer's pledge of allegiance to the Creator.

---

## Slide 39 – Q15: Worthy of Worship
- **Question:** Why is God worthy to receive our worship, praise and honor?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 4:11 – “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created.”

---

## Slide 40 – Q15: Key Points
- **The Basis of Worship:** We worship God because He is the Source of our being.
- **The Final Conflict:**
  - Revelation presents a conflict between worshiping the Beast and worshiping the Creator (Revelation 14:7).
  - Acknowledging God as Creator is central to the final test of loyalty.
- **Gospel Restoration:** Redemption restores us to the purpose for which we were created: to glorify God.

---

## Slide 41 – Q15: Illustration
- **The Inventor:**
  - An inventor receives the patent and credit for his invention.
  - It is theft to give credit to another.
- **Application:** When we worship, we give "glory and honor" to the One who holds the patent on life itself.

---

## Slide 42 – Summary: Creation and the Gospel
- **Creation Restored:** Redemption is simply "creation restored."
- **The Danger of Evolution:**
  - If man ascended from animals, there was no Fall, no sin, and no need for a Saviour.
  - Evolution implies man can save himself through progress.
- **The Witness of the Sabbath:** By keeping the Sabbath, we testify against evolution and witness to a personal God who created us and is able to re-create us in His image.
