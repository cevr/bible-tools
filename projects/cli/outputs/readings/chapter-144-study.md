### Q1. At the last Passover, what did the Saviour say to His disciples?

**“And He said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God." Luke 22:15, 16.**

**Answer:**

The Saviour expressed a deep, longing desire to share this specific meal with His followers. This was a pivotal moment in the history of the Plan of Salvation. The Passover was a **type** (a prophetic symbol) pointing forward to the "Lamb of God" who would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29). Jesus knew that within hours, the type would meet its **antitype** (the reality) at the cross.

By saying He would not eat of it again until it was "fulfilled in the kingdom of God," Jesus was transitioning the focus from the deliverance of Israel from Egypt to the greater deliverance of humanity from the bondage of sin. He was establishing the new ordinance—the Lord's Supper—to commemorate His death and the New Covenant. His "desire" reveals the intensity of His love; He longed to fortify the disciples’ minds with truth before His great sacrifice.

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the Passover lamb was slain in the outer court of the sanctuary to save the firstborn, Jesus was about to offer Himself in the outer court of this earth. His blood provides the covering that protects the believer from eternal death (Exodus 12:13; Hebrews 9:13–14).

**[ILL]** Imagine a father gathering his children for a final meal before he goes on a dangerous journey to save them from bankruptcy and ruin. Every word he speaks is weightier, every gesture more tender. He wants to leave them with instructions and a memorial of his love. This was the atmosphere in the Upper Room.

### Q2. What spirit was manifested by the disciples?

**“And He said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve." Luke 22:25, 26.**

**Answer:**

While Jesus was burdened with the weight of the world's salvation, the disciples were engaged in a petty dispute about who would be the greatest in the coming kingdom. They were manifesting the spirit of the world—a spirit of self-exaltation, pride, and desire for supremacy. This is the very essence of the mystery of iniquity (2 Thessalonians 2:7), originating with Lucifer, who said, "I will exalt my throne" (Isaiah 14:13).

Jesus contrasts two opposing kingdoms:
1.  **The Kingdom of the World:** Based on force, authority, position, and being served.
2.  **The Kingdom of Heaven:** Based on love, humility, service, and self-sacrifice.

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest wore garments of glory and beauty, but he bore the names of the tribes on his shoulders and heart (Exodus 28:12, 29). His position was strictly for the purpose of bearing the burden of the people, not for personal tyranny.

**[ILL]** In a worldly corporation, success is often viewed as climbing a ladder—the higher you go, the more people serve you. In Christ’s kingdom, the ladder is inverted. To be great, you must climb *down* into the valley of service. The deeper you go in serving others, the higher you stand in God's estimation.

### Q3. What did the Saviour say of His own position?

**“For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth." Luke 22:27.**

**Answer:**

Jesus reversed the human standard of greatness. By rights, as the Creator and King of the universe (Colossians 1:16), He deserved to sit at the table while all creation served Him. Yet, He declared, "I am among you as he that serveth."

This is the heart of **Righteousness by Faith**. The righteousness of Christ is not just a legal status; it is a living character of selfless love. Christ did not cling to His equality with God but emptied Himself to become a servant (Philippians 2:5–7). If we are to have His righteousness imparted to us (sanctification), we must possess this same spirit of service. We cannot claim to be His followers while cherishing pride and a desire to rule over others.

*   **Definition—Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in the believer, imparting the character of Christ to the life, resulting in obedience and holiness (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]** If the King of England were to visit a hospital, lay aside his royal robes, put on a nurse's uniform, and begin changing bandages and feeding patients, the world would be shocked. Yet the King of Glory did infinitely more than this by taking on human nature to serve a rebel race.

### Q4. With such knowledge of His own power and authority, what excellent example did Christ give of His humility?

**“He riseth from supper, and laid aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded Himself, After that He poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded," John 13:4, 5.**

**Answer:**

Knowing that "the Father had given all things into his hands" (John 13:3), Jesus performed the duty of the lowest menial servant. He:
1.  **Rose from supper:** Leaving the place of comfort.
2.  **Laid aside His garments:** Symbolizing how He laid aside His heavenly glory.
3.  **Girded Himself:** Taking the posture of a servant ready for work.
4.  **Washed their feet:** Performing the act of cleansing that they were too proud to do for one another.

This act was a rebuke to their contention for supremacy, but it was spoken in deeds rather than words. It was also a symbol of the deeper spiritual cleansing He provides. Just as water washes away the dirt of the road, the blood of Christ and the washing of the Word cleanse the soul from the defilement of sin (Ephesians 5:26).

*   **Sanctuary Connection:** Before the priests could enter the Holy Place to minister, they had to wash their hands and feet at the **Laver** (Exodus 30:18–21). This teaches that purity is required for communion with God. Jesus was here acting as the One who provides that purity.

**[ILL]** In the Orient, guests would arrive with dust-covered feet from the open roads. It was refreshing to have them washed. By doing this Himself, Jesus showed that no labor is degrading if it is done for the comfort and relief of others.

### Q5. On approaching Peter, what did that disciple say?

**“Then cometh He to Simon Peter; and Peter saith unto Him, lord, dost thou wash my feet?" John 13:6.**

**Answer:**

Peter was struck with astonishment and shame. He saw the incongruity of the situation: The Master washing the servant? The Sinless One washing the sinner? Peter's question reveals that he did not yet understand the true nature of God's love. He thought dignity was maintained by distance and superiority. He did not realize that God's glory is most clearly seen in His condescension to save the lost (Psalm 113:5–7).

**[ILL]** It is like a soldier seeing his General drop to his knees to polish the soldier's muddy boots. The instinct is to pull back and say, "No, sir! This is not right!" But in God's army, the General conquers by serving.

---

### Q6. And what was the reply?

**“Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter." John 13:7.**

**Answer:**

Jesus acknowledged that Peter could not fully grasp the spiritual significance of the act at that moment. The "hereafter" likely referred to the time after the cross and the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, when the disciples would understand that the washing of feet symbolized the cleansing of the soul from sin through Christ's humiliation and death.

This teaches us that we often must submit to God's methods even when we do not fully understand His reasons. Faith trusts the Master's heart even when it cannot trace the Master's hand.

### Q7. How did Peter feel about submitting to the Saviour's proposal?

**“Peter saith unto Him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou has no part with Me." John 13:8.**

**Answer:**

Peter's refusal was a mix of reverence and pride—a "false humility." By refusing, he was actually dictating terms to his Lord. Jesus' reply cuts to the very heart of the Gospel: **"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me."**

This is the doctrine of **Justification** and **Cleansing**.
1.  **Necessity of Cleansing:** Humans are defiled by sin (Isaiah 64:6). We cannot enter heaven in our natural state.
2.  **Exclusive Source:** We cannot wash ourselves. No amount of human effort, penance, or good works can remove the stain of sin (Jeremiah 2:22). Only Jesus can wash us.
3.  **Submission:** To be saved, we must submit to being washed. We must admit we are dirty and allow Christ to do the work for us. This strikes at the root of human pride.

*   **Definition—Justification:** The legal act by which God declares a penitent sinner righteous, based solely on the merits of Christ, not on the sinner's works (Romans 3:24–26).

**[ILL]** A man falling into a mud pit cannot clean himself with muddy hands. He needs someone standing on solid ground, with clean water, to wash him. If the man refuses the water, saying "I am not worthy," he remains in the mud and is lost.

### Q8. Learning that his salvation depended on his submission to Christ, what did Peter then wish done?

**“Simon Peter saith unto Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." John 13:9.**

**Answer:**

Peter’s heart was loyal, even if his understanding was imperfect. As soon as he understood that this washing was essential for companionship with Jesus ("part with Me"), his refusal turned into an eager request for a complete bath. He wanted to be entirely surrendered and entirely cleansed. This shows that despite his faults, Peter truly loved the Lord and desired to belong to Him completely.

### Q9. Was this really necessary?

**“Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save [only] to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all." John 13:10.**

**Answer:**

Jesus draws a vital distinction here between two types of washing, using two different Greek words (*louo* for bathing/washing the whole body, and *nipto* for washing a part of the body).

1.  **The Bath ("Washed"):** This represents the great, initial cleansing of **Regeneration** and **Justification**. When a sinner first comes to Christ, repents, and is baptized, they are washed "every whit." They pass from death to life. This does not need to be repeated daily (Titus 3:5).
2.  **The Foot Washing:** As the believer walks through the world, they contract "dust" (sins of infirmity, daily failures, contact with the world). They do not need to be re-baptized; they need their "feet" washed. This represents daily repentance and the fresh application of Christ's cleansing blood to the conscience (1 John 1:9).

This answers the believer's anxiety: "If I stumble, am I no longer God's child?" Jesus says: You are still bathed (a child of God), but you need to wash your feet (confess and receive cleansing) to maintain open communion.

*   **Note:** "But not all" referred to Judas, who had refused the inner cleansing of the heart, though he allowed his physical feet to be washed.

**[ILL]** A person who takes a shower in the morning is clean. However, if they walk in sandals through a dusty street, they don't need another shower before dinner; they simply need to wash their feet to be comfortable and clean for the meal.

---

### Q10. After performing the ceremony, what did Christ say had been His object?

**“For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you." John 13:15.**

**Answer:**

Christ's object was not merely to perform a kindness, but to institute an **ordinance** and set a permanent **example**. He established a pattern of humility that cuts against the grain of human nature.

To "do as I have done" means:
1.  To serve others regardless of their status.
2.  To be willing to humble oneself to lift others up.
3.  To harbor no pride or resentment.

This ordinance is a test of loyalty. Are we willing to follow Jesus even when it requires humiliation? It is a part of the "faith of Jesus"—not just believing *in* Him, but believing and living *like* Him.

### Q11. What did He say they should therefore do to one another?

**"Ye call Me Master and Lord, and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet." John 13:13, 14.**

**Answer:**

Because the Master served the servants, the servants must serve one another. Jesus explicitly commanded the literal observance of this ordinance ("ye also ought to wash one another's feet").

The **Ordinance of Humility** (Foot Washing) serves a specific purpose in the church:
1.  **Preparation for the Lord's Supper:** Just as the foot washing preceded the meal, self-examination and reconciliation should precede Communion (1 Corinthians 11:28).
2.  **Equality:** In this service, the rich and the poor, the leader and the layman, bow down to serve one another. All social distinctions are leveled at the foot of the cross.
3.  **Reconciliation:** It is difficult to wash the feet of someone you hate. This ordinance provides a practical opportunity to clear away misunderstandings and bitterness before partaking of the emblems of Christ's body and blood.

**[ILL]** Iron is rigid and cold, but when heated in the fire, it becomes malleable and can be welded together. The Ordinance of Humility brings our cold hearts near to the fire of Christ's love, melting our pride so that we can be united with our brethren.

---

### Q12. What promise is given to those who carry out this ordinance?

**“If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them." John 13:17.**

**Answer:**

The blessing is not in the *knowing*, but in the *doing*. Many Christians know the theory of humility, but true happiness (blessedness) comes only from the practice of it.

*   **The Practicality of Sanctification:** Godliness is not just an intellectual assent to truth; it is the practice of truth in the life.
*   **The Promise:** There is a specific joy—a sense of freedom and peace—that comes when we let go of pride. When we take the low place, we have nothing to defend and nothing to lose. We share in the joy of Christ, which is the joy of self-sacrificing love.

**[ILL]** A man may know all the nutritional facts about bread, but he will starve unless he eats it. So, a Christian may know all the doctrines of humility, but his soul will starve unless he practices the acts of service Christ ordained.

### Q13. How was the Oriental custom of feet washing invariably conducted?

**“Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree." Gen. 18:4 (Gen.19:2) (Judges 19:21) (2 Sam. 11:8) (Luke 7:44).**

**Answer:**

In Bible times, feet washing was a necessary act of hospitality and hygiene. People wore open sandals and walked on dusty, dirty roads.
1.  It was the first act of welcome to a guest (Genesis 18:4).
2.  It was refreshing to the weary traveler.
3.  It was traditionally performed by a servant or a slave, or the guest was provided water to do it themselves.

By taking this common social custom and making it a religious ordinance, Christ elevated the common to the sacred. He taught that in His kingdom, the highest honor belongs to the one who serves the needs of others.

### Q14. As late as A.D. 65, what was one test applied by the apostle to determine whether a widow was worthy to be taken into a certain circle?

**“If she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work." 1 Tim. 5:10.**

**Answer:**

This verse proves that the apostolic church practiced feet washing literally, well after Christ's ascension. Paul lists "washed the saints' feet" alongside other practical good works like raising children and helping the afflicted. It was a mark of a dedicated, humble Christian woman.

This suggests that the early Christians understood Jesus' command in John 13 not merely as a figurative lesson, but as a practice to be observed. It demonstrated a heart willing to stoop to the humblest service for the brethren.

---

### Q15. How does Christ regard an act performed toward the humblest of His disciples?

**“Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me." Matt. 25:40.**

**Answer:**

Jesus identifies Himself fully with His suffering and humble people. When we wash a brother's or sister's feet—or perform any act of kindness to relieve their needs—Christ accepts it as though we had done it personally to Him.

This is the final motive for the Ordinance of Humility. We are not just serving a human being; we are ministering to the Lord of Glory in the person of His saints. This transforms a lowly duty into a high privilege.

*   **Conclusion:** The Ordinance of Humility points us to the Cross (where Jesus served us by dying) and to the Throne (where He serves us by interceding). It calls us to walk in the "newness of life" (Romans 6:4), characterized by love that seeketh not her own.
