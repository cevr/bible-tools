### Q1. How may lawgivers are there?
“There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.” James 4:12.

**Answer:**
The Bible establishes that moral authority originates from a single, sovereign source: God Himself. Just as the Creator is one, His moral standard is singular and absolute.

*   **Sovereignty of God:** Because God created the universe, He alone possesses the right to determine the rules by which it operates (Psalm 24:1; Isaiah 33:22). Human laws are valid only so far as they harmonize with divine law; but God’s law is the supreme constitution of the universe.
*   **Power to Save and Destroy:** The text highlights two prerogatives that belong only to God: salvation and judgment.
    *   *To Destroy:* The wages of sin—transgressing God’s law—is death (Romans 6:23).
    *   *To Save:* Because God is the Lawgiver, He is the only one who can legally pardon the lawbreaker without undermining the law’s authority.
*   **Implications for Us:** We cannot invent our own morality or modify God’s requirements to suit our convenience. We are subjects, not legislators. Our duty is humble obedience to the revealed will of the One Lawgiver.

**[ILL] The Architect:** If a master architect designs a complex skyscraper, he creates the blueprints (laws) for how the building must stand. A tenant cannot simply decide to remove a load-bearing wall because they dislike it; doing so would destroy the building. There is only one Architect whose design matters. Likewise, God designs life; to ignore His law is to invite ruin.

### Q2. What is said of the stability of His character?
“For I am the Lord, I change not.” Mal. 3:6.

**Answer:**
God’s character is immutable—meaning it is not subject to change, variation, or evolution.

*   **The Law as a Transcript:** The law of God is a transcript of His character.
    *   God is love; His law is the law of love (1 John 4:8; Matthew 22:37–40).
    *   God is holy; His law is holy (1 Peter 1:16; Romans 7:12).
    *   God is just; His law is just (Deuteronomy 32:4).
*   **Eternal Stability:** Because God does not change, His moral law can never change. If God were to abolish His law, He would have to change His own nature. He cannot be perfect one day and imperfect the next; therefore, His requirements for humanity remain consistent throughout eternity.
*   **Comfort in Stability:** This is good news for the believer. We do not serve a capricious deity who shifts the rules arbitrarily. His promises and His standards are as rock-solid as His existence (James 1:17).

**Definition:**
*   **Immutability:** The attribute of God whereby He is unchanging in His character, will, and covenant promises.

### Q3. What is the character of His works?
“The works of His hands are verity and judgment; all His commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.” Ps. 111:7, 8.

**Answer:**
The Psalmist declares that God’s commandments possess three distinct qualities: they are true ("verity"), they are just ("judgment"), and they are eternal ("stand fast forever").

*   **Sure Commandments:** The word "sure" implies reliability and trustworthiness. In a world of shifting cultural values, the Ten Commandments provide an unshakeable foundation.
*   **Forever and Ever:** This text refutes the idea that God’s moral law was temporary or restricted to the Old Testament dispensation. The phrase "stand fast" means they are sustained or supported by God’s own power. They are not temporary shadows (like the ceremonial laws of sacrifice which met their fulfillment at the cross), but eternal moral principles.
*   **Connection to the Sanctuary:** In the earthly sanctuary, the Ten Commandments were placed *inside* the Ark of the Covenant, covered by the Mercy Seat (Exodus 25:16, 21). This symbolizes that God’s throne is founded on law and justice (Psalm 89:14), yet covered by mercy for the repentant sinner.

### Q4. What is the character of His law?
“For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.” Rom. 7:14.

**Answer:**
Here Paul identifies the fundamental problem of the human condition. The conflict is not that the law is bad, but that the law is "spiritual" while fallen man is "carnal."

*   **Spiritual Nature of the Law:** The law deals not only with outward actions but with the thoughts, intents, and motives of the heart (Hebrews 4:12). It requires a spiritual nature—love, unselfishness, and purity—to keep it.
*   **Carnal Nature of Man:**
    *   **Definition—Carnal:** Literally "fleshly." It refers to human nature inherited from Adam, which is self-centered, rebellious against God, and unable to produce true righteousness (Romans 8:7).
    *   **Sold Under Sin:** Like a slave sold into bondage, the natural man is under the dominion of sin. He cannot free himself by his own willpower.
*   **The Dilemma:** A carnal man cannot obey a spiritual law. He may force his outward behavior to conform (legalism), but his heart remains selfish. This brings us to the necessity of the New Birth. The law must be written on the heart by the Holy Spirit (Hebrews 8:10).

**[ILL] The Bird and the Fish:** Expecting a carnal man to keep the spiritual law is like expecting a fish to fly like an eagle. It is not in the fish’s nature. The fish does not need a new set of instructions on how to fly; it needs a new nature. So we need to be "born again" of the Spirit to walk in God’s law (John 3:3–5).

---

### Q5. What is revealed in that law as necessary for the carnal man to know before he can be converted?
“And knowest His will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law.” Rom. 2:18.

**Answer:**
Before a person can seek a cure, they must realize they are sick. The law functions as the diagnostic tool of the Great Physician.

*   **Revealing God’s Will:** The law instructs the conscience, defining what right and wrong actually are. Without the law, sin is subjective and vague.
*   **The Knowledge of Sin:** Paul states elsewhere, "by the law is the knowledge of sin" (Romans 3:20). The law acts as a mirror (James 1:23–25). When we look into it, we see the "dirt" on our character.
*   **Step One of Salvation:** The law cannot wash away the sin (only Christ’s blood does that), but it points out the sin so that the sinner sees their need for a Savior. We must know we are lost before we can be found.

**Definition:**
*   **Repentance:** A sorrow for sin and a turning away from it, prompted by the Holy Spirit when one sees the holiness of God’s law and the love of Christ (2 Corinthians 7:10).

---

### Q6. Then, if there is a change in one's life, from the carnal to the spiritual, does the law act any part in that work?
“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.” Ps. 19:7.

**Answer:**
Yes, the law plays a vital role in the work of conversion. While the Holy Spirit is the agent of conversion, the law is the instrument He uses to convict the mind.

*   **Perfect Law, Converted Soul:** The Hebrew word for "converting" here can also mean "reviving" or "restoring." The law restores the soul by turning it back to God. When the Spirit applies the law to the conscience, the sinner cries out, "What must I do to be saved?"
*   **Schoolmaster to Christ:** The law acts as a "schoolmaster" or guardian to bring us to Christ (Galatians 3:24). It shows us our bankruptcy so we will accept the wealth of Christ’s righteousness.
*   **Sanctification:** After conversion, the law continues to guide the spiritual man, marking the path of holiness that the indwelling Christ empowers him to walk (Psalm 119:105).

---

### Q7. What did our Saviour say to the young man who wanted salvation?
”And He said unto him, Why callest thou Me good? there is none good but One, that is God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” Matt. 19:17.

**Answer:**
Jesus directed the rich young ruler straight to the moral law.

*   **The Standard of Life:** Jesus upholds the Ten Commandments as the standard of righteousness. He did not say, "The law is done away with, so just believe." He said, "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."
*   **Exposing Shallow Religion:** This young man thought he had kept the law perfectly. Jesus used the law to probe deeper, eventually showing the young man his covetousness (breaking the 10th commandment) and lack of love for his neighbor (breaking the spirit of the 2nd table of the law).
*   **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** Jesus was not teaching salvation by works (legalism). He was showing that the condition for eternal life is perfect obedience—a condition man cannot meet alone. This drives us to Christ, who *did* keep the commandments perfectly. Through faith:
    1.  **Justification:** Christ’s past obedience is credited to us.
    2.  **Sanctification:** Christ’s present life in us empowers us to keep the commandments in reality (Romans 8:3–4).

---

### Q8. Was it the intention of Christ to abolish or change any part of God's law?
”For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” Matt. 5:18.

**Answer:**
Christ’s language here is emphatic and absolute. He affirms the enduring nature of the moral law in the strongest possible terms.

*   **Heaven and Earth as Witnesses:** Jesus ties the durability of the law to the durability of the physical creation. Since heaven and earth are still here, the law remains in force.
*   **Jot and Tittle:** The "jot" (yod) is the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet; the "tittle" is a tiny stroke that distinguishes one letter from another. Jesus is saying that not even the smallest punctuation mark or detail of the moral law will be removed.
*   **Rejection of Antinomianism:** This refutes the idea that the New Covenant abolishes the Ten Commandments. The New Covenant writes the *same* law upon the heart, rather than erasing it (Jeremiah 31:33).

---

### Q9. What did the Saviour say He came to do to the law?
“Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” Matt. 5:17.

**Answer:**
Jesus clarifies His mission regarding the law: He is the Fulfiller, not the Destroyer.

*   **"Think Not":** Jesus anticipated that people would accuse Him of undermining the law because He stripped away human traditions. He preemptively corrects this error.
*   **To Fulfill (Pleroo):** The Greek word means "to fill up," "to make full," or "to complete."
    *   He filled the law with its true meaning (magnifying it, Isaiah 42:21).
    *   He perfectly obeyed it in His life, demonstrating that a human being, relying on God, can live a sinless life.
*   **Example:** If a builder promises to "fulfill" the contract to build a house, he does not tear up the blueprints (destroy the law); he follows them perfectly until the house stands complete. Jesus built the temple of a perfect character by following the blueprint of the law.

### Q10. When used in prophecy, what does the word fulfill mean?
To bring to pass. “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet." (Matt. 4:14). "Then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory." 1 Cor. 15:54.

**Answer:**
In the context of predictive prophecy, "fulfill" means that an event predicted in the past has now happened in reality.
*   **Example:** Isaiah predicted a virgin would conceive. When Mary gave birth to Jesus, that prediction was "fulfilled" (Matthew 1:22–23). The prediction is no longer pending; it is a historical fact.

---

### Q11. But what does the word mean associated with an obligation?
To perform, or act in accordance with. “Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.” Gal. 6:2 (Matt. 3:15) (James 2:8, 9).

**Answer:**
When applied to a law or moral obligation, "fulfill" means "to obey" or "to carry out."

*   **Obedience:** When Jesus said He came to "fulfill" the law (Matt 5:17), He meant He came to *keep* it.
*   **Does Fulfilling Abolish?** When you stop at a stop sign, you are "fulfilling" the traffic law. Does your obedience abolish the stop sign so the next driver doesn't have to stop? No. Your obedience establishes the law.
*   **Our Experience:** Likewise, when we bear one another's burdens, we "fulfill" (obey) the law of Christ. We do not make the law void; we establish it in our lives (Romans 3:31).

---

### Q12. What did Christ say He came into the world to do?
“Wherefore, when He cometh into the world, He saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not... Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of Me) to do Thy will, O God.” Heb. 10:5-7.

**Answer:**
Christ came to exemplify perfect submission to the Father’s will.

*   **Sacrifice vs. Obedience:** The blood of bulls and goats (ceremonial law) could never take away sin. God desired a life of perfect obedience. Christ became that living sacrifice.
*   **"To Do Thy Will":** The "will" of God is expressed in His law (Psalm 40:8 says, "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart").
*   **The Foundation of Atonement:** The Atonement required two things:
    1.  **Christ’s Death:** To pay the penalty for our broken law (Justification).
    2.  **Christ’s Life:** To weave a robe of perfect righteousness—perfect law-keeping—to cover the believer.
    Because Jesus perfectly did God's will, He offers us His righteousness as a free gift.

**Definition:**
*   **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation between God and man, accomplished through the life, death, and high priestly ministry of Jesus Christ.

---

### Q13. Who did the Saviour say should be saved in the kingdom of heaven?
“Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.” Matt. 7:21.

**Answer:**
Entry into the kingdom is not based on profession ("Lord, Lord") but on a living faith that produces obedience ("he that doeth").

*   **Cheap Grace:** Jesus warns against a religion that claims His name but ignores His authority. Acknowledging Jesus as "Lord" implies that He is the Master whose commands we follow (Luke 6:46).
*   **Faith and Works:** We are saved by grace through faith alone (Ephesians 2:8), but saving faith is never alone—it always produces the fruit of obedience. If there is no "doing of the will," the faith is dead (James 2:17).
*   **Sanctification:** This "doing" is not done in human strength to earn heaven, but is the natural outflow of the Holy Spirit dwelling in the believer.

---

### Q14. What did He say of those who should break one of God's commandments?
“Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.” Matt. 5:19.

**Answer:**
Jesus warns against the danger of minimizing even the smallest point of God’s law.

*   **Unity of the Law:** The law is a cohesive whole. To pick and choose which commandments to keep is to place human judgment above Divine authority. James 2:10 tells us, "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
*   **"Called Least":** In the context of the Kingdom, to be "least" or to have no standing implies exclusion for those who unrepentantly teach rebellion. A teacher who leads others to sin bears a heavy responsibility.
*   **Relevance to Sabbath:** This is often applied to the Fourth Commandment, which the world considers "least" or disposable. Yet Jesus upholds "these least commandments" as binding.

---

### Q15. What did He say of those whose righteousness (right-doing) did not exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees?
“For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.” Matt. 5:20.

**Answer:**
Jesus contrasts external conformity with internal holiness.

*   **Pharisaic Righteousness:** The Pharisees were rigorous in outward details—tithing mint and cumin, washing hands, and keeping the letter of the law. However, their hearts were often full of pride and self-sufficiency. Theirs was a "works-based" righteousness.
*   **Exceeding Righteousness:** How can we exceed the strictest sect of the Jews?
    1.  **By Source:** We need *imputed* righteousness. We need the righteousness of God by faith (Philippians 3:9), which is perfect, unlike the filthy rags of human effort.
    2.  **By Nature:** We need *imparted* righteousness. The Pharisees cleaned the outside of the cup; Jesus cleans the inside. When the heart is changed by love, the obedience exceeds cold legalism because it flows from a converted nature.

**[ILL] The Mannequin:** A mannequin in a store window may be dressed perfectly, but it has no life. It is stiff and cold. A living child may have messy hair, but it has life, warmth, and love for its parents. The Pharisees were like mannequins—outwardly structured but lifeless. God wants living children who obey from the heart.

---

### Q16. On what particular point did Christ reprove the Pharisees?
“But He answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?” Matt. 15:3.

**Answer:**
Jesus identified the core error of false religion: elevating human tradition above divine revelation.

*   **The Conflict:** The Pharisees accused the disciples of breaking the "tradition of the elders." Jesus countered by accusing the Pharisees of breaking the "commandment of God."
*   **The Principle:** Whenever tradition and Scripture conflict, tradition must yield. To follow tradition at the expense of God's law is transgression.
*   **Prophetic Warning:** This spirit of placing man’s law above God’s law is the identifying mark of the Antichrist power in Daniel 7:25, which would "think to change times and laws."

---

### Q17. How had they done this?
“For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother;... but ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift,... and honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.” Matt. 15:4-6.

**Answer:**
Jesus exposes a specific loophole they invented called "Corban."

*   **The Scheme:** The 5th Commandment requires caring for aging parents. The Pharisees taught that if a man dedicated his money to the Temple (saying "It is a gift," or Corban), he was exempt from using that money to help his parents.
*   **The Result:** They appeared religious (giving to the temple) while actually violating the moral law of love and honor.
*   **Making the Law of None Effect:** By strict adherence to a human rule, they nullified the authority of God’s law. This warns us against any religious system that creates "work-arounds" to avoid the plain requirements of the Ten Commandments.

---

### Q18. What kind of worship did He say theirs was?
“But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” Matt. 15:9.

**Answer:**
Worship that is based on human authority rather than God's Word is termed "vain" (empty, useless, futile).

*   **Criterion of True Worship:** Sincerity alone is not enough. We must worship in "spirit and in truth" (John 4:24). If our doctrines come from men and contradict God, our worship is not accepted in heaven.
*   **Application:** This is a call to every believer to examine their beliefs. Are we observing Sunday, for example, because of the "commandments of men," or are we observing the Bible Sabbath (Saturday) according to the "commandment of God"?

---

### Q19. By what rule will men's actions be weighed in the judgment?
“For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law,... in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.” Rom 2:12-16.

**Answer:**
The moral law is the standard of the final judgment.

*   **Universal Accountability:** Whether one had the written law or only the law of conscience (nature), all are judged by their response to the light they received.
*   **Investigative Judgment:** God will judge the "secrets of men." The law, which discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart, will be the measuring stick.
*   **According to the Gospel:** Note that judgment and gospel go together. The Gospel provides the remedy (Christ’s righteousness) for the failure revealed by the judgment (the Law). Those who are "in Christ" pass the judgment because His perfect law-keeping covers them.

**Definition:**
*   **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (starting in 1844, Dan. 8:14) where the records of professed believers are examined to see who is truly in the faith before the Second Coming.

---

### Q20. How many of those who are condemned will be proved guilty by the law at that time?
“Now we know that what things soever the law saith, It saith to them who are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.” Rom. 3:19.

**Answer:**
The law proves 100% of humanity guilty.

*   **Every Mouth Stopped:** No one can stand before God and argue their innocence. The law silences all excuses.
*   **The Purpose of Guilt:** God does not declare us guilty to crush us, but to strip us of self-righteousness. As long as we think we are "good enough," we will not appreciate the Cross.
*   **Under the Law:** To be "under the law" here means to be under its condemnation. The only way to escape being "under the law" (condemned) is to be "under grace" (Rom 6:14), where Christ’s blood covers the guilt and His Spirit empowers obedience.

---

### Q21. By whom will the saved be blessed in the bestowal of the eternal reward?
“Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Matt. 25:34.

**Answer:**
The reward is bestowed by Jesus Christ, the King, with the full blessing of the Father.

*   **Prepared for You:** Salvation is God’s plan from the beginning. He desires to save, not to destroy.
*   **Inheritance:** We do not earn the kingdom as wages; we receive it as an inheritance because we have been adopted as children of God through faith in Jesus.

---

### Q22. What blessing will God give to those who have kept His commandments?
“Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” Rev. 22:14.

**Answer:**
The final beatitude of the Bible links commandment-keeping with entrance into the New Jerusalem.

*   **The Evidence of Salvation:** These saints are not saved *by* doing the commandments (which would be legalism), but they do the commandments *because* they are saved (faith working by love). Their obedience is the visible fruit of their relationship with Jesus.
*   **Restoration:** Sin (law-breaking) barred Adam and Eve from the Tree of Life (Genesis 3:24). Obedience (faith-empowered law-keeping) is the condition for access to the Tree of Life being restored.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Revelation 14:12 describes this group: "Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." They have the faith *of* Jesus—a faith that trusts the Father completely and obeys Him implicitly. Through this faith, the law that was once written on stone is now transcribed onto their hearts, fitting them for heaven.

**[ILL] The Passport:** A passport gives a traveler the right to enter a country. The traveler didn't print the passport himself; the government issued it. However, the traveler must carry it and not destroy it. Christ’s righteousness is our passport to the City. A life of rebellion (breaking the commandments) throws the passport away. A life of obedience cherishes and holds fast to the gift Christ has given.
