### Q1. What was already at work in the church in Paul's day?

**"The mystery of iniquity doth already work." 2 Thessalonians 2:7.**

**Answer:**

The apostle Paul reveals a startling truth: the great apostasy that would eventually result in a union of church and state was not merely a future event, but a present reality in the apostolic church.

*   **The Mystery of Iniquity:**
    *   **Definition:** The term "mystery of iniquity" (or lawlessness) refers to the hidden, subtle working of Satan to overthrow God’s law while ostensibly remaining within the church. It is the counterfeit of the "mystery of godliness" (1 Timothy 3:16), which is God manifested in the flesh.
    *   **Self-Exaltation:** Just as the "mystery of godliness" is Christ humbling Himself to save man (Philippians 2:5–8), the "mystery of iniquity" is man exalting himself to take the place of God (2 Thessalonians 2:4).
    *   **The Root of the Issue:** This spirit begins in the heart. It is the desire to substitute human tradition for God's commandments and to use force or manipulation rather than the Holy Spirit to control others.

*   **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
    *   True righteousness comes only by faith in Christ, who writes His law upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
    *   The "mystery of iniquity" seeks righteousness by works, forms, and external ceremonies. When the church loses the internal power of the Gospel (Christ in you), it inevitably seeks external power (political influence) to prop up its existence.

*   **Sanctuary Connection:**
    *   In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner relied entirely on the sacrifice and the priest. The "mystery of iniquity" shifts reliance to human priests and earthly systems, obscuring Christ’s work in the heavenly sanctuary.

**[ILL]** **The Leaven:** Jesus compared the kingdom of heaven to leaven (yeast), but He also warned of the "leaven of the Pharisees" (Luke 12:1), which is hypocrisy. If a baker puts a drop of poison in the dough, it is hidden at first. It looks like bread and smells like bread, but as it works through the lump, it corrupts the whole. The "mystery of iniquity" was a spiritual poison introduced early in the church, mixing the Gospel with human pride.

### Q2. What class of men did he warn were to soon arise in the church?

**“For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them." Acts 20:29, 30.**

**Answer:**

Paul’s farewell to the Ephesian elders contains a solemn warning against internal corruption. The danger was not only from pagan persecutors outside, but from false teachers inside.

*   **Wolves in Sheep's Clothing:**
    *   A "wolf" in the church is a leader who feeds *on* the flock rather than feeding the flock. They seek personal gain, authority, or prestige rather than the salvation of souls (Ezekiel 34:2–4).
*   **"Of Your Own Selves":**
    *   The most dangerous deception comes from those who hold high office within the church structure.
    *   **Motivation:** Their goal is "to draw away disciples *after them*." Instead of pointing men and women to the Lamb of God (John 1:29) and the High Priest in heaven (Hebrews 8:1), they attach people to themselves, their intellect, or their organization.
*   **Perverse Things:**
    *   This refers to twisted doctrines that distort the character of God. Any teaching that lessens the authority of God's law or obscures the sufficiency of Christ's grace is a "perverse thing."

*   **The Spirit of Antichrist:**
    *   The spirit of antichrist is not just an open denial of Jesus; it is a *replacement* of Jesus. When a leader steps between the soul and the Savior, demanding a loyalty that belongs only to God, the seeds of the papacy are being sown.

### Q3. What apostasy in the church was to develop before Christ would return the second time?

**“That day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition." 2 Thessalonians 2:3.**

**Answer:**

Paul clarifies that the Second Coming would not happen until a massive, structural rebellion against God occurred within the visible church.

*   **Defining the Terms:**
    *   **Apostasy ("Falling Away"):** From the Greek *apostasia*, meaning a defection or revolt. This is not a falling away from the *name* of Christian, but from the *truth* of Christ (2 Timothy 4:3–4).
    *   **Man of Sin:** A system of lawlessness. This power is characterized by an attempt to change or annul the Law of God (Daniel 7:25).
    *   **Son of Perdition:** This title is applied to only one other person in Scripture: Judas Iscariot (John 17:12). This indicates that this power is not an atheist or an open enemy, but a *betrayer* from within the inner circle—one who kisses Christ while selling Him out.

*   **The Prophetic Sequence:**
    1.  The restraining power (pagan Rome) is removed.
    2.  The "Man of Sin" (Papal Rome) is revealed, taking his seat in the "temple of God" (the church), claiming divine prerogatives.
    3.  The Lord consumes this power with the spirit of His mouth at the Second Coming (2 Thessalonians 2:8).

*   **Sanctuary Insight:**
    *   By setting himself up in the "temple," this power obscures the view of the true Temple in heaven. It diverts the eyes of men from the true Intercessor to human intermediaries.

***

### Q4. How was this "falling away" from Bible truth shown?

**By the adoption of heathen rites and customs in the church.**

**Answer:**

The "falling away" was not an immediate abandonment of Christianity, but a gradual compromise—a blending of pagan philosophy with Christian terminology.

*   **Syncretism (Mixing):**
    *   To make Christianity more palatable to the heathen masses, the church leaders adopted pagan festivals, images, and rituals, giving them Christian names.
    *   **Example:** The veneration of images (forbidden by the Second Commandment) was introduced to replace the pagan worship of idols. Sunday (the day of the sun) was elevated to replace the biblical Sabbath (the seal of God’s authority), aligning the church with the customs of the Roman Empire.
*   **Loss of Spiritual Power:**
    *   When the church possesses the "power of godliness" (2 Timothy 3:5), she does not need to imitate the world to attract converts. The Holy Spirit convicts hearts (John 16:8).
    *   When the church loses the Spirit, she resorts to pageantry, sensory rituals, and elaborate liturgy to impress the senses, substituting emotionalism or formalism for genuine conversion.

**[ILL]** **The Muddy Stream:** If you have a glass of pure water and add a drop of sewage, it is no longer pure. The church in the early centuries tried to expand the "river of life" by digging channels into the stagnant pools of paganism. The volume of water increased (more members), but the purity was lost.

### Q5. What came to be the character and work of many of the religious leaders?

**‘Worldly-minded bishops, instead of caring for the salvation of their flocks, were often but too much inclined to travel about, and entangle themselves in worldly concerns." Neander, General History of the Christian Religion and Church (Torrey's translation}, Vol. 2, p. 16.**

**Answer:**

The historian Neander describes a shift from a ministry of service to a ministry of politics.

*   **The Shift in Focus:**
    *   **True Ministry:** The biblical elder feeds the flock, taking the oversight not for "filthy lucre" (money) or as a "lord over God's heritage," but as an example (1 Peter 5:2–3).
    *   **Apostate Ministry:** As the church gained wealth and status, leadership positions attracted ambitious men who sought power rather than piety. They became entangled in "worldly concerns"—politics, real estate, and civil influence.
*   **Sanctification vs. Status:**
    *   In God's kingdom, greatness is measured by service (Mark 10:43–44). In the developing apostasy, greatness was measured by rank, titles, and proximity to the Emperor.
    *   A leader concerned with political maneuvering has little time to weep for souls or point sinners to the Lamb of God.

### Q6. What has been the special characteristic of the papacy?

**A union of church and state, or the religious power dominating the civil power to further its ends.**

**Answer:**

The defining mark of the Papacy is not merely its theology, but its method of operation: using the "sword of Caesar" to enforce the "will of God."

*   **Defining the Papacy:**
    *   **Papacy:** The ecclesiastical system in which the Bishop of Rome claims supreme authority over the church and, historically, over the state.
*   **Two Opposing Principles:**
    *   **God's Government:** Based on free will and love. "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" (Revelation 22:17). God accepts only voluntary service (Joshua 24:15).
    *   **Satan's Principle:** Based on force and coercion. If you cannot convince the heart, force the body. This is the principle of the union of church and state.
*   **Spiritual Adultery:**
    *   The Bible calls the church the "bride" of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2). She is to rely on Him for support and protection.
    *   When the church turns to the kings of the earth (the State) for power and support, Scripture calls this "fornication" (Revelation 17:2). It is an illicit union.

**[ILL]** **Oil and Water:** The church and the state are like oil and water; they have distinct functions. The State deals with civil order and crime; it uses the sword (Romans 13:4). The Church deals with sin and the conscience; it uses the Word of God (Ephesians 6:17). When you try to mix them—using the sword to deal with conscience—you create a monster that destroys both liberty and true religion.

### Q7. When was the union of church and state formed, from which the papacy gained its control over the civil powers?

**The foundation was laid for it during the reign of Constantine, A.D. 313-337, and it developed under his successors.**

**Answer:**

The pivotal moment in church history was the "conversion" of the Roman Emperor Constantine.

*   **The Edict of Milan (A.D. 313):**
    *   Constantine granted freedom of worship, ending centuries of pagan persecution. This was a blessing, but the church did not stop at freedom; she sought *favor*.
*   **The Compromise:**
    *   Satan changed tactics. Since persecution (the roaring lion) only made the church purer and stronger, he switched to patronage (the deceiving serpent).
    *   By marrying the church to the empire, Constantine made it fashionable to be a Christian. Thousands joined the church for political advancement without experiencing the new birth (John 3:3).
*   **Prophetic Fulfillment:**
    *   This transition prepared the way for the "dragon" (Pagan Rome) to give "his power, and his seat, and great authority" to the "beast" (Papal Rome) (Revelation 13:2).

### Q8. How was this governmental patronage of the church shown under Constantine and later rulers?

**Immunities, privileges, and certain judicial functions for the clergy, and gifts, endowments, and financial support for the church; first on a basis of equality with the priesthood and temples of paganism, then on a preferred basis, and finally to the exclusion of all except Catholic orthodoxy.**

**Answer:**

The union of church and state was cemented through legal and financial privileges that corrupted the clergy.

*   **Steps to Tyranny:**
    1.  **Equality:** Christianity was placed on par with paganism.
    2.  **Privilege:** The clergy were exempted from taxes and civil duties. The state began paying the church's bills.
    3.  **Exclusion:** Finally, the state declared that only "Catholic orthodoxy" was legal. Dissenters (those who held to the Bible over tradition) were branded as heretics and punished by the civil law.
*   **The Result of State Support:**
    *   When the church accepts state money, it must accept state control.
    *   **Atonement Distorted:** The focus shifted from the blood of Christ to the gold of the Empire.
    *   **Persecution:** As soon as the church held the sword of the state, she began to use it. This fulfilled the prophecy that the church would become "drunken with the blood of the saints" (Revelation 17:6).
*   **Righteousness by Faith Contrast:**
    *   A church that relies on the state admits it lacks the power of the Holy Spirit. The believer who trusts in Christ relies on the power of God for victory over sin and for the support of the Gospel work, not on the arm of flesh (Jeremiah 17:5).

**[ILL]** **The Crutch:** A healthy man walks on his own two legs. A crippled man needs a crutch. When the church was filled with the Spirit in Acts, she walked and leaped, conquering the world with the Gospel. When she became spiritually paralyzed by sin and compromise under Constantine, she reached for the crutch of State Power to hold herself up. She has leaned on that crutch ever since.
