### Q1. What was the leaven of the Pharisees?

**"Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy." Luke 12:1.**

**Answer:**
The Savior frequently used the symbol of leaven (yeast) to represent an invisible, pervasive influence. While in the parable of the Kingdom (Matthew 13:33) leaven can represent the growth of grace, here Jesus explicitly defines the "leaven of the Pharisees" as hypocrisy.

1.  **The Nature of Leaven:** Just as a small amount of yeast permeates the entire batch of dough, causing it to puff up through fermentation, hypocrisy affects the whole character. It may start small—a slight pretense of being better than we are—but it eventually corrupts the entire spiritual life.
2.  **Puffed Up:** Leaven puffs up the bread. Similarly, the central sin of the Pharisee is pride. Hypocrisy is the attempt to appear righteous outwardly while the heart remains unchanged.
3.  **The Opposite of Faith:**
    *   **Righteousness by Faith** relies on the merits of Christ alone for salvation and His indwelling Spirit for obedience.
    *   **Hypocrisy** relies on the "works of the flesh"—outward performance, human praise, and self-generated holiness.

**Key Definition:**
*   **Hypocrisy:** From the Greek word for "actor" or "mask-wearer." In a spiritual sense, it is the act of pretending to be holy or devoted to God while the heart is actually committed to self and sin.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a beautiful, shiny red apple. On the outside, it looks perfect, fit for a king’s table. But inside, a worm has eaten away the core, leaving only rot and decay. This is the leaven of hypocrisy. It maintains a polished exterior (church attendance, correct diet, proper dress) while the "core" (the heart) is eaten away by pride and selfishness. God looks at the core (1 Samuel 16:7).

### Q2. In what way did the Pharisees show themselves to be hypocrites?

**"Ye hypocrites well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips; but their heart is far from Me." Matt. 15:7, 8.**

**Answer:**
The heart of the Great Controversy is a battle for the allegiance of the human will. Here, Jesus exposes the fatal disconnect between profession and possession.

1.  **Lip Service vs. Heart Service:** God does not judge by the eloquence of our prayers or the correctness of our theological vocabulary. He judges by the condition of the heart.
2.  **The Danger of Formality:** It is possible to keep the Sabbath, return tithe, and profess the Three Angels’ Messages strictly as a form, without the love of Jesus in the soul. This is legalism, which is a form of hypocrisy.
3.  **The New Covenant Promise:** The Lord promises, "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). A hypocrite has the law on their lips (memorized) but not in their heart (loved and obeyed).
4.  **Distance from God:** The text says their heart is "far from Me." Holiness is agreement with God. If our hearts love the world while our lips sing hymns, we are not in agreement with God; we are His enemies (James 4:4).

**[ILL]**
Consider a husband who brings his wife flowers, speaks poetic words of praise to her in public, and claims to adore her, yet secretly he is texting another woman and planning to leave. His public words are "drawing nigh with the mouth," but his actions prove his heart is "far away." God desires a marriage covenant of faithfulness, not a performance.

### Q3. How had the Saviour shown that their hearts were not with the Lord?

**"For God commanded, saying, Honor thy father and mother... But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; and honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition." Matt. 15:4-6.**

**Answer:**
Here Jesus strikes at the root of false religion: the elevation of human tradition over the express Law of God.

1.  **The Commandment:** The Fifth Commandment requires honoring parents. This includes caring for them in their old age.
2.  **The Tradition (Corban):** The Pharisees invented a rule where a man could dedicate his property to the Temple (saying, "It is Corban," or a gift to God). Once dedicated, he claimed he could not use it to help his needy parents, yet he often kept the use of it for himself.
3.  **Making the Law of "None Effect":**
    *   They used a religious act (giving to the temple) to excuse a moral duty (loving their parents).
    *   **Righteousness by Faith** establishes the law (Romans 3:31). It writes the law of love in the heart.
    *   **Hypocrisy** looks for loopholes to avoid the spirit of the law while keeping the letter of their own traditions.
4.  **Sanctuary Truth:** The Law of God is in the Ark of the Covenant, under the Mercy Seat. It is the standard of judgment. No human tradition—whether Sunday sacredness or the "Corban" rule—can alter the Ten Commandments (Psalm 89:34).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a man who refuses to pay his debts to his neighbor, claiming, "I cannot pay you what I owe, because I have promised to give that money to the church building fund." He thinks he is being pious, but he is actually a thief and a hypocrite. God says, "I hate robbery for burnt offering" (Isaiah 61:8). True religion pays its debts and loves its neighbor.

### Q4. What other sign of insincerity did they manifest?

**"And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward." Matt. 6:5.**

**Answer:**
Prayer is the breath of the soul, the channel through which the life of God flows into the believer. Hypocrisy cuts this lifeline by turning it into a performance for an audience of men.

1.  **The Motive:** The hypocrite prays "to be seen of men." Their reward is the applause and admiration of others. Jesus says, "They have their reward"—that is all they will ever get. They receive no answer from heaven.
2.  **Secret Prayer:** The cure for this hypocrisy is the "closet" (Matthew 6:6). In secret prayer, there is no audience but God. It is the test of sincerity. Do we pray as fervently when no one is watching as we do in the prayer meeting?
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** In the Holy Place, the incense represents the merits of Christ mingled with the prayers of the saints (Revelation 8:3-4). A prayer offered for self-glorification has no incense; it does not rise to heaven. It is "strange fire."
4.  **Justification:** We cannot justify ourselves by long, public prayers. The publican who beat his breast and said, "God be merciful to me a sinner" went down to his house justified, rather than the Pharisee who prayed about his own virtues (Luke 18:13-14).

**[ILL]**
A store mannequin can be dressed in the finest clothes and placed in the window for everyone to admire. It looks like a person, but it has no life, no breath, and no heartbeat. A hypocritical prayer is like that mannequin—a decorated outer form with no living connection to the Father.

### Q5. What did Christ call those who so readily saw the faults of others, but did not correct their own?

**"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye." Matt. 7:5.**

**Answer:**
Criticism and a judgmental spirit are sure signs of a lack of grace. Those who have seen the enormity of their own sin in the light of the Cross are rarely quick to condemn the small failings of others.

1.  **The Beam vs. The Mote:** A "beam" is a large log; a "mote" is a speck of dust. Jesus uses humor to show the absurdity of a man with a log in his eye trying to perform eye surgery on someone else.
2.  **Self-Deception:** The hypocrite feels righteous because they can identify sin in others. But a critical spirit is often a greater sin than the specific act they are criticizing.
3.  **The Order of Cleansing:**
    *   **First:** "Cast out the beam." This is the work of repentance and surrender. We must invite the Holy Spirit to cleanse our own hearts (Psalm 51:10).
    *   **Then:** "See clearly." Only the sanctified heart has the wisdom and gentleness to restore a brother (Galatians 6:1).
4.  **Preparation for Judgment:** We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement. We should be afflicting our own souls, not afflicting the souls of our brethren by harsh criticism.

**[ILL]**
If a window is dirty, everything you look at through it seems blurry and unclean. If you look at your neighbor through a dirty window, you might say, "Look how dirty his clothes are!" But the dirt is actually on your own glass. We must clean our own pane of glass (our heart/mind) before we can rightly judge the condition of others.

### Q6. What is the real work of a hypocrite?

**"A hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbor." Prov. 11:9.**

**Answer:**
Hypocrisy is not a victimless sin. It actively destroys faith and community.

1.  **Destruction by False Teaching:** A hypocrite may teach error while claiming it is truth, leading others into paths of destruction (2 Peter 2:1-2).
2.  **Destruction by Slander:** As seen in the previous question, the hypocrite often elevates themselves by tearing down the reputation of their neighbor.
3.  **Destruction by Bad Example:** When a professing Christian lives a double life, they destroy the faith of those watching. Children who see their parents act religious at church but angry and dishonest at home often grow up to despise God.
4.  **The Cure:** "But through knowledge shall the just be delivered" (Prov. 11:9, latter part). A true knowledge of God—knowing Him by experience—protects us from the deception of hypocrites.

**[ILL]**
A lighthouse is meant to guide ships to safety. But if a wrecker puts up a false light on the rocks to trick the captain, the ship crashes and is destroyed. A hypocrite is a false light. They signal "safety" and "truth," but those who follow their example are led to spiritual shipwreck.

### Q7. What eminent man was once nearly sacrificed by the dissimulations (really hypocrisy) of some Jews and one of the apostles?

**"And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him [Peter]; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation." Gal. 2:13.**

**Answer:**
Even the Apostle Peter, who walked with Jesus, was not immune to the temptation of hypocrisy. This incident occurred in Antioch.

1.  **The Situation:** Peter had been eating with Gentile converts, acknowledging that in Christ, there is no wall of separation. But when strict Jewish believers arrived from Jerusalem, Peter withdrew and separated himself, fearing their criticism.
2.  **The Ripple Effect:** Peter’s action was "dissimulation" (hypocrisy). He acted as if he believed the Gentiles were unclean, even though God had shown him otherwise (Acts 10:28). Because of his influence, Barnabas—a good man full of the Holy Ghost—was also led astray.
3.  **The Danger of Influence:** No matter how high our position, if we act falsely, we drag others down with us.
4.  **Justification by Faith at Stake:** Peter’s action suggested that Gentiles needed to become like Jews to be saved. This struck at the heart of the Gospel—that we are saved by faith in Christ, not by cultural rituals or fleshly heritage.

**Key Definition:**
*   **Dissimulation:** Concealing one's true motives or beliefs under a false appearance; acting differently than one knows to be true.

**[ILL]**
If the lead sheep jumps off a cliff, the rest of the flock often follows blindly. Peter was a lead sheep. When he acted out of fear rather than principle, he led the flock (Barnabas and the Jews) away from the truth of the Gospel.

### Q8. Why did Paul say he opposed Peter in the work he was doing at that time?

**"But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed." Gal. 2:11.**

**Answer:**
Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, saw that this was not a matter of personal preference, but a matter of the Gospel itself.

1.  **Open Rebuke:** Paul did not gossip about Peter behind his back; he withstood him "to the face." This is the biblical way to handle sin in the church (Matthew 18:15).
2.  **The Issue:** Peter was compelling Gentiles to live as do the Jews, implying that Christ’s righteousness was not enough—that they also needed adherence to Jewish ceremonial laws.
3.  **Faith vs. Works:** Paul argued that if righteousness comes by the law (or ceremonial separation), then Christ is dead in vain (Galatians 2:21).
4.  **Courage for Truth:** We must love the truth more than we love peace or the approval of leaders. True unity is found only in the truth (John 17:17).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a doctor sees another doctor about to administer the wrong medicine—a medicine that could kill the patient. Is it polite to stay silent? No! Love demands that he speak up and stop the error. Paul saw Peter administering the poison of legalism and hypocrisy, and he intervened to save the church.

### Q9. What will become of the hypocrite's hope?

**"So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish." Job 8:13.**

**Answer:**
Every human being lives by some hope. The Christian hopes in the return of Christ. The hypocrite also hopes—usually hoping that their outward works will save them, or hoping that God will not see their secret sins.

1.  **A Perishing Hope:** The hypocrite’s hope is like a spider's web (Job 8:14). It looks structured and intricate, but it is fragile. When the broom of judgment comes, it is swept away instantly.
2.  **The Investigative Judgment:** We are judged by our works because our works reveal our faith. If the life has been a charade, the books of heaven record the reality, not the pretense. "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing" (Ecclesiastes 12:14).
3.  **No Foundation:** Only the house built on the Rock (Christ and His Word) stands the storm. The house on the sand (hearing but not doing—hypocrisy) falls (Matthew 7:26-27).

**[ILL]**
A man may carry a counterfeit passport. It looks real, and he hopes it will get him across the border. But when the border guard scans it, the fraud is detected, and the man is rejected. At the gate of heaven, no counterfeit character will pass. Only the robe of Christ’s genuine righteousness allows entry.

### Q10. What did David say he would not do?

**"I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers." Ps. 26:4.**

**Answer:**
"Dissemblers" are those who hide their true character—hypocrites. David, a man after God's own heart, knew that he became like the company he kept.

1.  **Separation from the World:** While we must mingle with sinners to win them to Christ, we are not to "sit" with them in their vanity or join in their pretenses.
2.  **Sanctification involves Separation:** We are called to "Come out from among them, and be ye separate" (2 Corinthians 6:17). This implies leaving behind the associations that encourage a double life.
3.  **The Danger of Compromise:** To "go in with dissemblers" means to join them in their activities. If we laugh at their crude jokes or nod along with their skepticism to fit in, we are becoming dissemblers ourselves.

**[ILL]**
If you put on a pair of white gloves and play in the mud, the gloves do not make the mud clean; the mud makes the gloves dirty. We cannot "sit" in the mud of hypocrisy and expect to keep our garments of righteousness unspotted.

### Q11. If one has true heavenly wisdom, what kind of fruits will he bear?

**"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy." James 3:17.**

**Answer:**
Here is the antidote to the leaven of the Pharisees. It is the fruit of the Holy Spirit—Imparted Righteousness.

1.  **Source:** This wisdom comes "from above." It is not generated by human effort or education. It is a gift from the Father of lights (James 1:17).
2.  **Characteristics:**
    *   **Pure:** No secret corruption.
    *   **Peaceable/Gentle:** Not critical or abrasive like the Pharisees.
    *   **Easy to be entreated:** Willing to listen and learn; not stubborn.
    *   **Without Partiality:** Treating the poor the same as the rich.
    *   **Without Hypocrisy:** Transparent. The outside matches the inside.
3.  **The Work of Sanctification:** God does not just cover us with a robe; He changes us into His image. When Christ dwells in the heart by faith, hypocrisy is driven out by love.

**[ILL]**
Think of a clear mountain stream. You can see all the way to the bottom. There is no mud, no hidden debris, just clear, life-giving water. A Christian without hypocrisy is like that stream—transparent and pure, because the source is pure.

### Q12. Where does the Saviour class those who profess to believe in the lord's coming, and yet by their actions show that their hearts are not in the matter?

**"And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." Matt. 24:51.**

**Answer:**
This verse concludes the parable of the Evil Servant. This servant said in his heart, "My lord delayeth his coming," and began to abuse his fellow servants and live for the world.

1.  **The Context:** This is a warning for the church in the last days (Matthew 24).
2.  **The Fatal Error:** The servant did not deny the Lord's existence; he denied the *imminence* and *authority* of the Lord by his actions. He lived as if the Lord would not see.
3.  **The Punishment:** He is appointed his portion with the hypocrites. Why? Because he claimed to be a servant of the King, but lived like a rebel.
4.  **The Call to Readiness:** We are living in the time of the end. To profess the Advent message while loving the world, engaging in sharp business practices, or cherishing secret sins, is to act the part of the Evil Servant.
5.  **Victory is Possible:** We need not fear this fate. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us [Justification] and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness [Sanctification]" (1 John 1:9). We may have "boldness in the day of judgment" because "as He is, so are we in this world" (1 John 4:17).

**[ILL]**
A soldier on guard duty who falls asleep or gets drunk with the enemy is more dangerous than the enemy himself. He wears the uniform of his country, but his actions betray it. God calls us to be "watchmen" on the walls of Zion, awake, alert, and sincere, waiting for the return of our Captain.
