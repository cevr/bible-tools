## Slide 1 – Q1: Seeking Salvation
- **Question:** How earnestly should we seek for salvation?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:10 – “Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Cooperation & Election)
- **Cooperative Nature:** Salvation is by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8), but it is not a passive experience.
- **“Give Diligence”:** We must make an earnest, persistent effort to walk in the light God gives.
- **Making it Sure:**
  - God’s calling is faithful (1 Thessalonians 5:24).
  - The uncertainty lies with us; we must anchor our wavering will in Christ.
- **Definition – Election:** God’s gracious choice to save those who are “in Christ.” It is a selection of a *class of people* (believers), not an arbitrary selection of individuals for heaven or hell.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Sanctification)
- **Not “Earning” Salvation:** Diligence does not buy heaven. It is the active reception of the gift.
  - We must lay hold of Christ’s strength.
- **Sanctification:**
  - The verse connects to adding virtue, knowledge, and temperance (2 Peter 1:5–7).
  - This is the daily process of becoming more like Christ through the Holy Spirit.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Scholarship Analogy:**
  - A philanthropist offers a full scholarship (the "calling") to anyone who enrolls.
  - To graduate, the student must attend classes and study (diligence).
  - Studying does not “earn” the money—it was a gift—but diligence makes the scholarship effective.
  - **Application:** Salvation is freely given, but we must diligently walk in it.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Persevering to the End
- **Question:** How important is it that we persevere to the end?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 3:11 – “Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Holding Fast)
- **The Danger of Falling:** The Bible does not teach “once saved, always saved.” A believer can cast away their confidence (Hebrews 10:35).
- **Protecting the Crown:** The crown represents victory and eternal life (2 Timothy 4:8). We must guard this treasure against sin and indifference.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We “hold fast” not by our own muscle, but by the continuous exercise of faith.
  - As we keep our eyes on Jesus, “He is able to keep you from falling” (Jude 24).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration
- **The Mountain Climber:**
  - A climber is secured by a strong safety rope held by a master guide (Christ).
  - The climber is told, "Hold fast; do not unclip."
  - If the climber deliberately unclips to chase a distraction, they fall.
  - **The Lesson:** The rope didn't fail; the connection was severed by the climber. We must maintain our connection to Christ.

***

## Slide 8 – Q3: Condition of the Crown
- **Question:** On what condition is the crown of life promised to us?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 2:10 – “Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer... be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Faithfulness)
- **The Condition:** The crown is for those who finish the race, not just those who start.
- **Faithful unto Death:**
  - Faithfulness throughout the entire natural life.
  - Faithfulness even to the point of martyrdom.
- **Quality of Faith:** True faith works by love (Galatians 5:6) and produces obedience to God’s commandments.
- **Definition – Covenant:** A binding agreement where God writes His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10–12), and we pledge loyalty to Him.

***

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Eternal Plan
- **Question:** How long ago did God and Christ determine that they would seek to save us?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 1:4 – “According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Chosen in Him)
- **Eternal Purpose:** The plan of salvation was not an afterthought; Christ is the “Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” (Revelation 13:8).
- **Chosen “In Him”:**
  - God chose *Christ* as the Elect One.
  - Anyone who chooses to be “in Christ” joins that elect group.
- **Security:** Our salvation is rooted in God’s eternal purpose, not the shifting sands of time.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration
- **The Ship’s Destination:**
  - A captain determines a ship's destination before it sets sail.
  - He declares, "Anyone who boards this ship is elected to reach that port."
  - The destination is fixed for the ship (Christ).
  - **Application:** We choose whether to get on board and stay on board.

***

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Object of Election
- **Question:** Who are those that will thus be saved?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 1:4 (R.V.) – “That we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Holiness & Sanctuary)
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - The sacrificial lamb had to be without blemish (Leviticus 22:20–21).
  - Christ proposes to make *us* holy through His grace.
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - The Gospel does not just forgive (Justification); it transforms character (Sanctification).
  - God designs a people who have victory over known sin.
- **Rooted in Love:** Holiness is not cold legalism; it is the fulfillment of the law through love (Romans 13:10).

***

## Slide 15 – Q6: Foreordained to Adoption
- **Question:** To what has God foreordained those who attain to this character?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 1:5 (R.V.) – “Having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Adoption)
- **Adoption:** A legal process granting all rights and privileges of a natural-born son.
- **Restoration:**
  - Adam was a “son of God” (Luke 3:38); sin broke that bond.
  - Christ took our place so we could be “born again” into the family.
- **Heirs:** We become heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17).
- **Definition – Foreordained:** God’s pre-determined plan that *all* who accept Christ shall be adopted. The plan is fixed; participation is voluntary.

***

## Slide 17 – Q7: Called According to Purpose
- **Question:** According to what does God call us?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:28 – “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Providence)
- **God’s Providence:** Even trials and difficulties are overruled by God to refine our characters.
- **The Condition:** The promise is for “them that love God.”
  - To the humble believer, trials purify the soul like gold (1 Peter 1:7).
- **The Purpose:** To be “conformed to the image of His Son” (Romans 8:29). God uses life’s circumstances to shape us into the likeness of Jesus.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Illustration
- **The Sculptor:**
  - A sculptor strikes a block of marble with a hammer and chisel.
  - To the marble, it feels like destruction.
  - The sculptor strikes "according to his purpose"—to reveal the statue inside.
  - **Application:** God chisels our characters through trials to reveal the image of Jesus.

***

## Slide 20 – Q8: God’s Will and Plan
- **Question:** In fulfillment of whose plan have we been predestined?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 1:11 – “In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points (Sovereignty)
- **God is the Architect:** Salvation originates in the "counsel of His own will," not human invention.
- **Confidence:** Because the plan is God's, it cannot fail.
  - “If God be for us, who can be against us?” (Romans 8:31).
- **Harmony:** True religion brings the human will into harmony with the Divine will.

***

## Slide 22 – Q9: Condition of Salvation
- **Question:** Upon what condition is salvation offered to us?
- **Key Text:** Acts 16:31 – “And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Faith & Justification)
- **Saving Faith:** More than just knowledge (James 2:19). It is trusting Christ fully as personal Sin-bearer.
- **Definition – Justification:**
  - The legal act where God declares a repentant sinner righteous.
  - He imputes Christ’s perfect life to the believer (Romans 5:1).
- **Simplicity:** The answer to “What must I do?” is simply “Believe.”
  - This faith naturally leads to a changed life (e.g., the jailer washing stripes).

***

## Slide 24 – Q10: Enduring to the End
- **Question:** For how long must we maintain our faith in and connection with God in order to achieve this final salvation?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:13 – “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Daily Walk)
- **A Marathon, Not a Sprint:** Salvation depends on enduring faith, not just a past decision.
- **Abiding:** We must abide (remain) in the vine to bear fruit (John 15:6).
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the sanctuary, the lamps were kept burning continually (Leviticus 24:2).
  - The oil of the Holy Spirit must be constantly replenished in our hearts.

## Slide 26 – Q10: Illustration
- **Marriage:**
  - A marriage begins with a wedding (Covenant).
  - A happy marriage requires enduring love every day thereafter.
  - One cannot say, "I was faithful on my wedding day," and ignore the spouse for 40 years.
  - **Application:** Relationship with Christ requires daily endurance.

***

## Slide 27 – Q11: Written in Heaven
- **Question:** Can our names be written right now in heaven?
- **Key Text:** Luke 10:20 (R.V.) – “Howbeit in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points (Assurance)
- **The Book of Life:** Heaven keeps a record of those who have accepted God’s service (Philippians 4:3).
- **Present Assurance:**
  - We do not have to wait until death to know if we are accepted.
  - “He that hath the Son hath life” (1 John 5:12).
- **The Heavenly Census:** God’s personal care covers every individual believer.

***

## Slide 29 – Q12: Retaining the Name
- **Question:** Whose names only will be retained in those books?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 3:5 – “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life...”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points (Investigative Judgment)
- **Blotting Out:** Either the *sin* is blotted out (Acts 3:19), or the *name* is blotted out.
- **The Condition:** The name is retained for “he that overcometh.”
- **How to Overcome:**
  - “By the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony” (Revelation 12:11).
  - It is Christ living in us; He covers our lives with His righteousness.
- **Definition – Investigative Judgment:** The review of believers’ lives in the heavenly sanctuary before the Second Coming.

***

## Slide 31 – Q13: God’s Justice
- **Question:** What scripture is sometimes cited as evidence that God is arbitrary in His dealings with men?
- **Key Text:** Romans 9:18 – “Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points (Misunderstood Texts)
- **Context:** This often refers to Pharaoh, who hardened his own heart first (Exodus 8:15).
- **Rejected Light:**
  - God sends light; if rejected, the heart naturally hardens.
  - The same sun melts wax but hardens clay. The difference is in the material.
- **God’s Sovereignty:** God has the right to show mercy to Gentiles who accept Him, rather than only to national Israel.

***

## Slide 33 – Q14: Reciprocity with God
- **Question:** But what other scripture explains those toward whom God "wills" to be merciful, or otherwise?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 18:25–26 – “With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points (Divine Justice)
- **Reciprocity:** God reflects our choices back to us.
  - To the merciful, He is merciful.
  - To the froward (rebellious), He appears as an opponent because He must oppose sin.
- **The Condition for Mercy:**
  - Isaiah 55:7 – “Let the wicked forsake his way... and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him.”
  - God wills to be merciful to *all* who return.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Illustration
- **The Mirror:**
  - A mirror reflects exactly what stands before it (smile or frown).
  - God’s law is a mirror (James 1:23–25).
  - To the righteous, God’s face is approval; to the rebellious, it is “against them that do evil.”
  - The change is in us, not in God.

***

## Slide 36 – Q15: God’s Desire for All
- **Question:** How many people does God desire to be saved?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 2:4 – “Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.”

## Slide 37 – Q15: Key Points (Universal Will)
- **Universal Atonement:** Christ died for “the whole world” (1 John 2:2), not just a select few.
- **The Tragedy of the Lost:**
  - Since God wants all saved, the lost are those who “frustrate the grace of God” (Galatians 2:21).
- **God’s Character:** God is love (1 John 4:8) and takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezekiel 33:11).

***

## Slide 38 – Q16: Our Part
- **Question:** What is our part in the work of salvation?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Joshua 24:15 – “Choose you this day whom ye will serve...”
  - Revelation 22:17 – “Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”

## Slide 39 – Q16: Key Points (The Will)
- **Power of Choice:** We cannot cleanse our own hearts, but we can *choose* to serve God.
- **Continuous Decision:** “Choose you *this day*.” It is a moment-by-moment surrender.
- **The Result:**
  - When we choose to submit, God supplies the power (Philippians 2:13).
  - Our job is to open the door; His job is to come in (Revelation 3:20).

## Slide 40 – Q16: Illustration
- **The Sick Man:**
  - A sick man cannot cure himself, but the doctor brings the medicine.
  - The man must *choose* to swallow the medicine.
  - If he refuses, he dies—not because there was no cure, but because he refused it.
  - **Application:** Faith is the hand that takes the medicine of the Gospel.
