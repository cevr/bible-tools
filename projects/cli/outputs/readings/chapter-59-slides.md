## Slide 1 – Q1: Spiritual Discernment
- **Question:** For what did Christ censure the Jewish people?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 16:3 – “O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points
- **Intellectual Sharpness vs. Spiritual Blindness:**
  - The leaders knew natural science (weather) but missed spiritual reality.
  - They knew the letter of the law but did not recognize the Author of the law standing before them.
- **The Spiritual Danger:**
  - **External Religion:** Interpreting the physical world while ignoring prophecy.
  - **Willful Blindness:** Pride and tradition hardened their hearts against fulfilled prophecy.
- **Application for Today:**
  - We face the same danger of being absorbed by politics, economics, or science.
  - True discernment requires the Holy Spirit to see prophecy fulfilling around us.
- **Key Term – Hypocrisy:**
  - Claiming to believe God’s Word while acting contrary to its spirit (Matthew 23:27–28).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration
- **The Captain and the Lighthouse:**
  - Imagine a ship's captain who is an expert at reading clouds and waves.
  - However, he ignores a lighthouse flashing directly in front of him, warning of rocks.
  - He knows the science of the sea but ignores the specific warning meant to save his life.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The Pharisees knew the "weather" of the world but ignored Jesus, the Light of the World (John 8:12).

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Sign of the Messiah
- **Question:** What sign had Isaiah given by which Christ might be known as the Messiah?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 7:14 – “Therefore the Lord Himself shall give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points & Righteousness by Faith
- **The Sign (Virgin Birth):**
  - Indicates that salvation is not of man's making; it is a divine intervention.
- **The Name (Immanuel):**
  - Means "God with us."
  - God did not send a subordinate; He came Himself to reach man where he is.
- **Connection to Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Because He is "God with us," He can be "God *in* us."
  - He took our nature and infirmities so that He might impart His strength to us.
  - Hebrews 2:14 – “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.”

## Slide 6 – Q3: Fulfillment of Prophecy
- **Question:** Was this fulfilled?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 1:22, 23 – “Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points
- **Reliability of Scripture:**
  - God keeps His appointments.
  - Since God fulfilled the First Advent prophecies to the letter, we can be certain He will fulfill the Second Advent prophecies.
  - Habakkuk 2:3 – “For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.”
- **The Mystery of Godliness:**
  - The fulfillment was humble (a carpenter's family), yet it was the pivotal moment of history.
  - God often fulfills His word in ways that prideful men overlook.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration
- **The Lock and Key:**
  - Prophecy is like a lock with a complex, unique shape.
  - History is the key.
  - If a key fits the lock perfectly and opens the door, you know it was made for that lock.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The life of Jesus fits the "lock" of Isaiah’s prophecy perfectly, proving He is the one sent to open the door of salvation.

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Place of Birth
- **Question:** Where had the prophet said Christ should be born?
- **Key Text:** Micah 5:2 – “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points
- **God Chooses the Humble:**
  - He bypassed Jerusalem (the center of power/pride) for Bethlehem.
  - Bethlehem means "House of Bread."
- **The Bread of Life:**
  - It was fitting that Jesus, the "Bread of Life," should be born in the "House of Bread."
  - John 6:35 – “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.”
- **Eternal Origins:**
  - Micah 5:2 affirms His goings forth were "from of old, from everlasting," proving Christ's pre-existence and divinity.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Historical Confirmation
- **Question:** Where was Christ born?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 2:1 – “Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points
- **Sovereignty of God:**
  - God used a decree from Caesar Augustus (taxation) to move Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem at the exact moment needed.
  - Even heathen rulers are unwitting agents in God’s hand to fulfill His word.
- **Certainty of Faith:**
  - Our faith is grounded in historical facts predicted by prophets.
  - 2 Peter 1:16 – “For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.”

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Triumphal Entry Predicted
- **Question:** What had been predicted of His ride into Jerusalem?
- **Key Text:** Zechariah 9:9 – “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King cometh unto thee; He is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points & Application
- **Character of the King:**
  - **Just:** He comes with righteousness.
  - **Lowly:** Riding a donkey (symbol of peace), not a warhorse (symbol of bloodshed).
  - **Salvation:** His mission was to conquer sin, not Rome.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - Christ’s kingdom is established by love, not force.
  - To receive His righteousness, we must lay down our pride.
  - Ephesians 2:8–9 – “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”

## Slide 15 – Q7: Fulfillment of the Entry
- **Question:** Was this fulfilled?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 21:4, 5 – “All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, saying Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points & Atonement
- **The Event:**
  - Jesus intentionally declared Himself the Messiah by fulfilling this Scripture.
  - The crowds cried "Hosanna" ("Save now").
- **The Atonement Connection:**
  - This began the week of the Atonement, where the Lamb of God would be slain.
  - He entered as a King but would be crowned with thorns to pay the debt of sin.
- **Key Term – Atonement:**
  - The work of reconciliation: Christ's sacrifice (paying the debt) and His priestly ministry (cleansing the sinner and sanctuary).
  - Romans 5:11 – “And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.”

## Slide 17 – Q8: The Disciples' Question
- **Question:** Did the believers of these and other evidences of His Messiaship, expect a sign of His second coming?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:3 – “And as He sat upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came unto Him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Key Points
- **Context:**
  - The disciples associated the destruction of the temple with the end of the world.
- **Dual Prophecy:**
  - Jesus' answer in Matthew 24 blends two events:
    1. The destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70).
    2. The final destruction of the world at the Second Coming.
- **Looking for the Day:**
  - True disciples are always looking for the day of God.
  - 2 Peter 3:12 – “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?”

## Slide 19 – Q9: Signs in Nature
- **Question:** How does Luke record our Saviour's answer to this query?
- **Key Text:** Luke 21:25, 26 – “And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.”

## Slide 20 – Q9: Key Points & Sanctuary
- **The Signs:**
  - **Celestial:** Disturbances in sun, moon, and stars.
  - **Terrestrial:** Distress of nations, roaring seas.
  - **Psychological:** Fear and perplexity among the lost.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the people waited in solemnity for the High Priest to finish his work on the Day of Atonement.
  - Nature’s signs signal that our High Priest (Jesus) is about to finish His work in the Heavenly Sanctuary.
  - Daniel 12:1 – “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people...”

## Slide 21 – Q10: Old Testament Prediction
- **Question:** What is said of these signs by an Old Testament prophet?
- **Key Text:** Joel 2:30, 31 – “And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.”

## Slide 22 – Q10: Key Points
- **Precursors to the End:**
  - The darkening of the sun and the moon turning to blood are specific markers before the "Day of the Lord."
- **Nature's Testimony:**
  - Creation itself "groans and travails" (Romans 8:22) awaiting redemption.
- **A Wake-Up Call:**
  - These signs urge the world to repent while probation lingers.

## Slide 23 – Q11: The Dark Day
- **Question:** Have the sun and the moon been darkened in fulfillment of these predictions?
- **Historical Note:** “But especially I mention that wonderful darkness on the 19th of May [1780]...”

## Slide 24 – Q11: Key Points
- **Fulfillment:** May 19, 1780 ("The Dark Day").
- **Timing:**
  - Occurred "immediately after the tribulation of those days" (Matthew 24:29).
  - The "tribulation" (1260 years of papal persecution) was cut short by the Reformation in the mid-18th century.
  - This sign marked the beginning of the "Time of the End."
- **The Event:**
  - Not an eclipse (full moon).
  - Supernatural darkness in the northeastern US; birds roosted at noon; men feared Judgment had come.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Illustration
- **The Theater Lights:**
  - When a theater manager dims the house lights, the audience knows the show is about to start; focus turns to the stage.
- **The Lesson:**
  - On May 19, 1780, God dimmed the lights of the sun.
  - This signaled to the world that the drama of the ages was entering its final act.

## Slide 26 – Q12: Falling Stars
- **Question:** Has there been a display of falling stars that would meet the specifications predicted?
- **Historical Note:** Prof. Olmstead (Yale): “Those who were so fortunate as to witness the exhibition of shooting stars on the morning of Nov.13, 1833, probably saw the greatest display of celestial fire works that has ever been since the creation of the world...”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points
- **Fulfillment:** November 13, 1833 (The Great Leonid Meteor Shower).
- **Biblical Prediction:**
  - Revelation 6:13 – “And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.”
- **Significance:**
  - Occurred 53 years after the Dark Day.
  - Heralded the end of the 2300-day prophecy (1844) and the start of the Investigative Judgment.
  - Spurred the Great Awakening and the Advent movement.

## Slide 28 – Q13: Roaring Seas
- **Question:** What may be said with reference to the late unusual ocean tempests?
- **Historical Note:** Burnet remarks: “Let us then proceed in our explication of this sign, the roaring sea and waves, applying it to the end of the world...”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Key Points
- **Fulfillment:**
  - Increasing intensity of natural disasters, tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods.
- **The Meaning:**
  - The earth is wearing out like a garment.
  - Psalm 102:26 – “They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.”
- **Our Hope:**
  - We must not build on this world, but on the Solid Rock, Jesus Christ.

## Slide 30 – Q14: Increase of Knowledge
- **Question:** What other sign is to indicate the time of the end?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 12:4 – “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: Key Points
- **Unsealing of Prophecy:**
  - After 1798 (Time of the End), the "sealed" prophecies of Daniel (2300 days, sanctuary) were understood.
  - "Running to and fro" refers to searching the Scriptures (Amos 8:12).
- **Scientific Knowledge:**
  - Explosion of travel and technology in the 19th/20th centuries.
- **God's Purpose:**
  - Technology was permitted to spread the Gospel rapidly.
  - Revelation 14:6 – “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.”

## Slide 32 – Q15: Moral Decay
- **Question:** What is predicted of the moral condition of the world in the last days?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:1–5 – “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves... having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.”

## Slide 33 – Q15: Key Points & Sanctification
- **The Root of Decay:**
  - **Selfishness:** Men shall be "lovers of their own selves."
- **The Form vs. The Power:**
  - *Form:* Outward religion, doctrine, church attendance.
  - *Power:* The Gospel is the power of God to save from sin (Romans 1:16).
  - To deny the power is to refuse to let Christ transform the character.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - True religion is the indwelling life of Christ, not just a form.
  - We must allow the Spirit to write the law on our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).
- **Key Term – Sanctification:**
  - The process of being made holy and restored to God's image by the Holy Spirit (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

## Slide 34 – Q16: Scoffers
- **Question:** How will the message of the Lord's coming be generally treated?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:3, 4 – “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days, scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.”

## Slide 35 – Q16: Key Points
- **The Argument:**
  - **Uniformitarianism:** "All things continue as they were."
  - Belief that the world has always functioned the same way.
- **The Motive:**
  - They scoff because they walk "after their own lusts."
  - Admitting Christ is coming means giving up sin.
- **God's Patience:**
  - The delay is not slackness, but mercy.
  - 2 Peter 3:9 – “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”

## Slide 36 – Q17: The Faithful Servant
- **Question:** What will God's faithful servants be doing at this time?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:45 – “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?”

## Slide 37 – Q17: Key Points
- **Meat in Due Season:**
  - "Present Truth" applicable to the current time (The Three Angels' Messages).
- **Service:**
  - The servant focuses on feeding the household, not himself.
- **Motivation:**
  - He serves not to earn salvation, but because he belongs to the Lord.

## Slide 38 – Q17: Illustration
- **Winter Food:**
  - A wise father ensures his family has food stored for winter; he doesn't feed them summer fruit out of season.
- **The Application:**
  - The faithful teacher gives "winter food"—solemn warnings and promises needed for the final crisis—to sustain the flock.

## Slide 39 – Q18: The Call to Readiness
- **Question:** What are all admonished to do when these signs have appeared?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:44 – “Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.”

## Slide 40 – Q18: Key Points & The Wedding Garment
- **What is Readiness?**
  - Having the "wedding garment" on—the imputed righteousness of Christ.
  - Matthew 22:11–12 – “And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.”
- **Practical Application:**
  - Live in a state of confessed sin and dependence on Jesus.
  - Live today as if it were the last, but work as if we have years.

## Slide 41 – Q19: The Evil Servant
- **Question:** What will be done to those evil ones who say in their hearts that the Lord delays His coming?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:50, 51 – “The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him... and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

## Slide 42 – Q19: Key Points & Probation
- **The Fatal Error:**
  - Believing "My Lord delayeth his coming."
  - This leads to careless living and worldly association.
- **The Warning:**
  - Do not presume upon God's grace.
  - Enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus while there is time.
  - Hebrews 10:19 – “Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.”
- **Key Term – Probation:**
  - The time granted by God for men to accept salvation and have their characters transformed before the final judgment.
