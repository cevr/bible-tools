### Q1. Of what did Paul say he was not ashamed?
“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth.” (Romans 1:16)

**Answer:**
The apostle Paul declares boldly that he is not ashamed of the **gospel**, for it is nothing less than the omnipotent energy of God directed toward the saving of man.

1.  **Defining the Gospel:** The word "gospel" means "good news." It is the glad tidings that God has provided a way for sinners to be reconciled to Himself.
2.  **Power, Not Just Theory:** The text says the gospel is the *power* (Greek: *dunamis*) of God. It is not merely a philosophy or a code of ethics. It is a living, active force that:
    *   Breaks the chains of habit and sin (Romans 6:14).
    *   Transforms the character (2 Corinthians 5:17).
    *   Rescues man from the penalty and power of sin.
3.  **The Condition:** This power is operative "to everyone that believeth." Faith is the hand that grasps the power. Without faith, the power remains external; with faith, it becomes an internal reality.

**[ILL] The Live Wire:** Imagine a wire connected to a massive power plant. In itself, the wire looks cold and dead. But touch it to a lamp, and it brings light; touch it to a motor, and it drives machinery. The gospel is like that wire. To the skeptic, it seems foolishness; but to the one who believes, it connects the soul to the infinite power of Heaven, lighting up the mind and driving the life in the path of obedience.

### Q2. What good tidings did the angels announce to the shepherds?
“Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people; for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:10, 11)

**Answer:**
The angels announced the arrival of the central figure of all history: the **Saviour**.

1.  **Universal Joy:** The message was for "all people." The plan of salvation is not limited to a specific race or class; it is a universal offer of grace to the entire human family (Titus 2:11).
2.  **The Identity of the Babe:** He is identified as "Christ the Lord."
    *   **Christ (Messiah):** The Anointed One, the High Priest and King promised in the Old Testament prophecies (Daniel 9:25).
    *   **Lord:** The Creator Himself, taking on humanity to redeem it (John 1:1–3, 14).
3.  **The Necessity of a Saviour:** The title "Saviour" implies that humanity is lost and in desperate need of rescue. We cannot save ourselves; help must come from outside our sphere.

### Q3. What did Simeon say after seeing the Saviour?
“And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary His mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel.” (Luke 2:34)

**Answer:**
Simeon, moved by the Holy Spirit, prophesied that Jesus would be the deciding factor in the destiny of men.

1.  **The Crisis of Decision:** Christ is the "Stone of Stumbling" and the "Rock of Ages" (1 Peter 2:6–8). No one can remain neutral regarding Him.
    *   **The Fall:** Those who cling to their own righteousness and refuse to submit to God's way will fall, broken by their pride (Matthew 21:44).
    *   **The Rising Again:** Those who humble themselves, admitting their need, are raised up to newness of life (James 4:10).
2.  **A Revealer of Hearts:** The presence of Christ compels men to show their true colors. The light reveals who loves the darkness and who seeks the truth (John 3:19–21).

### Q4. To whom did Anna the prophetess speak of the Saviour?
“And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of Him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.” (Luke 2:38)

**Answer:**
Anna spoke to a specific group: those who "looked for redemption."

1.  **The Remnant of Faith:** Even in times of spiritual darkness, God has always preserved a people who study the prophecies and long for deliverance. These faithful few were not looking for political revolution, but for **redemption**—deliverance from the guilt and power of sin.
2.  **Sharing the News:** Like the shepherds and Simeon, Anna could not keep the good news silent. True faith always leads to witnessing. When one finds the Remedy for sin, they naturally tell the dying patients around them where to find the Cure.

### Q5. In his pre-announcement of Christ's birth and name, what did the angel say Christ should do?
“And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus [Saviour]; for He shall save His people from their sins.” (Matthew 1:21)

**Answer:**
This text provides the very definition of the gospel mission: to save people **from** their sins.

1.  **Not Saved *IN* Sin:** Many misunderstand salvation, thinking God saves them while they continue to cherish and practice iniquity. But the angel was clear: Jesus saves us *from* sin—from its penalty (guilt) and its power (dominion).
2.  **The Nature of Sin:** Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4). To be saved from sin means to be brought back into harmony with God's law.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** This salvation is a miracle. God does not merely overlook sin; He cleanses the heart and implants a new nature that hates sin and loves righteousness (Ezekiel 36:26–27).

**[ILL] The Drowning Man:** If a lifeguard saves a drowning man, he pulls him *out* of the water. He does not leave him in the water and merely pronounce him "dry." So Christ pulls us out of the ocean of sin; He does not leave us drowning in disobedience while calling us "saved."

---

### Q6. On what condition was He to save them?
“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)

**Answer:**
The condition is **belief**, or faith, in the Son of God.

1.  **The Motivation:** "God so loved." The plan of salvation originated in the Father's love. He was not compelled to save us; He desired it.
2.  **The Cost:** He "gave" His Son. This implies the sacrificial death of Christ. The broken law demanded the life of the transgressor; Christ gave His life to meet that demand so that mercy could be extended to us (Romans 3:25–26).
3.  **What is Saving Faith?** It is more than intellectual assent.
    *   It is a transaction where the sinner gives his life to Christ and accepts Christ’s life in return (Galatians 2:20).
    *   It acts upon the word of God, trusting His promises for forgiveness and for the power to overcome.

**Definition:**
*   **Justification:** The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is righteous, based solely on the merits of Christ, received by faith (Romans 5:1).

### Q7. Christ saves believers from their sins under the Christian dispensation; but does His blood atone for sins committed in the old dispensation?
“And for this cause He is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.” (Hebrews 9:15)

**Answer:**
Yes, the blood of Christ is retroactive. It reaches backward to Adam and forward to the last man who shall be saved.

1.  **One Way of Salvation:** There have never been two ways to be saved (e.g., by works in the Old Testament and by grace in the New). All who are saved—from Abel to the thief on the cross—are saved by the blood of Christ (Acts 4:12).
2.  **The Credit of the Cross:** Before the cross, believers looked *forward* in faith to the coming Messiah, offering sacrifices that symbolized His death. God accepted their faith based on the pledge of Christ's future sacrifice.
3.  **The Reality:** Now that Christ has died, the debt is paid in full. The "transgressions that were under the first testament" (the time before the cross) are fully redeemed by the actual death of the Testator.

---

### Q8. How did Abel show his faith in the coming Saviour?
“By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.” (Hebrews 11:4)

**Answer:**
Abel showed his faith by obeying God's instruction to offer a lamb, acknowledging his need of a substitute.

1.  **The Blood vs. The Fruit:** Cain brought the fruit of the ground—the product of his own labor. This represents salvation by works (human effort). Abel brought a lamb (the firstlings of his flock), representing faith in the "Lamb of God" (John 1:29).
2.  **Confession of Sin:** By slaying the lamb, Abel confessed, "I am a sinner worthy of death. I trust in the death of the Substitute God has promised."
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Abel was accounted righteous not because he was naturally better than Cain, but because he relied on the merits of the promised Redeemer.

---

### Q9. What did the ceremonial law of the Jews contain?
“For the law having a shadow of good things to come.” (Hebrews 10:1)

**Answer:**
The ceremonial law (the system of sacrifices, festivals, and priesthood) contained "shadows" or types of the plan of salvation.

1.  **Shadow vs. Substance:** A shadow is cast by a solid object. The ceremonial system was the shadow cast backward by the cross and the ministry of Christ.
2.  **Educational Tool:** God gave these ceremonies to teach the Israelites the terrible cost of sin and the holiness of God. Every bleeding sacrifice cried out, "Without shedding of blood is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22).

**Definition:**
*   **Type:** An Old Testament symbol, person, or event that foreshadows a spiritual reality in the New Testament (e.g., the Passover Lamb).
*   **Antitype:** The fulfillment or reality of the type (e.g., Christ our Passover).

---

### Q10. What were these "good things to come" which this law foreshadowed?
“But Christ being come a High Priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle.” (Hebrews 9:11)

**Answer:**
The "good things" are the realities of Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.

1.  **The True Tabernacle:** The earthly sanctuary was a model of the "greater and more perfect tabernacle" in heaven, which the Lord pitched, and not man (Hebrews 8:2).
2.  **The True Priest:** The earthly priests were shadows of Christ, our great High Priest. They died and had to be replaced; He lives forever to make intercession for us (Hebrews 7:25).
3.  **The Better Sacrifice:** The blood of bulls and goats could not actually take away sin (Hebrews 10:4). They only pointed to the blood of Christ, which cleanses the conscience (Hebrews 9:14).

---

### Q11. Did those of the patriarchal age have a knowledge of sin?
“Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.” (Genesis 20:9; see also Genesis 4:7; 13:13)

**Answer:**
Yes, long before the Ten Commandments were spoken on Mount Sinai, men knew what sin was.

1.  **Sin in Genesis:** Abimelech knew adultery was a "great sin." Cain knew murder was wrong (Genesis 4:7). The men of Sodom were "sinners before the Lord exceedingly" (Genesis 13:13).
2.  **The Implication:** Since "sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4), the moral law of God must have been known to men from the beginning. It was written in their consciences and handed down from Adam, though later codified in stone at Sinai because memory had been dimmed by transgression.

---

### Q12. By what means must they have gained that knowledge?
“By the law is the knowledge of sin.” (Romans 3:20); “I had not known sin, but by the law.” (Romans 7:7)

**Answer:**
They gained the knowledge of sin through the moral law.

1.  **The Detector:** Just as a crooked line cannot be known to be crooked without a straight ruler to measure it against, moral crookedness (sin) cannot be identified without the straight edge of God's law.
2.  **Conviction:** Paul states he would not have known lust was sin except the law said, "Thou shalt not covet." The law goes deep, exposing not just actions but the motives of the heart.

**[ILL] The Mirror:** If your face is dirty, you might not know it until you look in a mirror. The mirror reveals the dirt, but it cannot wash it off. The law is the mirror—it reveals our sin. The gospel is the water and soap—it cleanses us from the sin the law revealed. We do not break the mirror because it shows us we are dirty; we thank it for the revelation and seek the Cleanser.

### Q13. Was there a priesthood in the days of Abraham, to minister for the sins of the people?
“For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him.” (Hebrews 7:1)

**Answer:**
Yes, there was a priesthood. Melchizedek is specifically named as a "priest of the most high God."

1.  **Mediators:** God has always provided a way for the sinner to approach Him through mediation, teaching the lesson that sinful man cannot approach a holy God in his own merit.
2.  **Melchizedek and Christ:** The book of Hebrews uses Melchizedek as a type of Christ. Unlike the Levitical priests, Melchizedek was both a King and a Priest, just as Jesus is the King of Kings and our Great High Priest (Zechariah 6:13).

---

### Q14. And was the gospel preached to Abraham?
“And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham.” (Galatians 3:8)

**Answer:**
Yes, the gospel was preached to Abraham. The "good news" is not a New Testament invention; it is the eternal plan of God.

1.  **Abraham's Gospel:** Abraham was told, "In thee shall all nations be blessed." He understood this to refer to the coming Seed, the Messiah (Galatians 3:16).
2.  **Justification by Faith:** Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness (Genesis 15:6). This is the exact same gospel Paul preached—righteousness not by works, but by faith in God's promise.
3.  **One Covenant of Grace:** The method of saving men has always been the "everlasting covenant"—grace accepted by faith, leading to obedience.

---

### Q15. But when Christ came, did He expect to put away the law of God in order to save men?
“Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17)

**Answer:**
No, Christ emphatically stated that He did not come to destroy the law.

1.  **Fulfill means "Fill Full":** To "fulfill" does not mean to abolish. When a builder fulfills a blueprint, he does not tear it up; he makes the building that the blueprint described. Christ "magnified the law and made it honorable" (Isaiah 42:21) by living it out perfectly.
2.  **The Purpose of the Law:** The law was ordained to life (Romans 7:10). It is the transcript of God's character.
3.  **Why It Cannot Be Destroyed:** If the law could have been changed or abolished, Christ need not have died. It was because the law is immutable (unchangeable) that the penalty for its transgression had to be paid by the Son of God. He died to pay the debt, not to remove the standard.

**[ILL] The Lifeboat:** If a man falls off a ship because he ignored the railing (the law), the captain throws him a life preserver (the gospel). When the man is pulled back on deck, the captain does not say, "Now that you are saved, we will tear down the railing." No, the man appreciates the railing more than ever!

### Q16. How much of the law did Christ say should remain in force?
“For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:18)

**Answer:**
Christ declared that not even the smallest letter ("jot") or the smallest stroke of a pen ("tittle") would pass from the law as long as heaven and earth stand.

1.  **Perpetuity:** Since heaven and earth are still here, the law is still here.
2.  **Complete Authority:** Men often try to edit God's law—removing the second commandment (idols) or changing the fourth (Sabbath)—but Jesus affirms the integrity of the entire code. It stands as a united whole (James 2:10).

---

### Q17. Then if we have faith in Christ and the gospel, how does that affect the law?
“Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” (Romans 3:31)

**Answer:**
Far from abolishing the law, faith establishes it.

1.  **Making Void:** To make void is to render useless or empty. If faith led to disobedience, it would make the law void.
2.  **Establishing the Law:**
    *   **In the Conscience:** Faith acknowledges the law's verdict (that we are sinners needing a Savior).
    *   **In the Life:** True faith works by love (Galatians 5:6). When the Holy Spirit enters the heart through faith, He writes the law upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10). The believer now keeps the law, not *to be* saved, but because he *is* saved and loves the Lawgiver.
    *   **Sanctification:** This is the process where the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit (Romans 8:4).

**Definition:**
*   **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the believer is made holy, growing in likeness to Christ and obedience to His will (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

---

### Q18. How many lawgivers are there?
“There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.” (James 4:12)

**Answer:**
There is only one true Lawgiver: God Himself.

1.  **Sovereignty:** No human government or ecclesiastical council has the authority to alter the moral law of Jehovah. To tamper with God's law is to usurp the throne of God (Daniel 7:25; 2 Thessalonians 2:3–4).
2.  **Power to Save and Destroy:** Only the One who created us and gave the law has the authority to judge us by it. He alone determines the penalty and the remedy.

---

### Q19. What part does Christ act in behalf of the sinner?
“If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” (1 John 2:1)

**Answer:**
Christ acts as our **Advocate** (intercessor/lawyer) in the heavenly court.

1.  **The Problem:** "If any man sin." Even as believers, we may stumble. We have an Accuser (Satan) who points out our faults (Revelation 12:10).
2.  **The Solution:** We have an Advocate who stands before the Father. He does not plead our innocence; He pleads His own righteousness. He presents His wounded hands and claims pardon for the repentant sinner.
3.  **"Jesus Christ the Righteous":** His argument is His own perfect life. He imputes (credits) His righteousness to our account so we can stand accepted.

**[ILL] The Defense Attorney:** Imagine standing in a courtroom, guilty of a capital crime. You have no defense. But then the Judge's Son steps down and says, "I have paid the fine for this man. I have served his prison time. Let him go free." That is what Jesus does for us in the heavenly sanctuary.

### Q20. In the closing message to the world, how are the law and the gospel associated?
“Here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

**Answer:**
In the final days, God's faithful people—the "remnant"—are identified by a perfect blend of Law and Gospel.

1.  **Commandments of God:** They do not despise the law. In a world of lawlessness, they uphold God's moral standard, including the fourth commandment Sabbath, as a sign of loyalty to the Creator.
2.  **The Faith of Jesus:** Note it does not just say faith *in* Jesus, but the *faith of* Jesus.
    *   This is the same quality of trust and dependence that Jesus exercised when He was on earth.
    *   It is the active, living faith that claims victory over every sin.
3.  **The Harmony:** The Law reveals the standard of holiness; the Faith of Jesus provides the power to reach it. They are not enemies; they are partners in the restoration of the image of God in man. The result is a people who are safe to save—fully forgiven and fully transformed.
