## Slide 1 – Q1: The Creator of All

- **Question:** Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:1 – “In the beginning God created the heaven and the
  earth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (God’s Sovereignty)

- **Foundational Truth:**
  - The Bible opens with the fact that God is the source of all life and matter.
  - This refutes atheism (no God), polytheism (many gods), and pantheism (God is
    the universe).
- **Ownership and Authority:**
  - Because God is the Creator, He is the Owner and Ruler of all things.
- **The Three Angels’ Message:**
  - The final call to the world is grounded in God’s identity as Creator.
  - Revelation 14:7 – “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to
    him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven,
    and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Master Artist:**
  - Imagine a painting created by a master artist.
  - The painting does not own itself; it belongs entirely to the one who created
    it.
- **Our Status:**
  - We are not our own; we are God’s property by creation and by redemption.
  - 1 Corinthians 6:20 – “For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God
    in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.”

## Slide 4 – Q2: Means of Creation

- **Question:** What were the means that God used to bring the heavens and the
  earth into existence?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 33:6, 9 – “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made;
  and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth... For he spake, and it
  was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Fiat Creation)

- **Creation by Command:**
  - God did not use tools or long evolutionary ages.
  - He used His Word (Fiat Creation).
- **Creation and Redemption Parallels:**
  - The same power that spoke light into existence speaks spiritual life into
    the sinner.
  - **In Creation:** God speaks, and matter obeys instantly.
  - **In Redemption:** God speaks the Gospel, and faith receives it to create
    righteousness.
  - Romans 10:17 – “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
    God.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (The Power of the Word)

- **Transforming Power:**
  - We cannot create a clean heart in ourselves.
  - We receive the Word of God, which contains the energy to transform us.
- **Born Again by the Word:**
  - 1 Peter 1:23 – “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
    incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Agent of Creation

- **Question:** Through whom did God create all things?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 1:16 – “For by him were all things created, that are
  in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
  thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created
  by him, and for him.”
- **Key Text:** John 1:3 – “All things were made by him; and without him was not
  any thing made that was made.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Christ the Creator)

- **Jesus is the Creator:**
  - The active Agent in creation was Jesus Christ.
  - This proves His divinity; He is not a created being.
- **Connection to Salvation:**
  - The One who made us is the same One who died to save us.
  - Because He created the human "machinery" (body, mind, spirit), He alone
    knows how to fix it.
  - Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
    come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Watchmaker:**
  - If a complex watch breaks, you do not take it to a carpenter.
  - You take it to the watchmaker because he understands the mechanism.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - Since Christ made us, He is the only one qualified to repair the brokenness
    caused by sin.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Purpose of Creation

- **Question:** What was God's purpose in creating the earth?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 45:18 – “For thus saith the LORD that created the
  heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established
  it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD;
  and there is none else.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (God’s Plan)

- **God is Love:**
  - God desired to share life and joy with holy, happy beings.
  - 1 John 4:8 – “He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Sin has temporarily marred this purpose, but God has not abandoned His plan.
  - Through the plan of salvation, the earth will be restored to be the home of
    the redeemed.
  - Matthew 5:5 – “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Creation of Man

- **Question:** How does the Bible describe the creation of man?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 2:7 – “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
    breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
    soul.”
  - Genesis 2:21-22 – “And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam...
    and the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman...”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (The Nature of Man)

- **The Biblical Equation:**
  - **Dust + Breath of Life = Living Soul.**
- **Understanding the Soul:**
  - The "soul" is not a ghost inside the body; it is the whole person.
  - Just as wood + nails = a box, body + breath = a soul.
  - If you remove the nails, the box ceases to exist.
- **Death:**
  - When the breath returns to God, the soul ceases to exist until the
    resurrection.
  - Psalm 146:4 – “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
    very day his thoughts perish.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Image of God

- **Question:** In whose image was man created?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:27 – “So God created man in his own image, in the
  image of God created he him; male and female created he them.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Restoration)

- **The Image:**
  - **Physical:** Reflecting the outward glory of the Maker.
  - **Spiritual:** Ability to reason, choose, love, and have moral character.
- **Sanctification:**
  - Sin marred this image.
  - Sanctification is the process of restoring the moral image of God in the
    soul.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my
    laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Muddy Mirror:**
  - A mirror covered in mud cannot reflect the face of the viewer.
  - Sin is the mud.
- **Cleansing:**
  - As we submit to the blood of Christ (Justification) and the washing of the
    Word, the mud is removed.
  - We begin to reflect Jesus clearly to the world.
  - 2 Corinthians 3:18 – “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
    glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even
    as by the Spirit of the Lord.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Dominion Given

- **Question:** What authority did God originally give to him?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:26 – “And God said... let them have dominion over the
  fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
  all the earth...”
- **Key Text:** Psalm 8:6 – “Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of
  thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Dominion Lost & Restored)

- **Vice-gerent:**
  - Adam was appointed representative ruler (steward) of the earth.
- **The Loss:**
  - By obeying Satan, Adam surrendered his dominion.
  - Satan became the "god of this world" (2 Corinthians 4:4).
- **The Restoration:**
  - Jesus, the Second Adam, came to win back what was lost.
  - The dominion will be returned to the redeemed (Micah 4:8).

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Ideal Home

- **Question:** God gave man an ideal home. What was it?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 2:8 – “And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
    he put the man whom he had formed.”
  - Genesis 2:15 – “And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden
    of Eden to dress it and to keep it.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (God’s Environment)

- **Nature:**
  - God placed man in a garden, not a city.
  - Nature is God’s ideal schoolroom for humanity.
- **Occupation:**
  - Work is not a curse; it was given before sin.
  - Useful labor promotes health of body and mind.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Food and Immortality

- **Question:** What was the food that God gave to perpetuate immortality?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:9 – “And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow
  every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life
  also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Life & Health)

- **The Tree of Life:**
  - Man is not innately immortal; he has "conditional immortality."
  - We live only as long as we have access to the source of life.
- **Original Diet:**
  - God's design was fruits, grains, and nuts (Genesis 1:29).
  - This points to principles of **Health Reform**—caring for the body temple.
  - 1 Corinthians 6:19 – “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the
    Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?”

## Slide 23 – Q10: The Test of Loyalty

- **Question:** What simple plan was used by God to test the loyalty and
  obedience of Adam and Eve?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:16-17 – “And the LORD God commanded the man, saying,
  Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the
  knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
  eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (Law and Liberty)

- **The Nature of the Test:**
  - The tree was not poisonous; the issue was **obedience**.
  - God desires willing obedience based on trust.
- **The Consequence:**
  - "Thou shalt surely die."
  - Sin cuts us off from the Source of Life.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- **The Law:**
  - God's law is a wall of protection, not a restriction of true liberty.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Sustaining Power

- **Question:** What is the power that upholds all the universe?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 1:3 – “Who being the brightness of his glory, and the
  express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his
  power...”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points & Application

- **Continuous Power:**
  - Creation was not a one-time event where God walked away.
  - He sustains the universe moment by moment.
- **Spiritual Application:**
  - The same God who upholds the stars upholds the believer.
  - We depend on a constant flow of power from Christ to live victoriously.
  - Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
    present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Light Bulb:**
  - A light bulb needs a constant flow of electricity to stay lit.
  - If the current stops, the light goes out.
  - Similarly, we need a constant connection to Christ to maintain spiritual
    life.

## Slide 28 – Q12: The Witness of the Heavens

- **Question:** As we gaze upon the heavens, what do they declare unto us?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 19:1-2 – “The heavens declare the glory of God; and the
  firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto
  night sheweth knowledge.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (God’s Second Book)

- **Visual Revelation:**
  - The Bible is God's written revelation.
  - Nature is His visual revelation ("second book").
- **The Message:**
  - Despite the marks of sin (decay, storms), nature still speaks of God’s
    infinite power, wisdom, and love.

## Slide 30 – Q13: Visible Reveals Invisible

- **Question:** What is it that the visible Creation reveals to us?
- **Key Text:** Romans 1:20 – “For the invisible things of him from the creation
  of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,
  even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points (Evidence of God)

- **Without Excuse:**
  - The evidence for a Designer is overwhelming.
- **Attributes Revealed:**
  - **Eternal Power:** Seen in the energy of the universe.
  - **Godhead:** Seen in intelligent design and complexity of life.
- **Responsibility:**
  - This knowledge calls every human being to seek and glorify the Creator.

## Slide 32 – Q14: His Workmanship

- **Question:** An obedient Christian is whose workmanship?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:10 – “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ
  Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in
  them.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points (Spiritual Creation)

- **The New Creation:**
  - Conversion is a supernatural act of creation.
  - 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
    creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”
- **The Purpose of Grace:**
  - We are not saved _by_ good works, but created _for_ good works.
  - God imparts righteousness and prepares the path of obedience for us to walk
    in.
  - We are the clay; He is the Potter.

## Slide 34 – Q15: The Future Promise

- **Question:** Looking beyond the present sin-cursed earth, to what promise may
  we fix our gaze?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 65:17 – “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new
  earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.”

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points (Paradise Restored)

- **Full Circle:**
  - The Bible ends where it began: with a perfect Creation.
  - Paradise lost will be Paradise restored.
- **The Hope:**
  - No more sin, sickness, or death (Revelation 21:4).
  - We look for a city “whose builder and maker is God” (Hebrews 11:10).

## Slide 36 – Q16: True God vs. False Gods

- **Question:** There is an important difference between the true God and all
  false gods. What is it?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 10:11 – “Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that
  have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the
  earth, and from under these heavens.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points (The Seal of Creation)

- **The Distinction:**
  - The true God can **create**; false gods cannot.
- **The Memorial:**
  - God gave the Sabbath to distinguish Himself as the Creator.
  - Exodus 20:11 – “For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
    all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed
    the sabbath day, and hallowed it.”
  - Keeping the Sabbath acknowledges the true God who made us.

## Slide 38 – Q17: True Worship

- **Question:** To whom alone are we to give our worship?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 95:6 – “O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel
  before the LORD our maker.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points (Worship & The End Time)

- **Exclusive Right:**
  - Worship belongs only to the Maker.
  - Worshiping created beings or objects is idolatry.
- **The Final Conflict:**
  - The Beast demands worship (Revelation 13:15).
  - God calls us to worship Him as **Creator** (Revelation 14:7).
  - True worship is the surrender of the will to the One who made us.

## Slide 40 – Q18: The Brotherhood of Man

- **Question:** What is the great truth that makes all men on earth brothers?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 2:10 – “Have we not all one father? hath not one God
  created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by
  profaning the covenant of our fathers?”

## Slide 41 – Q18: Key Points (Equality)

- **Common Origin:**
  - We are all descendants of the same first parents.
  - We are all handcrafted by the same God.
  - Acts 17:26 – “And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
    all the face of the earth...”
- **Dignity:**
  - Racism and hatred deny the Creation account.
  - To mistreat a human being is to insult their Maker (Proverbs 14:31).
