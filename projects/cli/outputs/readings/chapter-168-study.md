### Q1. What duty does God require of children?

**"Honor thy father and thy mother." Exodus 20:12.**

**Answer:**
This command, the fifth of the Ten Commandments, stands as the bridge between our duty to God (the first four commandments) and our duty to our fellow man (the last six). It lays the foundation for all human authority and social order.

*   **The Nature of Honor:** To "honor" (*kabad* in Hebrew) means to give weight to, to value highly, and to respect. It involves more than mere outward obedience; it requires an attitude of reverence and love.
*   **A Type of Divine Authority:** The earthly parent is the first representation of God to the child. By learning to respect and obey their earthly parents, children learn to respect the authority of their Heavenly Father.
*   **The First Commandment with Promise:** The Apostle Paul notes that this is the "first commandment with promise"—that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth (Ephesians 6:2–3).
*   **Righteousness by Faith Application:** A child cannot manufacture a submissive heart on their own. The "carnal mind is enmity against God" (Romans 8:7). However, when the heart is touched by the love of Jesus, the spirit of rebellion is broken. The child who learns to love Jesus will find it a delight to honor their parents, for Christ Himself honored His earthly parents (Luke 2:51).

**[ILL]** Think of a great building. The foundation stones are often hidden from view, yet they support the entire structure. Honoring parents is the hidden foundation of character. If a child learns to honor authority at home, they become a stable citizen and a faithful Christian. If this foundation is cracked, the whole life is often unstable.

### Q2. How are parents instructed to teach their children?

**"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." Deuteronomy 6:6, 7.**

**Answer:**
This passage, known as the *Shema*, outlines the method of true Christian education. It is not merely formal instruction once a week, but a continual, living atmosphere of godliness.

*   **First, In the Parent’s Heart:** Notice the order: "These words... shall be in *thine* heart" first. A parent cannot impart what they do not possess.
    *   *Sanctification:* This refers to the law written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10). The parent must experience the converting power of the Holy Spirit before they can effectively lead their children to Christ.
*   **Diligent Teaching:** The Hebrew word for "teach diligently" suggests sharpening, like whetting a tool. It implies repetition, effort, and intentionality.
*   **A Lifestyle of Faith:** Godliness is to be woven into the fabric of daily life—sitting, walking, resting, and rising. Religion is not a garment to be worn only on the Sabbath; it is the lifeblood of the home.
*   **The Home Sanctuary:** The father and mother act as priests in the home sanctuary, daily presenting the character of God to their children through Bible study, prayer, and conversation.

**[ILL]** If you wish to fill a cup with water, the pitcher must first contain water. A dry pitcher cannot fill a cup. Likewise, a parent whose heart is empty of the grace of Christ cannot fill the heart of the child with the love of God. The parent must first go to the Fountain of Life (John 4:14).

### Q3. How does God regard those parents who enforce obedience?

**"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him." Genesis 18:19.**

**Answer:**
God chose Abraham to be the father of the faithful because He could trust Abraham to lead his family in righteousness.

*   **Commanding vs. Suggesting:** Abraham did not merely advise his children; he "commanded" them. This was not the command of a tyrant, but the firm, loving direction of a captain steering a ship away from rocks.
*   **The Purpose of Authority:** The goal was not blind submission, but that "they shall keep the way of the Lord." Parental authority is a stewardship given by God to guide the family into the Covenant.
    *   *Covenant:* God’s binding agreement to save and restore humanity through faith in the coming Messiah.
*   **Justice and Judgment:** These are attributes of God's throne (Psalm 89:14). A righteous home is established on the same principles that govern the universe.
*   **The Result:** Because Abraham was faithful in his home duties, God could entrust him with the destiny of a nation. Neglect of home duties disqualifies a man for public ministry (1 Timothy 3:4–5).

**[ILL]** A shepherd does not merely suggest to the sheep which way to go; he uses his rod and staff to guide and protect them. If he sees a sheep heading toward a cliff, he intervenes decisively. A parent who loves their child will not let them wander into the paths of sin without decisive, loving intervention.

### Q4. How should parents train their children?

**"Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it." Proverbs 22:6 (Ephesians 6:4).**

**Answer:**
The word "train" implies more than "tell." It suggests the molding of character, the formation of habits, and the directing of the will.

*   **In the Way He Should Go:** Not in the way he *would* go (following natural inclinations), but the way he *should* go (God's way).
*   **Early Influence:** The twig is easily bent, but the full-grown tree is rigid. The earliest years are the most critical for spiritual formation.
*   **Nurture and Admonition:** Ephesians 6:4 warns against provoking children but commands bringing them up in the "nurture and admonition of the Lord."
    *   *Nurture:* Providing the spiritual food and atmosphere for growth.
    *   *Admonition:* Gentle but firm correction and instruction.
*   **The Promise:** While children have free will, the faithful training of parents plants seeds that the Holy Spirit uses throughout life. Even if a child wanders, the early training acts as a tether to the conscience, often pulling them back in later years.

**[ILL]** Consider a gardener training a vine. He does not let it crawl on the ground in the mud; he ties it to a trellis, pruning away wild shoots so that it may bear fruit. If he neglects it, the vine becomes a tangled mass. Training a child requires the same patient, daily attention to lift their thoughts and habits toward heaven.

### Q5. What encouragement have parents to correct their children?

**"Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul." Proverbs 29:17. (Proverbs 22:15).**

**Answer:**
Discipline is an investment that yields the dividend of peace.

*   **The Fruit of Discipline:** A disciplined child learns self-control, respect, and obedience. This brings "rest" to the home, eliminating the chaos and strife caused by unruly behavior.
*   **Delight to the Soul:** There is no greater joy for a parent than to see their children walking in the truth (3 John 1:4). A character formed by godly discipline is a thing of beauty.
*   **Foolishness Bound in the Heart:** Proverbs 22:15 teaches that "foolishness" (moral perversity/sinful tendencies) is bound in the heart of a child.
    *   *The Nature of Man:* We are not born neutral; we are born with a bent toward self and sin (Psalm 51:5). Godly correction is the means of driving out this foolishness and pointing the child to the wisdom of Christ.

**[ILL]** A wild horse is dangerous and useless for service. But once "broken" or trained, its strength is harnessed, and it becomes a valuable companion. A child’s will must be subdued (not broken in spirit, but conquered) so that they can be of service to God and man.

### Q6. What will result if correction is withheld?

**"The rod and reproof give wisdom; but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame." Proverbs 29:15.**

**Answer:**
Neglect is as damaging as abuse. To leave a child "to himself" is to leave him to the mercy of his fallen nature and the temptations of Satan.

*   **The Myth of Natural Goodness:** Modern philosophies often teach that children are naturally good and only need freedom to express themselves. The Bible teaches that a child "left to himself" naturally gravitates toward selfishness and sin.
*   **Shame:** The result of permissiveness is public and private shame. Consider Eli the high priest, who "restrained not" his sons, leading to the ruin of his house and national tragedy (1 Samuel 3:13).
*   **The Combination:** Note that "the rod" (consequences) and "reproof" (instruction/explanation) go together. Punishment without instruction is tyranny; instruction without consequences is often ineffective.

**[ILL]** If a farmer leaves a field "to itself," what grows? Corn? Wheat? No—weeds and thorns grow naturally. A harvest of righteousness requires intentional weeding (correction) and planting (instruction).

### Q7. By proper correction what profit will come to the child?

**"Withhold not correction from the child; for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell." Proverbs 23:13, 14.**

**Answer:**
The ultimate goal of discipline is salvation.

*   **Deliverance from Hell (Sheol):** The word used here is *Sheol*, meaning the grave or the realm of death. Unchecked sin leads to premature physical death (through reckless living) and ultimately eternal death.
*   **Correction as Rescue:** Parents should view discipline not as venting anger, but as a rescue mission. They are interfering with the "law of sin and death" working in their child’s members.
*   **Justification and Sanctification:**
    *   We are justified by faith alone, but a heart that refuses correction cannot walk by faith.
    *   Discipline prepares the soil of the heart to receive the Gospel. It teaches the child that sin has consequences, pointing them to the need for a Savior who took those consequences for us.

**[ILL]** Imagine a child playing with a venomous snake. A loving parent would strike the snake away and pull the child back, even if the child cries because they wanted to play with it. The parent sees the deadly poison; the child only sees a toy. Discipline saves the child from the poison of sin.

### Q8. Is there danger of delaying correction too long?

**"Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying." Proverbs 19:18.**

**Answer:**
There is a probationary time in the life of a child—a window of opportunity that eventually closes.

*   **While There is Hope:** The character is pliable in youth. As years pass, habits harden into character, and character determines destiny. "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil" (Jeremiah 13:23).
*   **Emotional Manipulation:** "Let not thy soul spare for his crying." Parents often recoil from discipline because it pains them to see their child cry. However, avoiding the temporary pain of discipline leads to the eternal pain of a ruined life.
*   **Divine Parallel:** God gives humanity a time of probation. He calls, corrects, and pleads "while it is called Today" (Hebrews 3:13). We must work while the clay is wet.

**[ILL]** Wet concrete can be molded into any shape with ease. Once it sets, however, it becomes rock-hard. To change it then requires a jackhammer and great destruction. It is far better to mold the will while the child is young and tender.

---

### Q9. Because a parent corrects his child, is it evidence that he does not love him?

**"He that spareth his rod hateth his son, but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes." Proverbs 13:24.**

**Answer:**
The world defines love as "tolerance" or "indulgence." The Bible defines love as seeking the highest good of the other.

*   **Hate vs. Love:** The text uses strong language. To withhold necessary correction is effectively to "hate" the child, because you are permitting the thing that will destroy them to grow unchecked.
*   **Chastening "Betimes":** "Betimes" means "early" or "diligently." True love is proactive. It deals with the little foxes before they spoil the vine.
*   **God's Example:** "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth" (Hebrews 12:6). God does not discipline us because He is angry *at* us, but because He is fighting *for* us. When parents discipline in love, they reflect the character of God.

**[ILL]** A surgeon cuts the patient with a sharp knife. Is this an act of hate? No, it is an act of love to remove a cancer that would otherwise kill. The parent’s correction is the surgery that removes the cancer of rebellion.

### Q10. In correcting the child, what should the father guard against?

**"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged." Colossians 3:21.**

**Answer:**
This is the vital balance to the previous verses. Authority must never be exercised with harshness, tyranny, or inconsistency.

*   **Provoking to Anger:** Parents provoke children when they are:
    1.  Inconsistent (punishing an act today that was ignored yesterday).
    2.  Unreasonable in demands.
    3.  Disciplining in anger or loss of temper.
    4.  Never pleased, always critical.
*   **Discouragement:** A child who feels they can never please their parent will give up. They become "discouraged" or broken in spirit.
*   **The Christian Standard:** We must treat our children as younger brothers and sisters in the Lord. We are to "forbear threatening" (Ephesians 6:9).
*   **Self-Control:** A parent who cannot control their own temper has no right to punish a child for lack of self-control. Victory over sin must first be experienced by the parent (Righteousness by Faith).

**[ILL]** Iron can be shaped by a blacksmith when it is heated and struck with precision. But if you strike cold iron with violence, it breaks. A parent acting in anger is like striking cold iron—it damages the child rather than shaping them.

### Q11. What consideration should the young ever show to the aged?

**"Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God; I am the Lord." Leviticus 19:32.**

**Answer:**
Respect for authority extends beyond the home to the community, specifically toward the elderly.

*   **The Hoary Head:** This refers to gray hair, the crown of age and experience.
*   **Connection to Godliness:** The verse links respect for the elderly directly with the command to "fear thy God." One cannot claim to fear God while disrespecting those who bear the dignity of age.
*   **A Counter-Cultural Command:** In a world that idolizes youth and dismisses the old as obsolete, God's people are to stand out by their reverence for the wisdom and history represented by the aged.

**[ILL]** In a forest, the saplings grow in the shadow of the ancient oaks. The old trees provide shelter and stability to the ecosystem. To cut down or despise the old trees exposes the young ones to storms they are not ready to weather.

---

### Q12. Is the Lord pleased with children who obey their parents?

**"Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well pleasing unto the Lord." Colossians 3:20.**

**Answer:**
Obedience is not just a social duty; it is an act of worship.

*   **"In All Things":** This implies comprehensive obedience in the rightful sphere of parental authority. (Exceptions only exist if a parent commands a violation of God's law—Acts 5:29).
*   **Pleasing to the Lord:** When a child obeys their mother or father, Jesus accepts that obedience as if it were given to Him.
*   **The Example of Christ:** Jesus, the Creator of the universe, went down to Nazareth and "was subject unto them" (Luke 2:51). If the King of Glory could obey earthly parents, surely every child can do likewise.

**[ILL]** Think of a beautiful melody. When a child obeys, their life strikes a chord that is in harmony with heaven. Disobedience is like a discordant, jarring noise that disrupts the melody of the home.

---

### Q13. How long does the command to honor parents bind sons and daughters?

**"Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old." Proverbs 23:22.**

**Answer:**
The duty to honor parents does not expire when a child reaches adulthood.

*   **Care for the Aged:** When parents are old and feeble, the roles often reverse. The children who were once cared for must now become the caregivers. To "despise" them in their weakness is a grievous sin.
*   **Requiting Parents:** 1 Timothy 5:4 says that children should "learn first to show piety at home, and to requite [repay] their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
*   **A Test of Religion:** Pure religion is to visit and care for the widows and the fatherless (James 1:27). How much more one's own parents? A Christian who neglects their aging parents has "denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel" (1 Timothy 5:8).

**[ILL]** Consider a bank loan. Parents invest years of love, labor, sleepless nights, and resources into their children. In their old age, the "bill" comes due. It is a debt of love that a grateful child will spend their life repaying.

### Q14. What is to be one of the prominent sins of the last days?

**"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy." 2 Timothy 3:2.**

**Answer:**
The breakdown of parental authority is listed among the primary signs of the "perilous times" of the last days.

*   **The Root Cause:** The list begins with "lovers of their own selves." Selfishness is the root of all disobedience.
*   **The Attack on the Family:** Satan knows that the family is the nursery of the church and the foundation of society. If he can destroy the authority of the home (disobedience to parents), he destroys the capacity of people to respect the authority of God (disobedience to His Law).
*   **Preparation for the End:** Those who are preparing for the coming of Jesus and the seal of God must stand in contrast to this list. The "Elijah message" which prepares the way for the Lord is to "turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers" (Malachi 4:6).
*   **Sanctuary Context:** As Christ finishes His work in the Most Holy Place, He is purifying a people who will reflect His image. This reflection begins in the home. A restored family is the greatest witness to the world of the power of the Gospel.

**[ILL]** If you see termites eating the foundation beams of a house, you know the house will soon collapse. Disobedience to parents is the termite in the foundation of society. Its prevalence today tells us the structure of this world is crumbling and Christ's return is near.
