## Slide 1 – Q1: The Spirit of Prayer

- **Question:** What spirit should accompany prayer?
- **Key Text:** Mark 11:25 – “And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; that your Father also which is in heaven, may forgive you your trespasses.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Open Channel:**
  - Prayer is opening the heart to God as to a friend.
  - For this channel to remain open, our spirit must harmonize with Heaven’s spirit: love and mercy.
- **The Condition of Acceptance:**
  - We cannot hold God’s hand for blessing while holding a brother’s throat for vengeance.
  - Bitterness spiritually clogs the heart; there is no room for grace to flow in (James 3:11–12 – “Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.”).
- **Hindered Prayers:**
  - Unforgiveness is a cherished iniquity that blocks access to the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Psalm 66:18 – “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Clogged Vessel:**
  - Imagine a vessel with a narrow neck representing the human heart.
  - If the vessel is already filled with sour, stagnant water (bitterness), you cannot pour in fresh, pure water (God’s grace).
  - **Lesson:** The vessel must be emptied of the old grievances before God can pour in His pardon.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Pardon and the Unforgiving

- **Question:** Will God pardon the unforgiving?
- **Key Text:** Mark 11:26 – “But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Law and Gospel)

- **Solemn Declaration:**
  - This truth cuts to the root of the Great Controversy in the heart.
  - God’s forgiveness is not arbitrary; it is a transformation of the soul.
- **Justification Defined:**
  - A legal act where God declares a sinner righteous based solely on Christ’s merits (Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”).
- **The Fruit of Salvation:**
  - We are not saved *by* forgiving others (works).
  - Our willingness to forgive is the *evidence* that we are saved (fruit).
  - If Christ’s Spirit dwells in us, He produces His own merciful character (Galatians 5:22).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Closed Door:**
  - A man locks his door to keep his enemy out.
  - However, the Physician stands outside that same door with life-saving medicine.
  - **Lesson:** As long as the door is bolted against the brother, it is also bolted against the Physician. You cannot open the door for one while keeping it shut for the other.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Asking for Pardon

- **Question:** How should we ask for pardon?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 6:12 – “And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **A Dangerous Prayer:**
  - To pray this while holding a grudge is to pray a curse upon oneself.
  - It essentially asks: "Lord, deal with me exactly as I deal with my neighbor."
  - If we are harsh and exacting, we are asking God to be harsh and exacting with us.
- **Justification and Sanctification:**
  - **Justification:** God cancels the massive debt we owe Him.
  - **Sanctification:** Constrained by love, we cancel the small debts others owe us.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The believer lives entirely by God’s charity.
  - Acknowledging our own lack of righteousness leads us to extend charity to others.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Mirror:**
  - The Lord's Prayer acts as a mirror.
  - Before asking God to wash our face (pardon), we must look in the mirror to see if our hands are clean of our brother's blood (grudges).
  - **Lesson:** We cannot ask for a clean record in heaven while keeping a dirty record of wrongs on earth.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Extent of Forgiveness

- **Question:** How many times should we forgive?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:21, 22 – “Then came Peter to Him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **Beyond Tradition:**
  - Rabbinical tradition suggested three times; Peter suggested seven.
  - Christ reveals the infinite nature of divine love.
- **Unlimited Mercy:**
  - "Seventy times seven" (490) symbolizes completeness, not a mathematical limit.
  - Forgiveness is not an act to be counted, but an attitude to be maintained.
- **Prophetic Parallel:**
  - Matches the "seventy weeks" of probation for the Jewish nation (Daniel 9:24).
  - Shows God is long-suffering, not willing that any should perish (2 Peter 3:9).
- **The Standard of Love:**
  - Love "keeps no record of wrongs" (1 Corinthians 13:5, NKJV).
  - Counting offenses proves we have not truly forgiven the previous ones.

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Parable of Forgiveness

- **Question:** In what parable are we taught forgiveness?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:23 – “Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points – The Two Debts

- **The Great Debt (Sin against God):**
  - The first servant owed 10,000 talents (an unpayable sum).
  - Represents our bankruptcy before God’s Law (Romans 3:23).
  - **Grace:** The King forgives the entire debt freely (Justification by Faith).
- **The Small Debt (Sin against Man):**
  - The servant finds a fellow servant owing 100 pence (a tiny fraction).
  - **Reaction:** He uses violence and demands justice ("Pay me that thou owest").
  - He demands justice for his neighbor while enjoying mercy from God.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points – The Consequence

- **Revoked Forgiveness:**
  - The King revokes the pardon because the servant showed no mercy.
- **The Warning:**
  - Justification can be lost if it does not lead to Sanctification.
  - Receiving grace without letting it soften the heart means receiving the grace of God in vain (2 Corinthians 6:1 – “We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.”).

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **Two Microscopes:**
  - The unmerciful servant looked at his own debt through the wrong end of the telescope (making it look small).
  - He looked at his brother's debt through a magnifying glass (making it look huge).
  - **Lesson:** The Gospel reverses this. We must see ourselves as the "chief of sinners" (1 Timothy 1:15) and view our brother's sins with charity.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Motive for Mercy

- **Question:** In dealing with the erring, what feeling should actuate us?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:33 – “Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee?”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **Compassion Defined:**
  - Literally "to suffer with."
  - Sympathy arising from a knowledge of our own weakness (Hebrews 4:15).
- **Gospel Logic:**
  - The King argues from greater to lesser: "I forgave you a mountain; can you not forgive a molehill?"
- **The Power of the Cross:**
  - We are saved by looking to Christ paying our debt.
  - This melts the heart; from a melted heart, compassion flows to others.
  - We forgive because we love Him (1 John 4:19 – “We love him, because he first loved us.”).

## Slide 18 – Q7: Sincerity in Forgiveness

- **Question:** In forgiving, should we be satisfied with mere formalities?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:35 – “So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points

- **Heart Work:**
  - God looks on the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).
  - A verbal "I forgive" while holding internal malice is a lie to the Holy Spirit.
- **New Covenant Promise:**
  - God writes the law of love in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).
  - True forgiveness is a genuine release of bitterness.
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - In the antitypical Day of Atonement, sins must be blotted out.
  - Formal forgiveness does not blot out the sin of malice; it retains it on the soul-record.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Weed:**
  - Formal forgiveness is like snapping the top off a weed but leaving the root.
  - If the root remains, it will grow back stronger.
  - **Lesson:** The "root of bitterness" must be pulled out completely (Hebrews 12:15).

## Slide 21 – Q8: The Manner of Mercy

- **Question:** How should we bestow mercy?
- **Key Text:** Romans 12:8 – “Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points

- **Cheerfulness:**
  - The Greek implies readiness or hilarity.
  - We should be eager to extend mercy, like the father running to the prodigal (Luke 15:20).
- **Reflecting the Father:**
  - Micah 7:18 – “Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity... he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.”
  - If we forgive grudgingly, we misrepresent our Father.

## Slide 23 – Q9: Responding to Confession

- **Question:** What should we do when a sin is confessed?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 2:7 – “So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points

- **Forgive and Comfort:**
  - It is not enough to merely pronounce forgiveness.
  - We must actively strengthen and encourage the repentant one.
- **Preventing Despair:**
  - Harshness toward a repentant sinner can drive them to despair ("overmuch sorrow").
  - Refusing to accept confession makes us agents of the Accuser.
- **The Church's Role:**
  - The church is a hospital for sinners.
  - Staff should encourage the recovering patient, not berate them for being sick.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Lifeline:**
  - A man falls overboard (sin) and cries for help (confession).
  - Forgiveness is throwing the rope.
  - Comfort is pulling him into the boat and warming him.
  - **Lesson:** To throw the rope but leave him shivering in the cold is not the spirit of Christ.

## Slide 26 – Q10: Restoring the Erring

- **Question:** In restoring the erring, what grace should we exemplify?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:1 – “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points

- **Spirit of Meekness:**
  - Strength under control; the opposite of pride and self-righteousness.
- **"Ye Which Are Spiritual":**
  - Only those led by the Spirit are qualified to correct others.
  - Carnal correction leads to anger and deeper wounds.
- **Self-Distrust:**
  - "Considering thyself": We are made of the same dust.
  - Realizing we could fall into the same sin destroys arrogance and births gentleness.

## Slide 28 – Q10: Illustration

- **Setting a Bone:**
  - The Greek word for "restore" is used medically for setting a broken bone.
  - A doctor uses firm but very gentle hands to align the bone for healing.
  - **Lesson:** Harshness only breaks the bone further; gentleness restores.

## Slide 29 – Q11: The Example of Forgiveness

- **Question:** Whose example are we to follow in forgiving?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:13 – “Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you so also do ye.”

## Slide 30 – Q11: Key Points

- **Christ is the Standard:**
  - We do not forgive as society expects, but "as Christ forgave."
- **How Christ Forgives:**
  - **Freely:** While we were yet sinners (Romans 5:8).
  - **Completely:** Casting sins into the depths of the sea.
  - **Sacrificially:** It cost Him His life.
  - **Initiatively:** He seeks the lost before they seek Him.
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - We cannot do this alone; we need "Christ in you" (Colossians 1:27).
  - He lives out His forgiving life through us.

## Slide 31 – Q12: The Old Testament Standard

- **Question:** Did God anciently forbid grudging?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 19:18 – “Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord.”

## Slide 32 – Q12: Key Points

- **Consistent Law:**
  - God’s Law has always been a transcript of His character: Love.
- **Definition of a Grudge:**
  - Nursing anger or keeping a mental record of wrongs.
  - Retaining ill-will in the heart.
- **"I am the LORD":**
  - Holding a grudge is rebellion against God’s sovereignty.
  - Vengeance belongs exclusively to God (Romans 12:19).

## Slide 33 – Q13: The New Testament Warning

- **Question:** What says the New Testament?
- **Key Text:** James 5:9 – “Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned; behold, the Judge standeth before the door.”

## Slide 34 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - "The Judge standeth before the door" indicates the time of the end.
  - As our names come up in the sanctuary, we must not be found holding grudges.
- **Self-Condemnation:**
  - "For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged" (Matthew 7:2).
- **Unity and the Latter Rain:**
  - Grudging destroys church unity.
  - Differences must be put away (like the disciples in the Upper Room) for the Spirit to be poured out.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Forgive and Forget?

- **Question:** Does one forgive who holds a grudge? (Some say: "I can forgive, but I cannot forget.")
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 31:34 – “...for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points

- **Biblical Forgetting:**
  - Not a loss of memory, but a choice of the will.
  - Means choosing not to dwell on the offense or hold it against the person.
- **The Divine Pattern:**
  - God casts sin out of His consideration.
  - If God "remembered" our sins against us, we would be consumed.
- **The Test of Sincerity:**
  - If we treat the person coldly or gossip about the offense, we have not forgiven.
  - "Forgiving but not forgetting" is often a mask for a hidden grudge.

## Slide 37 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Buried Hatchet:**
  - To forgive is to bury the hatchet.
  - To "forgive but not forget" is to bury the hatchet with the handle sticking out above ground.
  - **Lesson:** Leaving the handle visible means you are ready to grab the weapon again the moment you are provoked.

## Slide 38 – Q15: The Master's Comment

- **Question:** What petition in the Lord's prayer, is the only one to which the Master adds a comment?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 6:14, 15 – “For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.”

## Slide 39 – Q15: Key Points & Application

- **The Vital Link:**
  - Our relationship with God (vertical) is inseparable from our relationship with man (horizontal).
  - You cannot have one without the other (1 John 4:20).
- **The Final Test:**
  - In the judgment, our treatment of others is the evidence of our relationship with Christ (Matthew 25:40).
- **Application:**
  - This hard truth drives us to the Cross.
  - We must pray: "Lord, take my heart... Keep it pure, for I cannot keep it for Thee" (Christ's Object Lessons).
  - God promises to replace the stony heart with a heart of flesh (Ezekiel 36:26).
