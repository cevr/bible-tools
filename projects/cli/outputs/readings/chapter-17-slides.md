## Slide 1 – Q1: The Promise of Forgiveness

- **Question:** Is there a promise for those who confess their sins?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Condition & Justice)

- **The Condition of Confession:**
  - Confession is not merely admitting facts God already knows.
  - It is the soul agreeing with God about the guilt of sin (Psalm 51:3–4 – “For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned...”).
  - It requires laying aside pride and genuinely turning the heart to God.
- **Faithful and Just:**
  - The text says God is “just” to forgive, not just “merciful.”
  - Because Christ paid the penalty (Romans 3:24–26), justice no longer demands the death of the believer in Christ.
  - God is faithful to His covenant and just in applying Christ’s merits to us.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Forgiveness & Cleansing)

- **Forgiveness (Justification):**
  - Legal release from the penalty of sin.
  - The record of guilt is covered by Christ’s blood.
  - Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
- **Cleansing (Sanctification):**
  - God attacks the root of the problem.
  - He imparts Christ’s life to enable victory over sin.
  - Ezekiel 36:26 – “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh...”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Muddy Workman:**
  - If a workman falls into a pit of mud, he needs two things:
    1. **Rescue:** To be pulled out of the pit (Forgiveness).
    2. **Washing:** To be cleansed of the filth (Sanctification).
  - If he is only pulled out but left covered in mud, he is not fit for the King’s palace.
  - The Gospel does both: it rescues from condemnation and cleanses the character.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Confessing to Others

- **Question:** To whom besides the Lord should one confess his sins?
- **Key Text:** James 5:16 – “Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **Confession to God:**
  - Every sin is ultimately against God and His law.
  - Only Christ can mediate between the soul and God (1 Timothy 2:5 – “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus”).
- **Confession to Man:**
  - When we injure a neighbor or brother, we must confess to them.
  - Matthew 5:23–24 teaches that reconciliation is a prerequisite for worship.
  - **Rule:** Public sins require public confession; private sins require private confession.
- **The Goal is Healing:**
  - Unresolved guilt hinders spiritual health.
  - Humility breaks down pride and allows the Holy Spirit to work.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Broken Window:**
  - If you break a neighbor's window, apologizing to your father inside your own house does not fix the window.
  - You must go to the neighbor, admit the fault, and make restitution.
  - You must *also* ask your father for forgiveness for your carelessness.
  - **Lesson:** We make right with man what affects man, and with God what affects God.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Covering Sin

- **Question:** If one tries to cover up a sin, and will not properly confess it, what effect will such a course have on the delinquent?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 28:13 – “He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **The Failure of Hiding:**
  - “Covering” means hiding, excusing, or justifying sin.
  - Spiritual prosperity is impossible while sin is concealed (Psalm 32:2).
- **Confessing and Forsaking:**
  - True Righteousness by Faith is not a cloak for cherished sin.
  - **Confession** acknowledges the debt.
  - **Forsaking** turns away from the cause (Philippians 2:13).
- **Christ’s Covering:**
  - The only covering God accepts is the Robe of Christ’s Righteousness (Isaiah 61:10).
  - We must uncover the sin to Jesus so He can cover it with His blood.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Bandaged Wound:**
  - A man with a festering wound may bandage it tightly to hide it.
  - He looks healthy on the outside, but the infection spreads internally.
  - "Covering" the wound guarantees death.
  - He must expose the wound to the Physician to be cleaned and healed.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Hiding from God

- **Question:** Is it possible to hide a sin from God?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Numbers 32:23 – “...be sure your sin will find you out.”
  - Psalm 90:8 – “Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Judgment & Sanctuary)

- **The Record Books:**
  - A record of every life is kept in heaven (Revelation 20:12).
  - Hebrews 4:13 – “...all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.”
- **The Sanctuary Truth:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, sin was transferred to the sanctuary via sacrifice.
  - In the heavenly reality, sins are recorded for the **Investigative Judgment**.
  - Unconfessed sins will stand against the sinner in the judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:14).
- **Sin Finds Us Out:**
  - Sin hardens the conscience and often leads to exposure.
  - Even if hidden from men, it meets the sinner at God's judgment bar.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Hidden Camera:**
  - A criminal may commit a crime in the dark, thinking he is unseen.
  - If a recording camera is running, his secrecy is an illusion.
  - God’s record is more accurate than any camera; it records the act, the motive, and the thought.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Before Confession

- **Question:** How did David feel before he confessed his sins?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 32:3, 4 – “When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Physical Toll of Guilt:**
  - David describes physical symptoms: bones waxing old, moisture drying up.
  - Unconfessed sin destroys mental peace and physical health.
- **The Heavy Hand:**
  - This was God’s mercy in disguise.
  - The Holy Spirit convicted David to prevent him from being lost.
- **The Silence:**
  - “Keeping silence” was the refusal to admit guilt.
  - There is no rest for the wicked (Isaiah 57:21 – “There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked”).

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Heavy Backpack:**
  - Carrying a heavy load all day exhausts a traveler.
  - If he refuses to take it off at night, he cannot sleep and becomes weak.
  - Unconfessed sin is a burden the soul cannot bear.
  - Jesus invites us to find rest (Matthew 11:28).

***

## Slide 17 – Q6: After Confession

- **Question:** What came to him after confession?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 32:5 – “I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Justification by Faith)

- **Instant Forgiveness:**
  - “I said, I will confess... and Thou forgavest.”
  - No long penance was required; God responded instantly to faith.
- **No Excuses:**
  - David took full responsibility: “I acknowledged my sin.”
  - He did not blame circumstances or others.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - David had no merit; he had murder and adultery on his record.
  - He offered a broken heart and faith in God’s mercy.
  - God imputed righteousness the moment David ceased defending himself (Romans 4:7–8).

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Dam and the River:**
  - Imagine a dam holding back a mighty river of water.
  - God’s mercy is like that river, pressing against the door of our hearts.
  - Confession is unlocking the sluice gate.
  - The moment it opens, the grace of God floods in instantly.

## Slide 20 – Q7: The Advocate

- **Question:** Who is the advocate of the sinner?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 2:1 – “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points (Christ’s Ministry)

- **The Advocate (*Parakletos*):**
  - One called alongside to help; a defense attorney.
- **Jesus Christ the Righteous:**
  - Christ does not plead *our* righteousness (we have none).
  - He pleads *His* righteousness and His wounded hands.
- **High Priestly Ministry:**
  - Jesus appears in the presence of God for us (Hebrews 9:24).
  - He points to His sacrifice as the payment.
- **“If Any Man Sin”:**
  - Sin should not be the pattern of the Christian life.
  - But *if* we fall, restoration is provided immediately.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Courtroom:**
  - A defendant representing himself against a skilled prosecutor will lose.
  - But if he has the highest Attorney in the land—one who has never lost a case and has already paid the fine—he can stand with confidence.
  - Jesus is that Attorney for the repentant sinner.

***

## Slide 23 – Q8: Specific Confession

- **Question:** How fully did Israel confess to Samuel when they wished him to intercede before God in their behalf?
- **Key Text:** 1 Samuel 12:19 – “And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points

- **Specific Confession:**
  - Israel did not just say, “We are sinners.”
  - They pinpointed the exact sin: “to ask us a king.”
- **The Principle:**
  - Repentance is not a vague feeling of sadness.
  - It is the specific renunciation of specific wrongs revealed by the Spirit.
  - Psalm 139:23–24 – “Search me, O God, and know my heart... and see if there be any wicked way in me...”
- **Acknowledging the Evil:**
  - They stopped calling it a political necessity and called it "evil" (sin).

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Doctor’s Diagnosis:**
  - If a patient tells a doctor, “I hurt,” the doctor cannot help much.
  - If he says, “I have a sharp pain in my chest when I breathe,” the doctor can diagnose and treat.
  - We must bring our specific spiritual symptoms to the Great Physician.

***

## Slide 26 – Q9: Expectation & Blotting Out

- **Question:** What are we to expect when we confess our sins?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 51:1 – “Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points (Sanctuary & Final Atonement)

- **Appeal to Character:**
  - David appeals to God’s “lovingkindness” and “tender mercies.”
- **Blotting Out:**
  - A sanctuary term connected to the Day of Atonement.
  - Sin is transferred to the sanctuary, then finally cleansed.
- **The Final Goal:**
  - We look for the time when sins are blotted from the books of heaven (Acts 3:19).
  - This prepares a people to stand during the final judgment.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Ledger:**
  - If a debt is written in a ledger, a merchant may write "Paid" across it (Forgiveness).
  - "Blotting out" is wiping the page clean or burning the book.

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points

- **Two Kinds of Confession:**
  1.  **Voluntary:** Made now, resulting in salvation.
  2.  **Involuntary:** Made in the judgment, acknowledging God’s justice, but too late for salvation.
- **The Vindication of God:**
  - The Great Controversy ends with all beings acknowledging God’s justice.
- **The Urgent Call:**
  - We must settle the account now while the door of mercy is open.
  - We send sins to judgment beforehand through confession.

## Slide 31 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Sentencing Phase:**
  - A criminal can confess before the trial to receive mercy or a plea deal.
  - After the gavel falls and the sentence is read, admitting guilt changes nothing regarding the punishment.
  - **Lesson:** Now is the accepted time (2 Corinthians 6:2).
