## Slide 1 – Q1: The Days of Noah

- **Question:** What did Jesus say would be the condition of the world just
  prior to His coming?
- **Key Text:** Luke 17:26 – “As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also
  in the days of the Son of man.”
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:5 – “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great
  in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only
  evil continually.”
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:11 – “The earth also was corrupt before God, and the
  earth was filled with violence.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Sin and Violence)

- **No Golden Age:** Christ’s prophecy contradicts the theory that the world
  will improve into a time of universal peace.
- **Prevalence of Sin:**
  - The last days are marked by the removal of God’s law from the conscience.
  - Men surrender to the lower nature (Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is
    enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
    can be.”).
- **Violence and Anarchy:**
  - Casting aside God’s law leads to violence.
  - When heaven's authority is rejected, respect for human life disappears.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Temporal Focus)

- **Preoccupation with the Temporal:**
  - Jesus noted they were eating, drinking, marrying, and building (Luke
    17:27-28).
  - These things became sinful because they were the _only_ focus of life.
- **Application:** The people lived entirely for the present world, neglecting
  preparation for the coming judgment.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Necessity of Power:**
  - Man naturally slides toward evil (Jeremiah 17:9 – “The heart is deceitful
    above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?”).
  - Social reform and education cannot cure the heart.
- **Grace Defined:**
  - Grace is not just unmerited favor; it is enabling power.
  - Genesis 6:8 – “But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.”
- **The Solution:** We need the indwelling life of Christ to swim against the
  current of this age.

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Drifting Boat:**
  - Imagine a boat drifting on a mighty river leading to a waterfall.
  - The current represents the world's wickedness and indifference.
  - To drift is to be lost; one must get into the Ark (Christ) to be saved.
- **The Lesson:** Inside the Ark, we are safe from the storm, not because of our
  own swimming ability, but because of the strength of the vessel.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Wheat and Tares

- **Question:** According to the parable of the wheat and tares, how long do the
  good and bad remain together?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 13:38-39 – “The field is the world; the good seed are
  the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
  the enemy that sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the
  world...”
- **Key Text:** Matthew 13:30 – “Let both grow together until the harvest: and
  in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the
  tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points (The Harvest)

- **Co-existence:** The righteous (wheat) and the wicked (tares) grow together
  in the world until the end.
- **No Universal Conversion:** The world does not gradually convert; the
  separation happens decisively at the Second Advent.
- **Ripening of Character:**
  - The wicked ripen in iniquity (Revelation 22:11 – “He that is unjust, let him
    be unjust still...”).
  - The righteous ripen in holiness through **Sanctification** (2 Peter 3:18 –
    “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
    Christ.”).

## Slide 8 – Q2: Sanctuary Connection

- **Christ’s Ministry:**
  - The "growing together" phase corresponds to Christ’s ministry in the
    Heavenly Sanctuary.
  - While the door of mercy is open, a "tare" can become "wheat" through the new
    birth (John 3:3).
- **The Close of Probation:**
  - Once judgment ends and Christ stands up (Daniel 12:1), the harvest is ready.
- **Definition – Probation:** The time God grants humanity to be tested and
  choose between life and death.

## Slide 9 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Gardener:**
  - A gardener sees weeds intertwining with the roots of precious flowers.
  - Pulling the weeds too early might destroy the flowers.
- **God’s Mercy:**
  - God allows the wicked to remain for a time to give every opportunity for
    repentance.
  - This allows the righteous to develop patience and endurance in a contrary
    environment.

## Slide 10 – Q3: The Purpose of Preaching

- **Question:** Did Christ tell us that worldwide preaching of the gospel would
  result in world conversion?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:14 – “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be
  preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the
  end come.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Key Points

- **A Witness, Not a Conversion:**
  - Jesus said the gospel would be a **witness**.
  - The Three Angels' Messages (Revelation 14) offer salvation and vindicate
    God's character before the end.
- **Many Called, Few Chosen:**
  - The invitation is universal, but acceptance is limited (Matthew 7:14 –
    “Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life,
    and few there be that find it.”).
- **Power of the Gospel:**
  - For the individual believer, the gospel brings complete victory over sin
    (Romans 1:16).

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Royal Decree:**
  - When a herald reads a royal decree in the town square, it is a "witness."
  - The herald’s job is to ensure everyone hears.
  - Whether the people obey or rebel is their own choice.
- **The Lesson:** The proclamation clears the King of any charge of unfairness.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Paul’s Description

- **Question:** How did Paul describe the last days?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:1 – “This know also, that in the last days perilous
  times shall come.”
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:13 – “But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and
  worse, deceiving and being deceived.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Key Points (Decline and Deception)

- **Moral Decline:**
  - Humanity is not evolving upward; men wax "worse and worse."
  - Without God, the heart degenerates (Jeremiah 13:23).
- **Spiritual Deception:**
  - The danger includes counterfeit Christianity.
  - People have a "form of godliness" but deny the power to cleanse the heart (2
    Timothy 3:5).

## Slide 15 – Q4: Application (Power and Obedience)

- **The Necessity of Power:**
  - To stand, we need an experimental knowledge of Christ, not just theory.
- **Justification and Sanctification:**
  - **Justification** clears our record.
  - The Spirit must impel us to **obedience** (Sanctification).
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me...”

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **Rowing Upstream:**
  - A man rowing a boat upstream cannot stop; if he does, he drifts backward.
  - He does not stay in the same place.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The current of sin is fierce in the last days.
  - We must press forward in faith daily, or we will "wax worse and worse" with
    the world.

## Slide 17 – Q5: International Affairs

- **Question:** How does Scripture describe the state of international affairs?
- **Key Text:** Joel 3:9 – “Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war,
  stir up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up.”
- **Key Text:** Joel 3:10 – “Beat your plowshares into swords, and your
  pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: Key Points

- **Preparation for Conflict:**
  - Despite talk of peace, nations convert agricultural tools (plowshares) into
    weapons.
- **The Spirit of War:**
  - As the Spirit of God is withdrawn, restraining power is removed (Revelation
    11:18 – “And the nations were angry...”).
- **Christian Duty:**
  - We are peacemakers, but we do not trust in earthly confederacies.
  - Our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20).

## Slide 19 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Pressure Cooker:**
  - The world situation is like a pressure cooker with the heat turned up.
  - Treaties and alliances clamp the lid down tight.
  - Without the "safety valve" of God's restraining grace, the pressure builds
    until the vessel explodes.

## Slide 20 – Q6: False Peace

- **Question:** What statement by Jeremiah about conditions in his day equally
  applies to our own time?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 6:14 – “They have healed also the hurt of the daughter
  of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.”

## Slide 21 – Q6: Key Points (Slight Healing)

- **Cheap Grace:**
  - Jeremiah rebuked leaders for offering a superficial remedy ("slight
    healing").
  - It is deceptive to tell people they are saved while they continue in known
    sin (Romans 8:7).
- **The True Remedy:**
  - God wants to cleanse the conscience, not just cover the sin.
  - 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
    our sins, and to _cleanse us from all unrighteousness_.”

## Slide 22 – Q6: Application (Atonement)

- **Definition – Atonement:**
  - The work of reconciliation.
  - In the type (OT), blood was shed.
  - In the antitype (NT), Christ’s blood pays the penalty and His high priestly
    ministry applies it to blot out sin.
- **True Peace:** Comes only through **Justification by Faith** and the
  surrender of the will to God's law.

## Slide 23 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Malpractice:**
  - A doctor who puts a band-aid over a deep, infected wound and says, "You are
    fine," is guilty of malpractice.
  - The infection must be removed.
- **The Great Physician:**
  - God wants to perform the surgery of removing the "stony heart" (Ezekiel
    36:26), not just cover it up.

---

## Slide 24 – Q7: False Security

- **Question:** Will talking about world peace create a false security?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:3-4 – “...scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and
  saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep,
  all things continue as they were...”
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 5:3 – “For when they shall say, Peace and
  safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them... and they shall not
  escape.”

## Slide 25 – Q7: Key Points

- **Uniformitarianism:**
  - Scoffers argue "all things continue as they were," denying past judgments
    (the Flood) and future judgment.
- **Peace and Safety:**
  - A spiritual anaesthetic suggesting God is not needed.
- **The Thief in the Night:**
  - For the sleeping world, destruction is unexpected.
  - Believers are called to watch: “But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that
    that day should overtake you as a thief” (1 Thessalonians 5:4).

## Slide 26 – Q7: Illustration

- **Pompeii:**
  - Residents of Pompeii went about daily business, ignoring the signs of Mount
    Vesuvius.
  - They discussed the future prosperity of the city while the mountain smoked.
- **The Lesson:** The cry of "Peace and Safety" is the smoke before the
  eruption.

---

## Slide 27 – Q8: The Christian’s Reaction

- **Question:** What warning to Isaiah to the faithful in his day should also be
  the Christian's reaction to last-day conditions?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 8:12 – “Say ye not, A confederacy... neither fear ye
  their fear, nor be afraid.”
- **Key Text:** Luke 21:28 – “And when these things begin to come to pass, then
  look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.”

## Slide 28 – Q8: Key Points (Hope)

- **Sanctify the Lord:**
  - Isaiah 8:13 – “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear,
    and let him be your dread.”
  - If we have a reverent awe of God, we need not fear the world.
- **Separation:**
  - We do not join the panic or political "confederacies."
  - Our anchor holds within the veil (Hebrews 6:19), where Jesus ministers.
- **Look Up:**
  - The signs that terrify the wicked are signals that our Deliverer is at the
    door.

## Slide 29 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Thunderstorm:**
  - When a violent storm strikes, a stranger is terrified by the thunder.
  - A child in the house, who knows the voice of their father, feels safe.
- **The Lesson:** The thunder of the last days is the approaching footsteps of
  our Savior. We know Him, so we do not fear.
