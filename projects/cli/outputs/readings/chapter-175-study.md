### Q1. With what does the apostle Paul class temperance?

"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law." Gal. 5:22, 23.

**Answer:**

The apostle Paul places **temperance** at the very climax of the list of the fruits of the Spirit. It is not merely a human habit or a social improvement, but a divine attribute imparted to the believer through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

*   **Definition of Temperance:** In the biblical and historic Adventist sense, temperance is the **self-control** (Greek: *egkrateia*) exercised by the believer over their entire being. It includes total abstinence from things that are harmful (like alcohol or tobacco) and the moderate, judicious use of things that are good (like food, work, and rest).
*   **A Fruit, Not a Root:** Notice that temperance is a *fruit*, not the *root*. We do not exercise self-control in order to be saved (legalism); rather, because we are saved and indwelt by the Spirit, we receive the power to control our appetites (sanctification).
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** The carnal nature cannot control itself; it is "sold under sin" (Romans 7:14). True temperance is the life of Christ—who overcame appetite in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1–4)—manifested in the believer. When we submit to Christ, His victory becomes ours.
*   **Harmony with Law:** The text says, "against such there is no law." When the Spirit writes God's law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10), the believer naturally desires to live healthfully and soberly. The law condemns sin, but it has no condemnation for the life lived in the Spirit.

**[ILL]**
Imagine a wild horse that no man can tame. This represents our natural appetites and passions. If you try to hold the horse with a rope of sand (human will), it will break free and run wild. But if the Master Horseman (Christ) takes the reins, the horse is brought under control. The horse is not destroyed, but its energy is disciplined and directed. This is temperance: our faculties controlled by the Spirit of God.

### Q2. What does the same apostle say of those who strive for the mastery?

"And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things." 1 Cor. 9:25.

**Answer:**

Paul uses the illustration of the ancient Isthmian games to teach a profound spiritual lesson about the Christian warfare against self and sin.

1.  **Temperate in *All* Things:** The athlete does not merely abstain from one bad habit while indulging another. He regulates his diet, sleep, and activity strictly. Similarly, the Christian seeking "the mastery" (victory over sin) must be temperate in eating, drinking, working, and even thinking. A clouded mind cannot clearly discern the will of God.
2.  **The Incorruptible Crown:** Earthly athletes practiced self-denial for a wreath of fading leaves. How much more should those who seek an **incorruptible crown** (eternal life) be willing to deny fleshly lusts? (1 Peter 1:4).
3.  **Victory through Grace:** While the athlete strives in human strength, the Christian strives with the energy God provides (Colossians 1:29). We "fight the good fight of faith" (1 Timothy 6:12), relying on Christ's power to subdue our lower nature.

**Definition – Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit sets the believer apart for God, purifying the character and bringing every thought and habit into obedience to Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

**[ILL]**
A musician preparing for a great concert will not risk damaging their hearing with loud noises or their fingers with rough labor. They protect their instrument for the performance. Our bodies are the "temple of the Holy Ghost" (1 Corinthians 6:19). To prepare for the "concert" of eternity and to serve God now, we must protect the instrument through temperance.

### Q3. In running the Christian race, what did Paul say he did in order to be successful?

"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway." 1 Cor. 9:27.

**Answer:**

Paul realizes that his body must be a servant to his spirit, not the master of it. If the body rules, the spiritual life dies.

*   **"Keep Under My Body":** The Greek term implies striking a blow to discipline an adversary. Paul took decisive action against his carnal desires. This is not self-flagellation (punishing the body to earn merit), but the rigorous denial of sinful cravings that war against the soul (1 Peter 2:11).
*   **The Danger of Being a Castaway:** Even the great apostle Paul knew that if he allowed his lower nature to rule, he could be disqualified ("a castaway") from the race. This teaches us that:
    *   Salvation is maintained by a continuous, living faith that produces obedience.
    *   We are never "once saved, always saved" in a way that permits us to live in sin.
*   **Practical Application:** We must bring our appetites into subjection to the laws of health and the laws of God. A clogged stomach often leads to a clogged brain, making it difficult to maintain patience and love.

**[ILL]**
A ship's captain (the conscience/will) must command the crew (the body's appetites). If the crew mutinies and raids the cargo, getting drunk and ignoring the captain, the ship will crash on the rocks. Paul says we must, by God's grace, keep the crew in subjection so the ship can reach the harbor of Heaven.

### Q4. What is the effect of intemperance?

"Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine." Prov. 23:29, 30.

**Answer:**

The Bible provides a vivid, clinical description of the physical, social, and emotional wreckage caused by alcohol and intemperance.

1.  **Physical Destruction:** "Redness of eyes" and "wounds without cause" point to the deterioration of the body and the physical accidents that occur under the influence.
2.  **Emotional and Mental Ruin:** "Woe," "sorrow," and "babbling" (incoherent speech) show how alcohol degrades the dignity of man, who was made in the image of God. It depresses the mind and confuses the intellect.
3.  **Social Strife:** "Contentions" arise because alcohol removes inhibitions and patience. Many homes are broken and crimes committed because the reasoning powers are paralyzed by drink.

**Theological Insight:** God warns against this not to restrict our pleasure, but to preserve our happiness. Sin (including intemperance) always brings "woe." God's law is a hedge of protection; when we step over it, we suffer the consequences.

### Q5. Why were kings prohibited the use of strong drink?

"It is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink; lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted." Prov. 31:4, 5.

**Answer:**

Those in positions of authority require clear minds to execute justice. Alcohol attacks the frontal lobe of the brain—the seat of judgment, conscience, and reason.

*   **Forgetting the Law:** Intoxication causes a moral amnesia. Under the influence, a ruler (or any person) forgets the distinction between right and wrong defined by God's law.
*   **Perverting Judgment:** Justice requires precision. A chemically altered mind cannot weigh evidence or make righteous decisions.
*   **Spiritual Application:** In the New Testament, believers are called "kings and priests unto God" (Revelation 1:6). If earthly kings needed clear heads to judge temporal matters, how much more do Christians need clear minds to discern spiritual truths and the wiles of the devil?

---

### Q6. Why were priests not allowed to use intoxicating drink?

"And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying, Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, ...that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean." Lev. 10:8-10.

**Answer:**

This command was given immediately after the tragic death of Nadab and Abihu, who offered "strange fire" before the Lord (Leviticus 10:1). It is implied they did so because their minds were confused by drink.

1.  **Discernment:** The priest's duty was to distinguish between "holy and unholy" and "clean and unclean." Alcohol blurs the line between the sacred and the common. A staggering brain cannot discern the holiness of God.
2.  **Sanctuary Connection:** We are living in the time of the antitypical Day of Atonement, where Christ is ministering in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1–2). Just as the earthly priests had to be sober to enter the tabernacle, God's people today must be sober and vigilant (1 Peter 5:8) to cooperate with Christ's work of cleansing the sanctuary and the heart.
3.  **Holiness:** God says, "Be ye holy; for I am holy" (1 Peter 1:16). Anything that benumbs the brain makes holiness impossible, for the Holy Spirit communicates with us through the mind.

**Definition – Atonement:** The work of reconciliation between God and man. In the sanctuary service, it involved the transfer of sin to the sanctuary and its final removal (cleansing). We must be awake to afflict our souls during this time.

**[ILL]**
A surgeon performing a delicate heart operation must have steady hands and a perfectly clear mind. If he takes a drug that dulls his senses, he endangers the patient's life. We are engaged in a life-or-death spiritual warfare; we cannot afford to dull our spiritual senses with intemperance.

### Q7. Why did Daniel and his companions refuse to drink of the wine of the king of Babylon?

"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank." Dan. 1:8.

**Answer:**

Daniel's refusal was not merely a dietary preference; it was an act of worship and loyalty to God.

*   **"Purposed in his Heart":** True temperance begins in the heart (the will). Daniel made a settled decision before the temptation arose.
*   **Defilement:** The king's meat was likely unclean (Leviticus 11) or offered to idols, and the wine was fermented and used in pagan toasts. To partake would be to compromise his faith and unite with the world's idolatry.
*   **Righteousness by Faith:** Daniel did not have the strength to resist the Babylonian empire on his own. He trusted in the God of Israel. His obedience was the fruit of his faith. He dared to be a "peculiar people" (Titus 2:14) amidst a pagan culture.

**[ILL]**
A dead fish floats downstream with the current, but it takes a live fish to swim against it. Daniel was alive to God. While others drifted with the customs of Babylon, Daniel swam against the current because the life of God was in him.

### Q8. After protesting against the use of the stimulants offered them, what did they request?

"Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days: and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink." Dan. 1:12.

**Answer:**

Daniel proposed a scientific test. He did not ask for a miracle to save him from the effects of a bad diet; he asked to live in harmony with God's natural laws.

*   **Pulse and Water:** "Pulse" refers to plant-based foods (vegetables, legumes, grains). Water is the only drink God originally provided for man and beast (Genesis 1:29; 2:10).
*   **The Principle:** They chose the diet that would provide the best blood and the clearest brain. They rejected the rich, stimulating, and intoxicating diet of the world.
*   **Trusting God:** It took faith to believe that a simple diet would outperform the king's luxury in just ten days.

---

### Q9. At the end of the ten days' test, how did these Hebrews appear?

"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat." Dan. 1:15.

**Answer:**

God honored their faith and obedience. The natural laws of health, established by God, produced visible results.

*   **Physical Health:** They were "fairer" (healthier appearance) and "fatter" (better nourished, not overweight).
*   **The Lesson:** A simple, temperate diet, free from alcohol and unclean meats, imparts a vigor that stimulants cannot give. Stimulants (like alcohol or caffeine) produce a temporary high followed by a crash; natural food provides sustained strength.
*   **God's Blessing:** While the diet was naturally healthy, God added His blessing because they honored Him. "Them that honor me I will honor" (1 Samuel 2:30).

### Q10. At the end of three years (the time appointed for them to learn the Chaldean tongue, (Dan. 1:4, 5) how many in the realm were found equal in learning to these abstainers?

"Now at the end of the days... the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah ...And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm." Daniel 1:18-20.

**Answer:**

The result of strict temperance was not just physical health, but superior intellectual and spiritual power.

*   **Ten Times Better:** Their minds were clear, their memories retentive, and their perceptions sharp. The Holy Spirit could work through their minds without the hindrance of clouded nerves.
*   **Connection to Wisdom:** "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10). By keeping their bodies under subjection, they maintained a connection with the Source of all wisdom.
*   **Witness:** Their temperance became a witness to the heathen king about the superiority of the God of Israel.

**[ILL]**
A dusty, dirty window lets in very little light. A clean, clear window lets the sunlight flood the room. The Holy Spirit is the light; our body (specifically the brain) is the window. Temperance keeps the window clean so God's light can shine into us and through us to others.

### Q11. Did not Paul recommend the use of wine under certain conditions?

"Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and thine often infirmities." 1 Tim. 5:23.

**Answer:**

This text is often misused to justify social drinking, but the context and the definition of "wine" in Scripture clarify the meaning.

*   **Medicinal Use:** Paul was prescribing a remedy for a specific physical ailment ("thine often infirmities"), not suggesting wine as a beverage for pleasure.
*   **The Term "Wine":** As the note in the lesson outline explains, the Bible uses the word "wine" (*yayin* in Hebrew, *oinos* in Greek) to refer to the juice of the grape in *two* states:
    1.  **Unfermented:** New wine, pure grape juice (a blessing).
    2.  **Fermented:** Alcoholic, decomposed juice (a mocker).
*   **Consistency:** Paul, who wrote that drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom (1 Corinthians 6:10) and that we should not be "drunk with wine" (Ephesians 5:18), would not contradict his own teaching. It is reasonable to conclude Paul was recommending unfermented grape juice (which has medicinal properties for the stomach) or a strictly medicinal application, distinct from the recreational drinking that the Bible condemns.

### Q12. How is the first kind spoken of?

"Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the PURE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE." Deut. 32:14.

**Answer:**

The first kind of wine is the fresh, unfermented juice of the grape.

*   **"Pure Blood of the Grape":** This refers to the juice as it comes from the fruit—sweet, nourishing, and non-intoxicating.
*   **A Blessing:** Isaiah 65:8 says, "As the new wine is found in the cluster... Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it." God's gifts in nature are good.
*   **Symbolism:** This pure juice represents the blood of Christ shed for the remission of sins (Matthew 26:27–29), which is why we use unfermented grape juice in the Communion service. Fermentation represents corruption and sin (leaven), which cannot symbolize the sinless blood of Jesus.

---

### Q13. How is the second kind represented?

"Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder." Prov. 23:31, 32.

**Answer:**

The second kind is fermented, alcoholic wine. The Bible warns us not even to "look" upon it with desire.

*   **Signs of Fermentation:** The description "giveth his color," "moveth itself," and "red" describes the chemical process of fermentation (carbon dioxide bubbles moving upward).
*   **The Nature of Alcohol:** It "biteth like a serpent." This connects alcohol directly to the work of the Serpent (Satan). It promises pleasure but delivers death.
*   **Deception:** Just as the serpent deceived Eve, alcohol deceives the user, making them feel strong while they are weak, and wise while they are foolish.

### Q14. With what other low debaucheries is drunkenness more or less associated?

"Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like." Gal. 5:19-21.

**Answer:**

Paul lists drunkenness among the "works of the flesh." It is interesting to note the company it keeps.

*   **The Chain of Sin:** Drunkenness is linked with **sexual immorality** ("adultery, fornication") because it lowers moral inhibitions. It is linked with **violence** ("wrath, strife, murders") because it inflames the passions.
*   **The Carnal Nature:** These sins are the natural outflow of the heart separated from God. No amount of human resolution can cleanse these from the heart; only the blood of Christ can wash them away, and only the Spirit of Christ can replace them with His fruit (Galatians 5:22).
*   **Sanctification:** A believer cannot willfully engage in these "works of the flesh" and claim to be walking in the Spirit.

### Q15. Can a drunkard enter the kingdom of God?

“Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." 1 Cor. 6:10.

**Answer:**

The Bible is explicit: those who cling to the sin of drunkenness cannot inherit heaven.

*   **Why?** Heaven is a place of perfect purity, order, and holy joy. A character warped by self-indulgence and chemical dependency would be miserable in the presence of a holy God.
*   **The Good News:** The very next verse (1 Corinthians 6:11) provides the hope of the Gospel: "**And such were some of you**: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
*   **Transformation:** The Gospel does not just forgive the drunkard; it delivers him. Through the power of Christ, the drunkard can be made sober and holy. This is Righteousness by Faith—God giving us the power to become what we are not by nature.

**Definition – Justification:** God's gracious act of declaring a repentant sinner righteous, forgiving their past sins for Christ's sake (Romans 3:24).
**Definition – Sanctification:** God's work of making the believer holy in lifestyle and character (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

### Q16. How, then, should a Christian regard one who persists in drunkenness?

“But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard." 1 Cor. 5:11.

**Answer:**

While we must love the sinner and seek to restore them, the church has a responsibility to maintain the honor of God's name.

*   **"Called a Brother":** This instruction applies to those within the church who claim to be Christians but persist in open sin.
*   **Separation:** "Not to keep company" (or "not to eat" with such a one) implies church discipline. This is done for two reasons:
    1.  To protect the church from the leaven of sin (1 Corinthians 5:6).
    2.  To shock the sinner into realizing the gravity of their condition, that they might repent and be saved (1 Corinthians 5:5).
*   **Love's Duty:** True love does not condone sin. We must call sin by its right name so that the sinner may see their need of a Savior. We point them to the High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary who is able to "save them to the uttermost" (Hebrews 7:25) if they will come to Him in repentance.

**[ILL]**
If a man has a contagious, deadly disease, we quarantine him. This is not because we hate him, but to stop the spread of the disease and to focus on his cure. Sin is the most deadly disease in the universe. We must not treat it lightly.
