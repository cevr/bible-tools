## Slide 1 – Q1: The Little Horn and the Law

- **Question:** In his mention of the "little horn," what does the prophet say
  that power should think to do?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:25 – "And he shall speak great words against the Most
  High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change
  times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times
  and the dividing of time."

## Slide 2 – Q1: Identifying the Power

- **Historicist Interpretation:**
  - The "little horn" represents the religious-political system that grew out of
    the Roman Empire (the Papacy).
- **Three Key Characteristics (Daniel 7:25):**
  1. **Speaking Against the Most High:** Claiming prerogatives that belong only
     to God.
  2. **Persecuting the Saints:** Using civil power to force conscience.
  3. **Thinking to Change Times and Laws:** A direct assault on God’s
     government.
- **"Thinking" to Change:**
  - This power cannot actually change God's eternal law, but attempts to change
    it in human minds.
  - Psalm 111:7–8 – "The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
    commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in
    truth and uprightness."
  - Matthew 5:18 – "For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one
    jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
    fulfilled."

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Attack on the Law

- **Which Law?**
  - The prophecy refers to the moral law (Ten Commandments), not ceremonial laws
    fulfilled in Christ.
  - Colossians 2:14 – "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was
    against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it
    to his cross."
- **"Times":**
  - The only commandment dealing with time is the Sabbath (the Fourth).
  - Exodus 20:8 – "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."
- **The Implication:**
  - Attempting to shift the Sabbath from Saturday (the seventh day) to Sunday
    (the first day) places human authority above Scripture.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Righteousness by Faith & Sanctuary

- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - Faith leads to obedience; substituting man's tradition for God's law is a
    form of righteousness by works.
  - Romans 3:31 – "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
    we establish the law."
  - Romans 8:4 – "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
    who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
- **Sanctuary Insight:**
  - The Law is the foundation of God's throne in the Most Holy Place.
  - Exodus 25:21 – "And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in
    the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee."
  - Attacking the law is attacking the foundation of God’s sanctuary.

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Blueprint and the Foreman:**
  - Imagine an architect provides a master blueprint for a house.
  - A foreman changes the measurements on the blueprint without permission.
  - The foreman cannot change the architect's mind, but he causes the workers to
    build a crooked house.
- **Application:**
  - God’s Law is the blueprint of His character.
  - The "little horn" has altered the blueprint in the minds of millions.
  - This leads many to build a spiritual house on human tradition rather than
    the rock of God’s Word.

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Man of Sin

- **Question:** What does Paul say the "man of sin" should do?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4 – "Let no man deceive you by any means:
  for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that
  man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth
  himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God
  sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Characteristics

- **The Falling Away:**
  - A corruption from within the church, drifting from the gospel to forms and
    hierarchy.
- **Exalting Himself Above God:**
  - Claiming titles belonging to Christ.
  - Claiming power to forgive sins, a prerogative of God.
  - Mark 2:7 – "Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
    but God only?"
- **Sitting in the Temple:**
  - The "temple" refers to the church, the spiritual temple.
  - 1 Corinthians 3:16 – "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that
    the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?"
  - This power usurps the position of the Holy Spirit and Christ within the
    church.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Application (Sanctuary & Victory)

- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - This system directs people to earthly priests rather than the High Priest in
    Heaven.
  - 1 Timothy 2:5 – "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
    the man Christ Jesus."
- **Victory in Christ:**
  - Sin is "transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4); the "man of sin" is the "man
    of lawlessness."
  - True righteousness requires humility, not self-exaltation.
  - Luke 18:14 – "I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather
    than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he
    that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
  - Hebrews 10:16 – "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those
    days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their
    minds will I write them."

## Slide 9 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Usurper in Office:**
  - Suppose a Vice President sits in the President's chair and signs orders
    contradicting existing laws.
  - Even if he wears the President's suit, he is a usurper.
- **Application:**
  - The "man of sin" has seated himself in the church, issuing commands (like
    Sunday sacredness) that contradict the King of Kings.
  - True subjects check the Law Book (the Bible) and obey the rightful Ruler.

## Slide 10 – Q3: History and the Change of the Law

- **Question:** What power has attempted to change the law of God?
- **Historical Evidence (Catholic Catechism):**
  - **Question:** "Have you any other way of proving that the church has power
    to institute festivals of precept?"
  - **Answer:** "Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which
    all modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the
    observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of
    Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is not scriptural
    authority." (_Doctrinal Catechism_, p. 174).

## Slide 11 – Q3: The Issue of Authority

- **The Conflict:**
  - The Papacy admits to substituting Sunday for Saturday without Scriptural
    authority.
  - This is a question of authority: Tradition vs. Scripture.
- **Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone):**
  - Protestantism stands on the Bible as the only rule of faith.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
    to this word, it is because there is no light in them."
  - 2 Timothy 3:16 – "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
    profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
    righteousness."

## Slide 12 – Q3: Righteousness by Faith & Obedience

- **Obedience as Love, Not Legalism:**
  - John 14:15 – "If ye love me, keep my commandments."
- **The Sabbath and Sanctification:**
  - Keeping the Sabbath acknowledges God's power to make us holy.
  - Exodus 31:13 – "Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily
    my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout
    your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify
    you."
- **Rest in Christ:**
  - Hebrews 4:9 – "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God."

## Slide 13 – Q3: The Great Controversy

- **The Final Conflict:**
  - The controversy centers on worship: The Creator vs. the Beast power.
  - Revelation 14:7 – "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to
    him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven,
    and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
- **The Call of the Faithful:**
  - Revelation 14:12 – "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
    keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

## Slide 14 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Father’s Letter:**
  - Imagine receiving a letter from your father with specific instructions for
    the family estate.
  - A stranger says, "Your father wrote that, but I have authority to cross out
    lines and write my own. Listen to me, not the letter."
- **Application:**
  - Honoring your father means following his original written word.
  - Keeping the Bible Sabbath is honoring our Heavenly Father's original,
    unchangeable letter of love.
