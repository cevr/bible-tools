Chapter 12: Prophecies Relating to Christ

### Q1. In what words did Moses speak of Christ?
"The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto Him ye shall hearken." Deut. 18:15.

**Answer:**
Moses, the great lawgiver and deliverer of Israel, here points forward to the true Deliverer, Jesus Christ. This prophecy establishes Christ’s authority and His nature.

*   **"Like unto me":** Moses was a type (a symbolic foreshadowing) of Christ. Just as Moses was chosen to lead Israel out of literal Egyptian bondage, Christ was chosen to lead humanity out of the spiritual bondage of sin (John 8:34–36). Moses was a mediator between God and the people at Sinai; Christ is the "one mediator between God and men" (1 Timothy 2:5).
*   **"Of thy brethren":** This predicts the incarnation. Christ did not come as an angel, but took upon Himself "the seed of Abraham" (Hebrews 2:16). He became a sharer in our flesh and blood so that He could be a merciful High Priest, touched with the feeling of our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15).
*   **"Unto Him ye shall hearken":** This is a command. While the law came by Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus Christ (John 1:17). To "hearken" means to obey from the heart.

**Definition:**
*   **Mediator:** One who intervenes between two parties to restore peace. Christ bridges the gap caused by sin, reconciling man to God (2 Corinthians 5:19).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a group of travelers lost in a deadly desert. A guide appears who knows the way because he has walked it himself. He is not a map; he is a living leader. Moses was like a map pointing to the Promised Land; Christ is the Living Guide who takes our hand and leads us in the path of life. We must listen to Him not just as a teacher, but as the Captain of our salvation.

### Q2. How may we know that the Prophet here spoken of is Christ?
"For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me," "Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days." Acts 3:22, 24.

**Answer:**
The New Testament is the inspired interpreter of the Old. Here, the Apostle Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, explicitly applies Moses' prophecy to Jesus of Nazareth.

*   **The Testimony of the Apostles:** Peter declares that the days of Christ's ministry were the very events all the prophets—from Samuel onward—had anticipated.
*   **The Unity of Scripture:** This confirms that the Bible is one book with one central Hero. The Old Testament is the gospel concealed in types and shadows; the New Testament is the gospel revealed in the life of Christ.
*   **The Authority of Jesus:** If Jesus is the Prophet Moses spoke of, then His words carry the weight of God Himself. To reject His teaching on the law, the Sabbath, or the way of salvation is to reject the God who sent Him (John 12:48–49).

### Q3. Was this prophecy fulfilled?
"Now all this was done [the birth of Jesus of the Virgin Mary], that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us." Matt. 1:22, 23.

**Answer:**
Yes, it was fulfilled in the miracle of the Incarnation. This passage cites Isaiah 7:14, revealing the two-fold nature of Christ.

*   **The Miracle of Birth:** He was born of a virgin, signifying that His Father was God. This allowed Him to be the "second Adam," the new head of the human race, untainted by the inherited guilt of the first Adam, yet fully bearing our fallen nature to redeem it.
*   **Emmanuel (God with us):** This is the heart of the Righteousness by Faith message.
    *   He was God *with* us in proximity (walking on earth).
    *   He was God *with* us in nature (taking our flesh).
    *   He is now God *in* us by His Spirit (Colossians 1:27).
*   **Victory over Sin:** Because He is "God with us," we are not left to fight sin alone. His divinity combined with humanity means He could endure every temptation without yielding, and He offers that same victorious life to us today.

**Definition:**
*   **Incarnation:** The act of God the Son taking on human flesh and nature, becoming fully man while remaining fully God (John 1:14).

**[ILL]**
If a king sees his subjects drowning in a rushing river, he might shout instructions from the bank. But a Savior-King dives into the treacherous water himself. He feels the cold current; he battles the same waves. By entering the water ("God with us"), He is able to grab the drowning man and pull him to safety. Christ did not save us from a distance; He came into the river of our humanity.

### Q4. Where was He to be born?
"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel." Micah 5:2.

**Answer:**
The prophecy was specific not only regarding the *manner* of His birth but the *place*.

*   **Humility:** Bethlehem was "little among the thousands." God often chooses the weak things of the world to confound the mighty (1 Corinthians 1:27). The King of Glory was not born in Rome or Jerusalem, but in a humble village, showing that true greatness is found in character, not position.
*   **Pre-existence:** The verse continues (in the KJV text of Micah 5:2), "whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." This proves Christ did not begin to exist at Bethlehem. He is the eternal Son of God who entered time and space.
*   **Ruler in Israel:** He was born to be King—not to sit on Herod's throne, but to rule on the throne of the heart.

***

### Q5. Was this prediction fulfilled?
"Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king." Matt. 2:1.

**Answer:**
History confirms prophecy. Through the decree of Caesar Augustus (Luke 2:1–7), Joseph and Mary were brought from Nazareth to Bethlehem just in time for the birth.

*   **God's Providence:** Even the movements of pagan emperors are under God's control to ensure His word is accomplished.
*   **The Bread of Life:** "Bethlehem" means "House of Bread." It was fitting that Jesus, the "Bread of Life" (John 6:35), should be born there.

***

### Q6. How was His advent to be heralded?
"The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God." Isa. 40:3.

**Answer:**
Before the King arrives, the road must be prepared. This prophecy outlines the work of preparation required in the human heart to receive Christ.

*   **The Wilderness:** The world—and the unregenerate heart—is a spiritual wilderness, dry and fruitless until watered by God's grace.
*   **Making Straight the Way:** Isaiah 40:4 explains this: "Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low."
    *   *Mountains made low:* Pride and self-righteousness must be leveled.
    *   *Valleys exalted:* Despair and hopelessness must be lifted by faith in God's love.
*   **Repentance:** This preparation is the work of true repentance. We cannot have Christ's righteousness while we hold onto our own pride or cherished sins. The "highway" is the path of obedience and surrender.

**[ILL]**
Before a modern highway is paved, engineers must blast through rock and fill in deep ravines to create a level surface. If they pave over the bumps and holes, the road will fail. Similarly, we cannot just add Jesus to a life full of the "rocks" of pride or the "holes" of cherished sin. The ground of the heart must be broken up by repentance (Jeremiah 4:3) so the King can travel smoothly into our lives.

***

### Q7. By whom was this fulfilled?
"And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?" "He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias." John 1:19, 23.

**Answer:**
John the Baptist fulfilled this role in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17).

*   **A Voice, Not an Echo:** John spoke with direct authority from God, calling for practical holiness. "Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance" (Matthew 3:8).
*   **Pointing to the Lamb:** John’s ministry was not to gather a following for himself but to point to the Sanctuary service's fulfillment: "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29).
*   **The Lesson for Us:** Like John, God's people in the last days are to prepare the way for Christ's *second* coming by proclaiming the message of repentance and the cleansing of the soul temple.

***

### Q8. Under what striking emblem was He prophesied of by Balaam?
"There shall come a Star out of Jacob and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel." Num. 24:17.

**Answer:**
Even a reluctant prophet like Balaam was constrained by the Holy Spirit to speak the truth.

*   **The Star:** Represents light, guidance, and glory. Christ is the light that shines in the darkness of this world (John 1:5).
*   **The Scepter:** Represents kingly authority and rule. Christ has the right to rule over the nations and over the individual life.
*   **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the Holy Place, the candlestick provided light. Christ is the true Light that illuminates our path to the Father.

***

### Q9. Is He designated under the same emblem in the New Testament?
"I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star." Rev. 22:16. See also 2 Peter 1:19. Rev. 2:28.

**Answer:**
Yes, Christ claims this title for Himself at the very end of the Bible.

*   **Root and Offspring:** As the "Root," He is David's Creator; as the "Offspring," He is David's descendant. This affirms He is both God and Man.
*   **The Morning Star:** The morning star appears in the darkest part of the night, just before the dawn. In the spiritual darkness of this world, Christ is the promise of the coming eternal day.
*   **Practical Application:** As we study the "sure word of prophecy" (2 Peter 1:19), Christ arises in our hearts. The darkness of doubt and sin is dispelled by the rising of the Sun of Righteousness.

### Q10. What was predicted of the little children in connection with the birth of Christ?
"A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not." Jer. 31:15.

**Answer:**
Jeremiah foresaw a time of great sorrow in Israel, originally relating to the captivity, but typologically pointing to the attempt by Satan to destroy the Messiah.

*   **The Great Controversy:** This prophecy unveils the intense conflict behind the scenes. Satan knew the "Seed of the woman" (Genesis 3:15) had come to crush his head, and he used the cruel ambition of a worldly king to try to kill the Child.
*   **Suffering of the Innocent:** Sin is ruthless. It causes the innocent to suffer. This event shows us the true character of the enemy we face—he is a murderer from the beginning (John 8:44).

***

### Q11. How were these words of the prophet verified?
"Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not." Matt. 2:16-18.

**Answer:**
Herod, fearing a rival to his throne, committed this atrocity.

*   **The Rage of the Enemy:** Whenever Christ is born in a heart (conversion), the enemy becomes wrathful. We should not be surprised by trials when we decide to follow Jesus.
*   **God's Protection:** While many innocents died—a tragedy that God weeps over—God preserved His Son because His hour had not yet come. Christ was preserved not to avoid death, but to die at the appointed time (Passover) as the true Sacrifice for the sins of the whole world.

***

### Q12. How was He to be received by His own people?
"He is despised and rejected of men; a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not." Isa. 53:3.

**Answer:**
This is one of the most poignant prophecies in Scripture. It predicts that the Messiah would not be the conquering political hero the Jews desired, but a suffering Servant.

*   **Despised and Rejected:** He was rejected because His pure life was a constant rebuke to their sins. He offered righteousness; they wanted power.
*   **Man of Sorrows:** Christ bore the weight of the world's woe. He grieved over the hardness of human hearts.
*   **Hiding our Faces:** By nature, the carnal heart turns away from the self-denial of the Cross. We prefer a religion of glory to a religion of sacrifice.

**[ILL]**
If a doctor comes to a patient with a painful, life-saving surgery, the patient might reject the doctor in fear or anger. The Jews rejected the Great Physician because He diagnosed their fatal disease (sin) and prescribed a cure (humility and faith) that their pride could not accept.

***

### Q13. Did this prophecy prove true?
"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not." John 1:10-11.

**Answer:**
Tragically, yes. The Creator walked among His creatures, and they did not recognize Him.

*   **The Blindness of Sin:** Sin darkens the mind so that it cannot value spiritual things. They saw a carpenter's son; they missed the Son of God.
*   **The Exception:** Verse 12 adds, "But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God." To receive Christ is to welcome Him as Lord and Savior, allowing Him to blot out our sins and rewrite the law in our hearts.

***

### Q14. What was predicted of His preaching?
"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound." Isa 61:1.

**Answer:**
This prophecy outlines the Messiah's mission statement.

*   **Anointed:** The word "Messiah" (Hebrew) and "Christ" (Greek) both mean "The Anointed One." In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest was anointed with oil (a symbol of the Spirit) for ministry. Jesus is our Anointed High Priest.
*   **Good Tidings (The Gospel):**
    1.  **To the Meek:** Only those who know they are spiritually poor can receive the riches of grace.
    2.  **Bind the Brokenhearted:** He heals the wounds caused by sin.
    3.  **Liberty to Captives:** He frees those enslaved by habits, addictions, and the condemnation of the law (Romans 8:1–2).

**Definition:**
*   **Gospel:** Literally "Good News." The news that God has provided a way for sinners to be forgiven (justified) and transformed (sanctified) through faith in Christ.

***

### Q15. In what way was this prediction verified?
"And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read... And He began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." Luke 4:16-21.

**Answer:**
Jesus publicly applied this prophecy to Himself at the beginning of His ministry.

*   **Sabbath Keeping:** It was Jesus' "custom" to be in the sanctuary on the Sabbath. As our Example, He showed that the Sabbath is a day for spiritual refreshing and instruction.
*   **Present Truth:** He declared, "This day is this scripture fulfilled." He is the Liberator *now*. He does not just promise freedom in heaven; He offers freedom from the power of sin today for all who will accept His anointing.

***

### Q16. What was said He would do when on trial?
"He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth." Isa. 53:7.

**Answer:**
This prophecy describes the perfect patience and submission of the Savior.

*   **The Lamb of God:** In the sanctuary service, the lamb did not struggle or fight against the priest. It yielded its life to make atonement. Christ, the Antitype, submitted voluntarily to the cross.
*   **Victory over Self:** Christ had the power to destroy His accusers with a word, yet He chose silence. This demonstrates that true power is found in self-control and trust in God's vindication (1 Peter 2:23).

***

### Q17. When accused by His enemies before Pilate, how did Christ receive their words?
"Then said Pilate unto Him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? And He answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marveled greatly." Matt. 27:13, 14.

**Answer:**
Christ's silence marveled the Roman governor, who was used to men begging for their lives or shouting angry defenses.

*   **Why Silence?**
    1.  His innocence was obvious; no defense was needed against lies.
    2.  He was standing in our place. We are guilty and have no defense before God's law. He took our guilt and stood silent so that we, who are guilty, might speak with boldness in the judgment, claiming His righteousness.

***

### Q18. How did the prophecy state that Christ's murderers would dispose of His garments?
"They part My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture." Ps. 22:18.

**Answer:**
A specific detail regarding the humiliation of the Messiah.

*   **Stripped of Dignity:** The soldiers took everything He had, even His clothes. He became poor that we might become rich (2 Corinthians 8:9).
*   **Imputed Righteousness:** While they gambled for His earthly seamless robe, Christ was providing a "Robe of Righteousness" (Isaiah 61:10) for every believer. He was stripped naked so that we might be clothed with His perfect character and not be found naked in the judgment (Revelation 3:18).

***

### Q19. Was this literally accomplished?
"And they crucified Him, and parted His garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted My garments among them, and upon My vesture did they cast lots." Matt. 27:35.

**Answer:**
Yes, to the letter. The Roman soldiers, who knew nothing of Hebrew prophecy, fulfilled it exactly while mocking Him. This proves the divine inspiration of Scripture.

***

### Q20. How was it said they would treat Him while on the cross?
"They gave Me also gall for My meat; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink." Ps. 69:21.

**Answer:**
This highlights the physical agony and thirst of the crucifixion.

*   **The Cup of Suffering:** In the garden, Jesus prayed, "Let this cup pass from me." On the cross, He drained the bitter cup of separation from God so that we might drink the water of life freely.

***

### Q21. What was offered Him, when in His dying agony?
"They gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when He had tasted thereof, He would not drink." Matt. 27:34.

**Answer:**
The mixture was a mild narcotic (painkiller) often given to those being crucified to dull the senses.

*   **Refusal to Drink:** Why did He refuse? He would not allow His mind to be clouded. He had to face death and the powers of darkness with a clear mind to complete the atonement. He conquered sin fully conscious of the cost.
*   **Temperance Lesson:** Even in His greatest agony, Christ refused anything that would numb His moral or mental faculties. This is a powerful lesson for us to keep our bodies and minds pure from intoxicating substances.

***

### Q22. Where was the grave of Christ to be made?
"And He made His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death." Isa. 53:9.

**Answer:**
This prophecy contains a seeming contradiction: How could He be with the wicked and the rich simultaneously?

*   **With the Wicked:** He was crucified between two thieves (wicked men), and the Romans intended to bury Him in a common criminal's grave.
*   **With the Rich:** God intervened. The text indicates He would be *with* a rich man in His death (burial).

***

### Q23. What was actually done with His body, after it was taken down from the cross?
"A rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph,... went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus... He wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in His own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock." Matt. 27:57-60.

**Answer:**
God overruled the plans of wicked men.

*   **Joseph of Arimathea:** A rich counselor and secret disciple stepped forward.
*   **The New Tomb:** Jesus was laid in a tomb where no man had ever lain. This prevented any claim that another body had come to life or influenced the resurrection.
*   **Sabbath Rest:** Jesus finished His work of redemption on Friday ("It is finished") and rested in the tomb over the Sabbath, just as He rested after Creation. He then rose on the first day to begin His work as our High Priest.

**Conclusion:**
These prophecies prove Jesus is the Messiah. But more than that, they reveal a Savior who loved us enough to suffer, die, and rise again to save us from sin. Faith in *this* Christ brings justification, sanctification, and the hope of eternal life.
