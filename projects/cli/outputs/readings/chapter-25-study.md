### Q1. What has man's redemption from sin cost?
"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John 3:16. (See also Heb. 5:7-9.)

**Answer:**
The cost of redemption was nothing less than the infinite life of the Lawgiver Himself. Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4), and the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). To redeem man—meaning to buy him back from the condemnation of the law—God could not simply set aside His law, for that would compromise His government and justice.

Instead, the Father gave His only begotten Son to pay the penalty that the broken law demanded.
1.  **The Infinite Sacrifice:** Christ did not merely lend His life; He poured it out. In Gethsemane and on the cross, He felt the crushing weight of the world’s sin, which caused the Father’s face to be hidden from Him (Matthew 27:46).
2.  **Redemption:** This term means "deliverance by payment of a price." We were "bought with a price" (1 Corinthians 6:20), not with silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18–19).
3.  **The Author of Salvation:** Hebrews 5:7–9 tells us that through His suffering, Christ "learned obedience" and became the "author of eternal salvation." He is now our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, able to save to the uttermost because He paid the uttermost price.

*   **Definition:** **Redemption** – The act of buying back a sinner from the slavery of sin and death through the payment of a ransom—the blood of Jesus.

[ILL] **Illustration:** Imagine a judge who has a son guilty of a capital crime. The judge cannot simply ignore the law, or he becomes corrupt. Instead, the judge pronounces the guilty verdict, steps down from the bench, removes his robes, and takes the punishment for his son. This satisfies the law while saving the son. This is a faint picture of what God did in Christ.

### Q2. How great was this love?
"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Rom. 5:7, 8 (Jer. 31:3).

**Answer:**
Human love is usually reactive—we love those who are lovable or who treat us well. God's love is proactive and unconditional.
1.  **While We Were Enemies:** Christ did not wait for humanity to improve or to ask for forgiveness before He died. He died for us while we were in open rebellion (Romans 5:10).
2.  **The Ground of Acceptance:** This proves that our acceptance with God is not based on our performance, but on His character. This is the foundation of **Justification by Faith**—God declares the ungodly righteous based on Christ's merits, not their own (Romans 4:5).
3.  **Everlasting Love:** Jeremiah 31:3 describes this love as "everlasting." It existed before the foundation of the world and draws the sinner to repentance with "lovingkindness."

*   **Definition:** **Justification** – The legal act where God declares a penitent sinner righteous. It is a change of standing before the law, credited solely because of what Jesus has done.

[ILL] **Illustration:** If a man sees a drowning enemy—someone who has cursed him and stolen from him—and jumps into the raging water to save him at the cost of his own life, that is the love of God. He saves us not because we are good, but because He is love.

### Q3. In return, what does God require of us?
"And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind." Luke 10:27. (Deut. 6:5).

**Answer:**
Because God has given all, He requires all. He does not accept a divided service (Matthew 6:24).
1.  **Total Surrender:** The commandment requires the intellect ("mind"), the affections ("heart"), the physical powers ("strength"), and the spiritual life ("soul"). Every faculty is to be consecrated to Him.
2.  **The Response of Faith:** This requirement is not a method to earn heaven, but the natural response of a heart touched by the infinite sacrifice of Christ. "We love Him, because He first loved us" (1 John 4:19).
3.  **Impossible for the Natural Man:** The carnal mind "is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be" (Romans 8:7). Therefore, this requirement implies the necessity of the New Covenant promise: "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). Only Christ living *in* us can love the Father perfectly through us.

[ILL] **Illustration:** In a marriage, a husband does not want his wife to be faithful to him 90% of the time, or to love him only when it is convenient. True love demands the whole heart. God is the husband of His people (Isaiah 54:5), and He asks for exclusive devotion.

---

### Q4. What is the love of God?
"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments." 1 John 5:3.

**Answer:**
The Bible defines love not merely as a feeling or an emotion, but as a principle of action.
1.  **Love is Obedience:** Jesus said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). Disobedience is the highest form of disrespect; therefore, one cannot claim to love God while willfully breaking His law.
2.  **Not a Burden:** The verse continues, "and His commandments are not grievous." When the law is written on the heart (Sanctification), obedience becomes a delight, just as it was for Jesus who said, "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart" (Psalm 40:8).
3.  **The Fruit of Faith:** Obedience is the fruit of salvation, not the root. We do not obey to *be* saved; we obey because we *are* saved by His grace.

*   **Definition:** **Sanctification** – The work of the Holy Spirit in the believer, imparting the life of Christ so that the character is changed and the law of God is lived out in daily actions.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A good tree produces good fruit naturally. You don't have to force an apple tree to make apples. If a person is "rooted" in Christ (the tree), they will naturally produce the "fruit" of obedience (apples).

### Q5. Does the Lord compel obedience?
"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Rev. 22:17 (Joshua 24:15).

**Answer:**
God's government is based on love, and love cannot be forced.
1.  **Free Will:** From the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem, God presents man with a choice. "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15).
2.  **Satan's Method vs. God's Method:** Satan uses force, coercion, and deception. God uses attraction, truth, and invitation. He knocks at the door of the heart (Revelation 3:20) but never breaks it down.
3.  **Whosoever Will:** The invitation is open to all, but it must be accepted voluntarily. The "water of life" is free, but one must choose to drink it.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A government can draft soldiers and force them to march, but it cannot force them to be patriots. A forced loyalty is no loyalty at all. God desires children who serve Him because they love Him, not robots programmed to obey.

### Q6. Why does He ask obedience?
"O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea." Isa. 48:18. (Isa. 1:19, 20) (John 15:10).

**Answer:**
God does not ask for obedience to stroke His ego, but for the well-being of His creatures.
1.  **The Law is Protection:** God's commandments are like a "hedge" of protection. Every command is a prohibition against something that would hurt us.
2.  **Peace and Righteousness:** Obedience brings "peace like a river"—steady, deep, and flowing. Disobedience brings unrest, guilt, and chaos ("There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked" - Isaiah 48:22).
3.  **Abiding in Love:** Jesus said, "If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love" (John 15:10). Obedience keeps us in the atmosphere where God's blessing can flow freely.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A parent tells a child, "Do not play in the street." Is the parent trying to restrict the child's fun? No, the parent is trying to preserve the child's life. The law of God is the wall that keeps us safe from the traffic of sin.

### Q7. What did God forbid those to do who assisted in removing the sanctuary from place to place?
"And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die." Num. 4:15.

**Answer:**
1.  **The Distinction Between Holy and Common:** In the earthly sanctuary, God taught the Israelites that He is holy. The vessels of the sanctuary represented Christ and His ministry; they were not to be treated as common luggage.
2.  **Strict Obedience:** The sons of Kohath were privileged to carry the furniture, but they were strictly forbidden to touch the holy objects directly. They had to respect the covering provided by the priests.
3.  **Lesson for Us:** We must not treat the things of God (His Word, His law, His house, His means) with irreverence or carelessness. God is to be had in reverence of all them that are about Him (Psalm 89:7).

[ILL] **Illustration:** High-voltage electricity lines are powerful and useful, but they must be handled according to strict protocols. Touching a live wire with a bare hand brings death, regardless of one's intentions. God's holiness is a consuming fire; we approach Him only through the covering of Christ.

### Q8. When David designed to remove the ark of the covenant from Gibeah to Jerusalem, how did he propose to do it?
"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it our of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart." 2 Sam. 6:3.

**Answer:**
David intended to do a good work—bringing the Ark of God back to the center of national life—but he attempted to do it in a way God had not commanded.
1.  **Copying the World:** The Philistines had previously sent the Ark back on a "new cart" (1 Samuel 6:7). David adopted the method of the pagans rather than the instruction of God's law, which required the Ark to be carried on the shoulders of the Levites (Numbers 7:9).
2.  **Good Intentions are Not Enough:** Zeal for God must be "according to knowledge" (Romans 10:2). We cannot improve God's work by using worldly methods or compromising His specific instructions.
3.  **Partial Obedience:** They were obeying the *desire* of God (to honor the Ark) but disobeying the *method* of God.

[ILL] **Illustration:** If a doctor prescribes a specific medicine to cure a disease, but the patient decides to drink poison because it "looks better" or is "easier to get," the patient will die. The sincerity of the patient does not change the chemical result. We must follow God's prescription exactly.

### Q9. What was one of these men next emboldened to do?
"And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it." 2 Sam 6:6.

**Answer:**
1.  **The Result of the First Error:** Because they used a cart (disobedience), the oxen stumbled. One wrong step often necessitates another.
2.  **Presumption:** Uzzah reached out to steady the Ark. He likely thought he was helping God. He presumed that his hand was less sinful than the dirt of the threshing floor.
3.  **Familiarity:** Uzzah had grown up with the Ark in his father’s house (Abinadab). He had likely lost his sense of awe and reverence for the presence of the Infinite God.

*   **Definition:** **Presumption** – Claiming the promises or protection of God while willfully neglecting His commandments; counterfeit faith.

---

### Q10. How did the Lord regard this act?
"And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God." 2 Sam. 6:7.

**Answer:**
This seems harsh to human reasoning, but it teaches a vital lesson about the holiness of God.
1.  **God Means What He Says:** God had said, "They shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die" (Numbers 4:15). If God failed to execute this sentence, His word would be proven unreliable.
2.  **Checking Sin:** Had this open violation passed unpunished, irreverence would have swept through Israel. God judged one man physically to save the nation spiritually.
3.  **The Atonement:** The Ark represented God's throne (Mercy Seat) and His government (Law). A sinner cannot approach God's law without the Mediator. Uzzah approached without the covering; the law demands the death of the sinner.

[ILL] **Illustration:** Gravity is a law. A man who jumps off a cliff may be a very kind man with good intentions, but the law of gravity will still pull him down. Spiritual laws are just as real. We cannot violate God's command and expect to escape the result.

### Q11. What did Samuel say Saul had done in disobeying a plain command given him?
"And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel." 1 Sam. 15:26.

**Answer:**
Saul claimed he had obeyed God ("I have performed the commandment of the Lord," v. 13), but he had only obeyed partially.
1.  **Partial Obedience is Disobedience:** Saul kept the best sheep for sacrifice, contrary to God's command to destroy everything. He thought he could negotiate with God's requirements.
2.  **Rejection of the Word:** Samuel equated disobedience with "rejection of the Word." To reject the Bible's instruction is to reject the God of the Bible.
3.  **The Consequence:** Because Saul rejected God's rule over his heart, he lost God's rule over the kingdom. "To obey is better than sacrifice" (1 Samuel 15:22).

[ILL] **Illustration:** If an employee follows 9 out of 10 instructions from the boss, but willfully ignores the most critical one because he thinks he knows better, he is insubordinate. God seeks humble hearts that tremble at His word (Isaiah 66:2).

### Q12. When the angels had put Lot and his family out of the doomed city of Sodom, what admonition did they give them?
"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed." Gen.19:17.

**Answer:**
This command is a type of the gospel call to leave the world (Egypt/Sodom) and find refuge in Christ (the Mountain).
1.  **Urgency:** "Escape for thy life." Salvation is a life-or-death matter. There is no time for delay.
2.  **Total Separation:** "Look not behind thee." One cannot be saved while longing for the sins they are leaving behind.
3.  **Do Not Linger:** "Neither stay thou in all the plain." Many Christians leave "Sodom" (open sin) but linger in the "plain" (borderline compromise). We must go all the way to the high ground of holiness.

[ILL] **Illustration:** When a building is on fire, you run. You don't stop to pack your bags or look at the pictures on the wall. You run to safety. Sin is that fire.

### Q13. When Lot's wife looked back, what became of her?
"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt." Gen. 19:26.

**Answer:**
1.  **A Divided Heart:** Lot's wife was out of Sodom, but Sodom was not out of her. Her feet were moving toward safety, but her heart was attached to the world she was leaving.
2.  **Instant Judgment:** She became a monument ("pillar") to the danger of half-heartedness. "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways" (James 1:8).
3.  **Proximity is Not Salvation:** She was the wife of a righteous man, holding the hand of angels, yet she was lost. Being close to truth does not save; only a surrendered heart saves.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A ship can be very close to the harbor and still sink. Being "almost saved" is to be wholly lost.

---

### Q14. In referring to this, what warning does our Saviour give to all?
"Remember Lot's wife." Luke 17:32.

**Answer:**
Jesus uses this three-word sermon in the context of the Second Coming.
1.  **The Danger of Attachment:** In the final days, God’s people must be detached from the world. If our treasure is on earth, our hearts will be there too (Matthew 6:21).
2.  **Don't Look Back:** Jesus says, "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:62).
3.  **Victory through Faith:** To avoid the fate of Lot's wife, we must have the faith of Abraham—faith that seeks a "city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10).

### Q15. When evidently citing these cases, what solemn question does the apostle ask?
"For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?" Heb. 2:2, 3.

**Answer:**
1.  **Greater Light = Greater Responsibility:** If God punished violations of the ceremonial law and specific commands in the Old Testament ("word spoken by angels"), how much more serious is it to reject the Son of God?
2.  **Neglect:** Notice it does not say "if we *reject*," but "if we *neglect*." One does not have to actively fight against God to be lost; one simply has to drift (Hebrews 2:1).
3.  **No Escape:** There is no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12). If we ignore the remedy of the Gospel, the disease of sin remains fatal.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A man who has swallowed poison doesn't need to drink more poison to die; he just needs to *neglect* the antidote.

---

### Q16. What does He say in another place of those who persist in willful sins?
"For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins." Heb. 10:26.

**Answer:**
This is one of the most solemn warnings in Scripture regarding the **Investigative Judgment** and the close of probation.
1.  **Willful Sin:** This is not referring to a stumble or a weakness of the flesh (for which we have an Advocate, 1 John 2:1). It refers to a deliberate, persistent, high-handed rejection of the Spirit's conviction. It is saying, "I know this is God's will, but I choose not to do it."
2.  **No More Sacrifice:** The sacrifices of the Old Testament pointed to Christ. If a man rejects Christ's power to cleanse him from sin, there is no Plan B. God has nothing else to offer.
3.  **The End of Grace:** Just as the door of the Ark closed in Noah's day, there comes a point where the character is fixed. If we hold onto sin, we cannot hold onto the Savior.

*   **Definition:** **Willful Sin** – A settled determination to continue in a path of disobedience despite knowing the truth.

[ILL] **Illustration:** If a patient tears off his bandages and refuses the surgeon's help, the surgeon can do nothing more. It is not that the doctor lacks skill, but that the patient has rejected the only cure.

### Q17. How does the Saviour regard the worship of those who allow a tradition to take the place of one of God's commandments?
"But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." Matt. 15:9.

**Answer:**
1.  **Vain Worship:** Worship is "worth-ship"—ascribing worth to God. But if we place human authority above God's authority, we are actually worshiping ourselves or the creature. Jesus calls this "vain" (useless/empty).
2.  **Tradition vs. Commandment:** In the Great Controversy, the central issue is authority. God says, "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8). Tradition says, "Keep the first day." To follow tradition over the plain command of Scripture is to repeat the sin of Saul and the error of the Pharisees.
3.  **True Discipleship:** A true disciple follows the Lamb whithersoever He goeth (Revelation 14:4). This means submitting every tradition, every habit, and every opinion to the test of the Law and the Testimony (Isaiah 8:20).

[ILL] **Illustration:** If you buy a counterfeit watch, it may look like the real thing, tick like the real thing, and even have the logo. But if you take it to the master watchmaker, he will reject it because it did not come from his workshop. Man-made doctrines are counterfeit religion; they will not stand in the judgment.
