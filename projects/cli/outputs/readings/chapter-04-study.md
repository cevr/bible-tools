### Q1. How powerful is the Word of God when brought into contact with one's life?

**Scripture:**
"For the word of God is quick [literally, "living"], and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." Hebrews 4:12.

**Answer:**
The Word of God is not merely ink on paper; it is a living agent of divine power. When this Word enters the mind and heart, it performs a necessary and miraculous work in the plan of salvation.

1.  **It is "Quick" (Living):** The Bible does not just contain history; it contains life. When received by faith, the Word imparts the very life of Christ to the believer (John 6:63). It is the seed of the new birth (1 Peter 1:23).
2.  **It is a Sword of Conviction:** Before the High Priest can heal us, the "sword" of the Spirit must cut away our self-deception. This connects to the **Sanctuary** service: just as the sacrifice had to be slain before the blood could be ministered for atonement, the "old man" of sin must be slain by the convicting power of the Word (Romans 6:6; Romans 7:7).
3.  **It Discerns the Heart:** We often do not know our own motives. The Word acts as a mirror and a judge, revealing the secret sins and selfishness we hide (Jeremiah 17:9–10). This discernment is essential for **Sanctification**—the process of being made holy—because we cannot overcome sins we do not acknowledge.

*   **Definition—Sanctification:** The work of God’s free grace, whereby we are renewed in the whole man after the image of God, and are enabled more and more to die unto sin and live unto righteousness (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 2:13).

**[ILL]**
Imagine a surgeon who must remove a deep-seated tumor to save a patient's life. The scalpel must be sharp to cut accurately between healthy tissue and diseased tissue. If the knife is dull, it causes damage without healing. The Word of God is that sharp scalpel. It hurts to have our pride and cherished sins cut away, but it is the "wound of a friend" (Proverbs 27:6) that leads to healing and life.

### Q2. What was Peter constrained to say about Christ's words?

**Scripture:**
"Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life." John 6:68.

**Answer:**
Peter recognized that life is found nowhere else but in Christ. The world offers philosophy, entertainment, and legalism, but none contain the power to regenerate the soul.

1.  **The Source of Life:** Eternal life is not an inherent property of man; it is a gift found only in the Son (1 John 5:11–12).
2.  **Total Dependence:** Peter’s question, "To whom shall we go?" reflects the heart of the converted believer. We do not look to ourselves, to earthly priests, or to political powers for salvation. We look to the **High Priest** in the heavenly sanctuary, Jesus Christ (Hebrews 8:1–2).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot generate righteousness by our own works. We must go to Him who "has the words," receiving His promises by faith. When we believe His word, that word accomplishes what it says (Isaiah 55:11).

**[ILL]**
A diver deep underwater relies entirely on the air line connected to the surface. If he disconnects to find air elsewhere, he dies. Similarly, the Christian is connected to heaven by the Word of Christ. To turn away from His words to human traditions or self-help is to cut the air line.

***

### Q3. What did Jesus declare regarding His Father's commandment?

**Scripture:**
"And I know that His commandment is life everlasting." John 12:50.

**Answer:**
Here is a profound truth often misunderstood: The Law and the Gospel are perfectly united.

1.  **The Law is Life:** The Ten Commandments are a transcript of God’s character of love. In a sinless universe, the law is the pathway of life. God never gave the law to be a burden, but to protect life (Romans 7:12).
2.  **Harmony with the Gospel:** Satan portrays God's law as a restriction on liberty. Jesus declares it "life everlasting." The Gospel does not abolish the commandment; rather, the Gospel restores the power to *keep* the commandment through the indwelling Spirit (Romans 8:3–4).
3.  **The New Covenant Promise:** God promises to write these very commandments on our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). When the law is internal—part of our nature through the new birth—obedience becomes a delight, not a drudgery (Psalm 40:8).

*   **Definition—The Law of God:** The moral standard of righteousness, summarized in the Ten Commandments, revealing God’s character and exposing man’s sin (Exodus 20; Romans 3:20; 7:7).

**[ILL]**
Think of a train. The tracks are the "commandments" that direct its path. Are the tracks a restriction to the train? No, they are the condition of its freedom and speed. If the train jumps the tracks to be "free," it results in a wreck and ruin. So it is with God's law; it is the track upon which the life of the believer runs smoothly to eternity.

### Q4. What great truth did God wish to teach us, when He gave the daily manna to feed the children of Israel?

**Scripture:**
"And He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that He might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live." Deuteronomy 8:3.

**Answer:**
The physical manna in the wilderness was a **type** (symbol) of spiritual reality.

1.  **Dependence on the Word:** Just as the Israelites would physically perish without the daily manna, our souls wither without the daily intake of God's Word.
2.  **"Every Word":** We are not to pick and choose which commandments or promises we like. A complete Christian character requires submission to *every* word God has spoken.
3.  **Humility and Faith:** God allowed them to hunger so they would realize their helplessness. This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**: realizing we have no spiritual food in ourselves, and looking entirely to God to supply our need (Matthew 5:6).

**[ILL]**
A prescription medicine often comes with a specific dosage. If a patient decides to take only half the ingredients, or take it only once a month instead of daily, the cure will not work. We cannot expect spiritual victory if we neglect the daily "dosage" of God’s instruction and promises.

***

### Q5. What happens when we feed upon the true, heavenly manna?

**Scripture:**
"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, O Lord God of hosts." Jeremiah 15:16.

**Answer:**
Feeding on the Word produces a change in the affections and identity of the believer.

1.  **Internalization ("I did eat them"):** Reading the Bible is not enough; we must "eat" it—meditate on it until it becomes a part of us. Just as food is assimilated into our bloodstream to build tissue, the Word must be assimilated to build character.
2.  **Joy and Rejoicing:** The world seeks happiness in excitement and possession. The Christian finds deep, abiding joy in the promises of God (Psalm 119:103).
3.  **Identity ("Called by Thy Name"):** When we partake of Christ (the Word), we take His name. We belong to Him. This is **Justification**—being covered by His name and His merit, so that when the Father looks at us, He sees the Son.

*   **Definition—Justification:** The legal act where God declares a penitent sinner righteous, pardoning their sins and imputing Christ’s righteousness to their account (Romans 3:24; 4:5).

**[ILL]**
If a person is starving, looking at a picture of a banquet will not help. Reading a menu will not help. They must take the food into their mouth and swallow it. So it is with the Bible; having a Bible on the shelf does not feed the soul. We must open it and "digest" its meaning by faith.

***

### Q6. What reference did Jesus make to this same life-giving manna?

**Scripture:**
"But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." Matthew 4:4.

**Answer:**
Jesus quoted Deuteronomy 8:3 during His temptation in the wilderness. This is vital for our understanding of how to overcome sin.

1.  **The Weapon of Victory:** Jesus overcame Satan not by using His divine power (which was laid aside), but by using the Word of God. He met the tempter with "It is written."
2.  **Example for Humanity:** Jesus showed that a man, filled with the Holy Spirit and relying on God's Word, can resist temptation. He condemns sin in the flesh by showing that obedience is possible through faith (Romans 8:3).
3.  **Priority of the Spiritual:** Satan tempted Jesus to satisfy physical hunger at the expense of God's will. Jesus declared that spiritual obedience is more necessary than physical life itself.

**[ILL]**
A soldier in battle does not invent a new weapon on the spot; he uses the sword he has been trained with. When temptation strikes—whether to pride, appetite, or anger—we must instantly wield the specific "It is written" that applies to that situation.

***

### Q7. How did God's will for Christ's life become His food?

**Scripture:**
"Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to finish His work." John 4:34.

**Answer:**
For Jesus, obedience was not a draining duty, but a nourishing source of strength.

1.  **Obedience as Sustenance:** Doing God's will refreshes the spirit. There is a supernatural strength that comes to the believer who steps out in faith to obey God (Isaiah 40:31).
2.  **Finishing the Work:** Christ was focused on the Atonement. His "meat" was to live a perfect life and offer a perfect sacrifice for us.
3.  **Our Experience:** When we align our will with God's will, we find "rest unto our souls" (Matthew 11:29). The struggle ceases when the surrender is complete.

**[ILL]**
Watch a musician who loves their art. They may practice for hours, yet they are energized, not exhausted, because they are doing what they love. When the law of God is written in the heart (Hebrews 8:10), doing His will becomes our "meat"—our passion and energy.

***

### Q8. What name is given to Jesus, since He was the Revealer of God's thought to mankind?

**Scripture:**
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God." John 1:1. "And He was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and His name is called The Word of God." Revelation 19:13.

**Answer:**
Jesus is the Living Word (Logos), the perfect expression of the Father’s mind.

1.  **The Medium of Communication:** A "word" is a thought made audible or visible. God's thoughts are hidden until revealed by Christ. If you want to know what God is like, look at Jesus (John 14:9).
2.  **The Creator:** "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made" (Psalm 33:6). Jesus is the active agent in Creation.
3.  **The Victor:** In Revelation 19, He is the "Word of God" who judges and makes war against sin. This points to the final resolution of the **Great Controversy**, where the Word triumphs over the rebellion of Satan.

**[ILL]**
If you have a thought in your mind, no one knows it. But if you speak, your thought takes flight and enters another person's mind. Jesus is God "speaking" Himself to humanity, so that we can know His heart.

***

### Q9. What did this Word become?

**Scripture:**
"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." John 1:14.

**Answer:**
This is the mystery of the **Incarnation**—God becoming man.

1.  **Tabernacling Among Us:** The Greek word for "dwelt" implies "pitched His tent." This is a direct **Sanctuary** reference. Christ is the true Tabernacle where God meets with man (Hebrews 9:11).
2.  **Partaking of Flesh:** To be our Saviour, He had to partake of the same flesh and blood that we have (Hebrews 2:14). He took upon Himself our fallen nature but without sinning, bridging the gap between a holy God and sinful humanity.
3.  **Jacob's Ladder:** By becoming flesh, Christ let down the ladder from heaven to earth. He is the only way we can climb out of the pit of sin (Genesis 28:12; John 1:51).

*   **Definition—Incarnation:** The act of the Son of God assuming human nature, becoming fully man while remaining fully God (Philippians 2:5–8).

**[ILL]**
A king who stays in his castle may issue laws, but he cannot fully understand the suffering of his peasant subjects. But if the king takes off his robes, puts on peasant clothes, lives in their huts, and eats their food, he understands them. Jesus did more than this; He became one of us to save us.

***

### Q10. What was in this Word that we so much need?

**Scripture:**
"In Him was life; and the life was the light of men." John 1:4.

**Answer:**
The desperate need of the human race is life, for we are "dead in trespasses and sins" (Ephesians 2:1).

1.  **Original Life:** "In Christ is life, original, unborrowed, underived" (*Desire of Ages*, p. 530). He has the power to resurrect the spiritually dead.
2.  **Life as Light:** This life brings moral clarity. It exposes the darkness of sin and reveals the path of righteousness.
3.  **Imparted Righteousness:** We do not just need a legal pardon (justification); we need a new principle of life (sanctification/regeneration). This life comes only from being in Christ, as the branch is in the vine (John 15:5).

**[ILL]**
A flashlight with dead batteries is useless, no matter how perfect the bulb is. The human soul is like that flashlight. We may have the form of religion, but without the "batteries"—the life of Christ within—we give no light to the world.

***

### Q11. What is Jesus therefore also called?

**Scripture:**
"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life." 1 John 1:1.

**Answer:**
He is called the "Word of Life."

1.  **Tangible Reality:** John emphasizes that this Word is not a ghost or a myth. They "handled" Him. Our faith is based on historical reality.
2.  **Experiential Faith:** Just as the disciples touched Jesus physically, we must "touch" Him spiritually by faith. The woman with the issue of blood touched only the hem of His garment, but her faith drew power from Him (Mark 5:27–34).
3.  **Resurrection Power:** Because He is the Word of Life, He could lay down His life and take it up again. This guarantees our resurrection if we sleep in Him (1 Thessalonians 4:14).

***

### Q12. What did Jesus declare Himself to be?

**Scripture:**
"And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst." John 6:35.

**Answer:**
1.  **Satisfaction:** The world offers "bread" that does not satisfy (Isaiah 55:2)—wealth, fame, pleasure. Only Christ fills the void in the human heart.
2.  **Sanctuary Type:** In the Holy Place of the earthly sanctuary, there was the **Table of Shewbread** (Leviticus 24:5–9). It was always fresh, always present before God. Jesus is the true Shewbread, the "Bread of the Presence," sustaining His people daily.
3.  **Invitation:** The condition is simple: "Come" and "Believe." Righteousness is not achieved by climbing a mountain of works, but by coming to a Person.

**[ILL]**
A man trying to quench his thirst by drinking salt water only becomes thirstier. Sin is salt water. Jesus is the fresh, living spring. Once the soul drinks of Him, the craving for the world's "salt water" dies away.

***

### Q13. What did He say would be given to those that partook of this God-given bread?

**Scripture:**
"As the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father: so He that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me. This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever." John 6:57, 58.

**Answer:**
1.  **Union with God:** Jesus reveals the secret of His own earthly life: He lived by total dependence on the Father. Now, He invites us to live by total dependence on Him.
2.  **Immortality:** The manna in the desert sustained physical life for a time, but those men eventually died. The spiritual bread (Christ) imparts eternal life.
3.  **The Method:** We "eat" Him by receiving His words and His Spirit. This assimilation changes our character. As we behold Him and feed on His truth, we are changed into His image (2 Corinthians 3:18).

*   **Definition—Atonement:** Literally "At-one-ment." The condition of being at one with God. Through eating the Bread of Life, the believer becomes one with Christ, as Christ is one with the Father (John 17:21–23).

***

### Q14. What did Jesus really mean when He said that we should eat His flesh?

**Scripture:**
"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." John 6:63.

**Answer:**
Jesus clarifies that He is not speaking of literal cannibalism or a sacramental ritual alone, but of a spiritual reality.

1.  **Word = Spirit = Life:** The life of Christ is contained in His teachings and promises. When we believe a promise of God, the Holy Spirit conveys the power of that promise into our lives.
2.  **The "Flesh Profiteth Nothing":** Outward rituals, human works, and legalistic striving cannot produce righteousness. "All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6). Only the Spirit-filled Word can quicken (make alive) the dead soul.
3.  **Receiving the Character:** As the note in the lesson says, "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character of God." This is **Imparted Righteousness**—God's character becoming our character through the agency of the Word.

**[ILL]**
Consider a seed. It looks like a dry, dead pebble. But inside that seed is a germ of life that contains the DNA of the entire plant. The Word of God is like that seed (Luke 8:11). When planted in the soil of the heart, it releases the life of Christ, producing the "fruit of the Spirit" (Galatians 5:22–23).

***

### Q15. What is it that God will let us taste right now?

**Scripture:**
"And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come." Hebrews 6:5. (See Jeremiah 15:16.)

**Answer:**
Eternal life does not begin only when we die; it begins now.

1.  **Tasting the Future:** We can experience the peace, victory, and holiness of heaven while still on earth. This is the "power of the world to come."
2.  **Preparation for Translation:** Those who live to see Christ return (the 144,000) must have the character of Christ fully reproduced in them. They must taste the victory over sin *now* to stand in that day (Revelation 14:1–5).
3.  **The Good Word:** God's promises are "good." They are reliable. We taste them by claiming them in the midst of trial and finding them true.

**[ILL]**
Before a wedding banquet, the cooks may taste the food to ensure it is perfect. In the Christian life, the Holy Spirit gives us a "foretaste" or a "down payment" (Ephesians 1:14) of the heavenly inheritance. We get a sample of heaven's peace in our hearts today.

***

### Q16. Tasting it, what do we learn?

**Scripture:**
"O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in Him." Psalm 34:8.

**Answer:**
1.  **Experience over Theory:** One cannot know the taste of a fruit by looking at a painting of it. You must bite into it. Similarly, skeptics may argue about religion, but the believer *knows* God is good because they have experienced His delivering power.
2.  **Trust brings Blessing:** The "blessed" (happy) man is the one who trusts—not in his own strength, but in God. This is the foundation of the **Third Angel's Message**—the patience of the saints and the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12).
3.  **God's Character:** The ultimate discovery is that God is *good*. Satan has maligned God's character since Eden, portraying Him as severe or arbitrary. The Word reveals God as "merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (Exodus 34:6).

***

### Q17. Does God want us to ask for this Bread daily?

**Scripture:**
"Give us this day our daily bread." Matthew 6:11.

**Answer:**
Yes, in the Lord's Prayer, Jesus teaches us the necessity of daily renewal.

1.  **Physical and Spiritual:** While this petition covers our physical needs, in the context of this study, it primarily points to the "Bread of Life." We need fresh grace every morning.
2.  **No Stored Manna:** In the wilderness, if the Israelites tried to hoard manna for the next day, it bred worms and stank (Exodus 16:20). We cannot live today on yesterday's religious experience. We need a fresh conversion, a fresh look at the Cross, and a fresh infilling of the Spirit every day.
3.  **Constant Dependence:** This prayer keeps us in a state of humble dependence, which is the safest place for a Christian to be. It kills pride and fosters faith.

**[ILL]**
We breathe constantly. We do not take a deep breath on Sunday and hope it lasts until Wednesday. We must breathe moment by moment. Prayer and the Word are the breath of the soul. To stop is to faint and die.

***

**NOTE:**
When "the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us," the thought of God was revealed in human flesh. When holy men of God "spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost," the thought of God was revealed in human language. The union of the Divine and the human in the manifestation of God's thought in the flesh is the mystery of godliness and is the same mystery in the union of the Divine thought and human language. The two revelations of God, in human flesh and in human speech, are both called the Word of God, and both are the Word of life. He who fails to find Christ thus in the Scriptures will not be able to feed upon the Word as the life-giving Word.
