## Slide 1 – Q1: The Scope of the Commandment

- **Question:** How much is included in the seventh commandment?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 5:27, 28 – “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Law and Heart)

- **Magnifying the Law:**
  - Christ acts as the great Lawgiver (Isaiah 42:21).
  - He dispels the idea that God’s law regulates only outward actions.
- **The Spirituality of the Law:**
  - The commandment extends beyond physical acts to the “secret chambers of the soul.”
  - It judges motives, desires, and the imagination.
- **The Seat of Sin:**
  - The heart is the true battleground.
  - Cherishing the desire to sin makes one guilty, even if the physical act does not occur.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (The New Covenant)

- **The Need for a New Heart:**
  - A heart that naturally produces lust cannot simply “try harder” to be pure.
  - We need the New Covenant promise: “I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts” (Hebrews 8:10).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - **Justification:** Forgives past acts and sinful thoughts.
  - **Sanctification:** Changes the heart so it no longer loves impurity.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Garden of Weeds:**
  - A man may mow the tops of weeds in his garden (outward behavior modification).
  - The garden looks clean for a day, but the roots remain, and weeds return.
- **The Root of Lust:**
  - The seventh commandment demands digging out the root.
  - Only the Holy Spirit can pull the root of lust from the soil of the heart.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Behaviors to Omit

- **Question:** What are the people of God exhorted to omit?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 5:3, 4 – “But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Specific Sins)

- **Fornication (*Porneia*):**
  - Covers all illicit sexual activity outside the marriage covenant.
- **All Uncleanness:**
  - Moral impurity in thought, word, or action that defiles the temple of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19).
- **Covetousness:**
  - Paul links impurity with idolatry—a greedy desire to possess what God has not given.
- **Foolish Talking and Jesting:**
  - Coarse humor or levity that lowers Christian dignity.
  - Speech should minister grace, not cheapen the soul.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Application (Sanctification)

- **"Not Once Named":**
  - The standard is absolute purity.
  - These topics should not be casual conversation or entertainment for God’s remnant.
- **Defining Sanctification:**
  - The process of being made holy.
  - Separation from the world’s low standards.
  - Dedication to God’s high standard of purity.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Nature of Impurity

- **Question:** What does the apostle class this inclination?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:19 – “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Two Natures)

- **The Conflict:**
  - **The Flesh:** Our fallen nature inherited from Adam; gravitates toward self-indulgence.
  - **The Spirit:** The new nature imparted by Christ; gravitates toward holiness (Romans 8:7).
- **Manifest Works:**
  - These sins are visible fruit proving the self-life is still on the throne.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot overcome the “flesh” by the energy of the flesh (willpower alone).
  - Victory comes by being “crucified with Christ” (Galatians 2:20) and letting His Spirit live through us.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Stone and Gravity:**
  - A heavy stone naturally falls due to gravity.
  - You can hold it up by hand (human effort), but your arm will tire, and it will fall.
  - If placed on a strong table, it stays up without effort.
- **Resting on Christ:**
  - The "table" is Christ.
  - Resting on Him by faith breaks the law of gravity (sin) with the law of the Spirit of life.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Consequence of Impurity

- **Question:** Of what will those who are guilty in this direction be deprived?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 5:21 – “I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (The Kingdom)

- **A Solemn Warning:**
  - Those who *practice* these sins (without repentance) are excluded from heaven.
- **Character of the Kingdom:**
  - The New Jerusalem allows nothing that defiles (Revelation 21:27).
  - Someone who loves filthiness would be miserable in the pure atmosphere of heaven.
- **Self-Examination:**
  - A profession of faith that does not lead to departing from iniquity is false.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Application (Sanctuary Cleansing)

- **The Necessity of Cleansing:**
  - Because no impurity can inherit the kingdom, we need the work of our High Priest.
  - He must blot out not only the *record* of sins in the heavenly sanctuary but the *love* of sin in our hearts.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Church Discipline

- **Question:** If one professing godliness is known to be impure, what is our duty regarding Him?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 5:11 – “But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Separation)

- **"Called a Brother":**
  - Applies to those within the church who profess Christ but live in open rebellion.
- **Not to Keep Company:**
  - We must not treat such a person with intimate fellowship.
  - Why?
    - It condones sin.
    - It deceives them into thinking they are safe.
    - It leavens the church with their influence (1 Corinthians 5:6).
- **Purpose of Discipline:**
  - Not cruelty, but restoration.
  - The goal is that the sinner realizes their condition and repents (1 Corinthians 5:5).

## Slide 16 – Q6: Evil Communications

- **The Law of Assimilation:**
  - By beholding, we become changed (2 Corinthians 3:18).
  - It is impossible to surround oneself with impurity and remain pure in heart.
- **"Be Not Deceived":**
  - Many believe they are strong enough to handle bad influences.
  - Even strong morals erode under the constant dripping of impure suggestions.
- **Practical Application:**
  - "Communications" includes books, music, and media.
  - If they glorify lust, they corrupt the Christian’s "good manners."

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Rotten Apple:**
  - If you place one rotten apple in a basket of fresh apples, the healthy ones do not heal the rotten one.
  - The rot spreads to the healthy ones.
  - Social impurity spreads by contagion.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Sowing and Reaping

- **Question:** When a person allows corrupt thoughts to be sown in his heart, what may he expect to reap?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:7, 8 – “Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (The Law of Harvest)

- **Thoughts are Seeds:**

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Standard of Judgment)

- **God Judges Intent:**
  - A "foolish" (wicked) thought is registered as sin in heaven's books.
- **Need for Atonement:**
  - If thoughts are sin, we are lost without a Savior.
  - We need Christ’s blood to cover the sins of the mind, not just the hands.
- **Call to Vigilance:**
  - An idle mind is the devil's workshop.
  - We must maintain a constant watch over our thoughts.

## Slide 24 – Q9: Conditions for Acceptance

- **Question:** On what condition does God accept the sinner?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 55:7 – “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.”
