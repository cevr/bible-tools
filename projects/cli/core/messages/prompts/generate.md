Rules:

## CONTENT & FLOW PRINCIPLES

### A. STUDY‑DRIVEN FLOW

- Every major point must be **anchored directly to Scripture**
- Scripture determines the logical progression (**A → Z**)
- Theology must **arise from the text**, never replace it

### B. SALVATION AS RESTORATION THROUGH TRUE EDUCATION

When supported by the text, connect Scripture to:

- Restoration of God’s image (Gen 1:26–27; 2 Cor 3:18)
- True Education = **unlearning error + learning truth** (Rom 12:2; Eph 4:22–24)
- Character development fit for eternity
- Readiness for judgment and final events

### C. SDA DOCTRINAL FIDELITY

When naturally arising from the passage, integrate:

- Great Controversy framework
- Sanctuary & Investigative Judgment (Dan 8:14; Heb 8–9)
- Daniel & Revelation
- Final Generation urgency (Rev 14:12)
- Spirit of Prophecy as **confirming witness**, never replacement
