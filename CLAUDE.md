## Effect Best Practices

**Before implementing Effect features**, run `effect-solutions list` and read
the relevant guide.

Topics include: services and layers, data modeling, error handling,
configuration, testing, HTTP clients, CLIs, observability, and project
structure.

**Effect Source Reference:** Use the `repo-explorer` skill to explore the Effect
repository for real implementations when docs aren't enough.

## Architecture

The project uses Effect's dependency injection pattern:

- **Services** defined with `Context.Tag` in `@bible/core`
- **Adapters** provide platform-specific implementations
- CLI provides `FileSystemStorageLayer` and `AppleNotesExportLayer`
- Web can provide its own adapter implementations
