## Introduction — The Journey's End Demands a Decision (5 min)

- Series recap in one sentence each:
  - Part 1: Sanctuary = God dwelling with man (Exodus 25:8)
  - Part 2: Christ IS the sanctuary fulfilled (John 2:19–21)
  - Part 3: Paganism counterfeited every truth (Dan 8:11–12)
  - Part 4: Prophecy exposed the counterfeit, 1844 began judgment (Dan 8:14)
- [WB]: Timeline — Eden → Tabernacle → Christ → 1844 → ? (Series visual)
- Now: What is God waiting for before the "?" becomes Christ's return?
- Revelation 14:12 — The answer: a people with commandments AND faith of Jesus
- [RQ]: If judgment began in 1844, why hasn't Christ returned yet? (Rev 14:12)

---

## Section 1 — What God Is Waiting For (7 min)

### A. The Perfecting Work of Christ

- Hebrews 10:12–14 — One sacrifice, ongoing perfecting of the sanctified
  - "Perfected" = character completion, not sinless perfection claimed
  - [WB]: Cross (DONE) → Intercession (NOW) → Perfected saints (GOAL) (Heb 10:14)
- 2 Corinthians 3:18 — Changed into same image, glory to glory
  - Sanctuary goal: God's image restored in man
- [RQ]: What is Christ's intercession accomplishing in His people right now? (Heb 10:14)

### B. Christ Waiting for His Image Reproduced

- [EGW]: "Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own." (COL 69.1)
- Genesis 1:26–27 connected to Revelation 14:1 — Image of God → Name of Father in forehead
  - [WB]: Gen 1:26 "Image of God" = Rev 14:1 "Father's name in foreheads"
- Character = the issue; not numbers, not programs, not institutions
- [Aside]: A photograph develops gradually — features emerge until the image is complete. So God's character emerges in His people until Christ recognizes His own reflection.

### C. Why Delay?

- 2 Peter 3:9 — Not willing any should perish
- But also: Not willing to claim an incomplete harvest
- [EB]: Malachi 3:2–3 — He shall sit as a refiner, purifying sons of Levi
- [EB]: James 5:7 — Farmer waits for precious fruit with patience

---

## Section 2 — The Final Call to Separation (7 min)

### A. Revelation 18:4 — Come Out of Her, My People

- Revelation 18:4 — God's people **still inside** Babylon at the end
  - "My people" = sincere believers in false systems
  - [WB]: Write "BABYLON" with arrow OUT → "MY PEOPLE" (Rev 18:4)
- Babylon = confusion of truth with error (Genesis 11:9 meaning)
  - Part 3 showed: every sanctuary truth counterfeited
  - Coming out = rejecting counterfeit, embracing original
- [RQ]: If God calls them "My people," why must they come out? (Rev 18:4)

### B. What They Must Leave

- Revelation 18:2–3 — Babylon's errors enumerated
  - Doctrines of demons (1 Tim 4:1)
  - Union of church and state (Rev 17:2)
  - Sunday sacredness replacing Sabbath (Part 3: counterfeit rest)
  - Immortal soul replacing sanctuary truth of death/resurrection
  - Confessional replacing Christ's sole mediation
- [WB]: List — COUNTERFEIT → ORIGINAL for each major truth
- [EGW]: "The message of Revelation 18 will be given... The light of truth is shining; those who have been deceived will see it." (EW 277–279 paraphrase)

### C. What They Must Embrace

- Full sanctuary truth restored:
  - One Mediator (1 Tim 2:5) — not human priests
  - Sabbath rest (Heb 4:9) — not Sunday substitution
  - Death as sleep (John 11:11–14) — not immortal soul
  - Judgment by law (James 2:12) — not cheap grace
  - Second Coming hope (Titus 2:13) — not secret rapture
- [EB]: Isaiah 58:12 — "Repairer of the breach, restorer of paths"
- [EB]: Revelation 14:6–7 — Everlasting gospel includes judgment hour message

---

## Section 3 — The Seal, The 144,000, and Christ's Return (6 min)

### A. The Seal of God

- Revelation 7:1–3 — Sealing before final destruction
  - Seal = mark of ownership + approval of character
  - [WB]: SEAL = OWNERSHIP + CHARACTER (Rev 7:3)
- Ezekiel 9:4 — Mark on those who sigh and cry over abominations
  - Grieves over sin, not comfortable with it
- Sabbath as sign of sanctification (Ezek 20:12, 20)
  - Identifies Creator AND Sanctifier
  - [WB]: Sabbath connects — CREATOR (Ex 20:11) + SANCTIFIER (Ezek 20:12)
- [RQ]: Why would God seal only those who grieve over sin? (Ezek 9:4)

### B. The 144,000 — God's Image Fully Reflected

- Revelation 14:1–5 — Specific characteristics:
  - Father's name (character) in foreheads (v.1)
  - Redeemed from earth, firstfruits (v.3–4)
  - Follow Lamb wherever He goes (v.4)
  - No guile in mouth (v.5)
  - Without fault before throne (v.5)
- [WB]: List the 5 characteristics of 144,000 (Rev 14:1–5)
- Not sinless perfection self-achieved — Christ's righteousness fully received
- [EGW]: "Those who are living upon the earth when the intercession of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above are to stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator." (GC 425)
- [Aside]: A mirror doesn't generate light — it reflects perfectly what shines upon it. The 144,000 don't generate righteousness; they perfectly reflect Christ's character.
- [EB]: Revelation 3:5 — White raiment, name not blotted out

### C. Then Christ Returns

- Revelation 14:14–16 — Harvest immediately follows 144,000 description
  - Character reproduction → Second Coming (COL 69 sequence)
- Revelation 19:7–8 — Wife made herself ready
  - Fine linen = righteousness of saints (lived experience)
  - [WB]: READY BRIDE → RETURNING GROOM (Rev 19:7–8)
- [RQ]: If the bride must "make herself ready," what part do we play in Christ's return? (Rev 19:7)
- [EB]: Matthew 24:14 — Gospel to all world, then end comes

---

## FINAL PEAK SECTION — The Image Restored, The Journey Complete (5 min)

### The Circle Closes

- Eden: God's image in man, dwelling with man (Gen 1:26–27; 3:8)
- New Earth: Same image, same dwelling, fully restored (Rev 21:3; 22:4)
  - [WB]: EDEN (Gen 1:26) ——→ SANCTUARY ——→ NEW EARTH (Rev 22:4) — "They shall see His face"
- The sanctuary was always about this: restoring fellowship, restoring character

### The Counterfeit Exposed and Rejected

- Revelation 18:1 — Earth lightened with glory
  - Not human arguments — divine revelation
- Those who have loved truth recognize error when light shines
- Those who have loved comfort more than truth will cling to Babylon
- [EGW]: "Those who have been unwilling to receive the truth will be lost." (GC 605–606 paraphrase)

### Revelation 14:12 — The Final Description

- "Here is the patience of the saints"
  - Endurance under pressure, not passive waiting
- "Keep the commandments of God"
  - Obedience as fruit, not root, of salvation
- "Have the faith of Jesus"
  - Not merely faith IN Jesus — faith LIKE Jesus had
  - Trust in Father even unto death (Luke 23:46)
- [WB]: PATIENCE + COMMANDMENTS + FAITH OF JESUS = GOD'S IMAGE RESTORED
- [RQ]: Does your life currently display ALL THREE marks of Revelation 14:12?

### Call to Action — Become the Answer to God's Waiting

- God has waited since 1844 — not for more time, but for a people
- **Come out of every system of error** (Rev 18:4)
  - Not just organizationally — doctrinally, practically
- **Receive Christ's seal** through sanctification (Ezek 20:12)
  - Sabbath observance as sign of total surrender
- **Let Christ's character be fully reproduced in you** (COL 69)
  - Daily surrender, daily transformation
- **Join the 144,000** — not by counting, but by character (Rev 14:4)
  - Follow the Lamb wherever He goes
  - No reserve, no compromise, no turning back

The Way Home is complete when you arrive — and you arrive when Christ sees His own image in you.

**Will you be the reason Christ returns?**
