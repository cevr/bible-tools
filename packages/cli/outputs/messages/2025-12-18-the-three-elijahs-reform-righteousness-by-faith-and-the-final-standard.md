## Introduction — One Prophecy, Three Expanding Fulfillments (5 min)

- Malachi 4:5–6 — Elijah promised “before… the great and dreadful day”
  - Pattern in Scripture: type → larger antitype → final fullness (Matt
    17:11–12)
- Matthew 17:11 — “Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things”
  - “Restore” = truth recovered + life reformed
- [WB]: Draw 3 ascending steps: **Elijah → John → Remnant**; write over all:
  “RESTORE ALL THINGS” (Matt 17:11)
- [RQ]: Why does God repeat Elijah’s work in expanding waves—what isn’t finished
  the first time? (Mal 4:5–6)
- [EGW]: “In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ… God calls for
  a special work of reform.” (CT 323.1)

## Section 1 — Elijah the Tishbite: Covenant Loyalty in a Corrupt Church-State (6 min) [*]

- **Clarity gained:** Jehovah vs Baal becomes unmistakable
  - 1 Kings 18:21 — “How long halt ye between two opinions?”
  - [RQ]: What does God call “halting”—and is it treated as neutral? (1 Kgs
    18:21)
- **Role:** rebuker, restorer of worship, builder of the broken altar
  - 1 Kings 18:30 — “Repair the altar of the LORD that was broken down”
  - [WB]: Sketch: **Broken altar → 12 stones → fire** (1 Kgs 18:30–38)
- **Reach:** primarily Israel (local/national), confronting a specific apostasy
  - 1 Kings 18:17–18 — trouble not from reformer but from lawbreaking
- **Standard required (Elijah’s audience): decision + obedience shown in
  worship**
  - 1 Kings 18:36–39 — God answers by fire; people confess the true God
  - 1 Kings 18:40 — separation from idolatry is decisive, not symbolic
- **Reform points implied by the text (root first, branches follow)**
  - Worship purity (altar restored) → lifestyle must align
  - [Aside]: A repaired altar with an unchanged heart is still broken
    worship—Elijah forces public alignment where private compromise hid.
- [EGW]: “The greatest want of the world is the want of men… who will not be
  bought or sold… whose conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the
  pole.” (Ed 57.3)
- [EB]: James 5:17–18 (Elijah’s prayer life as reform power, not mere activism)

---

## Section 2 — John the Baptist: Deeper Clarity—From Idolatry to Heart‑Sin, and from Reform to Messiah (8 min)

- **Clarity expands:** not merely “Baal vs Jehovah,” but **sin vs
  righteousness**, and **Messiah as remedy**
  - Matthew 3:2 — “Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand”
  - [RQ]: Repentance from what—just bad politics, or the heart’s dominion of
    sin? (Matt 3:2)
- **Role expands:** preparation for Christ’s first advent; making a people ready
  - Luke 1:17 — “Spirit and power of Elias… to make ready a people prepared for
    the Lord”
  - [WB]: Write: **ELIJAH WORK = PEOPLE PREPARED** (Luke 1:17)
- **Reach expands:** “all Judaea” and Jordan region—broader than Elijah’s mount
  crisis
  - Matthew 3:5–6 — confession of sins; baptism
- **Standard sharpened:** fruit meets the claim; reform is measurable
  - Matthew 3:8 — “Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance”
  - Matthew 3:10 — axe at the root; no neutral trees
  - [RQ]: What does John threaten—loss of comfort, or loss of destiny? (Matt
    3:10)
- **Purity of gospel begins to come into view:** Christ identified as the One
  who takes away sin
  - John 1:29 — “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”
  - [WB]: Contrast two phrases: “COVER sin?” vs “TAKE AWAY sin” (John 1:29)
- **Reform points explicitly tied to conversion (not legalism)**
  - Luke 3:10–14 — practical righteousness: honesty, contentment, compassion
  - This is “education” of the life: unlearn oppression/self; learn Christlike
    equity (Rom 12:2)
- [EGW]: “True repentance includes sorrow for sin and a turning away from it.”
  (SC 23.2)
- [EB]: Acts 19:4 (John’s baptism aimed at believing on Christ—reform tethered
  to faith)

## Section 3 — End‑Time Elijah (Remnant): Final Clarity—“Restore All Things” + Everlasting Gospel to the Whole World (7 min)

- **Clarity reaches full prophetic light:** “restore all things” includes
  commandments, worship, judgment hour, and gospel completeness
  - Matthew 17:11 — “restore all things”
  - Revelation 14:6–7 — everlasting gospel + judgment hour + Creator worship
  - [WB]: Diagram: **GOSPEL → JUDGMENT → WORSHIP (Creator) → COMMANDMENTS** (Rev
    14:6–7,12)
- **Role reaches final‑events preparation:** not only “prepare for Messiah,” but
  **prepare to stand when probation closes**
  - Revelation 14:12 — “keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus”
  - [RQ]: Why does God define the final saints by both obedience and “faith of
    Jesus”? (Rev 14:12)
- **Reach becomes global:** every nation, kindred, tongue, people
  - Revelation 14:6 — worldwide proclamation
- **Standard becomes end‑time maturity in Christ (restored image)**
  - 2 Corinthians 3:18 — transformed into the same image
  - Ephesians 4:22–24 — put off old; put on new man “in righteousness and true
    holiness”
  - [WB]: Write “IMAGE RESTORED = TRUE HOLINESS” (Eph 4:24)
- **Points of reform (character/habit/health/dress) as fruit of the everlasting
  gospel**
  - Titus 2:11–14 — grace teaches denial of ungodliness; produces “peculiar
    people… zealous of good works”
  - 1 Corinthians 6:19–20 — body temple stewardship under redemption claim
  - 1 Peter 3:3–4 — modesty principle: inner adorning governs outer
  - [RQ]: If the gospel restores the image, what part of life is
    exempt—appetite, speech, entertainment, finances, relationships? (1 Cor
    6:19–20)
- **Pure gospel defined biblically:** not permission to continue, but power to
  cleanse and keep
  - Matthew 1:21 — “save his people from their sins”
  - 1 John 3:3 — hope in Christ produces purification
- [EGW]: “Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself
  in His church.” (COL 69.1)
- [EB]: Daniel 12:10 (purified/white/tried connected to last days—character
  under prophecy)

## FINAL PEAK SECTION + CTA — The Standard of the Three Elijahs: Full Surrender to Christ’s Present Work, Full Victory Over Sin (6 min)

- **The standard (not theory): Christ’s life reproduced by union with Him**
  - 1 John 3:5–6 (KJV) — “in him is no sin… whosoever abideth in him sinneth
    not”
  - [RQ]: If “abiding” governs sinning, is your Christianity mainly forgiveness
    without abiding power? (1 John 3:6)
- **The standard in judgment-hour light:** cleansing is now; the gospel must be
  complete now
  - Daniel 8:14 — sanctuary cleansed (judgment-hour reality)
  - Hebrews 9:24 — Christ now appears in the presence of God for us
  - [WB]: Timeline: **Cross → 1844 → NOW (Heb 9:24) → Close of probation** (Dan
    8:14)
- **The standard across all reforms (root = will surrendered; fruit = whole-life
  obedience)**
  - Romans 12:1–2 — living sacrifice; transformed mind (true education: unlearn
    world; learn Christ)
  - Revelation 14:4–5 — follow the Lamb; “no guile”; “without fault”
  - [Aside]: A student may change habits for a season; a surrendered disciple is
    re-created. One is behavior management; the other is new birth.
- [EGW]: “The warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought.”
  (SC 43.2)
- [EGW]: “Not even by a thought could our Saviour be brought to yield to the
  power of temptation.” (DA 123.3)

### Call to Action — Choose Your Elijah Stand Now (Life-and-Death Decision)

- **Choose full surrender of the will to Christ today**—no halting (1 Kings
  18:21; Luke 9:23)
- **Enter and remain in abiding union with Christ for victory over every known
  sin** (1 John 3:6; Matt 1:21)
- **Align your whole life with the judgment-hour message—worship, commandments,
  and the faith of Jesus—whatever it costs** (Rev 14:6–7,12; Dan 8:14)
