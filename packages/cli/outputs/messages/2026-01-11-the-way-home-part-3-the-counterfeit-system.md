## Section 1 — Paganism's Counterfeit Sanctuary: Ancient Systems Prepared the Way (10 min)

### The Foundation: Eden's First Lie

- Genesis 3:4 — "Ye shall not surely die"
  - First counterfeit doctrine: immortality of the soul
  - Foundation of all false worship
  - [WB]: Write "LIE #1: You don't really die" (Gen 3:4)
- [Aside]: Every pagan system is built on this one lie — that death is not real,
  that the soul lives on. From this single deception flows ancestor worship,
  prayers to the dead, purgatory, and spiritualism.

### Egyptian Religion: Counterfeiting Death and Intercession

- Immortal soul doctrine fully developed in Egypt
  - Soul continues conscious existence after death
  - Elaborate preparations for afterlife journey
  - Prayers and offerings for the dead
- Isis and Horus: Mother-child worship
  - "Queen of heaven" devotion established
  - Mother figure intercedes with the gods
  - [WB]: "EGYPT: Immortal soul, prayers for dead, mother-child worship" (Gen
    3:4; Jer 44:17)
- [EB]: Jeremiah 44:17–19 — Israel condemned for worshiping queen of heaven
  - "We will certainly... burn incense unto the queen of heaven"
- [RQ]: How does belief in an immortal soul open the door to praying to the
  dead? (Gen 3:4; Eccl 9:5)

### Babylonian Mysteries: Counterfeiting Priesthood and Mediation

- Revelation 17:5 — "Mystery, Babylon the Great, Mother of Harlots"
  - One corrupt source; many corrupt offspring
  - All false religions trace back to Babylon
- Babylonian priesthood: Human mediators replacing divine access
  - Priests as gatekeepers between humans and gods
  - Confessional system: Priests hold secrets, control absolution
  - [WB]: "BABYLON: Priesthood mediators, confessional, queen of heaven
    (Semiramis/Tammuz)" (Rev 17:5)
- Nimrod, Semiramis, Tammuz — counterfeit trinity
  - Mother-child worship exported worldwide
- [RQ]: Why does prophecy trace false religion to _one_ ancient source? (Rev
  17:5)
- [EGW]: "The system of heathen worship was Satan's method of obscuring the plan
  of salvation." (PP 91)

### Mithraism: Counterfeiting the Creator's Memorials

- Roman Mithraism: Persian sun worship adapted for Roman soldiers
  - Dies Solis (Sunday) as sacred day — "day of the sun"
  - December 25: Birth of the sun god (winter solstice celebration)
  - Rituals in underground temples mimicking mystery religion
  - [WB]: "MITHRAS: Sunday sacred, Dec. 25 birth, sun worship" (Ezek 8:16)
- [EB]: Ezekiel 8:16 — Men with backs toward temple, worshiping sun toward the
  east
  - God calls this an "abomination"
- [Aside]: Before Christianity ever existed, paganism had already counterfeited
  the Sabbath (Sunday for Saturday), the resurrection (Dec. 25 sun "rebirth"),
  and priestly mediation. The counterfeits were _waiting_ to be absorbed.

### Summary: The Counterfeit Elements Prepared

- [WB]: Create summary chart: | Sanctuary Truth | Pagan Counterfeit |
  |-----------------|-------------------| | Resurrection hope | Immortal soul
  (Egypt) | | Christ our Intercessor | Queen of heaven (Babylon/Egypt) | |
  Direct access to God | Priesthood mediators (Babylon) | | Seventh-day Sabbath
  | Sunday — day of sun (Mithras) | | Christ's birth | December 25 (Mithras) |
- [RQ]: If all these counterfeits existed _before_ Christianity, what does that
  suggest about Satan's strategy? (2 Cor 2:11)

## Section 2 — The Merger: Paganism Enters Christianity (6 min)

### Paul's Warning: Apostasy from Within

- 2 Thessalonians 2:3 — "That day shall not come, except there come a falling
  away first"
  - Greek: _apostasia_ — departure, rebellion
  - Apostasy precedes Christ's return
- 2 Thessalonians 2:7 — "The mystery of iniquity doth already work"
  - Corruption began in Paul's own day
  - Not attack from outside — rotting from within
  - [WB]: Write "MYSTERY OF INIQUITY = Paganism + Christianity" (2 Thess 2:7)
- [EB]: Acts 20:29–30 — "Grievous wolves... speaking perverse things, to draw
  away disciples"

### How Paganism Conquered Christianity

- [EB]: Jeremiah 10:2–3 — "Learn not the way of the heathen; their customs are
  vain"
- Constantine's political "conversion" (312 AD)
  - Christianity made state religion
  - Pagans flooded into the church unconverted
  - Compromise to gain numbers
- [Aside]: When you can't destroy the church by persecution, join it and corrupt
  it from within. This was Satan's masterstroke.
- Pagan festivals Christianized:
  - Saturnalia → Christmas
  - Easter fertility rites → blended with resurrection
  - Sunday sun worship → "Lord's Day"
- [WB]: Draw arrow from "PAGANISM" merging into "APOSTATE CHRISTIANITY" (2 Thess
  2:7)
- [EGW]: "Paganism, while appearing to be vanquished, became the conqueror. Her
  spirit controlled the church." (GC 49.2)

### The Result: A Counterfeit System Complete

- 2 Thessalonians 2:4 — Man of sin "sitteth in the temple of God, shewing
  himself that he is God"
  - Claims divine prerogatives
  - Substitutes human authority for divine
- Revelation 13:6 — Beast "opened his mouth in blasphemy against God... and his
  tabernacle"
  - Direct attack on the sanctuary truth
  - [WB]: Circle "HIS TABERNACLE" — the target is the sanctuary (Rev 13:6)
- [RQ]: If the sanctuary is God's bridge to humanity, why would Satan
  specifically attack "his tabernacle"? (Rev 13:6)

---

## Section 3 — Systematic Substitution: The Counterfeit Bridge Exposed (10 min)

- Revelation 13:6 — Beast blasphemes God's tabernacle
  - Every element of sanctuary truth systematically replaced
  - [WB]: Title — "SANCTUARY TRUTH vs. COUNTERFEIT" (Rev 13:6)

### Each Truth Replaced Point by Point

**1. Heavenly High Priest → Earthly Priesthood**

- Hebrews 8:1–2 — Christ is High Priest in heavenly sanctuary
  - "We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne"
  - [WB]: Left column — "Christ, Heavenly High Priest (Heb 8:1–2)"
  - Right column — "Pope/Priests claim mediatorial power"
- The pope claims to be "Vicar of Christ" — substitute for Christ
- [RQ]: If Christ alone is High Priest, what does a human priesthood displace?
  (Heb 8:1–2)

**2. Direct Access to God → Confession to Priests**

- Hebrews 4:16 — "Come boldly unto the throne of grace"
  - No human gatekeeper required
  - [WB]: Left — "Direct access (Heb 4:16)" | Right — "Confessional; priestly
    absolution"
- 1 Timothy 2:5 — "One mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"
  - ONE mediator — not many
- [EB]: Matthew 27:51 — Veil torn from top to bottom — access opened

**3. Christ's Intercession → Mary and Saints as Mediators**

- Hebrews 7:25 — "He ever liveth to make intercession for them"
  - Christ's intercession is continual, sufficient, exclusive
  - [WB]: Left — "Christ intercedes (Heb 7:25)" | Right — "Mary intercession;
    prayers to saints"
- [EB]: Acts 4:12 — "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
  other name under heaven"
- [Aside]: When you believe the dead are conscious, you can pray to dead
  "saints." The immortal soul doctrine enables this counterfeit intercession.

**4. Resurrection Hope → Immortal Soul**

- 1 Thessalonians 4:16–17 — "The dead in Christ shall rise first"
  - Hope is in resurrection, not death
  - [WB]: Left — "Resurrection at His coming (1 Thess 4:16)" | Right — "Soul
    goes to heaven/hell at death"
- [EB]: Ecclesiastes 9:5 — "The dead know not any thing"
- [EGW]: "Satan commenced his deception in Eden. 'Ye shall not surely die'...
  This same lie he has continued." (GC 533.2)

**5. Seventh-day Sabbath → Sunday Observance**

- Exodus 20:8–11 — "Remember the sabbath day... the seventh day is the sabbath"
  - Memorial of creation; seal of Creator
  - [WB]: Left — "Seventh-day Sabbath (Ex 20:8–11)" | Right — "Sunday—'venerable
    day of the sun'"
- The only commandment involving time
- [Aside]: The catechism openly claims: "The Church... transferred the solemnity
  from the seventh to the first day." (Catholic Mirror, Sept. 1893)
- [RQ]: If no Scripture changes the Sabbath, by what authority was it changed?
  (Mark 7:7)

**6. Heavenly Sanctuary → Earthly Magnificence**

- Hebrews 9:24 — "Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands...
  but into heaven itself"
  - The true sanctuary is in heaven
  - [WB]: Left — "Heavenly sanctuary (Heb 9:24)" | Right — "Vatican/cathedrals
    as 'holy' places"
- [EB]: Acts 7:48 — "The most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands"
- Earthly buildings replace focus on heavenly ministry

### The Counterfeit Is Complete

- Every sanctuary truth—systematically replaced
  - [WB]: Draw X through counterfeit column; circle TRUE column (Dan 8:12)
- Satan's bridge looks impressive but leads nowhere
  - Ornate cathedrals, elaborate rituals, ancient tradition
  - But wrong mediator, wrong foundation, wrong destination
- [RQ]: If every truth pointing to Christ is displaced, where does the
  counterfeit bridge lead? (Matt 15:14)
- [EGW]: "Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention to man in the
  place of God." (GC 55.1)

## FINAL PEAK SECTION — Recognizing the Counterfeit, Seeking the True (5 min)

### The Test: Does It Point to Christ's Heavenly Ministry?

- Every true doctrine points to Christ in the heavenly sanctuary
  - His sacrifice, His intercession, His judgment, His return
- Every counterfeit obscures or replaces that ministry
  - [WB]: Write test question — "Does this truth point me to CHRIST IN HEAVEN?"
    (Heb 8:1–2)
- [RQ]: How can you test any religious teaching to see if it's genuine or
  counterfeit? (Isa 8:20)
- Isaiah 8:20 — "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to
  this word, there is no light in them"

### Part 4 Preview: Prophecy Exposes the Counterfeit

- How do we _know_ which system is the counterfeit?
  - Not by feelings or tradition
  - By the sure word of prophecy
- Daniel 7, 8, 9 — God gave specific prophecies identifying the power that
  would:
  - Persecute saints for 1260 years
  - "Think to change times and laws"
  - Take away the "daily" (Christ's continual ministry)
  - Cast truth to the ground
- Part 4 will unlock these prophetic timelines
  - [WB]: Write 'NEXT: Prophecy Identifies the Counterfeit (Dan 7–9)'

### Call to Action — Begin Examining

- **Test what you've been taught** — Does it point to Christ in the heavenly
  sanctuary or to earthly substitutes? (Isa 8:20)
- **Study the sanctuary** — Understand God's original design before accepting
  any substitute (Heb 8:5)
- **Ask the hard questions** — Why was the Sabbath changed? By what authority?
  (Mark 7:7)
- **Prepare for Part 4** — Prophecy will confirm what history reveals (2 Pet
  1:19)
- **Pray for discernment** — Ask God to show you truth from counterfeit (John
  16:13)
- The counterfeit bridge is exposed — but do you know the _proof_? Part 4 will
  provide it.
