## Introduction — The Image That Maps Satan's Strategy (4 min)

- Review: Part 2 established sanctuary as God's bridge to humanity
  - Sin severed access; sanctuary restored it through Christ
- Satan's dilemma: Cannot destroy heaven's remedy
  - Strategy: Create convincing counterfeits through successive empires
- Daniel 2:31 — Nebuchadnezzar shown great image
  - Not random kingdoms—prophetic sequence with spiritual purpose
  - [WB]: Draw the image with sections labeled (Dan 2:31–45)
- 2 Corinthians 11:14 — Satan transforms into angel of light
  - Counterfeits appear holy, not evil
- [RQ]: Why would God reveal world empires in advance? What was Satan planning through them? (Dan 2:28)
- Series context: Part 4 will show how prophecy identifies the counterfeit system by name

---

## Section 1 — Daniel 2's Framework: God's Preview of Counterfeit History (5 min)

### The Image as Prophetic Blueprint

- Daniel 2:37–40 — Four kingdoms identified
  - Babylon (gold), Medo-Persia (silver), Greece (bronze), Rome (iron)
  - God revealed history in advance
  - [WB]: List kingdoms beside image sections (Dan 2:37–40)
- Each kingdom became Satan's instrument
  - Not merely political—spiritually strategic
  - Each counterfeited a specific sanctuary truth
- Daniel 2:44 — God's kingdom will destroy and replace all others
  - The stone cut without hands
  - Christ's kingdom—the true sanctuary reality—prevails

### The Counterfeit Built Layer by Layer

- Satan used successive empires to construct complete counterfeit system
  - Each kingdom added a layer of deception
  - [WB]: Write beside each section: "Babylon = ?", "Persia = ?", "Greece = ?", "Rome = ?" (Dan 2:31–45)
- [RQ]: If each kingdom contributed to a counterfeit system, what was the end goal? (Rev 17:5)
- [EGW]: "The system of heathen worship was Satan's method of obscuring the plan of salvation." (PP 91)

---

## Section 2 — Four Kingdoms, Four Counterfeits (12 min)

### BABYLON (Gold Head) — Counterfeited the HIGH PRIESTHOOD

- Daniel 2:38 — "Thou art this head of gold"
  - First great world empire after flood
  - First organized counterfeit religious system
- Revelation 17:5 — "Mystery, Babylon the Great, Mother of Harlots"
  - All false religions trace to Babylon
  - [WB]: Gold head — "BABYLON: Counterfeit PRIESTHOOD" (Rev 17:5)
- Nimrod as first false priest-king
  - Genesis 10:8–10 — "mighty one in the earth... Babel"
  - Human mediator replacing divine access
- Babylonian confessional system
  - Priests as gatekeepers to the gods
  - Secrets held, absolution granted by men
- Semiramis and Tammuz — counterfeit intercessors
  - "Queen of heaven" worship established
  - [EB]: Jeremiah 44:17–19 — Israel condemned for worshiping queen of heaven
- [RQ]: If Christ alone is our High Priest, what does a human priesthood displace? (Heb 8:1–2)
- [Aside]: Babylon's mystery religion created the template—every future empire would build upon it.

### MEDO-PERSIA (Silver Arms) — Counterfeited SACRIFICE and ATONEMENT

- Daniel 2:39 — "After thee shall arise another kingdom"
  - Medo-Persian empire conquered Babylon
  - [WB]: Silver arms — "PERSIA: Counterfeit ATONEMENT" (Dan 2:39)
- Zoroastrian religion dominated
  - Dualism: Good vs. evil locked in endless struggle
  - No true atonement—no substitute bearing sin
- Fire worship — attempting purification without blood
  - Leviticus 17:11 — "It is the blood that maketh an atonement"
  - Persia rejected substitutionary death
  - [EB]: Hebrews 9:22 — "Without shedding of blood is no remission"
- Works-based righteousness
  - Good thoughts, good words, good deeds weighed against evil
  - No Lamb bearing penalty
- [RQ]: Without a substitute sacrifice, what hope remains for the guilty? (Heb 9:22)
- [EGW]: "The blood of Christ... speaks in behalf of sinners." (PP 67.2)

### GREECE (Bronze Belly) — Counterfeited IMMORTALITY and the SOUL

- Daniel 2:39 — "Another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth"
  - Greek philosophy conquered minds
  - [WB]: Bronze belly — "GREECE: Counterfeit RESURRECTION" (Dan 2:39)
- Genesis 3:4 — "Ye shall not surely die"
  - The original lie now given philosophical sophistication
  - Plato's immortal soul doctrine
- Greek philosophy spread through Alexander's conquests
  - Soul as immortal, body as prison
  - Death = liberation, not enemy
  - [EB]: Ecclesiastes 9:5 — "The dead know not any thing"
- This enabled:
  - Ancestor worship
  - Prayers to dead "saints"
  - Immediate conscious afterlife instead of resurrection
  - [WB]: Write "Greek immortal soul → prayers to dead" (1 Thess 4:16)
- [RQ]: If the soul never dies, why would anyone need a resurrection? (1 Cor 15:16–18)
- [Aside]: Without this Greek counterfeit, praying to Mary and dead saints would be impossible. The immortal soul doctrine is the foundation.

### ROME (Iron Legs) — Counterfeited the SABBATH and WORSHIP

- Daniel 2:40 — "The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron"
  - Rome crushed all before it
  - [WB]: Iron legs — "ROME: Counterfeit SABBATH" (Dan 2:40)

  - Dies Solis (Sunday) — sacred day of the sun
  - December 25 — birth of Mithra (sun god) at winter solstice
  - [EB]: Ezekiel 8:16 — Men worshiping sun toward east—called "abomination"
- Constantine merged paganism into Christianity (312 AD)
  - Sol Invictus (Unconquered Sun) worship practices retained

  - [WB]: Write "Sun-day" with sun symbol replacing Sabbath (Exod 20:8–11)
- Exodus 20:8–11 — "Remember the sabbath day... the seventh day is the sabbath"
  - The only commandment specifying time
  - Rome's counterfeit attacked the Creator's memorial
- [RQ]: If no Scripture changes the Sabbath, by what authority was it changed? (Mark 7:7)
- [EGW]: "Paganism, while appearing to be vanquished, became the conqueror. Her spirit controlled the church." (GC 49.2)

---

## Section 3 — The Feet of Iron and Clay: All Counterfeits Combined (6 min)

### The Merger — Every Layer Unified

- Daniel 2:41–43 — Feet partly iron, partly clay
  - Iron = Rome's political and religious power continuing
  - Clay = weakness, mixture, unable to fully unite
  - [WB]: Feet — "ALL COUNTERFEITS COMBINED" (Dan 2:41–43)
- 2 Thessalonians 2:3–4 — Falling away comes first
  - Man of sin sits in temple of God, claiming divine prerogatives
  - [WB]: Write "APOSTASY = Babylon + Persia + Greece + Rome" (2 Thess 2:7)
- 2 Thessalonians 2:7 — "Mystery of iniquity doth already work"
  - Corruption began in Paul's day
  - Building toward complete counterfeit system

### The Complete Counterfeit Sanctuary

- [WB]: Summary chart:

| Sanctuary Truth       | Empire  | Counterfeit                    |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Christ as High Priest | Babylon | Human priesthood, confessional |
| Blood atonement       | Persia  | Works, fire purification       |
| Resurrection hope     | Greece  | Immortal soul, prayers to dead |
| Seventh-day Sabbath   | Rome    | Sunday worship                 |

- Each layer built upon the previous
  - Babylon's priesthood + Persia's works + Greece's immortal soul + Rome's sun worship
  - = Complete counterfeit sanctuary system
- Revelation 13:6 — Beast blasphemes "his tabernacle"
  - Direct attack on sanctuary truth
  - [WB]: Circle "HIS TABERNACLE" (Rev 13:6)
- [RQ]: If Satan built his counterfeit through four empires over thousands of years, how careful should we be in examining our beliefs? (Acts 17:11)
- [EGW]: "Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention to man in the place of God." (GC 55.1)

## FINAL PEAK SECTION — The Stone That Smashes the Image (5 min)

### The Test: Does It Point to Christ's Heavenly Ministry?

- Every true doctrine points to Christ in the heavenly sanctuary
  - His sacrifice, His intercession, His judgment, His return
- Every counterfeit obscures or replaces that ministry
  - [WB]: Write test question — "Does this teaching point to CHRIST IN HEAVEN?" (Heb 8:1–2)
- Isaiah 8:20 — "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, there is no light in them"
- [RQ]: How can you test any religious teaching to see if it's genuine or counterfeit? (Isa 8:20)

### Part 4 Preview: Prophecy Identifies the Counterfeit by Name

- Daniel 2 showed us how the counterfeit was built empire by empire
  - But how do we know which modern system embodies these counterfeits?
- Daniel 7, 8, 9 — God gave specific prophecies identifying the power that would:
  - Persecute saints for 1260 years
  - "Think to change times and laws"
  - Cast truth to the ground
  - [WB]: Write 'NEXT: Prophecy NAMES the Counterfeit (Dan 7–9)'
- Daniel 2:44 — "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom"
  - The stone strikes the image at the feet — in our time
  - Christ's kingdom destroys all counterfeits

### Call to Action — Prepare for the Stone's Impact

- **Test what you've been taught** — Does it point to Christ in heaven or to earthly substitutes? (Isa 8:20)
- **Trace your beliefs to Scripture, not to empire** — Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome contributed counterfeits still present today (Dan 2:31–45)
- **Ask the hard questions** — Why was the Sabbath changed? Who changed it? By what authority? (Mark 7:7)
- **Study Daniel 2 yourself** — See how God predicted the counterfeit system's construction (2 Pet 1:19)
- **Prepare for Part 4** — Prophecy will name what history reveals (Dan 7:25)
- The image stands exposed — but do you know which modern system wears the counterfeits? Part 4 will prove it.
