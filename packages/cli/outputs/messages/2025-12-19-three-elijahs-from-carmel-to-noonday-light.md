## Introduction — The Elijah Question Is a Salvation Question (5 min)

- Revelation 14:12 — End‑time identity defined by **obedience + “faith of
  Jesus”**
  - [WB]: Write: **3AM ROOT = FAITH OF JESUS → COMMANDMENT‑KEEPING LIFE** (Rev
    14:12)
- Romans 6:14 — Not merely pardoned, but **delivered from dominion**
  - [RQ]: If the last‑day description is obedience, what must the gospel produce
    beyond forgiveness? (Rom 6:14)
- [EGW]: “Christ came to this world and lived the law of God, that man might
  have perfect mastery over the natural inclinations which corrupt the soul.”
  (MH 130.2)

## Section 1 — The Gospel Standard: What Christ Came to Prove in Human Flesh (6 min)

- Romans 8:3–4 — Condemned sin in the flesh “that the righteousness of the law
  might be fulfilled in us”
  - Victory is not theory; it is the **fulfilled righteousness** of God’s law in
    believers
  - [WB]: Two lines: **CHRIST condemned sin → RIGHTEOUSNESS fulfilled IN US**
    (Rom 8:3–4)
- 2 Peter 1:4 — “Partakers of the divine nature… escape the corruption”
  - **Divine nature + faith** is Heaven’s provision for present victory
  - [RQ]: If God offers escape from corruption, what excuse remains for
    continual bondage? (2 Pet 1:4)
- 1 John 3:6 — “Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not”
  - Abiding = a maintained union that breaks sin’s reign
- [Aside]: A graft doesn’t “try” to bear fruit; it bears because it is united to
  the life of the vine.
- [EGW]: “Everyone who by faith obeys God’s commandments will reach the
  condition of sinlessness in which Adam lived before his transgression.” (ST,
  July 23, 1902)
- [EB]: John 15:4–5 (Abide → fruit; without Christ, nothing)

## Section 2 — The Three Elijahs: Progressive Restoration Until “Noon‑Day” Gospel Light (8 min) [*]

- **Elijah #1: Carmel—God’s call to decision + restored worship**
  - 1 Kings 18:21 — “How long halt ye…?”
    - Halting = divided heart; divided heart = continued sin
    - [RQ]: What “two opinions” keep sin alive—truth vs appetite, conviction vs
      reputation, Bible vs culture? (1 Kgs 18:21)
  - 1 Kings 18:30 — “He repaired the altar…”
    - Victory begins where worship is repaired: surrender of the whole life
    - [WB]: Draw an altar; label stones: **WILL / APPETITE / TIME / DRESS /
      WORD** (1 Kgs 18:30)
- **Elijah #2: John—repentance that reaches habits and motives**
  - Luke 1:16–17 — “Make ready a people prepared”
    - Prepared = not only forgiven; **reformed in heart and life**
  - Matthew 3:7–10 — Pharisees rebuked; “bring forth fruits”
    - [RQ]: If religious form can resist God, what does fruit reveal that words
      can hide? (Matt 3:8–10)
  - Matthew 3:4 — Simplicity in dress/diet as a witness to separation from
    self‑indulgence
    - Not salvation by lifestyle; lifestyle as **evidence** of inward repentance
- **Elijah #3: Last‑day—global message that must be embodied**
  - Malachi 4:5–6 — Elijah before “the great and dreadful day”
  - Revelation 18:1 — Earth “lightened with his glory”
    - Glory = God’s character revealed through a purified people
    - [WB]: Write: **GLORY = CHARACTER OF GOD REPRODUCED** (Rev 18:1)
- [EGW]: “It is the privilege of every Christian not only to look for but to
  hasten the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (DA 633.2)
- [EB]: Matthew 5:16 (Light shines through works that glorify God)

## Section 3 — The Root of the 3AM: Judgment‑Hour Worship Requires Victory Reality (6 min)

- Revelation 14:6–7 — Everlasting gospel + judgment hour + worship the Creator
  - Judgment hour means God is not only forgiving sin; He is **finishing His
    work** in a people
  - [RQ]: If the judgment is now, what kind of gospel is needed—one that excuses
    sin, or one that ends its dominion? (Rev 14:7)
- Revelation 14:12 — “Keep the commandments… faith of Jesus”
  - “Faith of Jesus” = the faith that **overcame** (not merely believed facts)
  - [WB]: Write: **FAITH OF JESUS → OVERCOMING FAITH** (Rev 14:12; cf. Rev 3:21)
- Hebrews 9:28 — Christ appears “without sin unto salvation” to those who look
  for Him
  - The people who “look” are those consenting to His saving from sin, not in
    sin
- [EGW]: “Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself
  in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in
  His people, then He will come.” (COL 69.1)
- [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (Cleansing of sanctuary implies cleansing of life in the
  antitype)

## FINAL PEAK SECTION + CTA — Elijah Today: Will You Prove the Gospel True in Your Life—Now? (3 min)

- Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion over you”
  - No neutrality: either Christ reigns, or sin reigns
  - [RQ]: If God says sin shall not rule, whose rule am I under today—Christ’s
    or self’s? (Rom 6:14)
- 1 Kings 18:21 — Carmel’s question becomes final‑generation personal reality
  - Are you Elijah (repaired altar, undivided loyalty), or Ahab/Pharisee (truth
    known, self protected)?

### Call to Action — Covenant‑Level Decision (No Delay)

- Choose full surrender to Christ’s indwelling life—abide, and let sin’s
  dominion end (1 John 3:6; Rom 6:14)
- Claim God’s provision: partake of the divine nature by faith, escaping
  corruption now (2 Pet 1:4)
- Stand with the 3AM in lived reality—commandments kept through the faith of
  Jesus (Rev 14:12)
- Settle it before God today: no halting, no reserve—repair the altar, and let
  God prove His gospel true in you (1 Kings 18:21, 30)
