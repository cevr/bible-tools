### Introduction: Defining the Terms

- Misconception: "Old Covenant" = Old Testament (Law/Doom); "New Covenant" = New
  Testament (Grace/Freedom).
- Thesis: The New Covenant is God's everlasting plan of salvation by grace
  (God's promise). The "Old Covenant" is humanity's self-confident vow to obey
  (man's promise).
- Jeremiah 31:31-33 – God promises a "new" covenant.
  - Content (the Law) unchanged; location changes (stone → heart).
  - [WB]: Two columns:
    - OLD COVENANT: "WE will do." (Man’s promise – failure)
    - NEW COVENANT: "I [GOD] will." (God’s promise – success)
- Restoration Context: Salvation = restoration of God's image in the soul
  (Genesis 1:26-27; 2 Corinthians 3:18). The New Covenant is the only method
  that actually changes the heart.
- [RQ]: If God never changes (Hebrews 13:8), would He design a plan based on
  human works, or does the Old Covenant expose what is already in the human
  heart?

### Section 1: The Two Seeds - Eden to Abel

- Genesis 3:15 – First Covenant promise after the Fall.
  - "I will put enmity..." – God's initiative, not man's.
  - God provides the Lamb, God crushes the serpent; humans receive and
    cooperate.
  - [EB]: Revelation 13:8 – "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (New
    Covenant plan predates creation).
- Genesis 3:21 – Coats of skins.
  - A covering provided by God through sacrifice, not human weaving.
- Genesis 4:3-5 – Two offerings, two covenants in action.
  - Cain (Old Covenant mindset):
    - Fruit of the ground (labor of his own hands), no blood.
    - Symbol of salvation by effort and character without atonement.
  - Abel (New Covenant mindset):
    - Firstlings of the flock with fat (blood, surrender).
    - Faith in God’s provision, trusting the Substitute.
  - [WB]: CAIN → "MY EFFORT" (Rejected) / ABEL → "GOD’S LAMB" (Accepted)
    (Genesis 4:4-5)
  - [RQ]: Can a person be sincere, religious, and industrious like Cain, yet
    still lost because the foundation is self instead of the Lamb? (Genesis
    4:5-6)
- Restoration through True Education:
  - Cain refused to "unlearn" self-reliance and accept the lesson of sacrifice.
  - Abel allowed the sacrificial system to educate his mind away from self to
    Christ.
  - [Aside]: Like trying to pay a real debt with homemade play money—no matter
    how carefully printed, it has no value. Only the King’s currency (Christ’s
    righteousness) is accepted.

### Section 2: The Two Mothers - Flesh vs. Promise

- Galatians 4:22-26 – Hagar and Sarah as an allegory of the two covenants.
  - Hagar: Bondwoman → earthly Jerusalem → covenant of bondage.
  - Sarah: Freewoman → Jerusalem above → covenant of promise.
- Genesis 16 vs. Genesis 21 – How Abraham related to God’s promise.
  - Hagar (Old Covenant):
    - Abraham and Sarah "help" God by human devising.
    - Produces Ishmael – work of the flesh, leads to strife and bondage.
  - Sarah (New Covenant):
    - Promise fulfilled when Abraham’s body is "as good as dead" (Romans 4:19).
    - Isaac – impossible by human strength, purely miracle of God’s word.
- [EGW]: "The covenant of grace was first made with man in Eden... This same
  covenant was renewed to Abraham... But if the Abrahamic covenant contained the
  promise of redemption, why was another covenant formed at Sinai? ... The
  people did not realize the sinfulness of their own hearts, and that without
  Christ it was impossible for them to keep God's law..." (PP 370.2–371.4)
- Key Principle:
  - Old Covenant: Distrust of God’s power to perform His word → human schemes to
    "make" the promise happen.
  - New Covenant: Confidence that what God has promised, He is able also to
    perform.
- [WB]: Diagram (Galatians 4:24-26):
  - HAGAR → Sinai → Bondage → "I can help God out."
  - SARAH → Jerusalem Above → Freedom → "God must do the impossible in me."
- [EB]: Romans 4:20-22 – Abraham "staggered not" at the promise; faith equals
  relying on God to do exactly as He promised, despite appearances.

### Section 3: The Two Responses - Sinai & Kingship [*]

- Exodus 19:8 – "All that the LORD hath spoken we will do."
  - Sounds loyal, but omits dependence: no "by Thy grace," no "God working in
    us."
  - Old Covenant at Sinai: ratified on the promises of the people.
  - New Covenant: ratified on the "better promises" of God (Hebrews 8:6, 10).
- [RQ]: How long did their vow last before the golden calf (Exodus 32)? What
  does this reveal about any covenant built on human willpower alone?
- Deuteronomy 5:28-29 – God’s diagnosis.
  - God acknowledges their words are "well said," but laments: "O that there
    were such an heart in them..."
  - Their promise exposes their lack of the heart needed; God longs to give that
    heart.
  - [EB]: Deuteronomy 5:28-29 – God desires a heart-change, not merely correct
    words.
- 1 Samuel 8:5-7 – Israel’s request for a king.
  - Rejecting God as King = shifting from direct New Covenant reliance to human
    systems.
  - Saul: People’s choice, outwardly impressive, symbol of trusting flesh and
    appearance.
  - David: God’s choice, shepherd heart, symbol of God-formed character.
- [Aside]: Many live "Saul-style" Christianity—concerned with looking right
  externally—while God is calling us to a "David-style" experience: a heart
  after His own heart, fully yielded for Him to write His law within.
- True Education Through Failure:
  - Across their history, Israel had to "unlearn" the illusion that their
    promises could sustain obedience.
  - God allowed failure so they would see that only His indwelling Spirit can
    produce real obedience (Ezekiel 36:26-27).

### Section 4: The Sanctuary and the Everlasting Covenant [*]

- Sanctuary as God’s Visual Lesson Book of the Covenant:
  - Exodus 25:8 – "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them."
  - Sanctuary = God showing how He restores sinners into His presence under the
    Everlasting Covenant.
- Outer Court – God’s Provision, Not Man’s:
  - Altar of Burnt Offering (Leviticus 1:3-4) – Substitutionary sacrifice: the
    sinner leans on the sacrifice, not on self.
  - Laver (Exodus 30:18-21) – Cleansing that comes from God, not self-scrubbing.
  - [WB]: Outer Court = "Christ for us" → Justification by His sacrifice (Romans
    5:9).
- Holy Place – Daily Education in Dependence:
  - Table of Shewbread (Leviticus 24:5-8) – Living by every word of God (Matthew
    4:4).
  - Candlestick (Exodus 27:20-21) – Receiving light and reflecting Christ’s
    character (Matthew 5:14-16).
  - Altar of Incense (Exodus 30:7-8) – Constant intercession and prayer (Hebrews
    7:25).
  - This daily ministry teaches continual reliance on Christ, not on past vows.
- Most Holy Place – Law, Mercy, and the New Heart:
  - Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25:21-22) – Law inside the ark, under the mercy
    seat, sprinkled with blood.
  - Hebrews 9:23-24 – Christ appears in the true Most Holy Place for us,
    cleansing not only records but a people.
  - Hebrews 8:10; 2 Corinthians 3:3 – Law transferred from stone to heart = New
    Covenant sanctuary in the believer.
  - [WB]: Draw: Sanctuary → Arrow → "Heart as Most Holy Place" (Law written
    within).
- [EB]: Daniel 8:14 – "Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed" = final phase of
  Christ’s work to cleanse hearts and lives in harmony with the law.
- [RQ]: If the goal of the sanctuary service is God dwelling with a cleansed
  people, what does that say about what He wants to do in our minds and
  characters today?

### Conclusion & Call to Application

- Summarizing the Bible’s Picture of the Covenants:
  - From Eden (Genesis 3:15) to Abel, Abraham, Sinai, the kings, and the
    sanctuary, the contrast is constant:
    - Man’s promises (Old Covenant) always fail.
    - God’s promises (New Covenant) succeed in producing obedience from the
      heart (Hebrews 8:10; Ezekiel 36:26-27).
  - The everlasting covenant is God’s plan to restore His image in us—thoughts
    and feelings in harmony with His law.
- [EGW]: "The new-covenant promise is, 'I will put My laws into their hearts,
  and in their minds will I write them.'... If the law is written in the heart,
  will it not shape the life? Obedience—the service and allegiance of love—is
  the true sign of discipleship." (MB 51.1)

- Practical Action Steps in the Education of Restoration:
  1. **Unlearn self-promise religion** – Lay aside "I will do better next time"
     as the foundation (compare Peter’s vow in Luke 22:33-34).
  2. **Learn to claim God’s promises personally** – Pray texts like Deuteronomy
     30:6; Philippians 1:6; Hebrews 8:10: "Lord, do in me what You have
     promised."
  3. **Daily cooperate with the Inner Teacher** – Come to Scripture and prayer
     asking, "What must I unlearn today? What truth will You write deeper into
     my mind?" (John 16:13; Romans 12:2).
  4. **Choose dependence over determination** – In every temptation, look away
     from your willpower to Christ’s present power (Hebrews 12:2; Jude 24).
  - [WB]: Action Steps (Education for Restoration – Hebrews 8:10):
    1. Unlearn: Self-trust.
    2. Learn: God’s promises.
    3. Practice: Moment-by-moment dependence.

- [RQ]: As we near the closing scenes of earth’s history, where is your
  confidence resting—on your renewed resolutions, or on Christ’s living promise
  to write His law in your heart and finish the work in you? (Philippians 1:6;
  Hebrews 12:2)
