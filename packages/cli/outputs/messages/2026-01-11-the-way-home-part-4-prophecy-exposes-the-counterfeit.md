## Introduction — Why Prophecy Matters (4 min)

- Review: Part 3 exposed the counterfeit system
  - Four empires contributed four counterfeits:
    - Babylon → counterfeit priesthood
    - Persia → counterfeit atonement (works)
    - Greece → counterfeit resurrection (immortal soul)
    - Rome → counterfeit Sabbath (Sunday)
  - Chart showed: every sanctuary truth systematically replaced
- But how do we _prove_ which system inherited all these counterfeits?
  - Not by feelings or preferences
  - Not by popularity or tradition
  - By the **sure word of prophecy**
- 2 Peter 1:19 — "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
  well that ye take heed"
  - Prophecy is more sure than even eyewitness testimony
  - [WB]: Write "PROPHECY = God's PROOF" (2 Pet 1:19)
- God gave Daniel detailed prophecies identifying:
  - The exact power that would consolidate all counterfeits
  - The exact time period of its dominance
  - The exact date when truth would be restored
- [RQ]: If God foretold these events centuries in advance, can we trust the
  identification? (Isa 46:9–10)

---

## Section 1 — Daniel 7: The Little Horn Identified (6 min)

### Same Empires, New Perspective

- Daniel 7:2–7 — Four beasts from the sea
  - Same sequence as Daniel 2's image: Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome
  - Part 3 covered this — now focus on what's NEW
  - Difference: Daniel 2 showed political succession; Daniel 7 reveals their
    beastly character and religious significance
  - [WB]: Quick list — Lion/Babylon → Bear/Persia → Leopard/Greece → Beast/Rome
    (Dan 7:4–7)
- Daniel 7:7 — Fourth beast has ten horns
  - Ten divisions of Western Rome (Europe)
  - Stage is set for the real subject: the little horn

### The Little Horn Rises

- Daniel 7:8 — "There came up among them another little horn"
  - Rises _among_ the ten — in Europe
  - Three horns uprooted before it
  - "Eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things"
  - [WB]: Draw little horn rising among 10, 3 falling (Dan 7:8)
- Different from the others: religious-political power
  - Not merely political kingdom
  - Claims spiritual authority

### Three Identifying Marks (Daniel 7:25)

- Daniel 7:25 — Three unmistakable characteristics:

**1. "Speak great words against the most High"**

- Blasphemy: Claims divine prerogatives
- Claims to forgive sins (Mark 2:7 — only God can)
- [WB]: Mark #1 — "Speaks against God (blasphemy)" (Dan 7:25)

**2. "Wear out the saints of the most High"**

- Persecution of God's people
- Inquisition, crusades, religious wars
- Millions martyred over centuries
- [WB]: Mark #2 — "Persecutes saints" (Dan 7:25)

**3. "Think to change times and laws"**

- Claims authority to alter God's law
- Changed the Sabbath from seventh to first day
- [WB]: Mark #3 — "Changes times and laws" (Dan 7:25)

### Consolidating All Four Counterfeits

- [WB]: Return to Part 3's counterfeit chart and connect to little horn
- The little horn didn't _invent_ the counterfeits — it _inherited and merged_
  them:
  - From Babylon: counterfeit priesthood (human mediators)
  - From Persia: counterfeit atonement (works-based salvation)
  - From Greece: counterfeit resurrection (immortal soul doctrine)
  - From Rome: counterfeit Sabbath (Sunday sacredness)
- Daniel 2:41–43 — The feet of iron and clay
  - Iron = Rome's political structure
  - Clay = religious elements mixing with state power
  - Little horn = this merger in institutional form
- [RQ]: Which of these four counterfeits have you unknowingly accepted? (Dan 7:25)
- [EGW]: "Paganism, while appearing to be vanquished, became the conqueror. Her
  spirit controlled the church." (GC 49.2)

### The 1260 Years: Prophetic Time Fulfilled

- Daniel 7:25 — "They shall be given into his hand until a time and times and
  the dividing of time"
  - 3½ prophetic years = 1260 prophetic days
  - Day-year principle: Ezekiel 4:6; Numbers 14:34
  - 1260 prophetic days = **1260 literal years**
  - [WB]: Write calculation: 3½ × 360 = 1260 days = 1260 YEARS (Ezek 4:6)
- **538 AD to 1798 AD**
  - 538: Papal supremacy begins
  - 1798: Pope taken captive; deadly wound
  - [WB]: Timeline — 538 AD → 1260 years → 1798 AD (Dan 7:25)
- [EB]: Revelation 13:3 — "His deadly wound was healed"

---

## Section 2 — Daniel 8: The Daily and the 2300 Days (7 min)

### The Sanctuary Under Attack

- Daniel 8:9–12 — The little horn in Daniel 8
  - Grows exceedingly great
  - Attacks "the host of heaven" and "the prince of the host"
  - [WB]: Title — "ATTACK ON THE SANCTUARY" (Dan 8:9–12)

### The "Daily" Taken Away

- Daniel 8:11 — "By him the daily was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary
  was cast down"
  - "Daily" = Hebrew _tamid_ = continual, perpetual
  - Refers to Christ's continual ministry in heaven
  - [WB]: Write "DAILY (tamid) = Christ's CONTINUAL intercession" (Heb 7:25)
- How was the daily "taken away"?
  - Not literally removed from heaven
  - _Obscured from view_ by the counterfeit system
  - Earthly priesthood replaced heavenly intercession in people's understanding
- [RQ]: When a system claims priests can re-sacrifice Christ daily, what happens
  to His once-for-all heavenly ministry? (Dan 8:11; Heb 10:12)
- [WB]: Draw heavenly sanctuary with cloud labeled "COUNTERFEIT SYSTEM"
  obscuring it (Dan 8:11–12)

### Truth Cast to the Ground

- Daniel 8:12 — "It cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and
  prospered"
  - All four counterfeits = sanctuary truth displaced
  - System prospered despite opposing God
  - But prophecy promised restoration

### The 2300 Days: Longest Time Prophecy

- Daniel 8:14 — "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
  sanctuary be cleansed"
  - 2300 prophetic days = 2300 literal years
  - [WB]: Draw long line labeled "2300 DAYS (YEARS)" (Dan 8:14)
- "Sanctuary cleansed" — truth restored, judgment begins
- Daniel didn't understand; fainted (Dan 8:27)
- Gabriel sent to explain: "Understand, O son of man" (Dan 8:17)

---

## Section 3 — Daniel 9: The 70 Weeks Unlock the Timeline (8 min)

### Daniel's Prayer and Gabriel's Answer

- Daniel 9:21–23 — Gabriel returns to give understanding
  - "Understand the matter, and consider the vision"
  - What vision? The 2300-day vision from chapter 8
  - [WB]: Connect Dan 8:14 to Dan 9 with arrow — "GABRIEL EXPLAINS" (Dan 9:23)

### The 70 Weeks "Cut Off"

- Daniel 9:24 — "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people"
  - "Determined" = Hebrew _chathak_ = cut off
  - 70 weeks _cut off from_ the larger 2300-day prophecy
  - [WB]: On 2300-day line, mark first portion: "70 WEEKS cut off" (Dan 9:24)
- 70 weeks = 70 × 7 = 490 prophetic days = 490 literal years
  - Points to Messiah's work

### The Starting Point: 457 BC

- Daniel 9:25 — "From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build
  Jerusalem"
  - Artaxerxes' decree (457 BC) — full civil authority restored
  - [EB]: Ezra 7:12–26 — Artaxerxes' decree with full powers
  - [WB]: Write "STARTING POINT: 457 BC (Ezra 7)" (Dan 9:25)

### Messiah Arrives on Time

- Daniel 9:25 — 7 weeks + 62 weeks = 69 weeks (483 years)
  - 457 BC + 483 years = **27 AD**
- **27 AD: Jesus baptized**
  - "Messiah" = "Anointed One"
  - [EB]: Luke 3:21–22 — Spirit descends; "Thou art my beloved Son"
- Jesus began ministry declaring: "The time is fulfilled" (Mark 1:15)
  - What time? Daniel's prophetic time!
  - [WB]: Timeline — 457 BC → 483 yrs → 27 AD "MESSIAH ANOINTED" (Mark 1:15)

### The Final Week: Messiah Cut Off

- Daniel 9:27 — "In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the
  oblation to cease"
  - 27 AD + 3½ years = **31 AD (Spring)**
  - Christ's death ended the sacrificial system
  - [EB]: Matthew 27:51 — Temple veil rent; God declared earthly sacrifices ended
- **34 AD: Gospel to Gentiles**
  - Stephen stoned (Acts 7); Gospel to Gentiles
  - 70 weeks (490 years) concluded
  - [WB]: 27 AD → 31 AD (Crucifixion) → 34 AD (70 weeks end)

### Calculating to 1844

- Total prophecy: 2300 years
- First portion (70 weeks): 490 years, ending 34 AD
- Remaining: 2300 – 490 = 1810 years after 34 AD
- 34 AD + 1810 = **1844 AD**
- [WB]: Complete timeline — 457 BC → 27 AD → 31 AD → 34 AD → 1844 AD
- [RQ]: Every date — 27 AD, 31 AD, 34 AD — precisely fulfilled. Can we doubt
  1844? (Dan 8:14)

---

## FINAL PEAK SECTION — 1844: Restoration and Judgment (8 min)

### What Happened in 1844? The Day of Atonement Begins

- Leviticus 16 — The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)
  - Once yearly, high priest entered Most Holy Place
  - Sanctuary cleansed of accumulated sins
  - Day of judgment for Israel
  - [WB]: Draw earthly sanctuary; "DAY OF ATONEMENT = JUDGMENT" (Lev 16:29–30)
- Daniel 8:14 — Heavenly sanctuary cleansing = Day of Atonement antitype
  - Not a cleaning of dust, but a judgment process
  - Christ enters the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary
  - [WB]: Arrow from earthly to heavenly sanctuary — "1844: ANTITYPE BEGINS"

### The Investigative Judgment

- Daniel 7:9–10 — The judgment scene
  - "The Ancient of days did sit"
  - "The judgment was set, and the books were opened"
  - Cases reviewed _before_ the Second Coming
  - [WB]: Write "BOOKS OPENED — Cases reviewed" (Dan 7:10)
- Why an investigative judgment?
  - Universe watches (1 Cor 4:9; Eph 3:10)
  - God's justice demonstrated before all
  - Each case examined: profession matched to character
- [EGW]: "The judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above... The cases of all
  must be decided before the close of human probation." (4SP 309)
- [RQ]: If judgment is happening now, is your life aligned with heaven's
  sanctuary or earth's substitutes? (Dan 7:9–10)

### Why Truth Was Restored at This Time

- The counterfeit had prospered (Dan 8:12) — but God set a limit
- 1798: Deadly wound given — counterfeit's dominance broken
- 1844: God's response to the counterfeit being exposed
  - As judgment began in heaven, truth was restored on earth
  - Light proportional to the hour
- What was restored?
  - The seventh-day Sabbath (counterfeit #4 exposed)
  - Christ's heavenly ministry (counterfeit #1 exposed)
  - State of the dead (counterfeit #3 exposed)
  - Salvation by grace through faith (counterfeit #2 exposed)
  - [WB]: List "COUNTERFEITS EXPOSED → TRUTHS RESTORED" (Dan 8:14; Rev 14:6–12)

### The Three Angels' Messages — God's Final Response

- Revelation 14:6–12 — The everlasting gospel in judgment context

**First Angel (Rev 14:6–7)**

- "The hour of his judgment is come"
  - Judgment began 1844 — we live in this hour
  - "Fear God" — reverence, not terror
  - "Worship him that made heaven, and earth" — Creator worship; Sabbath implied
  - [WB]: FIRST ANGEL = "Judgment hour begun (1844)" (Rev 14:7)

**Second Angel (Rev 14:8)**

- "Babylon is fallen, is fallen"
  - Babylon = confusion; the counterfeit system
  - Part 3 showed: Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome all contributed to the
    confusion
  - The little horn consolidated it — that system is "fallen"
  - [WB]: SECOND ANGEL = "Counterfeit system exposed" (Rev 14:8)

**Third Angel (Rev 14:9–12)**

- "If any man worship the beast and his image"
  - Worship = ultimate allegiance
  - Beast's mark = counterfeit system's claim on you
  - Contrast: "Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
    Jesus"
  - [WB]: THIRD ANGEL = "Choose: TRUE vs. COUNTERFEIT" (Rev 14:9–12)
- [RQ]: The three angels call the world to decide — which side have you chosen?
  (Rev 14:12)
- [EGW]: "The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of
  the disappointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete system of truth,
  connected and harmonious." (GC 423.1)

### Part 5 Preview: God's Final Call

- God waits for something specific:
  - His image reflected in His people (Gen 1:26–27 restored)
  - A generation that keeps His commandments _and_ has the faith of Jesus (Rev
    14:12)
  - The 144,000 — sealed with the Father's name (Rev 14:1)
  - Satan's counterfeits designed to prevent this character restoration
- Revelation 18:4 — "Come out of her, my people"
  - God still has people in the counterfeit system
  - The call is to leave error, embrace truth
  - [WB]: Write "PART 5: God's Image Restored — The 144,000, The Seal, The Final
    Call"

### Call to Action — Respond to the Prophetic Evidence

- **Accept the prophetic proof** — God identified the counterfeit centuries in
  advance; this is not guesswork (2 Pet 1:19)
- **Examine your own beliefs** — Have your beliefs come from Scripture, or from
  the empire-built counterfeit? Which of the four counterfeits still influence
  your thinking?
- **Return to Christ's heavenly ministry** — Look to the true High Priest, not
  earthly substitutes (Heb 8:1–2)
- **Recognize the hour** — We live in the investigative judgment; today is the
  day of salvation (Rev 14:7; 2 Cor 6:2)
- **Align your life with heaven's sanctuary** — Not earth's substitutes, but the
  reality to which they pointed (Heb 9:24)
- **Prepare for the final call** — Part 5 will reveal what God awaits; will you
  be among those who reflect His image? (Rev 14:12)
