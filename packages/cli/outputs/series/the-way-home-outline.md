# The Way Home — Series Outline

## Series Metadata

- **Title:** The Way Home
- **Studies:** 14
- **Acts:** 3 (The Story → The Conflict → The Restoration)
- **Thesis:** "The point of prophecy, according to 2 Peter 1:19, is to place the Day Star or Morning Star, Jesus Christ, in your heart." Character transformation is the road. The structures are the lamp (Psalm 119:105). Christ is the One who walks it with you.

## Audience Design

- **Act I (Studies 1-4):** Any audience, including non-Christians. No denominational knowledge assumed.
- **Acts I-II (Studies 1-10):** Christians exploring prophecy. Adventist-specific conclusions emerge naturally.
- **Acts I-III (Studies 1-14):** Full SDA presentation. Character transformation as the destination.

## Design Principles

1. **Every study answers one question.** The title IS the question. The study IS the answer.
2. **Christ is the through-line, not doctrine.** Doctrinal conclusions emerge from the Christ-centered narrative. Non-Christians encounter Jesus before they encounter the Sabbath, 1844, or the Investigative Judgment.
3. **Structural evidence is the lamp, not the destination.** Chiastic findings illuminate the path. They are never the main point. The main point is always what the structure reveals about Christ and character.
4. **The Bible interprets itself.** Types, allegories, word studies, and narrative patterns are the primary evidence. Chiastic structures confirm. The generator should derive conclusions from the biblical material that the reference files may not have reached.
5. **No assumed knowledge.** A non-Christian can start at Study 1 and never feel lost. An Adventist can start at Study 1 and never feel patronized.
6. **Three acts, each standalone.** Act I works for any audience. Act I-II for Christians exploring prophecy. All three for full SDA presentation.
7. **Progressive disclosure.** Orientation → Illumination → Confrontation → Decision within each study AND across the series.

## Reference Files

These are derived reference sheets from Waterhouse's structural studies of Daniel and Revelation. They contain chiastic structures, key texts, novel findings, and teaching flows. The generator should read the relevant file(s) for each study to pull in structural evidence where appropriate, but should NOT be limited to what these files contain.

## ACT I — THE STORY

For any audience, including non-Christians.

---

### Study 1: Why Do You Exist?

- **Act:** I
- **Core question:** What is the purpose of human life?
- **Central verse:** Ephesians 3:10
- **Biblical material:**
  - Job 1-2 — cosmic trial dramatized. Satan challenges God's character; Job's faithfulness is evidence.
  - Abraham's sacrifice (Gen 22) — witness of faith. God asks for everything and provides everything.
  - Isa 14 / Ezek 28 — Lucifer's fall. The origin of the conflict.
  - 1 Cor 4:9 — "we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
  - Rev 12:7-11 — war in heaven, overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.
  - Cain and Abel (Gen 4) — the first two witnesses. One worships God's way, one his own. The pattern begins immediately.
- **Structural evidence:** Daniel 1 chiasm — two cities as bookends (Jerusalem/Babylon), four faithful men vs. four metals, diet test as the first trial.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/01-daniel-1.md`
- **Generative direction:** Connect Job's trial to Daniel's trial to YOUR trial. The cosmic controversy is not abstract history — it is the framework of every human life. Explore what it means that your daily choices are evidence in a universal case. Cain and Abel show that the trial starts in worship — HOW you approach God is the first test.
- **CTA theme:** Your life is testimony. What does it say?

---

### Study 2: The Bridge Between Heaven and Earth

- **Act:** I
- **Core question:** How does God reconnect with fallen humanity?
- **Central verse:** John 1:51
- **Biblical material:**
  - Gen 3:9 — "Where art thou?" God's first response to sin is not punishment but pursuit.
  - Gen 3:15 — the first promise (the seed of the woman).
  - Gen 3:21 — the first sacrifice. God kills to clothe. Innocence dies so the guilty can be covered.
  - Gen 28:12 — Jacob's ladder. Heaven and earth connected.
  - John 1:51 — Christ IS the ladder. "Ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
  - John 4:21-24 — the woman at the well. True worship transcends location.
  - Exod 25:8 — "let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them."
  - Heb 10:19-20 — the veil = His flesh.
  - Matt 27:51 — the veil torn at the cross. Access opened.
- **Structural evidence:** NT macro-chiasm with Christ as High Priest at the center — used as confirmation, not foundation.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/11-new-testament-structure.md`
- **Generative direction:** Trace the "God seeks man" pattern from Eden to the cross. God's first response to sin is not punishment but pursuit ("Where art thou?"). The sanctuary is not a building but a relationship map — each piece of furniture reveals something about how God draws near. What does it mean that the veil = His flesh? That access to God's presence cost Him His body?
- **CTA theme:** The bridge exists. Will you cross it?

---

### Study 3: The Hidden Architecture of Scripture

- **Act:** I
- **Core question:** Is the Bible designed, or just compiled?
- **Central verse:** Psalm 119:105 ("Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path")
- **Biblical material:**
  - The deliberate language switch in Daniel (Hebrew → Aramaic → Hebrew) — why would the author change languages mid-book?
  - The chronological displacement of Daniel 7 (placed after ch. 4-5 events but written with ch. 2) — the structure is more important than the timeline.
  - The Genesis 1-2 creation-fall chiasm.
  - Psalm 119 as an acrostic — 22 stanzas, one for each Hebrew letter. Intentional literary design.
  - The Torah's own chiastic structure (Genesis parallels Deuteronomy, Exodus parallels Numbers, Leviticus at the center — the sanctuary laws at the heart of the Pentateuch).
- **Structural evidence:** This is the ONE study where chiastic method IS the primary content. Daniel 2-7 Aramaic chiasm. Daniel 8-12 mega-chiasm with prayer at center. NT macro-chiasm. Teach the audience how to read before using it as evidence.
- **References:**
  - `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/02-daniel-2-7.md`
  - `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/08-daniel-8-12.md`
  - `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/11-new-testament-structure.md`
- **Generative direction:** The center of every chiasm carries the most important idea. What does it mean that prayer is at the center of Daniel 8-12? That Christ as High Priest is at the center of the NT? That the fall of earthly power is at the center of Daniel 2-7? The structures are the lamp (Ps 119:105). Character transformation is the road. Christ is at the center of both.
- **CTA theme:** God designed His Word with intentional architecture. Will you read it as designed?

---

### Study 4: The Pattern — Prophecy, Persecution, Deliverance

- **Act:** I
- **Core question:** Is there a pattern to how God works in history?
- **Central verse:** Revelation 14:6-7
- **Biblical material:**
  - Elijah on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18) — truth proclaimed, 450-to-1 opposition, fire from heaven vindicates.
  - Noah (Gen 6-8) — warning, rejection by the world, deliverance through the flood.
  - The early church in Acts — Pentecost → Stephen's death → the Gospel spreads further.
  - The Reformation — Luther's 95 theses → persecution → Reformation spreads.
  - John the Baptist — proclamation → imprisonment → Christ endorsed him ("among those born of women there hath not risen a greater").
  - Joseph (Gen 37-50) — truth told (dreams), betrayed by brothers, exalted to save his people.
  - Cain and Abel again — Abel's worship was true, Cain persecuted, Abel's blood "speaks" (Heb 11:4).
- **Structural evidence:** Daniel 2-7 chiasm encodes the same three-step pattern: A/A' = prophecy proclaimed, B/B' = persecution, C/C' = earthly power falls. This pattern IS the three angels' messages (Rev 14:6-12) embedded 2,500 years before Revelation.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/02-daniel-2-7.md`
- **Generative direction:** The pattern is not just historical — it is personal. Truth received always faces resistance. Resistance overcome always produces growth. Where are you in this cycle? Explore how this pattern applies to the individual Christian life, not just empires. Every believer who stands for truth will face a furnace (Dan 3), a den (Dan 6), a Carmel (1 Kings 18).
- **CTA theme:** Truth proclaimed, resistance encountered, God vindicates. This is the pattern of your life too.

---

## ACT II — THE CONFLICT

For Christians exploring prophecy.

---

### Study 5: The Statue — One System, Four Phases

- **Act:** II
- **Core question:** What is Daniel 2 really about?
- **Central verse:** Daniel 2:44
- **Biblical material:**
  - Tower of Babel (Gen 11) — humanity unites against God. One system of rebellion, one language, one project.
  - The serpent's lie (Gen 3:4-5) — "ye shall be as gods" — the operating principle of every empire.
  - Nebuchadnezzar's dream (Dan 2:31-45).
  - King = kingdom principle (Dan 2:37-39).
  - The stone cut without hands — God's kingdom replaces all human systems, not by human effort.
- **Structural evidence:** The gold head names the whole statue — "the statue's name is Babylon." Four men vs. four metals pairing. Iron + clay = church + state (Isaiah 64:8 for clay = God's people).
- **Historical witnesses:** Luther (_Preface to Daniel_, 1530), Calvin (_Commentaries on Daniel_, 1561), Josephus (_Antiquities_, c. 93 AD) — all identified the same four kingdoms independently.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/03-daniel-2.md`
- **Generative direction:** Babylon didn't end; it evolved. Each empire inherited and refined the same rebellion. What does this mean for systems today that claim divine authority through state power? The stone is not an argument — it is a group of people (the four men vs. four metals). God's answer to empires is character, not counter-empires.
- **CTA theme:** Which kingdom are you building?

---

### Study 6: The Counterfeit Sanctuary

- **Act:** II
- **Core question:** What did each empire contribute to the counterfeit?
- **Central verse:** 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4
- **Biblical material:**
  - The golden calf (Exod 32) — Israel's first counterfeit worship. Aaron said "these be thy gods" — using God's name for a false system.
  - Jeroboam's calves (1 Kings 12:25-33) — a political leader creates counterfeit worship to consolidate power. Changed the feast day, the place, and the priesthood.
  - Jezebel and Baal worship (1 Kings 18) — state-sponsored false religion.
  - Korah's rebellion (Num 16) — misplaced authority. "All the congregation is holy" — true statement, false conclusion.
  - Ezekiel 8 — four stages of progressive apostasy ending in sun worship (backs turned to the temple, facing east).
  - Nadab and Abihu (Lev 10) — strange fire. Worship that looks right but isn't authorized.
- **Structural evidence:** 666 in Daniel 3's image dimensions (6 x 60 x 6). The forced-worship test of Daniel 3 IS the mark-of-the-beast test in miniature.
- **Each empire's counterfeit contribution:** Babylon → counterfeit priesthood, Medo-Persia → counterfeit atonement, Greece → counterfeit resurrection (immortal soul), Rome → counterfeit Sabbath (Sunday).
- **References:**
  - `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/04-daniel-3.md`
  - `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/10b-ezekiel-8.md`
  - `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/10a-exodus-numbers-1kings.md`
- **Generative direction:** The counterfeit always looks religious. Korah didn't say "reject God" — he said "all the congregation is holy." The golden calf wasn't presented as a rejection of YHWH but as a representation of Him. Nadab and Abihu brought fire to the altar — they just brought the wrong fire. Explore how counterfeits succeed precisely because they look almost right. What modern practices fit this pattern?
- **CTA theme:** Every sanctuary truth has a counterfeit. Which version do you hold?

---

### Study 7: The Little Horn — Prophecy Names the Counterfeit

- **Act:** II
- **Core question:** Can we identify the power that consolidated all four counterfeits?
- **Central verse:** Daniel 7:25
- **Biblical material:**
  - Daniel 7's beasts — same four kingdoms as Daniel 2, but now revealing character (beasts) not just materials.
  - The little horn's three marks: speaks against God, persecutes saints, thinks to change times and laws (Dan 7:25).
  - The 1260 years (538-1798).
  - Jesus' warning: "many shall come in my name" (Matt 24:5).
  - Paul's warning: "that man of sin... sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God" (2 Thess 2:3-4).
  - The woman riding the beast (Rev 17) — religious power using political power.
- **The Reformers' testimony:** Wycliffe (_De Potestate Papae_, 1379), Hus (_De Ecclesia_, 1413), Luther (_Smalcald Articles_, 1537), Calvin (_Institutes_ IV.7), Tyndale, Bullinger, Newton — all independently identified this power through historicist reading, centuries before chiastic analysis. Their testimony IS the strongest evidence: not one man's structural theory but centuries of independent scholars reaching the same conclusion.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/05-daniel-7.md`
- **Generative direction:** The identification is not Adventist innovation. It is the historic Protestant position, held from Wycliffe through Newton. What changed? Why did Protestantism abandon the identification that gave birth to it? Explore the shift from historicism to futurism/preterism and what motivated it. The Reformers paid with their lives for this identification. We owe them the courage to maintain it.
- **CTA theme:** God identified the counterfeit centuries in advance. Do you recognize it?

---

### Study 8: The Day of Atonement in Daniel

- **Act:** II
- **Core question:** What is Daniel 8 really about?
- **Central verse:** Daniel 8:14
- **Biblical material:**
  - Abraham's sacrifice (Gen 22) — the ram caught in the thicket = substitutionary atonement. God provides Himself as the offering.
  - The Passover lamb (Exod 12) — blood on the doorpost protects from death. 1 Cor 5:7 — "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us."
  - The Day of Atonement (Lev 16) — two goats, one sacrificed (the Lord's lot), one sent to Azazel bearing sin.
  - Melchizedek (Gen 14:18-20, Heb 5-7) — a priesthood that transcends Aaron's. King of Salem = king of peace.
  - Isaac carrying the wood (Gen 22:6) — Christ carrying the cross.
- **Structural evidence:** Ram = Christ-type (Isa 44:28-45:1 — Cyrus as mashiyach; Gen 22:13 — the ram provided). Goat = Satan-type (Lev 17:7 sa'iyr/devils; Lev 16:8-10 Azazel; Matt 25 goats = lost). Compass directions: neither ram nor goat pushes north because north = God's throne (Isa 14:13, Ps 48:2). Daniel 8 is the Day of Atonement in prophetic form.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/06-daniel-8.md`
- **Generative direction:** The animals carry the theology. The ram is always the sacrifice (Gen 22:13, Exod 29, Lev 5). The goat carries sin away (Lev 16:21-22). Daniel 8 is not just about empires — it is the cosmic Day of Atonement. What does it mean that Christ is both the ram (sacrifice) AND the High Priest who enters the Most Holy Place? Explore how the types converge in Christ's heavenly ministry.
- **CTA theme:** The Day of Atonement is not history. It is happening now.

---

### Study 9: The Covenant Written in Blood — Daniel 9

- **Act:** II
- **Core question:** When would the Messiah come, and what would He do?
- **Central verse:** Daniel 9:26
- **Biblical material:**
  - Abraham's covenant (Gen 15) — animals cut in two, a burning lamp passes between the pieces. God Himself becomes the covenant sacrifice. Abraham sleeps — God does the work alone.
  - Jeremiah's covenant warning (Jer 34:18-20) — those who violated the covenant "will become like the animals cut in two."
  - The crucifixion (John 19:30) — "It is finished." The covenant is ratified.
  - The torn veil (Matt 27:51) — access to God's presence opened.
  - The Last Supper (Luke 22:20) — "This cup is the new covenant in my blood."
- **Structural evidence:** "Cut off" (_karath_, Strong's #3772) = covenant-cutting — the same word in Gen 15, Jer 34, Dan 9:26. 777 in "weeks seven weeks" (Dan 9:25 literal Hebrew) — the Messiah's number answers the beast's 666. Prayer at the chiastic center of Daniel 9. The verbal link "transgression of desolation" connects Dan 8:13 to 9:24, 26-27, proving the 70 weeks is a subset of the 2300 days.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/07-daniel-9.md`
- **Generative direction:** One Hebrew word (_karath_) connects Abraham, Jeremiah, Daniel, and the cross. When Daniel says the Messiah is "cut off," the Hebrew says He IS the covenant sacrifice — the burning lamp that passed between the pieces in Genesis 15. Explore this single word as the thread that ties the entire Bible's covenant theology together. What does it mean that God Himself walked through the pieces? That the covenant was always going to cost Him, not us?
- **CTA theme:** The covenant was cut in His blood. Have you entered it?

---

### Study 10: 1844 and the Judgment

- **Act:** II
- **Core question:** What began in 1844, and what does it mean for you?
- **Central verse:** Daniel 7:9-10
- **Biblical material:**
  - The parable of the wedding garment (Matt 22:1-14) — the king inspects the guests BEFORE the feast. Judgment precedes reward.
  - The parable of the talents (Matt 25:14-30) — the master returns and settles accounts.
  - The sheep and goats (Matt 25:31-46) — judgment based on character demonstrated in action.
  - The manna test (Exod 16) — obedience tested daily, on a schedule, before entering Canaan.
  - The cleansing of the temple (John 2:13-17, Matt 21:12-13) — Jesus inspects and purifies. A type of the heavenly cleansing.
- **The calculation:** 2300 - 490 = 1810. 34 AD + 1810 = 1844. Christ enters the Most Holy Place. Daniel 7:9-10: the judgment scene. Books opened. The investigative judgment is the cosmic trial reaching its conclusion — the universe watches (1 Cor 4:9, Eph 3:10, same principle from Study 1).
- **What was restored:** Sabbath, Christ's heavenly ministry, state of the dead, salvation by grace — each counterfeit from Study 6 now answered with its original truth.
- **References:**
  - `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/06-daniel-8.md`
  - `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/08-daniel-8-12.md`
- **Generative direction:** Jesus' parables about judgment always involve inspection BEFORE the event (wedding garment checked before the feast, talents accounted before reward). This is the investigative judgment in parable form. Explore the connection between Jesus' judgment parables and Daniel 7:9-10. What does it mean that the judgment is not about discovering what God doesn't know, but demonstrating to the universe what He does?
- **CTA theme:** The judgment hour has begun. Does your life align with heaven's reality?

## ACT III — THE RESTORATION

Full SDA presentation.

---

### Study 11: The Sabbath — The Test That Never Changed

- **Act:** III
- **Core question:** Why does the Sabbath matter?
- **Central verse:** Genesis 2:2-3
- **Biblical material:**
  - Creation Sabbath (Gen 2:1-3) — God rested, blessed, sanctified. The only day that carries all three.
  - The manna test (Exod 16) — Sabbath obedience tested BEFORE Sinai. The law was written in practice before it was written in stone.
  - Sinai (Exod 20:8-11) — "Remember." The only commandment that begins with a call to memory.
  - The Sabbath as sanctification sign (Ezek 20:12, 20) — "that ye may know that I am the LORD that sanctify you."
  - Jesus' custom (Luke 4:16) — He kept it.
  - Jesus' Sabbath healings (John 5:16-18, 7:1) — the Sabbath was the issue that got Him killed. Healing on Sabbath = the true purpose of the day.
  - "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28) — not "abolisher of the Sabbath."
  - Isaiah 58:13-14 — "call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable."
  - The Sabbath in the new earth (Isa 66:22-23) — from creation to the new earth, the Sabbath endures.
- **Structural evidence:** Sabbatismos in Hebrews 4:9 at the structural center of the NT — used as confirmation. John 5-7 chiasm centers on the Sabbath conflict.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/11-new-testament-structure.md`
- **Generative direction:** The Sabbath runs from creation to the new earth. It was tested before the law was given (manna, Exod 16). It was the issue that got Jesus killed (John 5, 7). It is the sign of sanctification (Ezek 20:12). Explore: why is this particular commandment the one Satan targets? What is it about rest and trust that threatens the counterfeit system built on works and self-exaltation?
- **CTA theme:** The Sabbath is not a rule. It is a relationship marker. Who do you trust as Creator and Sanctifier?

---

### Study 12: Come Out of Her, My People

- **Act:** III
- **Core question:** What does God ask of those who discover the truth?
- **Central verse:** Revelation 18:4
- **Biblical material:**
  - Abram's call (Gen 12:1) — "Get thee out of thy country." God's first instruction to the father of faith: leave.
  - Lot fleeing Sodom (Gen 19:15-17) — "Escape for thy life; look not behind thee." Lot's wife looked back (Gen 19:26).
  - Ruth's choice (Ruth 1:16) — "Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God." A Moabite chooses covenant.
  - The prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32) — leaving the far country, returning to the Father. The father runs to meet him.
  - The Reformers' exodus — Wycliffe, Hus, Luther, Tyndale. They left the system at great cost. Some paid with their lives.
  - Rahab (Josh 2, 6) — a pagan in a doomed city, who chose God's people and was saved. In Christ's genealogy (Matt 1:5).
- **The Laodicea connection:** Colossians was written to the Laodicean church (Col 4:13-16). The message to Laodicea (Rev 3:14-22) — lukewarm, self-satisfied, needing eye salve — is the message to those who have truth but haven't let it transform them.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/11-new-testament-structure.md`
- **Generative direction:** "Come out" is not about geography. It's about allegiance. Abram left Ur. Ruth left Moab. The prodigal left the pig sty. Rahab left Jericho. Each one left a system that was killing them and entered a covenant that saved them. But Laodicea shows the other danger: you can hold all the right truths and still be lukewarm. Coming out of Babylon without letting Christ in is just relocating. Explore the difference between doctrinal correctness and character transformation.
- **CTA theme:** Coming out means letting truth come in. Have you let it?

---

### Study 13: The 144,000 — What God Is Waiting For

- **Act:** III
- **Core question:** Why hasn't Christ returned yet?
- **Central verse:** Revelation 14:1-5
- **Biblical material:**
  - Peter's denial and restoration (John 18:25-27, 21:15-17) — failure redeemed by love. "Do you love me?" asked three times for three denials.
  - Paul's conversion (Acts 9) — the worst enemy becomes the greatest witness.
  - Zacchaeus (Luke 19:1-10) — immediate, visible character change. "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor."
  - The prodigal's return (Luke 15:20-24) — the father's embrace. The ring, the robe, the feast.
  - Enoch (Gen 5:24) — "walked with God; and he was not, for God took him." Translation as the natural result of intimacy.
  - Elijah (2 Kings 2:11) — translated without seeing death.
  - Moses' transformation — from murderer (Exod 2:12) to the meekest man on earth (Num 12:3). Character change over 40 years in the wilderness.
- **The 144,000 described:** Father's name (= character) in their foreheads. Follow the Lamb wherever He goes. No guile in their mouth. Without fault before the throne of God (Rev 14:1-5). They overcame by the blood of the Lamb AND the word of their testimony (Rev 12:11). COL 69 — God waits for character reproduction.
- **The 1888 lesson:** The knowledge was sufficient. The evidence was complete. The church rejected righteousness by faith at the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference. The problem was not insufficient proof — it was unreceived transformation. Hosea 4:6 — "my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge" — but the knowledge that is lacking is knowledge of God Himself, not knowledge of doctrine.
- **Reference:** `/Users/cvr/Downloads/prophecy-studies/01-daniel-1.md` (four witnesses pattern)
- **Generative direction:** Peter failed catastrophically and was restored. Paul murdered Christians and became one. Moses was a murderer who became the meekest man alive. Enoch walked so closely with God that translation was the natural result. The 144,000 are not a special breed — they are people who let Christ finish what He started. Explore: what does "without fault before the throne" mean in light of Peter and Paul? Is it perfection achieved or perfection received? What kept the 1888 generation from receiving it, and what would be different now?
- **CTA theme:** God is not waiting for more evidence. He is waiting for a people whose character answers every charge.

### Study 14: The Way Home

- **Act:** III
- **Core question:** Will you be the reason Christ returns?
- **Central verse:** 2 Peter 1:19
- **Biblical material:**
  - Eden (Gen 1:26-27) — God's image in man. The starting point.
  - The New Earth (Rev 21:3, 22:4) — "they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads." The same image, the same dwelling, fully restored.
  - Psalm 23 — the shepherd who leads through the valley and prepares a table in the presence of enemies.
  - 1 John 3:2 — "we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."
  - The marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev 19:7-9) — "his wife hath made herself ready." Readiness = character.
  - Rev 14:12 — "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." Patience + commandments + faith = God's image restored.
  - Gal 4:19 — "until Christ be formed in you."
  - The road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35) — Christ walks with His people, opens Scripture, reveals Himself. "Did not our heart burn within us?"
- **2 Peter 1:19:** "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts." The point of prophecy is to place the Day Star, Jesus Christ, in your heart. This is the thesis of the entire series. Every chiasm, every Hebrew word, every timeline, every type and shadow served this one sentence.
- **Character transformation is the road. The structures are the lamp (Psalm 119:105). Christ is the One who walks it with you.**
- **Generative direction:** The series began with "Why do you exist?" and the answer was: you are a witness. The series ends with: what does your witness say? Trace the full arc: creation → fall → sanctuary → prophecy → judgment → restoration. Everything points to one thing: Christ formed in you (Gal 4:19). The road to Emmaus shows the method: Christ walks with you through Scripture, and your heart burns. Explore what it looks like for the story to end — not with a date, but with a character.
- **CTA theme:** The Way Home is complete when you arrive. You arrive when Christ sees His own image in you.

## Cross-Cutting Notes for Generation

1. **Study 1 and Study 14 mirror each other.** Study 1 asks "Why do you exist?" (you are a witness). Study 14 asks "What does your witness say?" The generator should make this bookend explicit.
2. **The cosmic controversy thread** runs through every study. Study 1 introduces it. Study 10 shows its climax (judgment). Study 13 shows its resolution (character reproduction). The generator should reference this thread in every study, even briefly.
3. **Types compound.** The ram in Study 8 connects to the covenant-cutting in Study 9. The manna test in Study 10 connects to the Sabbath in Study 11. The golden calf in Study 6 connects to the little horn in Study 7. The generator should cross-reference types across studies.
4. **The Reformers appear in Studies 5, 7, and 12.** Their testimony is cumulative: they identified the kingdoms (5), named the counterfeit (7), and paid the price to leave it (12). The generator should build their witness progressively.
5. **Character transformation is the destination, not knowledge.** Every study's CTA should point toward transformation, not just understanding. The generator should resist ending any study with "now you know" and instead end with "now what will you do?"
6. **Waterhouse structural evidence should be introduced in Study 3** and then referenced naturally in subsequent studies. The audience learns the method once, then sees it applied. Don't re-explain chiastic structure in every study.
