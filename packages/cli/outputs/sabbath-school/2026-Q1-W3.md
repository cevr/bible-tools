# 2026 Q1 W3 - January 10–16

## Life and Death

**Overarching Theme:** Christ magnified through a perfected, fearless, united
remnant life—where even death cannot silence the gospel in the Great
Controversy  
**Central Focus:** God’s purpose in life, suffering, and even death is the
restoration of His image in us (sanctification), producing a unified,
mission-driven people ready for Christ’s return.  
**Key Texts:** Philippians 1:20–21; John 17:17–19; 2 Corinthians 10:3–6

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: If you had one sentence to sum up your life mission, what would it
  be—and could you keep it in prison, under criticism, or facing death?
- Theme Introduction: Paul’s line “to live is Christ” is not poetry; it is
  **end-time discipleship**—Christ so formed within that life and death both
  preach.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: `CHRIST MAGNIFIED—LIFE, DEATH, UNITY`
- Connection to Character/Eternity: In the Great Controversy, God answers
  Satan’s accusations by reproducing Christ’s character in His people
  (Revelation 14:12; 2 Corinthians 3:18). This is readiness.
  - [WB]: Add: `GC Issue: God’s character vindicated in His people`
- Roadmap:
  - Christ magnified in our bodies (Philippians 1:19–21)
  - Spiritual war and weapons (2 Corinthians 10:3–6)
  - Death as sleep and resurrection hope (1 Thessalonians 4:14–17; John
    11:11–13)
  - Unity through sanctified truth (Philippians 1:27–30; John 17:17–19)

### II. Christ Magnified in a Crucified Life (Philippians 1:19–22) (16-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul’s goal is not comfort, reputation, or even
  acquittal—but that Christ be seen **in his body**.

#### A. Christ as the supreme aim: life and death both become testimony (9-10 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 1:19–20
  - Reading/Context: Paul writes from imprisonment; outcome uncertain.
  - [WB]: `Phil 1:20 — “CHRIST…MAGNIFIED” + “body”`
  - Unpacking the Truth: “Magnified” means Christ is made larger in the eyes of
    others through a surrendered human life. The battlefield is not merely
    circumstances; it is **how Christ is displayed under pressure**.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What does Paul want more than freedom in verse 20?”
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What kind of ‘pressure’ reveals what’s really ruling
    my life?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Galatians 2:20
  - Reading/Connection: Paul’s secret is not heroic personality; it is
    crucifixion of self.
  - [WB]: Draw simple diagram: `Self on cross -> Christ living in me`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: True sanctification is Christ enthroned
    within—self dethroned. This directly attacks pride, the root of disunity and
    fear.
  - [EGW]: "By their good works, Christ’s followers are to bring glory, not to
    themselves, but to Him through whose grace and power they have wrought…
    Jesus will be magnified, self will be hidden, and Christ will appear as all
    in all." (CC 365).
  - [WB]: Quote fragment: `“Self hidden—Christ all in all”`
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What are subtle ways ‘self’ tries to share the glory,
    even in spiritual work?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A magnifying glass doesn’t create light; it
    concentrates it. Trials don’t create faith; they reveal and focus what is
    already within.
  - Connecting to Life: Pressure exposes whether Christ or self is “inside the
    lens.”
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “When I’m under pressure, what ‘image’ do others
    usually see magnified—Christ or me?”
- **Foundation Text 3 (Action/Promise):** 1 Corinthians 4:14–16
  - Reading/Challenge: Paul calls believers to imitate him **as he imitates
    Christ** (compare 1 Corinthians 11:1).
  - [WB]: `1 Cor 4:16 — “IMITATE”` + `1 Cor 11:1 — “as I…Christ”`
  - Practical Step: Choose one relationship where your instinct is self-defense;
    practice Christlike response as a deliberate act of imitation.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where is God inviting you to ‘imitate Christ’ this
    week—at home, work, church?”

#### B. “To live is Christ”: the fruit-bearing purpose of continued life [*] (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Philippians 1:21–22
  - Reading/Context: Paul calls living “fruitful labor.”
  - [WB]: `Phil 1:21 — LIVE=Christ | DIE=gain`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Life is stewardship for mission; the value of extended
    life is not self-preservation but **gospel fruit**.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “According to verse 22, what makes life worth
    continuing?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** John 12:24–25
  - Reading/Connection: Jesus teaches the law of the kingdom—life comes through
    death to self.
  - [WB]: `John 12:24 — “die -> bring forth much fruit”`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: The cross is not only what saves us; it is
    the pattern that **sanctifies** us. Clinging to self blocks fruit.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “Where do you most feel the ‘clinging’ to self—time,
    comfort, opinions, control?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** 2 Corinthians 12:15
  - Reading/Connection: Gospel love spends itself for others.
  - [WB]: Keyword: `“SPEND AND BE SPENT”`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Self-sacrificing love is the clearest
    evidence of Christ dwelling within—this is how heaven’s principles answer
    Satan’s charges.
  - [EGW]: "The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who on earth has
    drunk most deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing love… ‘For to me to
    live is Christ… and to die is gain.’" (DA 549).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does DA 549 redefine what ‘spiritual greatness’
    looks like in the church?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A seed looks like loss when it “dies” in soil; but
    death is the pathway to multiplied life. So, surrender feels like loss to
    self, but it multiplies gospel fruit.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What ‘seed’ (time, pride, comfort, preference) is
    God asking you to bury so others can live?”
  - [WB]: Simple sketch: `Seed -> burial -> stalk -> many seeds`

### III. The Great Controversy in the Mind: Warfare, Death, and Resurrection Hope (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The devil’s chief weapons are lies—especially
  about God’s character, our worth, and what death means. God arms us with truth
  and hope.

#### A. The war of ideas: pulling down strongholds (8-9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** 2 Corinthians 10:3–5
  - Reading/Context: The fight is not “people vs. people,” but truth vs.
    deception.
  - [WB]: `Strongholds = patterns of thought` + `“bring into captivity”`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Strongholds are entrenched thought-habits: resentment,
    lust, fear, criticism, worldly ambition—Satan’s “fortresses” inside the
    mind.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What is the target of spiritual warfare in verse 5?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Romans 12:1–2
  - Reading/Connection: God’s method is total consecration resulting in a
    renewed mind.
  - [WB]: `Rom 12:2 — “transformed” = mind renewed`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Sanctification is not mere behavior
    modification; it is **truth believed** until desires change. This is
    end-time preparation—no unconverted “strongholds” can stand in the time of
    trouble.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What is the difference between ‘conforming’ and being
    ‘transformed’?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Ephesians 6:17
  - Reading/Connection: The Spirit wields Scripture, not human force.
  - [WB]: `Sword = Word (Spirit-powered)`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: We don’t win by sheer willpower; we win by
    **Christ indwelling** and Scripture believed and obeyed.
  - [EGW]: "The only safeguard against evil is the indwelling of Christ in the
    heart through faith in His righteousness… the grace of Christ transforms the
    character." (MB 118-119).
  - [WB]: Quote fragment: `“Only safeguard: indwelling Christ”`
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does ‘indwelling Christ’ differ from trying
    harder to be good?”
- **Foundation Text 4 (Promise/Comfort):** Luke 22:31–32
  - Reading/Challenge: Jesus intercedes so faith does not fail.
  - [WB]: `Luke 22:32 — “I have prayed for thee”`
  - Practical Step: When tempted, pray Scripture aloud; choose one verse to
    “capture” a recurring thought this week.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What recurring thought do you want Jesus to ‘take
    captive’ for you—fear, anger, impurity, discouragement?”
- **Illustration (clarifying strongholds):**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A “stronghold” is like a well-worn footpath through
    grass—the more you walk it, the easier it becomes. Scripture + obedience
    grows a new path until the old one disappears.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What ‘new path’ (new habit) could replace one old
    path this week?”
  - [WB]: Two paths sketch: `Old habit (wide) / New habit (narrow growing)`

#### B. “To die is gain”: death as sleep; resurrection as God’s answer (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 5:** Ecclesiastes 9:5
  - Reading/Context: Scripture’s blunt clarity on the state of the dead.
  - [WB]: `Eccl 9:5 — “dead know nothing”`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Death is not life in another form; it is the
    enemy—unconscious rest until resurrection.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What does this verse plainly say about consciousness
    in death?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** John 11:11–13
  - Reading/Connection: Jesus calls death “sleep.”
  - [WB]: `Death = “sleep” (Jesus’ term)`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Satan’s first lie (“you shall not surely
    die”) undermines accountability and the urgency of sanctification. Biblical
    sleep keeps the focus on Christ’s return.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does the ‘sleep’ teaching protect the gospel from
    spiritualistic deception?”
- **Foundation Text 7 (Hope):** 1 Thessalonians 4:16–17
  - Reading/Promise: The remedy is resurrection at the Second Coming, not an
    immortal soul.
  - [WB]: Timeline:
    `Death (sleep) -> 2nd Coming -> resurrection -> with the Lord`
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like closing your eyes at night and “the next thing
    you know” it’s morning—so the believer’s next conscious moment after death
    is the voice of Christ calling.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “How does this hope change the way you face grief or
    your own mortality?”
- **Foundation Text 8:** 1 Corinthians 15:51–55
  - Reading/Connection: Paul ties victory over death to the last trump and
    immortality **put on** (not already possessed).
  - [WB]: `1 Cor 15 — “put on immortality”`
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “Why is it important that immortality is something we
    ‘put on’ at the resurrection?”

### IV. Unity Through Sanctified Truth: Fearless End-Time Citizenship (Philippians 1:27–30; John 17:17–19) (8-10 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The remnant cannot finish the work divided. Unity
  is not organizational sameness; it is shared submission to sanctifying truth
  that reproduces Christ’s character.

#### A. Unity’s foundation: sanctification by truth (5 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** John 17:17
  - Reading/Context: Jesus’ final prayer links unity to sanctification by the
    Word.
  - [WB]: `John 17:17 — Sanctify = truth/Word`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Unity without truth is a counterfeit; truth without
    love becomes a weapon. Jesus gives both: truth that sanctifies into
    Christlike love.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What is God’s means of sanctification in this
    verse?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** John 17:18–19
  - Reading/Connection: Sanctified people are **sent** people.
  - [WB]: `SANCTIFIED -> SENT (mission)`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: God sanctifies us not to isolate us but to
    equip us to represent His character publicly.
  - [EGW]: "Unity is the sure result of Christian perfection." (RC 98).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What would change in our local church if we believed
    unity is a ‘result’ of sanctification, not a substitute for it?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Ephesians 4:1–3
  - Reading/Connection: The Spirit’s unity is kept through humility, meekness,
    longsuffering—character traits, not mere policy.
  - [WB]: `Eph 4:2 — humility/meekness/forbearance`
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Which trait in Ephesians 4:2 is hardest for you
    personally—and why?”

#### B. Fearless striving together: heavenly citizenship under pressure (3-5 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Philippians 1:27
  - Reading/Context: “Conduct worthy” = live as citizens of heaven.
  - [WB]: `Phil 1:27 — “one spirit… one mind… striving together”`
  - Unpacking the Truth: A church that strives together for gospel truth will
    not be easily terrified—because it is grounded in a higher kingdom.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What practical behaviors build ‘one mind’—and what
    behaviors quietly sabotage it?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Philippians 1:28–30
  - Reading/Promise: Opposition is expected; fearlessness is a sign of God’s
    work.
  - [WB]: `Opposition -> “no terror” -> “granted…to suffer”`
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A bundle of sticks is hard to break; single sticks
    snap easily. Satan doesn’t need to destroy truth if he can just separate
    believers.
  - [EGW]: "As pride and worldly ambition have been cherished, the spirit of
    Christ has departed, and emulation, dissension, and strife have come in to
    distract and weaken the church." (5T 240-241).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “Where does pride show up most easily—in doctrine
    debates, personal preferences, or leadership issues? Why?”
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Name one Christlike act (Micah 6:8 style) that could
    heal a strained relationship in our church.”
  - [WB]: List: `Pride -> division -> weakness` / `Humility -> unity -> power`
- **Foundation Text 6:** Revelation 14:12
  - Reading/Connection: End-time perseverance = commandments + faith of Jesus (a
    united, obedient, trusting people).
  - [WB]: `Rev 14:12 — patience / commandments / faith of Jesus`
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does ‘the faith of Jesus’ help us obey without
    becoming harsh or proud?”

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
  - Christ is magnified when self is crucified and Christ lives in us
    (Philippians 1:20–21; Galatians 2:20).
  - The Great Controversy is fought primarily in the mind; Scripture and the
    indwelling Christ are the safeguard (2 Corinthians 10:3–5; Romans 12:2;
    Ephesians 6:17).
  - Death is sleep; resurrection at Christ’s return is our hope and the devil’s
    defeat (John 11:11–13; 1 Thessalonians 4:16–17; 1 Corinthians 15:51–55).
  - Unity is produced by sanctification through truth and expressed in striving
    together fearlessly (John 17:17–19; Ephesians 4:1–3; Philippians 1:27–30).
- Character Focus Recap: God’s end-time goal is a people who reflect
  Jesus—humble, truthful, united, fearless.
  - [WB]: `CHRISTLIKENESS = readiness`
- Call to Action/Decision: Choose one “stronghold” thought to surrender, one
  Scripture to wield daily, and one relationship step toward unity.
  - [WB]: `CAPTURE THOUGHTS (2 Cor 10:5) | ABIDE | STRIVE TOGETHER (Phil 1:27)`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ “What one area will you ask Christ to transform
    so that He is magnified in you this week?”
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: We are not left alone in this war, and eternal
  destinies are at stake.
  - [EGW]: "Live in contact with the living Christ, and He will hold you firmly
    by a hand that will never let go… that love is a fortress impregnable to all
    the delusions and assaults of Satan." (MB 118-119).
  - [WB]: `“Love is a fortress” (MB 119) + 1 Thess 4:16`
