# 2026 Q1 W10 - February 28–March 6

## Complete in Christ

**Overarching Theme:** End-time maturity in Christ: the Cross removes _shadows_
(ceremonial systems) so the Spirit can write God’s _substance_ (Christlike
character and the moral law) into the heart for a final, unmoved witness.  
**Central Focus:** Being “complete in Christ” means union with Jesus through
Scripture and Spirit that produces inward circumcision, steadfast obedience,
love-driven unity, and readiness when “commandments of men” become the world’s
test.  
**Key Texts:** Colossians 2:6–10; Colossians 2:13–17; Revelation 14:12

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Many Christians quote Colossians 2:16–17 against the Sabbath—so why does
  Paul actually say we are **complete in Christ**?
- Theme Introduction: In Colossians 2, Paul uncovers a Great Controversy
  strategy: replace Christ’s sufficiency with religious “extras,” then use those
  extras to judge, divide, and enslave.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title:
    `COMPLETE IN CHRIST = SUBSTANCE (Christ) > SHADOWS (rituals) + OBEDIENCE (moral law)`
- Connection to Character/Eternity: In the last days, the issue is not “less
  religion,” but **false religion**—commandments of men vs commandments of God
  (Rev. 14:12; 18:4–5). Christ aims to restore God’s image in us, not merely
  inform us.
- Roadmap: We will trace Paul’s logic in Colossians 2:
  - Christ’s fullness and church stability (2:1–10)
  - Cross: heart circumcision, forgiveness, and what was nailed (2:11–15)
  - Shadows vs substance; resisting judgment and counterfeit spirituality
    (2:16–19)
  - Freedom from man-made religion; end-time demarcation (2:20–23)

### II. Treasures of Wisdom: Christ’s Fullness Produces Order, Unity, and Steadfastness (14-16 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul’s antidote to deception is not argument
  alone, but **deep union with Christ**—mind, heart, and church life.

#### A. Paul’s burden: strengthened hearts, knitted love, settled faith (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 2:1–2
  - Reading/Context: Paul “struggles” so they may be “encouraged…knit together
    in love…full assurance…knowledge.”
  - [WB]: `2:2 = HEARTS strengthened + LOVE united + UNDERSTANDING assured`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Truth is not merely correct information; it is **Christ
    known**, producing unity and spiritual stability.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What three results does Paul want in verse 2, and
    which one do we often neglect?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Colossians 2:3
  - Reading/Connection: The “treasures” are **hidden in Christ**, not in secret
    rituals, angelic speculations, or human philosophy.
  - [WB]: `IN CHRIST: wisdom + knowledge (not hidden elsewhere)`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: If I look elsewhere for “spiritual
    upgrades,” I subtly declare Christ insufficient—this is the seed of
    apostasy.
  - [EGW]: “God is infinite…in Him are ‘all the treasures of wisdom and
    knowledge.’…to all eternity men may be ever searching…yet they can never
    exhaust…” (FLB 14).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How can ‘always learning’ become dangerous if it is
    not ‘learning Christ’?”
- **Foundation Text 3 (Guardrail):** Colossians 2:4
  - Reading/Challenge: “Lest anyone should deceive you with persuasive words.”
  - [WB]: `Danger: persuasive words (religious, sincere, wrong gospel)`
  - Practical Step: Test every “new emphasis” by: Does it magnify Christ’s
    Cross, uphold Scripture, and produce humble obedience?
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is a modern ‘persuasive word’ that sounds
    spiritual but weakens plain Bible obedience?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like a ship with a beautiful sail but no
    anchor—impressive movement, yet easily drifted by every current.
  - Connecting to Life: Busy church life without heart-anchoring in Christ can
    still drift into pride, controversy, or novelty.

#### B. “As you received…so walk”: rooted, built up, established (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Colossians 2:6–7
  - Reading/Context: Received a Person → walk in Him → rooted/built
    up/established → abounding with thanksgiving.
  - [WB]: Draw simple plant/building diagram:
    `ROOTED (Christ) → BUILT UP (character) → ESTABLISHED (faith)`
  - Unpacking the Truth: The gospel is not a moment only; it is a **walk**—a
    daily surrender where Christ’s life becomes our life.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “Which word in verse 7 describes your current need
    most: rooted, built up, established, or thankful?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Colossians 2:8
  - Reading/Connection: “Beware lest anyone cheat you…tradition…basic
    principles…not according to Christ.”
  - [WB]: `CAPTIVE = tradition + world-principles - Christ`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Captivity can happen inside religion—when
    human authority replaces Scripture and personal piety replaces the Cross.
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like a tree tied to a stake with a ribbon—looks
    secure, but the roots are shallow; the first storm exposes it.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How can a church member be ‘busy’ yet still be
    ‘captive’ to worldly principles?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** Colossians 2:9–10
  - Reading/Promise: “In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily…you
    are complete in Him.”
  - [WB]: `FULLNESS in Christ → COMPLETENESS in believers`
  - Practical Step: Completeness is not achieved by adding man-made rules but by
    receiving Christ’s fullness through Word and Spirit.
  - [EGW]: “If we will acknowledge the power of His Spirit, and submit to be
    molded by it, we shall stand complete in Him… ‘ye are complete in him.’”
    (OHC 152).
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What does ‘submit to be molded’ look like in a real
    conflict at home, work, or church?”

### III. Nailed to the Cross: Heart Circumcision, Forgiveness, and the True Meaning of “Ordinances” (14-16 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul contrasts outward religion with inward
  transformation. The Cross cancels the **shadow-system** that pointed to
  Christ, not the eternal moral law that defines sin.

#### A. Inward circumcision and baptismal union with Christ (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 2:11
  - Reading/Context: “Circumcision made without hands…putting off the body of
    sins.”
  - [WB]: `2:11 = HEART circumcision → SINS put off`
  - Unpacking the Truth: True Christianity is not external badges; it is
    **surgery of the will**—self dethroned, Christ enthroned.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What does Paul say is removed—skin, or sin?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Romans 2:28–29
  - Reading/Connection: “Circumcision is that of the heart…in the Spirit.”
  - [WB]: `OUTWARD vs INWARD (Spirit-written)`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: The last generation cannot survive on
    inherited identity or outward correctness; we must have inward reality.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What is one ‘outward’ thing that can disguise an
    unchanged heart?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Colossians 2:12–13
  - Reading/Promise: Buried/raised with Him…dead made alive…forgiven all
    trespasses.
  - [WB]: `BAPTISM = union with death/resurrection → forgiveness + new life`
  - Practical Step: When temptation comes, argue from union: “I died with
    Christ; I live by His power” (compare Gal. 2:20).
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like a legal adoption: the child’s old identity is
    replaced by a new family name and resources—yet the child must learn the new
    house ways.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where do you struggle to believe God has truly made
    you ‘alive’—and how does baptism language help?”

#### B. What was “blotted out” and what remains (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Colossians 2:14–15
  - Reading/Context: “Handwriting of requirements…taken out of the way…nailed to
    the cross…disarmed principalities.”
  - [WB]: `CROSS: cancels debt/requirements; triumph over powers`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Satan’s accusations are answered at the Cross; the
    ceremonial system that pointed forward reaches fulfillment in Christ.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “If Paul says Christ triumphed over powers, what
    kind of ‘bondage’ is he breaking in this chapter?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Deuteronomy 31:24–26
  - Reading/Connection: Moses’ law written in a book placed beside the ark as a
    witness “against.”
  - [WB]: `Book of Moses (beside ark) ≠ Tables of stone (inside ark)`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Distinguish: ceremonial ordinances
    (shadows) vs moral law (transcript of God’s character).
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “Where was the ‘book of the law’ placed, and why does
    that matter for interpreting Colossians 2?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** Romans 7:7
  - Reading/Connection: Paul defines sin by the moral law (“You shall not
    covet”).
  - [WB]: `Moral law defines sin → cannot be ‘nailed away’`
  - [EGW]: “They claim that the moral law was nailed to the cross. Heavy is the
    veil…Only as they shall come into harmony with the rule of His government,
    can Christ be of any avail…” (1SM 239).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “Why is it spiritually dangerous to say God’s moral
    law ended at the Cross?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ If you tear up a **paid debt notice**, you’re free;
    but if you tear up the **traffic laws**, you don’t get freedom—you get chaos
    and collisions.
  - Connecting to Life: Christ cancels our guilt and the shadow-system; He does
    not cancel the standard that defines love and sin.

### IV. Shadow or Substance: Judgment, Counterfeit Humility, and End-Time Focus on the Real Christ (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul now applies the Cross: don’t let anyone
  judge you by shadows, and don’t let anyone replace Christ with mysticism or
  man-made spirituality.
- [WB]: `Two dangers: (1) SHADOW-JUDGING (2:16) (2) HEAD-LETTING-GO (2:19)`

#### A. The “shadow” calendar and the “substance” of Christ (6-7 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 2:16–17
  - Reading/Context: Food/drink offerings; festival/new moon/sabbaths
    “shadow…substance is Christ.”
  - [WB]: `SHADOW (points forward) → SUBSTANCE (Christ)`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Shadows have value only while they point to Christ;
    once He comes, insisting on the shadow as necessity denies the substance.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “In verse 17, what is the shadow, and what is the
    substance?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Hosea 2:11
  - Reading/Connection: Same sequence (feasts/new moons/sabbaths) in an OT
    ceremonial context.
  - [WB]: `Hosea 2:11 sequence = ceremonial calendar`
  - Deeper Insight: Paul addresses Jewish ceremonial observances, not the Eden
    Sabbath memorial of Creation.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “How does Hosea’s sequence help clarify what kind
    of ‘sabbaths’ Paul likely means?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Mark 2:27–28
  - Reading/Connection: “The sabbath was made for man…Son of man is Lord also of
    the sabbath.”
  - [WB]: `Creation Sabbath = gift + Lordship of Christ`
  - Character Focus: The true Sabbath is not a shadow of a sacrifice; it is a
    weekly training in trust, humility, and loyalty to Christ as
    Creator-Redeemer.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “How does Sabbath-keeping expose whether my religion
    is self-powered or Christ-centered?”
- **Foundation Text 4:** Isaiah 58:13–14
  - Reading/Connection: “Call the sabbath a delight…honour him…then shalt thou
    delight thyself in the Lord.”
  - [WB]: `Sabbath = DELIGHT → character joy in God`
  - Practical Step: Prepare for the end-time test by practicing Sabbath as
    delight now: speech, appetite, entertainment, and compassion brought under
    Christ.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What is one change that would make your Sabbath more
    ‘delight’ and less ‘duty’?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A wedding ring is precious, but if someone clings to
    the ring while rejecting the spouse, it becomes hypocrisy—shadows without
    Christ.
  - Connecting to Life: We can defend forms (even correct ones) yet miss the
    Person; Christ must be the substance of every practice.

#### B. Don’t be “cheated”: angel worship, false humility, and losing the Head (4-5 mins)

- **Foundation Text 5:** Colossians 2:18–19
  - Reading/Context: False humility, worship of angels, “not holding fast to the
    Head.”
  - [WB]: `Hold fast to the Head → growth from God`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Anything that looks spiritual but loosens our grip on
    Jesus is end-time deception.
  - [EGW]: “Today…the enemy…seeking to lead souls into forbidden paths…The
    follower of Christ will meet with the ‘enticing words’…Keeping his eyes
    fixed on Christ…discarding all ideas not in harmony with His teaching.” (AA
    474–475).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What are modern ‘angel-worship’ equivalents—spiritual
    fascination that displaces Scripture and Christ?”
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What helps you ‘hold fast to the Head’ when you feel
    spiritually dry?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** Colossians 2:20–23
  - Reading/Connection: “Why…subject to regulations—‘Do not touch’…according to
    the commandments and doctrines of men…having appearance of wisdom…no value
    against the indulgence of the flesh.”
  - [WB]: `Man-made rules: LOOK holy → can’t CHANGE heart`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Legalism cannot crucify appetite, pride,
    lust, or temper; only union with Christ can.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation/Interpretation):_ “What does Paul say human regulations
    cannot accomplish in verse 23?”
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A coat of paint can hide rot on wood for a while, but
    only replacing the inside can save the house.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where do you most rely on ‘paint’ (appearance)
    instead of Christ’s inward work?”

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
  - Christ contains all wisdom and fullness (Col. 2:3, 9–10).
  - The Cross brings heart circumcision, forgiveness, and triumph over accusing
    powers (Col. 2:11–15).
  - Ceremonial shadows cannot replace Christ the substance; man-made
    spirituality must not judge or rule the conscience (Col. 2:16–19, 20–23).
  - End-time fidelity is Christ-centered obedience, not human regulation (Rev.
    14:12; compare Col. 2:8, 20–23).
- Character Focus Recap: Completeness is Christ reproducing His character in
  us—love that unites the church and obedience that proves the gospel’s power.
  - [WB]: `MATURITY = Christ’s life in me (love + obedience + humility)`
- Call to Action/Decision: Choose one “shadow replacement” to lay down (pride,
  man-made standards, spiritual fads) and one “substance practice” to strengthen
  (daily Bible intake, prayerful surrender, Sabbath delight).
  - [WB]: `HOLD FAST TO THE HEAD (Col. 2:19)`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ “Based on God’s Word today, what one area will
    you ask Christ to make truly ‘complete’ this week?”
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The last conflict will exalt commandments of
  men, but God will have a people who shine in obedience through Christ’s
  righteousness.
  - [EGW]: “The time is not far distant when the test will come to every
    soul…The contest will be between the commandments of God and the
    commandments of men…” (LUH 164).
  - [WB]: `Rev. 14:12 — “Here are they…”`
