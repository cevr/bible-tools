# 2026 Q1 W4 - January 17–23

## Unity Through Humility

**Overarching Theme:** End-time **oneness in Christ** is produced only by the
**cross-shaped mind** of Jesus—humility that dies to self, receives
heart-renewal, and becomes the Spirit’s witness to the world.  
**Central Focus:** God is preparing a people for Christ’s soon return by
restoring His image in us—**the mind of Christ**—so the church may live John 17
unity (not human uniformity) and reveal the final gospel witness.  
**Key Texts:** Philippians 2:1–11; John 17:20–23; Romans 12:2

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Unity sounds beautiful—until someone disagrees with me. Why is **church
  unity** so hard, and why does heaven treat it as urgent?
- Theme Introduction: Unity is not mainly organizational; it is **Christ’s
  character reproduced in His body**—humility that crucifies pride.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: `UNITY THROUGH HUMILITY = THE MIND OF CHRIST`
- Connection to Character/Eternity: Disunity is Satan’s old signature (Isa.
  14:12–14); Christlike unity is heaven’s final witness before the Second Coming
  (John 17:21).
- Roadmap: We will trace (1) the root of disunity (self), (2) the cure (the mind
  of Christ), (3) the method (Spirit-led mind/heart renewal), and (4) the
  end-time purpose (witness + readiness).

### II. The Root Problem: Prideful Self as Satan’s Seed in the Church (13-15 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul does not begin with policies—he begins with
  the **heart**, because the Great Controversy began with pride.

#### A. Selfish ambition and “empty glory” fracture Christ’s body (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 2:1–3
  - Reading/Context: A beloved church is being pulled apart by rivalry and
    conceit.
  - [WB]: `Phil 2:3 — selfish ambition + conceit`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Disunity is not first a doctrinal issue; it is often
    **a spirit issue**—self seeking “first place.”
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “From Phil. 2:3, what two attitudes does Paul forbid
    as unity-killers?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** James 3:16
  - Reading/Connection: Where envy/self-seeking reigns, confusion and “every
    evil thing” follows.
  - [WB]: Draw simple flow: `ENVY/SELF → CONFUSION → EVIL`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Satan does not need to destroy the church
    by persecution if he can destroy it by **competition**.
  - [EGW]: “Nothing can perfect a perfect unity in the church but the spirit of
    Christlike forbearance. Satan can sow discord; Christ alone can harmonize
    the disagreeing elements.” (RC 200).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “Why is ‘Christlike forbearance’ stronger than merely
    ‘being nice’?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Isaiah 14:12–14
  - Reading/Challenge: Lucifer’s five “I will” statements reveal the original
    spirit behind rivalry.
  - [WB]: `Isa 14 — “I will” spirit vs. “Thy will” spirit`
  - Practical Step: Ask God to expose where my inner language is “I deserve / I
    want / I will.”
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A crack in a dam begins small—but under pressure it
    widens. Pride is the “hairline crack” that becomes a flood of division.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where do you most feel tempted to ‘prove
    yourself’—home, work, or church—and how does that affect unity?”

#### B. The heart is deceitful: we cannot diagnose ourselves without God (6-7 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Jeremiah 17:9
  - Reading/Context: The heart is deceitful; self-justification feels sincere
    but is still deception.
  - [WB]: `Jer 17:9 — self can’t be trusted as final judge`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Many conflicts persist because both sides feel
    “right”—but sincerity is not sanctification.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation/Reflection):_ “How have you seen the heart ‘explain
    away’ a wrong spirit while still claiming to defend truth?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** 1 Corinthians 8:2
  - Reading/Connection: Thinking we “know” can be a form of pride; knowledge
    without humility can wound unity.
  - [WB]: `1 Cor 8:2 — knowing ≠ maturity`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: God calls us to be firm in truth and tender
    in spirit; pride can make “truth” a weapon.
  - [EGW]: “If you trust in your own strength and wisdom, you will surely fail.
    God calls for complete and entire consecration…” (CT 94).
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What does ‘complete consecration’ look like in a
    disagreement—what would you stop doing, and what would you start doing?”

### III. The Cure: Beholding the Condescension of Christ Produces the Mind of Christ (16-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul’s remedy is not first “try harder”—it is
  **behold Jesus** until the Spirit reproduces His humility in us.

#### A. Christ’s downward path is the blueprint for upward unity (9-10 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 2:5–8
  - Reading/Context: The command is clear: “Let this mind be in you…”
  - [WB]: `Phil 2:5 — COMMAND: “Let this mind be in you”`
  - Unpacking the Truth (simple but deep):
    - **Equal with God** (v.6) yet chose self-emptying love.
    - “Emptied Himself” (v.7): not ceasing to be God, but laying aside divine
      prerogatives to live as a true man dependent on the Father.
    - “Humbled Himself…to death” (v.8): humility is proved by **obedience under
      pressure**.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “In v.7–8, list the verbs describing Christ’s
    choices. What direction do they all move?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Matthew 23:11–12
  - Reading/Connection: Greatness in Christ’s kingdom is measured by
    **service**, not status.
  - [WB]: `Greatness = Servanthood`
  - Character Need: If I must be “seen,” I am not yet seeing Jesus clearly.
  - [EGW]: “To love God with all the heart, to be a partaker with Christ in His
    humiliation and suffering… The mind of man is to blend with the mind of
    Christ.” (LUH 229).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What changes in a church when greatness is defined by
    who serves most quietly?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Two ladders: one is leaned against the wall of
    **self-exaltation**; the other is leaned against the cross of
    **self-emptying**. Only one reaches heaven.
  - Connecting to Life: Unity grows where members choose the “downward ladder”
    daily—listening, yielding, serving.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one ‘downward step’ (a humble choice) you
    can take this week that would heal a relationship?”

#### B. Why His humanity matters: He is able to help the tempted (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 3:** Romans 8:3
  - Reading/Context: Christ came “in the likeness of sinful flesh” and condemned
    sin in the flesh.
  - [WB]: `Rom 8:3 — sin condemned “in the flesh”`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Jesus entered our battlefield to win where Adam fell—so
    victory is not theory.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “What does it mean that sin was ‘condemned’ in
    Christ’s flesh—what hope does that give for character change?”
- **Foundation Text 4:** Hebrews 2:14–18
  - Reading/Connection: He took our nature, faced death, became a merciful High
    Priest, and **helps** the tempted.
  - [WB]: `Heb 2:18 — “able to help”`
  - Practical Step: When tempted to speak, criticize, or win—claim His present
    help before the words form.
  - [EGW]: “Even the thoughts must be brought into subjection to the will of
    God… Every thought must be brought into captivity to the obedience of
    Christ.” (HP 164).
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “In conflict, what usually happens first—wrong
    thoughts, wrong feelings, or wrong words? How can we interrupt the chain?”

### IV. The Method and Mission: Spirit-led Mind Renewal Produces Unity as End-Time Witness (9-10 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Unity is not manufactured; it is the fruit of
  **sanctification by truth** through the Spirit, answering Christ’s prayer.

#### A. Christ prayed for an attainable oneness—and we must live the prayer (5-6 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** John 17:20–23
  - Reading/Context: Jesus prays for all future believers—oneness “that the
    world may believe.”
  - [WB]: `John 17 — UNITY → WORLD BELIEVES`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Heaven measures evangelistic credibility by
    **Spirit-produced unity**.
  - [EGW]: “Let them study the seventeenth of John… learn how to pray and how to
    live the prayer of Christ… Perfect oneness… is what will give success to the
    efforts of God’s workers.” (RC 200).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does John 17 connect unity directly to
    mission—what does the world conclude when we cannot love each other?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Ephesians 4:3
  - Reading/Connection: We “keep” unity the Spirit produces; we don’t create it
    by politics.
  - [WB]: `Eph 4:3 — keep the unity of the Spirit`
  - Practical Step: In every disagreement ask: “Does my spirit help keep the
    Spirit’s unity—or grieve Him?”
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Mountain climbers roped together: if one slips, the
    others hold him until he regains footing—**the Spirit ties us together**
    (cf. lesson illustration).
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Who in our church is ‘slipping’ right now, and what
    would it look like to hold them up without approving sin?”

#### B. Mind renewal: what we meditate on becomes what we are (4-5 mins)

- **Foundation Text 3:** Romans 12:2
  - Reading/Context: Transformation happens by the renewing of the mind so we
    can discern God’s will.
  - [WB]: `Rom 12:2 — TRANSFORMED by mind renewal`
  - Unpacking the Truth: End-time readiness is not mere information; it is
    **re-formation** into Christ’s likeness.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one repeated input (media, conversations,
    habits) that is discipling your mind away from Christ?”
- **Foundation Text 4:** Philippians 4:8
  - Reading/Challenge: The mind must be intentionally set—truth, purity,
    loveliness.
  - [WB]: `Phil 4:8 — “Meditate on these” (input → output)`
  - Obstacles & Solution: The obstacle is passive consumption; the solution is
    active, prayerful selection + Scripture meditation.
  - [EGW]: “The beginning of yielding to temptation is… permitting the mind to
    waver… Every thought must be brought into captivity… Natural tendencies are
    to be overcome.” (OHC 87).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How would a church change if we all practiced Phil.
    4:8 all week before coming to Sabbath?”

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
  - Disunity springs from Lucifer’s spirit of self (Isa. 14; Phil. 2:3; James
    3:16).
  - Unity is produced by the **mind of Christ**—self-emptying obedience and
    service (Phil. 2:5–8).
  - This mind is formed by Spirit-led heart/mind renewal through truth (John 17;
    Rom. 12:2; Phil. 4:8).
- Character Focus Recap: God is preparing a people whose unity is the evidence
  that Christ truly lives within—**Christ’s image restored**.
  - [WB]: `CHRISTLIKE FORBEARANCE`
- Call to Action/Decision: Choose one relationship or church connection where
  you will practice Phil. 2:3–4 this week—listen first, pray first, serve first.
  - [WB]: `"LET THIS MIND BE IN YOU" (Phil 2:5)`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ “Based on God’s Word today, what one area of
    pride will you ask Christ to crucify in you this week?”
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The last message must be carried by a united
  people—close to Christ, close to each other—so the world may believe and we
  may be ready.
  - [EGW]: “Complete union with Christ and with one another is absolutely
    necessary to the perfection of believers.” (RC 200).
  - [WB]: `John 17:21 — “that the world may believe”`
