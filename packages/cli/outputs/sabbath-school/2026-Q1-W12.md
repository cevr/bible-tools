# 2026 Q1 W12 - March 14–20

## Living With Each Other

**Overarching Theme:** The gospel produces an end-time people whose **Christlike
character** is proven in close relationships—home, church, and workplace—through
**mutual submission, sanctified speech, and persevering prayer**.  
**Central Focus:** God is restoring His image in us (sanctification) so that our
daily conduct becomes a living witness to outsiders—preparing a unified, mature
people for Christ’s soon return.  
**Key Texts:** Col. 3:12–17; Col. 3:18–4:6; John 17:17–23

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: In your closest relationships, what is harder—**being right** or being
  **Christlike**?
- Theme Introduction: The deepest test of Christianity is not in public, but in
  **proximity**—living “with each other.” Colossians shows that the gospel is
  not merely believed; it is **lived** in the home and in daily speech.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title:
    `THE GOSPEL IN PROXIMITY = CHRISTLIKE CHARACTER`
- Connection to Character/Eternity: End-time readiness is not just prophetic
  knowledge; it is the sealing work of Christ’s character reproduced in His
  people (Rev. 14:5). The last deception will exploit selfishness and division;
  God calls for unity in truth and love.
- Roadmap:
  - The gospel in the **home** (wives/husbands; children/parents) — Col.
    3:18–21; Eph. 5:21–25, 33
  - The gospel at **work** — Col. 3:22–4:1; 1 Pet. 2:16
  - The gospel in **prayer, walk, and speech** toward outsiders — Col. 4:2–6; 1
    Thess. 5:17

### II. The Home as God’s Workshop for Sanctification (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul’s “household code” is not Roman domination
  baptized; it is the cross applied to family life—where selfishness dies and
  Christ’s spirit reigns.

#### A. Marriage: Mutual Submission Under Christ (8-9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Ephesians 5:21
  - Reading/Context: This is the heading over the whole passage—before roles are
    described, the spirit is established.
  - [WB]: `Eph 5:21 = "SUBMIT TO ONE ANOTHER" (reverence for Christ)`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Biblical submission begins with **reverence for
    Christ**, not fear of humans. It is voluntary yielding for the other’s
    good—Christ’s way of power.
  - [DQ]: *(Observation):* 'According to Eph. 5:21, what is the motive for submission?'
- **Foundation Text 2:** Colossians 3:18–19
  - Reading/Connection: Two commands, two protections—wife’s submission is “**in
    the Lord**,” husband’s love is without **bitterness**.
  - [WB]: `Col 3:18-19: "in the Lord" / "not bitter"`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need:
    - “As is fitting in the Lord” means: loyalty to Christ is first; conscience
      cannot be absorbed by a spouse.
    - “Do not be bitter” strikes at harshness, sarcasm, control—spirit of
      tyranny is forbidden in a Christian home.
  - [EGW]: "How much trouble and what a tide of woe and unhappiness would be
    saved if men, and women also, would continue to cultivate the regard,
    attention, and kind words of appreciation and little courtesies of life
    which kept love alive." (HP 206).
  - [WB]: `HP 206: "little courtesies... kept love alive"`
  - [DQ]: *(Reflection):* 'What does ‘bitterness’ look like in real life—tone, timing, sarcasm, silence? Which one is most dangerous in your home?'
- **Foundation Text 3:** Ephesians 5:25, 33
  - Reading/Challenge: Husbandly headship is defined by Calvary—“gave Himself.”
    Respect is cultivated in the atmosphere of sacrificial love.
  - [WB]: `Eph 5:25 = "LOVE = SACRIFICE"` and `Eph 5:33 = "RESPECT"`
  - Practical Step: Replace one recurring pattern this week (criticism,
    coldness, impatience) with one concrete “courtesy of life” (thanks, apology,
    gentle tone, helpful act).
  - [DQ]: *(Application):* 'If Christ measured His love the way we sometimes measure ours (when the other ‘deserves’ it), what would happen to us? What does that teach us about marriage?'
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like two stones in a tumbler—close contact reveals
    rough edges, but constant “friction” with the right medium produces polish.
    The medium is **Christ’s grace**, not human force.
  - Connecting to Life: Marriage is not mainly for comfort; it is for
    character—God uses closeness to expose selfishness so we can surrender it.
  - [DQ]: *(Simple/Personal):* 'What ‘rough edge’ does closeness most quickly reveal in you—impatience, pride, defensiveness, control?'

#### B. Parenting: Authority Without Provocation; Training for the Final Crisis (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Colossians 3:20–21
  - Reading/Context: Children obey “in all things” (within God’s will);
    fathers/parents must not crush the spirit.
  - [WB]: `Col 3:21 -> "DISCOURAGED" (danger sign)`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - Obedience is worship: “well pleasing to the Lord.”
    - Provocation produces discouragement—children may comply outwardly but lose
      heart inwardly.
  - [EGW]: "Satan is well pleased when parents irritate their children by
    speaking harsh, angry words... you can not lead them to the right by losing
    patience with them." (RH Jan. 24, 1907).
  - [WB]: `RH 1907: harsh words -> discouragement`
  - [DQ]: *(Reflection):* 'How can a parent be ‘right’ in rules but ‘wrong’ in spirit—and what does that do to a child’s picture of God?'
- **Foundation Text 5:** Deuteronomy 6:6–7
  - Reading/Connection: True training is daily, conversational, and
    saturating—truth in the home atmosphere.
  - [WB]: `Deut 6:7 = "DILIGENTLY" + daily moments`
  - Deeper Insight & End-time Preparation: Children are not merely to behave;
    they are to be formed into principled believers who can stand when
    pressured.
  - [EGW]: "There has been too little definite work done in preparing our
    children for the tests... strong enough to resist temptation... The Lord is
    soon coming, and we must prepare for this solemn event." (HP 208).
  - [DQ]: *(Application):* 'What is one daily moment in your home (meals, rides, bedtime) that could become a ‘Deut. 6’ discipleship moment this week?'
- **Foundation Text 6:** Proverbs 22:6, 15
  - Reading/Challenge: Training includes direction and correction; folly must
    not be excused as personality.
  - [WB]: `Prov 22:6: "train up"` and `Prov 22:15: "folly..."`
  - Practical Step: Combine **firmness + tenderness**—consistent boundaries, but
    calm tones and quick forgiveness.
  - [DQ]: *(Deeper):* 'How do we correct folly without ‘provoking’? What balance do these verses demand?'
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A sapling tied to a stake—too loose and it grows
    crooked; too tight and it is damaged. God’s method is **steady guidance**
    with room to grow.
  - Connecting to Life: Discipline is not venting adult frustration; it is
    shaping a soul for eternity.
  - [DQ]: *(Personal):* 'If your child (or a younger person watching you) learns ‘God’s character’ from your reactions, what picture are they receiving?'

### III. The Gospel in Daily Labor and Public Witness: Prayer, Wisdom, and Speech (16-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul moves from inside relationships to
  outsiders. Heaven’s order is: the gospel reforms the home first, then the
  church becomes credible to the world.

#### A. Work Relations: Serving Christ in Every Task (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 3:22–24
  - Reading/Context: “Not with eyeservice… but in sincerity of heart, fearing
    God… you serve the Lord Christ.”
  - [WB]: `Col 3:23 = "HEARTILY... AS TO THE LORD"`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Work is a character test—faithfulness when unseen
    reveals whether Christ truly rules within.
  - [DQ]: *(Observation):* 'What phrases in Col. 3:22–23 show God cares about motives, not just performance?'
- **Foundation Text 2:** Colossians 4:1
  - Reading/Connection: Those with authority answer to a higher
    Authority—justice and fairness are gospel obligations.
  - [WB]: `Col 4:1 = "YOU ALSO HAVE A MASTER"`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: The Great Controversy issue is
    government—Satan rules by coercion; Christ rules by love and justice.
    Christian leadership must mirror Christ.
  - [DQ]: *(Reflection):* 'If every boss truly believed ‘I also have a Master in heaven,’ what would change Monday morning?'
- **Foundation Text 3:** 1 Peter 2:16
  - Reading/Challenge: Freedom in Christ is not license; it is power to serve.
  - [WB]: `1 Pet 2:16 = "FREE... SERVANTS OF GOD"`
  - Practical Step: Choose one workplace habit to sanctify: punctuality,
    honesty, speech, attitude under correction, refusal to gossip.
  - [DQ]: *(Application):* 'Where is it hardest to ‘serve Christ’ at work—when undervalued, when tired, when treated unfairly, or when tempted to cut corners?'
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A uniform doesn’t change the person, but it identifies
    who they represent. At work, we “wear” Christ’s name—our conduct is His
    reputation.
  - [DQ]: *(Personal):* 'What ‘uniform’ do people see when they watch you—complainer, peacemaker, dependable, sharp-tongued?'

#### B. Prayer, Wise Walk, and Gracious Speech: The End-time Witness (9-10 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Colossians 4:2–4
  - Reading/Context: “Continue earnestly… vigilant… with thanksgiving… a door
    for the word… speak as I ought.”
  - [WB]: `Col 4:2 = CONTINUE / VIGILANT / THANKFUL`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - The church advances on its knees; prayer opens doors human talent cannot.
    - Paul asks not for comfort but for clarity and opportunity—mission-minded
      prayer.
  - [EGW]: "It is a part of God’s plan to grant us, in answer to the prayer of
    faith, that which He would not bestow did we not thus ask." (GC 525).
  - [WB]: `GC 525: God gives some things only when we ask`
  - [DQ]: *(Reflection):* 'Why would God choose to withhold some blessings until we ask? What does that develop in us?'
- **Foundation Text 5:** 1 Thessalonians 5:17 (with Rom. 8:26 support)
  - Reading/Connection: “Pray without ceasing”—a life in communion, not a
    posture only.
  - [WB]: `1 Thess 5:17 = "UNBROKEN COMMUNION"`
  - Deeper Insight: Constant prayer is not constant talking; it is constant
    dependence—how we overcome in the last days.
  - [EGW]: "Cultivate the habit of talking with the Saviour... when you are
    walking, and when you are busy with your daily labor... Let every breath be
    a prayer." (MH 510-511).
  - [DQ]: *(Application):* 'What daily trigger could remind you to pray—phone notifications, doorways, starting the car, washing hands?'
- **Foundation Text 6:** Colossians 4:5–6
  - Reading/Challenge: “Walk in wisdom toward outsiders… speech always with
    grace, seasoned with salt.”
  - [WB]: `Col 4:5 = "MAKE THE MOST OF TIME"` and `Col 4:6 = GRACE + SALT`
  - Unpacking the Truth Simply:
    - **Grace** = words shaped by Christ’s undeserved favor.
    - **Salt** = words that preserve, heal, and make truth attractive—never
      corrupting, never bland compromise.
    - “Answer each one” = individualized, Spirit-led witness; not a one-size
      script.
  - [EGW]: "The Lord requires us... today to watch that we offend not in word or
    deed... watch and work and pray as though this were the last day." (AG 261).
  - [WB]: `AG 261: "offend not in word or deed" (TODAY)`
  - [DQ]: *(Observation):* 'What do you think ‘salt’ adds to speech—truthfulness, tact, courage, winsomeness, restraint?'
  - [DQ]: *(Heart-level):* 'Which most threatens ‘gracious speech’ in you—stress, feeling disrespected, politics, family tension, or online interactions?'
  - [DQ]: *(Practice):* 'What is one sentence you could replace this week (a jab, complaint, exaggeration) with a ‘grace + salt’ sentence?'
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like seasoning in soup—too little and it’s bland; too
    much and it’s inedible. The Spirit teaches proportion: truth spoken in love
    at the right time.
  - Connecting to Life: Many lose their witness not by denying doctrine, but by
    an un-Christlike spirit in ordinary conversation.

  - [WB]: `SYMpathy + TENDERness + LOVE = Christ in the home/church`
- Call to Action/Decision: Choose one relationship (spouse, child, parent,
  coworker, church member) and make one intentional gospel step today: humble
  apology, prayer commitment, or a “grace + salt” conversation.
  - [WB]: Write: `"LET YOUR SPEECH... WITH GRACE" (Col 4:6)`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God’s Word today, what one area will
    you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: God gives grace for **today’s** trials;
  readiness is built in today’s words, tones, and choices.
  - [EGW]: "We must today seek God... watch and work and pray as though this
    were the last day." (AG 261).
  - [WB]: `TODAY = the day character is sealed for eternity`
