# 2026 Q1 W11 - March 7–13

## Living With Christ

**Overarching Theme:** Union with Christ produces end-time-ready character:
**dying to self, setting the mind above, and putting on love—the bond of
perfection**  
**Central Focus:** Christ as our life (Col. 3:4) means a daily, Spirit-empowered
exchange of the old man for the new, until the image of God is restored in us
for the closing conflict.  
**Key Texts:** Col. 3:1–4; Rom. 6:4–11; Col. 3:12–14

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: “If someone watched your thoughts for one day, would they conclude you
  are **living with Christ**—or merely living near religious things?”
- Theme Introduction: Paul’s message is not superficial morality; it is **union
  with Christ** that creates a heavenly-minded people who can stand in the last
  days.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: `UNION WITH CHRIST → NEW LIFE → PERFECT LOVE`
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This is preparation for the soon-coming
  crisis: only those who **die before they live** can reflect Christ’s character
  and endure.
- Roadmap: We will trace Colossians 3 in three movements:
  - Raised with Christ (mindset)
  - Mortify the earthly (death to self)
  - Put on the new (love = perfection) and let the Word dwell richly (daily
    maintenance)

---

### II. Raised With Christ: The Mindset That Governs the Life (14-16 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before Paul lists behaviors, he establishes
  identity: **raised with Christ**. The battle begins in the mind.

#### A. Seek and Set the Mind “Above” (8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 3:1–2
  - Reading/Context: “If then you were raised with Christ…seek…set your mind.”
  - [WB]: `Col 3:1-2` + two verbs: `SEEK` / `SET MIND`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Heavenly-mindedness is not escapism; it is
    **Christ-centered thinking** that governs choices, reactions, priorities,
    relationships.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What are the two commands in Colossians 3:1–2, and
    how are they different?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Colossians 3:3–4
  - Reading/Connection: Our life is “hidden with Christ in God,” and Christ “is
    our life.”
  - [WB]: Draw simple diagram: `ME → hidden → CHRIST → in GOD` (Col 3:3)
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: Hidden life means security in Christ, but
    also **invisible roots** that produce visible fruit. Public religion without
    hidden union collapses under temptation.
  - [EGW]: “The soul that loves God, rises above the fog of doubt… His soul is
    committed to God, hid with Christ in God.” (OHC 86).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What does it look like practically to have your life
    ‘hidden with Christ’ while still living in a very public, stressful world?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** 2 Corinthians 4:16
  - Reading/Challenge: The inward person is renewed “day by day.”
  - [WB]: `DAILY RENEWAL` → not once-for-all emotion
  - Practical Step: Heavenly-mindedness is maintained by daily renewal (Word,
    prayer, surrender), not by past experiences.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What daily habit most strongly turns your mind
    ‘below,’ and what specific habit could replace it this week?”

- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A compass doesn’t move the ship, but it determines
    direction. A Christian’s “mind set above” is the compass; choices follow.
  - Connecting to Life: Many want changed behavior without a changed “north.”
  - [DQ]: _(Personal):_ “What is your ‘true north’ this month—career pressure,
    family stress, politics, entertainment, or Christ?”

#### B. Faith That Rests in God’s Working (6-8 mins) [*]

- **Foundation Text 4:** Romans 6:11
  - Reading/Context: “Reckon yourselves…dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in
    Christ.”
  - [WB]: `RECKON = count as true what God says`
  - Unpacking the Truth: This is not pretending; it is faith accepting God’s
    verdict and living from it.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “Why does Paul command us to ‘reckon’—what does
    that assume about feelings?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** John 15:5
  - Reading/Connection: “Without Me you can do nothing.”
  - [WB]: `0` under “self-effort” / `ALL` under “abide”
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: The old heart tries to reform itself. Union
    means dependence: victory flows from abiding, not striving.
  - [EGW]: “We are not to hold ourselves in our own hands. We are to drop self
    into the hands of God…” (UL 346).
  - [DQ]: _(Heart-search):_ “Where do you trust your own ‘working’ more than
    God’s working for you?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A phone can look “fine” but be dead; connection to the
    power source is what makes it function. Union with Christ is our “charge.”
  - Connecting to Life: Many confuse religious activity with spiritual power;
    Christ calls for abiding dependence.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one ‘religious activity’ you could do this
    week more intentionally as **abiding**, not performing?”

### III. Mortify the Earthly: Death to Self in the Great Controversy (14-16 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul moves from identity to warfare: because we
  are raised, we must execute the old life. This is end-time language—**no
  neutrality**.

#### A. Putting to Death the Old Life (8-9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 3:5
  - Reading/Context: “Put to death…fornication…evil desire…covetousness, which
    is idolatry.”
  - [WB]: `Col 3:5` + circle `COVETOUSNESS = IDOLATRY`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Earthliness is not only outward acts; it is
    **disordered desire**—loving created things more than the Creator.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “Which item in the list surprises you most, and why
    might Paul include it?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Romans 6:1–7
  - Reading/Connection: Baptism symbolizes death/burial; “our old man was
    crucified.”
  - [WB]: Timeline sketch: `CROSS → TOMB → NEW WALK` (Rom 6:4-6)
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: We don’t tame the old man; we crucify him.
    The “old self” fights back through habits and hereditary tendencies.
  - [EGW]: “Each day he must renew his consecration, each day do battle with
    evil. Old habits, hereditary tendencies to wrong, will strive for the
    mastery…” [EGW] (AA 476.2).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “In your experience, what makes ‘old habits’ return
    strongest—fatigue, loneliness, anger, success, discouragement?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** 1 Corinthians 10:12–13
  - Reading/Context: “Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
    fall…God is faithful…make a way to escape.”
  - [WB]: `WARNING + PROMISE` (1 Cor 10:12-13)
  - Practical Warning: Mortification requires vigilance and hope: God exposes
    temptation, then provides escape and strength to endure.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What has been your most common ‘point of
    overconfidence’—the place you assume you’re safe?”
- **Foundation Text 4:** Romans 1:18 (link to Col. 3:6)
  - Reading/Connection: God’s wrath revealed against ungodliness; the trajectory
    of rejected light.
  - [WB]: `WRATH = God giving up (trajectory of choice)`
  - Practical Warning: Paul ties these sins to final accountability (Col. 3:6).
    End-time readiness is moral readiness.
  - [DQ]: _(Solemn application):_ “How does remembering judgment help us love
    God more rather than fear Him in a slavish way?”

- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ You cannot “negotiate” with cancer; you remove it. Sin
    is not a pet—it is a disease of the soul.
  - Connecting to Life: The gospel does not excuse cherished sin; it
    **delivers** from it through Christ’s life in us.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What ‘respectable’ sin do we most often negotiate
    with instead of mortifying?”

#### B. Putting Away Relational Sins (5-7 mins) [*]

- **Foundation Text 5:** Colossians 3:8–9
  - Reading/Context: “Put off…anger, wrath, malice…filthy language…do not lie.”
  - [WB]: Two columns: `PUT OFF` vs `PUT ON`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Paul targets the sins that destroy church unity and
    home peace. The last-day remnant must reflect Christ in speech.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “Which of these sins is most commonly excused as
    ‘personality’?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** James 1:19–20
  - Reading/Connection: “Slow to wrath…wrath of man does not produce
    righteousness.”
  - [WB]: `SLOW` 'hear/speak/wrath'
  - Character Step: Practice “holy pause” before response; surrender tongue to
    the Spirit.
  - [EGW]: “Be careful of your influence… little things make up life.” (TMK
    209).
  - [DQ]: _(Practical):_ “What would change in your home if you applied James
    1:19 to one recurring conflict?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like toothpaste squeezed out of the tube, words come
    out fast—but they don’t go back in. Sanctification includes the tongue.
  - Connecting to Life: End-time faithfulness is proven in “small” daily speech
    tests that reveal who rules the heart.
  - [DQ]: _(Self-check):_ “When you’re pressured, what kind of words come out
    most naturally—and what does that reveal?”

### IV. Put On Christ: Love as the Bond of Perfection (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The Christian life is not only subtraction (put
  off) but **replacement** (put on). The goal is maturity—Christ reproduced in
  the believer.

#### A. The New Man Renewed Into God’s Image (5-6 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 3:10
  - Reading/Context: “Put on the new man…renewed in knowledge according to the
    image of Him.”
  - [WB]: `IMAGE RESTORED` + arrow: `KNOWLEDGE → TRANSFORMATION`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Redemption restores the image marred at the Fall. This
    is sanctification—real, progressive, and Spirit-driven.
  - [EGW]: “To restore in man the image of his Maker…this was to be the great
    work of redemption.” (AG 246).
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “How is being ‘renewed in knowledge’ more than
    just learning facts?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Ephesians 4:22–24
  - Reading/Connection: Put off old man; be renewed in spirit of mind; put on
    new man “created…in righteousness.”
  - [WB]: `SPIRIT OF THE MIND` (Eph 4:23)
  - Practical Step: Let Scripture re-train instincts—especially reactions under
    pressure.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where do you most need a ‘renewed mind’—media
    habits, money, sexuality, temper, or unforgiveness?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** 2 Corinthians 3:18
  - Reading/Context: “Beholding…are changed…from glory to glory…by the Spirit.”
  - [WB]: `BEHOLD → BECOME` (2 Cor 3:18)
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: The method of perfection is relational: we
    become like what we steadily contemplate.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What do you ‘behold’ most consistently—screens,
    worries, people’s opinions, or Christ in His Word?”

- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A mirror doesn’t generate light; it reflects what it
    faces. The soul reflects what it beholds.
  - Connecting to Life: If we want Christlike patience, we must behold Christ’s
    patience until it imprints the heart.
  - [DQ]: _(Simple):_ “What ‘old garment’ (habit or attitude) is easiest to
    recognize in yourself?”

#### B. Love: The Bond of Perfection in a Diverse Church (5-6 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Colossians 3:12–14
  - Reading/Context: Elect, holy, beloved—therefore put on mercy,
    kindness…forgive…and above all love.
  - [WB]: Circle `LOVE` and write: `BOND OF PERFECTION` (Col 3:14)
  - Unpacking the Truth: Perfection here is not mere flawlessness; it is
    **mature Christlikeness**—love that holds all virtues together under
    pressure.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “Why is love called a ‘bond’? What happens to
    kindness/humility when love is absent?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Colossians 3:11
  - Reading/Connection: In Christ there is no ethnic/social superiority; Christ
    is “all and in all.”
  - [WB]: `CHRIST > identity markers` (race/class/education)
  - Great Controversy Implication: Satan’s strategy is division; Christ’s proof
    to the world is unity in truth and love.
  - [EGW]: “Unity in diversity…this is the testimony that God sent His Son… In
    unity there is strength; in division there is weakness.” (SD 286).
  - [DQ]: _(Church application):_ “What is one practical way our class/church
    can show unity without erasing differences?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** Colossians 3:16–17
  - Reading/Context: Let the word of Christ dwell richly; teach/admonish;
    psalms/hymns/spiritual songs; do all in Jesus’ name.
  - [WB]: `WORD DWELL RICHLY → SONG → THANKS → DO ALL in JESUS' NAME`
  - Practical Safeguard: The Word in the heart produces stability; sacred music
    becomes a vehicle of truth and mutual encouragement.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “How can music either help the Word ‘dwell richly’ or
    push it out—and what boundaries should we set?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A bundle of sticks: one breaks easily, bound together
    they resist pressure. Love “binds” virtues into resilient character.
  - Connecting to Life: The final crisis will test whether our religion is
    private opinion or covenant love that holds under friction.
  - [DQ]: _(Heart check):_ “Who is hardest for you to ‘put on’ compassion
    toward, and what might Christ be teaching you through that?”

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths:
  - Union with Christ is real: raised with Him, hidden in Him, and soon to
    appear with Him (Col. 3:1–4).
  - The old life must be mortified, not managed (Col. 3:5; Rom. 6:6; 1 Cor.
    10:12–13).
  - The new life is Christ’s character: love as the bond of perfection (Col.
    3:12–14; 2 Cor. 3:18).
- Character Focus Recap: God is restoring His image in us for the final witness;
  this is the purpose of redemption and daily trials.
  - [WB]: `LOVE = PERFECTION (mature Christlikeness)`
- Call to Action/Decision: Choose one “put off” and one “put on” for this week,
  and connect it to a daily plan (Word + prayer + surrender).
  - [WB]: `PUT OFF ____ / PUT ON ____`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what one area will
    you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Moral and spiritual perfection is promised
  through Christ’s power—not human strength.
  - [EGW]: “Moral and spiritual perfection, through the grace and power of
    Christ, is promised to all… At every step we touch His living power.” (AA
    477.2–478.1).
  - [WB]: `Col 3:14` / `CHRIST OUR LIFE (Col 3:4)`
