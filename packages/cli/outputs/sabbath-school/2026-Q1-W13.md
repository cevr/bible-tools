# 2026 Q1 W13 - March 21–27

## Standing in All the Will of God

**Overarching Theme:** God’s end-time purpose is to form a people who
**stand**—mature, steadfast, and fully surrendered—through Christ’s indwelling
life, in united mission, against the spirit of the world.  
**Central Focus:** From Colossians 4 and companion texts, see how Christ
produces **settled, sanctified character** (“perfect and complete”) through
fervent intercession, church-connected faithfulness, and watchful separation
from worldliness—so we can stand in the final crisis.  
**Key Texts:** Col. 4:12; Eph. 6:10–13; 2 Pet. 3:10–14

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: If God answered one prayer over our church this week, what would it
  be—**more comfort**, **more unity**, or **more holiness**?
- Theme Introduction: Colossians ends with greetings and “small details,” but
  the Holy Spirit hides a **deep end-time blueprint** in plain sight: God is
  preparing a people to **stand in all His will**.
  - [WB]: Title: `STANDING IN ALL THE WILL OF GOD`
  - [WB]: Equation: `SURRENDER + UNITY + HOLINESS = STAND`
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The last days will not be survived by
  talent, arguments, or excitement, but by **settled character** formed by
  Christ (2 Pet. 3:14; Rev. 3:21).
- Roadmap:
  - God stabilizes believers through a **connected body** and faithful
    messengers (Col. 4:7–11).
  - God’s goal is **mature completeness** through fervent prayer and surrender
    (Col. 4:12; Heb. 13:20–21; Col. 2:10).
  - The final crisis reveals **two loves**: Christ vs. this world (Col. 4:14; 2
    Tim. 4:10–11).
  - Standing leads to shining: holiness that becomes **mission light** (Isa.
    60:1–3; Rev. 18:1–4).

---

### II. Standing requires a connected body: Christ builds stability through faithful messengers and united labor (12-14 mins)

- Introduction to Section: Paul’s closing greetings are not “small talk”; they
  are **God’s method** for preserving faith and forming character—He keeps us
  standing through **covenant fellowship and shared mission**.

#### A. Faithful messengers strengthen hearts and protect the flock (6-7 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 4:7–9
  - Reading/Context: Tychicus and Onesimus carry more than information—they
    carry **comfort** and **encouragement** to a pressured church.
  - [WB]: `Col 4:7-9 -> COMFORT / ENCOURAGE`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - God uses **faithful people** (not celebrities) to stabilize His church.
    - “Comfort” here is not sentimental—it is strengthening the will to obey
      under pressure.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What titles does Paul give Tychicus and Onesimus?
    What kind of character do those words describe?”
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Who has been a ‘Tychicus’ to you spiritually—and how
    can you become that to someone else?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Ephesians 6:21–22
  - Reading/Connection: Paul repeats the same pattern—Tychicus is sent to
    **comfort hearts** right in the armor-of-God context.
  - [WB]: `Eph 6:22 -> COMFORT YOUR HEARTS`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need:
    - Discouraged believers become easy prey for compromise; comfort is part of
      spiritual warfare.
    - End-time believers must resist Satan’s strategy of isolating souls.
  - [EGW]: “The golden chain of love, binding the hearts of the believers in
    unity… bears to the world a testimony of the power of Christianity that
    cannot be controverted.” (TMK 173).
  - [WB]: `TMK 173: "golden chain of love"`
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “Why would unity be ‘a testimony… that cannot be
    controverted’? What does disunity preach?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: Illustration: A coal pulled away from the fire cools quickly. The
    enemy doesn’t always tempt us with open sin first—often he tempts us with
    **quiet disconnection**.
  - Connecting to Life: Many drift not by rebellion, but by stopping the habits
    that keep them near the spiritual “fire.”
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one ‘coal-pulling-away’ habit—personally or
    as a church—that cools spiritual life?”

- **Foundation Text 3:** Hebrews 10:24–25
  - Reading/Connection: Scripture commands assembling, exhorting, and doing it
    **more** as the Day approaches.
  - [WB]: `Heb 10:25 -> MORE as the Day approaches`
  - End-time implication:
    - The closer we get to the end, the more we need mutual encouragement—not
      less.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “Why do you think the Bible says ‘more’ fellowship
    as the end nears, when many do the opposite?”

#### B. Unity across differences is part of end-time standing (5-6 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Colossians 4:10–11
  - Reading/Context: Mark is restored, Aristarchus suffers with Paul, Jewish
    coworkers labor alongside Gentile believers.
  - [WB]: `Col 4:10-11 -> RESTORATION + CO-LABORERS`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - The gospel produces a family where past failure can be redeemed into
      usefulness.
    - End-time firmness includes learning to labor with people unlike us.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “What does Paul’s mention of Mark teach about
    God’s view of people who once failed?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Acts 15:36–40
  - Reading/Connection: Even sharp conflict did not end mission—God overruled
    human weakness to widen labor.
  - [WB]: `Acts 15 -> CONFLICT managed -> MISSION continues`
  - Practical character point:
    - Unity is not the absence of friction; it is **surrendered wills** choosing
      Christlike responses.
  - [EGW]: “Those who are truly connected with God will not be at variance with
    one another. The spirit of harmony… will create harmony, love, and unity.”
    (RC 300).
  - [WB]: `RC 300: connected with God -> harmony`
  - [DQ]: _(Heart-check):_ “When I’m ‘at variance,’ what does it reveal about my
    connection with God at that moment?”
  - [DQ]: _(Skill-building):_ “What is one Christlike phrase or action that can
    de-escalate conflict in a family or church board?”

- [SN]: Illustration: A team of oxen must be yoked together; if one pulls his
  own direction, the plow cuts crooked. The yoke doesn’t remove strength—it
  **directs** it.
- [WB]: Simple sketch: `YOKE -> one direction -> straight furrow`

---

### III. Standing perfect and complete: surrender to God’s will produces mature character for the final conflict (14-16 mins)

- Introduction to Section: Colossians 4:12 is a prayer for the remnant: not
  merely forgiven, but **established**—able to stand in “all the will of God.”

#### A. “Stand”: firmness in spiritual warfare comes from God’s power, not self-confidence (6-7 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 4:12
  - Reading/Context: Epaphras “always laboring fervently… in prayers” for them
    to **stand**.
  - [WB]: `Col 4:12 -> LABORING in PRAYER -> STAND`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - Prayer is described as **labor** (wrestling), not decoration.
    - If standing is needed, a battle is assumed.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What does Epaphras do ‘always’? What does that
    reveal about real love?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Ephesians 6:10–13
  - Reading/Connection: We stand in the “evil day” only by being strong **in the
    Lord** and wearing the whole armor.
  - [WB]: `Eph 6:13 -> having done all -> STAND`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need:
    - End-time standing is not human toughness; it is surrendered dependence.
    - Neglect is deadly: we can be defeated without choosing open rebellion.
  - [EGW]: “The soul that is yielded to Christ becomes His own fortress…
    impregnable to the assaults of Satan… The only defense against evil is the
    indwelling of Christ in the heart through faith in His righteousness.” (DA
    324).
  - [WB]: `DA 324: yielded -> fortress / indwelling of Christ`
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What is the difference between trying harder and
    yielding more fully? How can you tell which you’re doing?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Philippians 2:12–13
  - Reading/Connection: We “work out” salvation because God is “working in” both
    will and do.
  - [WB]: `Phil 2:13 -> GOD works in (WILL + DO)`
  - Balance (simple but essential):
    - We cooperate; God supplies power. The will must be surrendered for the
      life to change.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where do you most need God to change your ‘will’
    before your ‘do’ can change?”

- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: Illustration: A castle is secure not because the walls brag, but
    because a loyal King holds it. A fortress with divided loyalty is easily
    taken.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What ‘room in the fortress’ (habit, media,
    resentment, appetite, pride) is most often left unguarded?”

#### B. “Perfect and complete”: maturity means a life fully molded to Christ’s will (8-9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Matthew 5:48
  - Reading/Context: “Be ye therefore perfect” = complete love reflecting the
    Father’s character.
  - [WB]: `Matt 5:48 -> PERFECT = COMPLETE in LOVE`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - Biblical perfection is not cold flawlessness; it is a heart fully
      surrendered, producing consistent Christlikeness.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “How does Jesus connect perfection to the Father’s
    character, not mere external performance?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Hebrews 13:20–21
  - Reading/Connection: God Himself “make you perfect… to do his will,” working
    in us what is pleasing.
  - [WB]: `Heb 13:21 -> GOD equips -> DO HIS WILL`
  - Practical character formation:
    - Trials are not random; God uses them to fit us for heaven by teaching
      obedience, patience, faith.
  - [EGW]: “Sanctification is a progressive work. It is a continuous work,
    leading human beings higher and still higher.” (HP 31).
  - [DQ]: _(Experience):_ “Where have you seen progressive sanctification—slow
    but real—in your life or someone else’s?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** Colossians 2:9–10
  - Reading/Connection: We are “complete in Him” because all fullness dwells in
    Christ.
  - [WB]: `Col 2:10 -> COMPLETE IN HIM`
  - Gospel balance:
    - Completion is not self-improvement; it is union with Christ that produces
      obedience.
  - [EGW]: “If we will acknowledge the power of His Spirit, and submit to be
    molded by it, we shall stand complete in Him.” (AG 196).
  - [WB]: `AG 196: "submit to be molded"`
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What does ‘submit to be molded’ look like in a daily
    routine (prayer, Bible, restitution, guarding thoughts)?”

---

### IV. Standing in the last days: refusing the world’s spirit, shining in Laodicea’s hour (10-12 mins)

- Introduction to Section: Paul’s closing names include a warning: some love the
  world more than Christ. End-time readiness demands separation of the heart,
  and then shining as God’s last-day light.

#### A. Two loves: Luke stayed, Demas left (5-6 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Colossians 4:14
  - Reading/Context: Luke is “beloved”; Demas is named without commendation.
  - [WB]: `Col 4:14 -> LUKE (beloved) / DEMAS (no praise)`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - The Spirit sometimes teaches by what Scripture **does not** add—silence
      can warn.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What might Paul’s silence about Demas be telling
    us?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** 2 Timothy 4:10–11
  - Reading/Connection: Demas forsook, “having loved this present world”; Mark
    is now “profitable.”
  - [WB]: `2 Tim 4:10 -> LOVED WORLD -> FORSOOK`
  - Character warning + hope:
    - Worldliness is transferred allegiance.
    - Mark proves restoration is possible; Demas proves drift can become final
      if unrepented.
  - [DQ]: _(Heart-check):_ “What are modern ways to ‘love this present world’
    while still keeping our name on the church book?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** 1 John 2:15–17
  - Reading/Connection: Love of the world is incompatible with love of the
    Father; the world passes away.
  - [WB]: `1 Jn 2:17 -> world passes -> do God’s will abides`
  - End-time point:
    - Standing “in all the will of God” is the opposite of living for passing
      things.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What ‘passing thing’ most competes for your affection
    and time?”

- [SN]: Illustration: Two magnets: one is Christ, one is the world. What you
  feed attention to strengthens attraction. Neutrality is an illusion.
- [WB]: Simple sketch: `HEART -> pulled by two magnets (CHRIST / WORLD)`

#### B. Watchfulness and holiness: living ready for the dissolving of all things (5-6 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** 2 Peter 3:10–14
  - Reading/Context: The world will be dissolved; therefore we should be in
    “holy conversation and godliness… without spot.”
  - [WB]: `2 Pet 3:11 -> what manner of persons?`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - The Advent is not only an event to believe; it is a character demand to
      answer.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “If you truly believed ‘all these things shall be
    dissolved,’ what would change this week?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Mark 13:32–37
  - Reading/Connection: “Watch”—because the Master may come unexpectedly;
    watching is alert obedience, not date-setting.
  - [WB]: `Mark 13 -> WATCH = faithful at post`
  - [SN]: Illustration: A night watchman doesn’t create morning by worrying; he
    stays at his post until dawn. Readiness is steady faithfulness.
  - [DQ]: _(Practical):_ “What does ‘watching’ look like for a student, a
    parent, a worker, a retiree—without fanaticism?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** Revelation 18:1–4 (with Isaiah 60:1–3 as supporting
  light-theme)
  - Reading/Context: Earth lightened with glory; Babylon exposed; God calls His
    people out.
  - [WB]: `Rev 18:1-4 -> GLORY / COME OUT`
  - Mission link:
    - Standing in God’s will is not private holiness only; it becomes public
      light and final warning—spoken with tears, not harshness.
  - [DQ]: _(Mission):_ “How can we ‘come out’ and call others out without
    becoming proud or critical?”
  - [EGW]: “Not my will, but Thy will, O Lord, be done… The only safety lies in
    putting… plans on one side.” (UL 48).
  - [WB]: `UL 48 -> "Not my will… Thy will"`

---

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** truths:
  - God helps His people **stand** through connected fellowship and faithful
    labor (Col. 4:7–11; Heb. 10:24–25).
  - God’s goal is **mature completeness**—Christ living within, producing
    obedience (Col. 4:12; Heb. 13:21; Col. 2:10).
  - The final crisis reveals what we love: Christ (Luke) or this world (Demas)
    (2 Tim. 4:10–11; 1 John 2:15–17).
  - Watchfulness and holiness are the logical response to the soon-dissolving
    world (2 Pet. 3:10–14; Mark 13:32–37).
- Character Focus Recap:
  - Standing is the fruit of **moment-by-moment surrender** and Christ’s
    indwelling.
  - [WB]: `SURRENDER -> INDWELLING -> STANDING`
- Call to Action/Decision:
  - Choose one specific “will of God” step: reconciliation, surrender of a
    cherished idol, faithful ministry role, disciplined prayer life like
    Epaphras.
  - [WB]: `Col 4:12 -> STAND in ALL the WILL of GOD`
  - Optional Final Question: “Based on God’s Word today, what one area will you
    specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?”
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope:
  - Close by reading Colossians 4:12 again as a prayer over the class/church.
  - [WB]: `PRAY LIKE EPAPHRAS -> READY FOR JESUS`
