# 2026 Q1 W2 - January 3–9

## Reasons for Thanksgiving and Prayer

**Overarching Theme:** God’s “good work” in the believer is matured to
completion by **Spirit-filled thanksgiving and biblically grounded prayer**,
preparing a people to stand “pure and blameless” at the day of Christ.  
**Central Focus:** Gratitude and prayer are not religious etiquette; they are
God’s chosen means to **restore His image in us** (motives, discernment,
obedience, fruit), vindicating His character in the Great Controversy and
fitting us for Christ’s soon return.  
**Key Texts:** Philippians 1:6; Philippians 1:9–11; Colossians 1:9–12

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Many prayers are “Help me, bless me”—but Paul’s prayers often sound like
  “Make me holy, make me useful, make me ready.” Why would an inspired apostle
  pray that way?
- Theme Introduction: Thanksgiving + prayer reveal a deeper reality: God is
  **finishing** a people—His “good work”—for the “day of Jesus Christ” (Phil.
  1:6, 10).
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title:
    `THANKSGIVING + PRAYER = GOD FINISHING HIS WORK`
- Connection to Character/Eternity: Paul ties prayer to being “sincere and
  without offense till the day of Christ” (Phil. 1:10)—end-time readiness
  language (character, not mere claims).
- Roadmap:
  - Phil. 1:3–8: Thanksgiving that reveals gospel fellowship under trial
  - Phil. 1:6, 12–14: Confidence in God’s finishing work through adversity
  - Phil. 1:9–11 + Col. 1:9–12: Prayer that produces discernment, obedience, and
    righteous fruit

---

### II. [*] Thanksgiving that Proves God Is Working (Philippi: Fellowship, Suffering, Assurance) (16-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul’s gratitude is not shallow optimism; it is
  faith discerning God’s invisible work in people, persecution, and progress.

#### A. [*] Gratitude rooted in gospel fellowship and intercession (7-8 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 1:3–5
  - Reading/Context: Paul is imprisoned, yet his first instinct is thanksgiving
    for their “fellowship” (koinonia) in the gospel.
  - [WB]: `Phil 1:3-5` + keyword: `KOINONIA = shared life/mission`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - Gospel fellowship is not mere friendship; it is **shared sacrifice for
      souls**.
    - Thanksgiving becomes a **spiritual thermometer**: what you celebrate
      reveals what you value.
  - [DQ]: *(Observation):* 'What is Paul thanking God for in Phil. 1:3–5—feelings, or partnership?'
- **Foundation Text 2:** Philippians 1:7–8
  - Reading/Connection: They are “partakers… in my bonds” and in the “defense
    and confirmation” of the gospel.
  - [WB]: Diagram: `HEART → BONDS → GOSPEL DEFENSE`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need:
    - Unity is tested under pressure; love that costs nothing is unproven love.
    - “Defense/confirmation” implies a church trained by Scripture, not driven
      by impulse.
  - [EGW]: “Paul’s labors… resulted in the establishment of a church… they
    prized the precious truths… and gave themselves with wholehearted devotion
    to the cause of their Redeemer.” (AA 218.1).
  - [WB]: Quote snippet: `“wholehearted devotion” (AA 218.1)`
  - [DQ]: *(Reflection):* 'What does it look like today to be ‘partakers’ in someone’s bonds—without being in prison ourselves?'
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A coal pulled from the fire cools quickly; coals
    together stay hot. Fellowship is not optional warmth—it is survival heat for
    the last days.
  - Connecting to Life (Need/Solution):
    - Need: Isolation shrinks gratitude and weakens prayer.
    - Solution: Intentional gospel partnership (praying by name, serving
      together, sharing burdens).
    - Obstacle: Pride (“I don’t need anyone”) or busyness.
  - [WB]: `ISOLATION → COLD | FELLOWSHIP → HEAT`
  - [DQ]: *(Application):* 'Who helps keep your spiritual ‘coal’ burning—and who are you helping?'
  - [DQ]: *(Practical):* 'What is one concrete ‘gospel partnership’ step you can take before next Sabbath?'

#### B. Confidence in God’s finishing work amid adversity and mixed motives (9-10 mins)

- **Foundation Text 3:** Philippians 1:6
  - Reading/Challenge: God begins and **completes** His work “until the day of
    Jesus Christ.”
  - [WB]: `Phil 1:6` + timeline arrow: `BEGIN → PROCESS → DAY OF CHRIST`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - The “good work” is salvation applied: justification leading into
      sanctification, culminating in readiness at Christ’s return.
    - This promise is not permission for laziness; it is power against despair
      and quitting.
  - [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* 'What is the ‘good work’—a feeling, a project, or a transformed character?'
- **Foundation Text 4:** Philippians 1:12–14
  - Reading/Connection: Chains become “furtherance of the gospel”; believers
    grow bold.
  - [WB]: Two-column chart: `CHAINS (seen) | FURTHERANCE (unseen)`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need:
    - Discernment reads providence by faith, not by comfort.
    - Trials are a classroom for end-time steadiness (patience, courage,
      unselfishness).
  - [EGW]: “The Lord can bring victory out of that which may seem to us
    discomfiture and defeat… chastisement is a part of His great plan.” (AA
    480.1).
  - [WB]: Quote snippet: `“victory… out of defeat” (AA 480.1)`
  - [DQ]: *(Reflection):* 'When has God turned an apparent ‘setback’ into gospel advance in your life?'
- **Foundation Text 5:** Jeremiah 17:9 (linked with Phil. 1:15–17 background)
  - Reading/Connection: The heart is deceitful; even “religious” service can be
    self-serving.
  - Practical Application (Need/Solution/Obstacle):
    - Need: God must cleanse motives, not only correct behavior.
    - Solution: Honest prayer + willingness to be corrected by Scripture and
      providence.
    - Obstacle: Defensiveness, comparison, wanting praise.
  - [WB]: `MOTIVES: SELF vs CHRIST`
  - [DQ]: *(Heart-searching):* 'Where are we most tempted to serve God while secretly serving self—home, church, work, online?'
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A compass near a magnet points confidently—but
    wrongly. Pride near the heart quietly distorts direction.
  - [WB]: `MAGNET (PRIDE) → DISTORTED COMPASS`
  - [DQ]: *(Application):* 'What simple prayer could you begin using daily to ask God to ‘de-magnetize’ your motives?'

### III. Prayer that Produces End-Time Discernment and Righteous Fruit (Philippi + Colossae) (16-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul’s prayers aim at a church that is loving,
  clear-minded, obedient, and fruitful—ready for the “day of Christ.”

#### A. [*] Love that is intelligent, discerning, and “sun-tested” (8-9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 1:9
  - Reading/Context: Love must “abound… in knowledge and all discernment.”
  - [WB]: `LOVE + KNOWLEDGE + DISCERNMENT`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - Love without truth becomes indulgence; truth without love becomes
      brutality.
    - Discernment is trained spiritual perception (Word + Spirit + obedience).
  - [DQ]: *(Observation):* 'What two guides does Paul attach to love in Phil. 1:9?'
- **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Corinthians 13:1–8
  - Reading/Connection: Gifts and activism without love are nothing; love is
    patient, kind, not self-seeking.
  - [WB]: 3 traits list: `patient | kind | not self-seeking`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need:
    - The remnant must have more than correct doctrine; we must reflect Christ’s
      character.
    - This is not softening standards—it is fulfilling the law’s intent (love).
  - [DQ]: *(Reflection):* 'Which description of love in 1 Cor. 13 exposes your biggest growth area—and why?'
- **Foundation Text 3:** Philippians 1:10
  - Reading/Challenge: Approve “things that are excellent… sincere and without
    offense.”
  - [WB]: Keyword: `SINCERE = “sun-tested”`
  - Unpacking the Truth (End-time readiness):
    - God is forming a people who can stand in full light without hypocrisy.
    - “Without offense” includes not tripping others—mission-minded holiness.
  - [EGW]: “Everything that Christians do should be as transparent as the
    sunlight.” (RC 71.0).
  - [WB]: Quote snippet: `“transparent as sunlight” (RC 71.0)`
  - [DQ]: *(Application):* 'If your week were ‘held up to sunlight,’ what would you ask Christ to change first—words, media, temper, priorities?'
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Like a jeweler holds a diamond under bright light to
    reveal flaws, God’s Word and Spirit reveal what must be surrendered.
  - Need/Solution/Obstacle:
    - Need: We often want comfort, not cleansing.
    - Solution: Daily “sunlight appointment” with Scripture + honest confession.
    - Obstacle: Hurry, entertainment, and fear of what God will ask us to give
      up.
  - [WB]: `SUNLIGHT TIME = Word + Prayer + Obedience`
  - [DQ]: *(Practical):* 'What time of day could realistically become your ‘sunlight appointment’ with God?'

#### B. Fruit of righteousness “by Jesus Christ,” not self (8-9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Philippians 1:11
  - Reading/Context: “Filled with the fruits of righteousness… by Jesus Christ…
    to the glory… of God.”
  - [WB]: `FRUIT → by JESUS → GOD’S GLORY`
  - Unpacking the Truth:
    - Fruit is evidence, not the root; it grows from union with Christ.
    - The Great Controversy issue: God’s character is vindicated in a
      transformed people.
  - [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* 'Why does Paul emphasize ‘by Jesus Christ’—what common religious mistake does that prevent?'
- **Foundation Text 5:** Colossians 1:9–10
  - Reading/Connection: Filled with knowledge of His will → “walk worthy… fully
    pleasing… fruitful.”
  - [WB]: Flow chart: `KNOW → WALK → PLEASE → FRUIT`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need:
    - “Walk” = daily conduct; holiness is practiced, not merely admired.
    - God’s will is primarily a revealed path of obedience, not a secret map.
  - [DQ]: *(Reflection):* 'When you say, ‘I want God’s will,’ do you mean guidance for decisions—or power to obey what you already know?'
- **Foundation Text 6:** Ezekiel 36:27
  - Reading/Promise: God puts His Spirit within to cause obedience.
  - [WB]: `Ezk 36:27 = Spirit-empowered obedience`
  - Obstacles & Solution (explicit):
    - Obstacle: self-trust, inconsistent prayer, cherished sin, discouragement
      after failure.
    - Solution: Spirit dependence expressed through thankful, persistent prayer
      and immediate obedience to known light.
  - [EGW]: “Unceasing prayer is the unbroken union of the soul with God, so that
    life from God flows into our life; and from our life, purity and holiness
    flow back to God.” (SC 98.1).
  - [WB]: Quote snippet: `“unbroken union” (SC 98.1)`
  - [DQ]: *(Application):* 'What would ‘unbroken union’ look like in a school day, a work shift, or a stressful home?'
  - [DQ]: *(Application/Decision):* 'What is one ‘known duty’ you’ve delayed, that the Spirit is asking you to obey this week?'
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A branch doesn’t strain to manufacture grapes; it
    stays connected to the vine and the fruit comes in season (union produces
    fruit).
  - [WB]: `ABIDE → SAP → FRUIT`
  - [DQ]: *(Simple/Engaging):* 'What usually ‘disconnects’ you from Christ fastest—hurry, conflict, entertainment, worry?'

  the day of Christ” (Phil. 1:10)—not by self-effort, but by Christ producing
  fruit in us (Phil. 1:11).
  - [WB]: `READINESS = SINCERE + BLAMELESS + FRUITFUL`

    cannot overcome him whose heart is thus stayed upon God.” (SC 98.2).
  - [WB]: `SC 98.2 | “heart… stayed upon God”` + `DAY OF CHRIST`
