# 2026 Q1 W5 - January 24–30

## Shining as Lights in the Night

**Overarching Theme:** End-time **readiness through Christlike character**—God
works His life into us, and we work it out as a visible witness in earth’s
midnight  
**Central Focus:** Justification by faith produces sanctification by the Spirit,
resulting in a **blameless, unified, sacrificial people** who shine in the final
darkness (Great Controversy context).  
**Key Texts:** Philippians 2:12–16; Romans 12:1–2; Matthew 5:14–16

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: On a moonless night, a tiny light can be seen miles away—why does God
  place His people in the world’s darkest hour?
  - [DQ]: _(Warm-up/Observation):_ “Where do you see ‘midnight darkness’ in our
    world right now—personally, socially, or spiritually?”
- Theme Introduction: In Philippians 2, Paul shows **how God produces a people
  ready for Christ’s return**: God works within, and we shine
  without—**character becomes mission**.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: `MIDNIGHT LIGHT = CHRIST IN ME (Phil 2)`
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The issue is not mere church identity but
  **blameless, harmless children of God** in a crooked generation—prepared for
  the Bridegroom.
  - [EGW]: “The coming of the bridegroom was at midnight—the darkest hour. So
    the coming of Christ will take place in the darkest period of this earth’s
    history.” (RC 211).
  - [WB]: `Midnight → Bridegroom → Readiness`
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “If Christ comes at ‘midnight,’ what kind of
    preparation can’t be done at the last minute?”
- Roadmap:
  - Section II: God’s part and our part in salvation (Phil. 2:12–13 with
    Romans/Ephesians)
  - Section III: What it looks like to shine—unity, purity, Word-centeredness,
    sacrifice, proven workers (Phil. 2:14–30)

---

### II. God Works In, We Work Out: Salvation That Produces Obedience (18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Paul guards us from two ditches: **legalism** (I
  save myself) and **presumption** (God obeys for me). The gospel creates a
  cooperative miracle.

#### A. Grace-first foundation: justification that births new life (9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Romans 3:23, 24
  - Reading/Context: Universal sin → free justification by grace through Christ.
  - [WB]: `Rom 3:23-24 → SIN (all) / JUSTIFIED (gift)`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Salvation begins outside of us—**credit belongs to
    Christ alone**.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What words in Rom. 3:24 prove salvation is a gift,
    not wages?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Romans 5:8
  - Reading/Connection: God loved us while we were sinners—initiative is God’s.
  - [WB]: `Rom 5:8 → “WHILE… CHRIST DIED”`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: The Cross doesn’t merely cancel guilt; it
    **wins the heart** to surrender, breaking self-centeredness.
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does ‘while we were sinners’ change the way we
    treat people who are still messy?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Ephesians 2:8–10
  - Reading/Connection: Saved by grace through faith → created for good works
    prepared by God.
  - [WB]: Draw arrow chain: `GRACE → FAITH → NEW CREATION → GOOD WORKS`
  - Unpacking the Truth simply: Works are not the **root** of salvation, but the
    **fruit**—and even the fruit grows by God’s power.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation/Application):_ “According to Eph. 2:10, what is God’s
    purpose for saving us besides ‘going to heaven’?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ A lamp is not lit to prove the lamp exists; it’s lit
    because power flows into it. **Good works prove connection, not self-made
    light.**
  - Connecting to Life: If we’re trying to “shine” without being connected, we
    burn out or fake it.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where are you most tempted to ‘perform’ Christianity
    rather than live from Christ’s power?”

#### B. The cooperative miracle: trembling responsibility without legalism (9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 4:** Philippians 2:12
  - Reading/Context: Spoken to believers—already in Christ—yet told to “work
    out.”
  - [WB]: `Phil 2:12 → WORK OUT (not work FOR)`
  - Unpacking the Truth: “Work out” means bring to full expression what God has
    already planted—like developing muscles that already exist.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What do you notice Paul says about their past
    obedience (‘as you have always obeyed’)—why mention that?”
- **Foundation Text 5:** Philippians 2:13
  - Reading/Connection: The engine is God: He works in us “to will and to do.”
  - [WB]: `GOD IN → will + do` and underline `IN YOU`
  - Deeper Insight & Character Need: God doesn’t merely command; He **supplies
    desire** and **strength**—but He does not cancel our choice.
  - [EGW]: “The Lord does not propose to perform for us either the willing or
    the doing. His grace is given to work in us to will and to do, but never as
    a substitute for our effort.” (AG 111).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How does [EGW] protect us from both laziness and
    legalism?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** 1 John 5:4
  - Reading/Challenge: Victory that overcomes is **faith**, not emotion.
  - [WB]: `1 Jn 5:4 → VICTORY = FAITH (not feelings)`
  - Practical Step: When you fall, don’t wait to “feel holy” before
    praying—**pray because you are needy**, then act by faith in the next right
    choice.
  - [EGW]: “When they feel that they have sinned, and cannot pray, it is then
    the time to pray.” (YRP 351).
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one ‘next right step’ you can take when you
    feel unworthy to pray?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Sailing: the wind (Spirit) provides power, but you
    still must raise the sail and steer. No sail = drift; no wind = human effort
    only.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What does ‘raising the sail’ look like in your daily
    routine—Word, prayer, restitution, removing temptation?”

### III. Shining in Earth’s Midnight: Unity, Purity, Sacrifice, and Proven Workers (19 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** God’s end-time witness is not merely correct
  information, but **a community whose character reveals God**—stars that shine
  brighter as night deepens.

#### A. A blameless people in a crooked generation (10 mins)

- **Foundation Text 1:** Philippians 2:14
  - Reading/Context: “Do all things without complaining and disputing”—unity
    begins at the level of spirit and speech.
  - [WB]: `NO: complaining + disputing → YES: unity`
  - Unpacking the Truth: Murmuring is the language of unbelief; it **dims
    light** and fractures mission.
  - [DQ]: _(Observation):_ “What kinds of ‘complaining’ are most socially
    acceptable today—even in church?”
- **Foundation Text 2:** Philippians 2:15
  - Reading/Connection: Result is a visible identity:
    “blameless…harmless…without fault…shine as lights.”
  - [WB]: List: `BLAMELESS / HARMLESS / CHILDREN / LIGHTS`
  - Deeper Insight: “Harmless” (pure/unmixed) means not blended with the world’s
    spirit; God calls for an end-time people who **stand distinct without being
    harsh**.
  - [EGW]: “The great apostasy will develop into darkness deep as midnight… But
    out of that night of darkness God’s light will shine.” (RC 211).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “How can we be distinct from the world without
    becoming proud, rude, or isolating?”
- **Foundation Text 3:** Philippians 2:16
  - Reading/Challenge: We shine by “holding fast the word of life”—Word-centered
    living is the fuel of light.
  - [WB]: `HOLD FAST → WORD OF LIFE`
  - Practical Step: Replace “media saturation” with “Word saturation”—not as a
    rule to earn favor, but to keep the lamp supplied.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one practical boundary you could set this
    week so the Word has the first voice each day?”
- **Foundation Text 4:** Matthew 5:14–16
  - Reading/Connection: Jesus defines mission: light is seen through “good
    works” that glorify the Father.
  - [WB]: `LIGHT → GOOD WORKS → GLORY TO GOD`
  - Clarifying Simply: Works are not for self-praise; they are **evidence of the
    indwelling Christ**.
  - [DQ]: _(Interpretation):_ “According to Jesus, what is the real purpose of
    our good works—who gets the glory?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration (Moody lighthouse):_ When the revolving light failed,
    men labored all night to keep it moving so sailors wouldn’t mistake it—our
    witness must not become stationary or confusing.
  - [WB]: Draw simple lighthouse with rotating beam labeled `CONSISTENCY`
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Where might our ‘light’ be present but not
    ‘revolving’—only visible in church, but not at home/work?”

#### B. The light is costly: living sacrifice and honored workers (9 mins)

- **Foundation Text 5:** Romans 12:1, 2
  - Reading/Context: “Present your bodies…living sacrifice…be transformed…not
    conformed.”
  - [WB]: `CONFORMED (world) vs TRANSFORMED (mind)`
  - Unpacking the Truth: End-time light requires an altar: body, habits,
    appetite, time, plans—**all surrendered**.
  - [EGW]: “Our bodies are not our own… that we may present our bodies to Him a
    living sacrifice, holy and acceptable.” (CC 273).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “Why does Paul tie worship to the body and mind, not
    just beliefs?”
- **Foundation Text 6:** Philippians 2:17
  - Reading/Connection: Paul as “poured out” drink offering—joyfully spent in
    service.
  - [WB]: `POURED OUT → JOYFUL SACRIFICE`
  - Character focus: True light is not comfort-centered; it is
    **self-sacrificing love**.
  - [EGW]: “The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who… has drunk most
    deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing love.” (DA 549).
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “What is one ‘small pouring out’ God is asking of
    you—time, forgiveness, hospitality, money, comfort?”
- **Foundation Text 7:** Philippians 2:22
  - Reading/Context: Timothy’s “proven character”—tested and found genuine.
  - [WB]: `PROVEN CHARACTER = tested faithfulness`
  - Unpacking simply: God trusts light-bearers who have endured training; trials
    are not accidents but classrooms.
  - [EGW]: “Life is disciplinary… it is by meeting these in a right spirit that
    the Christian graces are developed.” (5T 344).
  - [DQ]: _(Reflection):_ “What ‘provocation’ is currently revealing what’s in
    your heart?”
- **Foundation Text 8:** Philippians 2:29–30
  - Reading/Connection: “Hold such men in esteem”… because he “risked his life
    for the work of Christ.”
  - [WB]: `ESTEEM = sacrifice, not status`
  - End-time application: God is building a people who honor what heaven
    honors—Christlike service, not popularity.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “Who do we tend to ‘esteem’ today (even in church),
    and how does Paul re-train our values?”
- **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
  - [SN]: _Illustration:_ Two resumes: one lists titles; the other lists
    sacrifices for souls. Heaven hires the second.
  - [DQ]: _(Application):_ “If your life were summarized by heaven, what would
    it emphasize—titles or self-denying love?”

  - _(Optional Final Question):_ “Based on God’s Word today, what one area will
    you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?”
