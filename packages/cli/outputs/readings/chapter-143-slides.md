## Slide 1 – Q1: Character of Zacharias and Elizabeth

- **Question:** What was the character of Zacharias, and Elizabeth?
- **Key Text:** Luke 1:6 – “And they were both righteous before God, walking in
  all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Doctrinal Points

- **Righteousness Defined:**
  - To be “righteous” means to be in right standing with God.
  - **Justification:** They were accounted righteous through faith in the
    promised Messiah (Romans 4:3 – “For what saith the scripture? Abraham
    believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.”).
  - **Sanctification:** Faith produced fruit. They were “walking” in obedience;
    true faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).
- **Commandments and Ordinances:**
  - **Commandments:** The moral law (Ten Commandments) reflecting God’s
    character.
  - **Ordinances:** Ceremonial laws pointing to the Savior.
- **Blameless:**
  - This does not mean they were sinless by nature.
  - It means their hearts were loyal; when they failed, they used God's
    provision of grace (sacrifices) and did not cherish known sin.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Healthy Fruit Tree:**
  - **The Root:** Hidden underground, representing **faith in God**.
  - **The Fruit:** Visible to everyone, representing **obedience to the
    commandments**.
- **Lesson:**
  - Zacharias and Elizabeth did not practice legalism (stapling plastic fruit to
    dead branches).
  - Their obedience was the natural outgrowth of a living connection with God.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Old Covenant System

- **Question:** What was obligatory under the old covenant besides the ten
  commandments?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:1 – “Then verily the first covenant had also
  ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Sanctuary & Law)

- **Two Distinct Systems:**
  - The Ten Commandments defined sin (Romans 7:7).
  - The ceremonial system (ordinances) showed the _remedy_ for sin.
- **Ordinances of Divine Service:** Instructions regarding the priesthood,
  sacrifices, and feast days.
- **A Worldly Sanctuary:**
  - "Worldly" means earthly (made of gold, wood, linen), in contrast to the
    heavenly sanctuary pitched by the Lord (Hebrews 8:2).
- **The Purpose:** A "schoolmaster" or visual aid to lead people to Christ
  (Galatians 3:24), teaching the holiness of the law and the cost of salvation.

## Slide 6 – Q3: Content of the Ordinances

- **Question:** In what did these ordinances consist?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:10 – “Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers
  washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
  reformation.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points & Definition

- **Meats and Drinks:**
  - Refers to meal offerings and drink offerings (libations) in the sanctuary
    (Leviticus 23).
  - distinct from health laws regarding clean/unclean animals (Genesis 7:2).
- **Divers Washings:** Ceremonial cleansings teaching the need for purity and
  washing away sin.
- **Time of Reformation:**
  - These were temporary shadows imposed until Christ, the Reality, appeared.
- **Definition – Ceremonial Law:** The temporary system of types, symbols, and
  sacrifices pointing forward to the cross of Christ.

## Slide 8 – Q4: Shadow and Substance

- **Question:** What did these prefigure?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:1 – “For the law having a shadow of good things to
  come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
  which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto
  perfect.”

## Slide 9 – Q4: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Shadow vs. Image:**
  - A shadow shows an outline but has no substance.
  - The blood of bulls was the shadow; Christ is the Substance.
- **Limitations:**
  - Animal sacrifices could not cleanse the conscience or change the human heart
    ("make the comers thereunto perfect").
- **Salvation in the OT:**
  - Believers were not saved by animal blood.
  - They were saved by faith in the "good things to come"—the perfect sacrifice
    of Jesus.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Shadow in the Cave:**
  - If you are lost in a dark cave and see a man's shadow, you know help is
    near.
  - The shadow cannot lift you up; you must wait for the man.
- **Lesson:**
  - Old Testament saints saw the shadow (sacrifices).
  - They placed their faith in the Man (Christ) who cast the shadow.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Necessity of Sacrifices

- **Question:** Why was it necessary for them to offer these sacrifices?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 4:27-28 – “And if any one of the common people sin
  through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of
  the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; Or if
  his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; then he shall bring his
  offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he
  hath sinned.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points (The Cost of Sin)

- **Acknowledgment of Guilt:** Breaking the Ten Commandments incurs guilt and
  the death penalty (Romans 6:23).
- **Transfer of Sin:**
  - The sinner laid his hand on the victim's head, symbolically transferring
    guilt to the substitute (Leviticus 4:29).
- **Cost of Forgiveness:**
  - The sinner had to slay the animal himself.
  - This taught that "without shedding of blood is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22)
    and that _my_ sin causes the death of the Innocent One.

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Limit of Animal Sacrifices

- **Question:** Could these offerings take away their sins?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:4 – “For it is not possible that the blood of bulls
  and of goats should take away sins.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points (Atonement)

- **The Problem:** Sin is a moral rebellion against God’s government; animals
  lack moral character.
- **The Solution:** Only a Life equal to the broken law (the Creator) could pay
  the price for its transgression.
- **The "Credit Card":**
  - Animal blood did not wash away sin in reality.
  - It served as a "credit slip" acknowledging a debt Christ would pay in full
    at Calvary.
- **Definition – Atonement:** Reconciliation of God and man. Symbolic in the Old
  Testament; actual in Christ.

## Slide 15 – Q7: Looking to Christ

- **Question:** To what did they look forward?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:5 – “Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he
  saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared
  me.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points (Incarnation)

- **God's Desire:** He did not delight in death; He desired the obedience the
  sacrifices represented.
- **"A Body Hast Thou Prepared Me":**
  - The mystery of godliness: God took on human nature.
  - As **God**, He could offer an infinite sacrifice.
  - As **Man**, He could suffer and die in man’s place.
- **Twofold Work:** Christ took a body to live a perfect life (sanctification)
  and die a sacrificial death (justification).

## Slide 17 – Q8: The Law on Stone

- **Question:** Where were the ten commandments written under the old covenant?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 24:12 – “And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me into
  the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and
  commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Key Points

- **Stone:** Signifies the durability and unchangeable nature of God's law
  (Psalm 111:7-8).
- **External Standard:**
  - A law on stone is outside the man.
  - It commands "Thou shalt not" but offers no power to obey.
- **Human Condition:** The stony tables mirrored the "stony heart" of
  unconverted man (Ezekiel 36:26).

## Slide 19 – Q9: The New Covenant

- **Question:** What was to be done with these commandments when the new
  covenant came in force?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 31:33 – “But this shall be the covenant that I will
  make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
  law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their
  God, and they shall be my people.”

## Slide 20 – Q9: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Internalization:** The New Covenant relocates the law from stone tables to
  the human heart (affections and will).
- **Power to Obey:**
  - Obedience becomes natural and joyful because we love the Lawgiver (John
    14:15).
  - The "writing" is done by the Spirit of the living God (2 Corinthians 3:3).
- **Result:** Christ living His life of perfect obedience within the believer.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Illustration

- **Statue vs. Living Child:**
  - A statue obeys "Do not fall over" only because it is stone (external
    constraint).
  - A living child learns to walk by instinct and life.
- **Lesson:**
  - Law on stone = Statue.
  - Law in the heart = New nature that loves to do God’s will.

## Slide 22 – Q10: Memory of the Gospel

- **Question:** Having God's commandments in the heart, should we also keep
  Christ and His sufferings in mind?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:2-3 – “By which also ye are saved, if ye keep
  in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I
  delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ
  died for our sins according to the scriptures.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points (Law and Gospel)

- **Inseparable:** The Law is the standard; the Gospel is the power.
- **"Keep in Memory":**
  - We must constantly remember the price paid for our redemption.
  - Losing sight of the Cross makes the law a burden (legalism).
- **Saved by the Gospel:** Contemplating His love melts the heart, allowing Him
  to write His law there (2 Corinthians 5:14).

## Slide 24 – Q11: The Living Savior

- **Question:** Is it enough simply to believe in the death of Christ?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:14 – “For if we believe that Jesus died and
  rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points (Resurrection & Sanctuary)

- **A Living Savior:** Because He lives, we shall live also (John 14:19).
- **High Priestly Work:**
  - He rose to minister in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - He applies the merits of His blood to blot out sins (Hebrews 7:25).
- **Hope:** His resurrection guarantees our resurrection at the last day.

## Slide 26 – Q12: Commemorating the Resurrection

- **Question:** By what act do we commemorate the resurrection of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 2:12 – “Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye
  are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised
  him from the dead.”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points (Baptism)

- **The Symbolism of Immersion:**
  - **Going down:** Death to the old life of sin.
  - **Under water:** Burial.
  - **Coming up:** Resurrection to "newness of life" (Romans 6:4).
- **Faith:** It is the "faith of the operation of God" that saves, not the water
  itself.
- **Definition:** _Baptizo_ (Greek) means to dip, plunge, or immerse completely.

## Slide 28 – Q13: Pre-requisite to Baptism

- **Question:** But what should always precede baptism?
- **Key Text:** Acts 2:38 – “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized
  every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye
  shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Key Points (Repentance)

- **Sequence:** First repentance, then baptism. The "old man" must die before he
  is buried.
- **Remission:** Baptism is for the forgiveness/removal of sins, marking entry
  into the covenant of grace.
- **Definition – Repentance:** Deep sorrow for sin produced by the Holy Spirit,
  resulting in a turn away from sin and toward God (2 Corinthians 7:10).

## Slide 30 – Q14: The Focus of Conversion

- **Question:** Toward whom must repentance be exercised?
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:20-21 – “...Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the
  Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: Key Points

- **Repentance Toward God:**
  - Why? Because His law was broken. Sin is rebellion against the Father's
    government.
- **Faith Toward Jesus Christ:**
  - Why? Because we cannot atone for our own sin. We must look to the Mediator.
- **Balance:** One cannot exist without the other.
  - Repentance without faith = Despair (Judas).
  - Faith without repentance = Presumption.

## Slide 32 – Q15: Public Declaration

- **Question:** Then by being baptized, what does one signify to the world?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:27 – “For as many of you as have been baptized into
  Christ have put on Christ.”

## Slide 33 – Q15: Key Points (Identity in Christ)

- **"Putting On" Christ:**
  - **Justification:** Putting on His robe of righteousness (covering past
    sins).
  - **Sanctification:** Putting on His character (imparted righteousness for
    living).
- **New Identity:** The believer no longer identifies with the world, but with
  the King of Heaven.

## Slide 34 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Soldier's Uniform:**
  - A uniform signifies which army a soldier belongs to.
  - He is under the protection and command of his general.
- **Lesson:**
  - Baptism is the Christian's uniform.
  - We signify to the universe that we have changed sides in the Great
    Controversy.

## Slide 35 – Q16: Commemorating His Death

- **Question:** How is the death of Christ to be commemorated?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 11:26 – “For as often as ye eat this bread, and
  drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.”

## Slide 36 – Q16: Key Points (Communion)

- **"Show the Lord's Death":**
  - A visible sermon declaring our dependence on His broken body and spilled
    blood.
- **"Till He Come":**
  - The ordinance spans the time between the Cross and the Second Coming.
  - It links what He _did_ with what He _will do_.

## Slide 37 – Q17: Institution of the Ordinance

- **Question:** When and by whom was this ordinance instituted?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 11:23-24 – “...The Lord Jesus the same night in
  which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it,
  and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in
  remembrance of me.”

## Slide 38 – Q17: Key Points

- **Timing:** Instituted on the eve of the crucifixion, replacing the Passover.
- **Symbols:** Bread represents His body, "broken" to satisfy the claims of the
  law.
- **Remembrance:**
  - A memorial of a one-time, all-sufficient sacrifice (Hebrews 10:12).
- **Spiritual Feeding:** We are sustained by partaking of Christ and His Word by
  faith.

## Slide 39 – Q18: The Cup

- **Question:** What is signified by the cup?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 11:25 – “After the same manner also he took the
  cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood:
  this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.”

## Slide 40 – Q18: Key Points (Covenant)

- **The Symbol:** Unfermented wine (pure blood, Deut 32:14).
- **New Testament (Covenant):** A binding agreement where God promises to save
  us and write His law in our hearts.
- **"In My Blood":**
  - Ancient covenants were ratified by blood (Exodus 24:8).
  - Jesus' blood guarantees God will keep His promises to us.

## Slide 41 – Q19: Closing the Service

- **Question:** What was done by Christ and the disciples after partaking of the
  communion?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 26:30 – “And when they had sung an hymn, they went out
  into the mount of Olives.”

## Slide 42 – Q19: Key Points

- **Victory in Suffering:**
  - Jesus sang even while facing Gethsemane and the Cross.
  - Teaches that the joy of the Lord is our strength.
- **Pattern:** Our worship services should conclude with praise and thanksgiving
  for the work of Christ.

## Slide 43 – Q20: Worthy Partaking

- **Question:** If one refuses to obey God, can he be profited by partaking of
  the communion?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 11:27 – “Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread,
  and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and
  blood of the Lord.”

## Slide 44 – Q20: Key Points

- **"Unworthily":**
  - Refers to the _manner_ of eating, not personal merit.
  - Includes indifference, cherishing known sin, or harboring hatred (Matthew
    5:23-24).
- **Self-Examination:**
  - Preparation (v. 28) is a time for soul-searching and confession.
  - It is a time to renew vows of obedience.

## Slide 45 – Q20: Illustration

- **The Photo and Infidelity:**
  - If a man carries a photo of his wife but is unfaithful, the photo testifies
    against him.
- **Lesson:**
  - If we hold the symbols of Christ's love but refuse Him entrance through
    obedience, the ordinance condemns our hypocrisy.
  - But for the repentant soul, it provides strength and life.
