# Bible Study: What Was Abolished by Christ?

## Introduction

One of the most misunderstood questions in Christianity concerns what Christ abolished at the cross. Many sincere believers assume that Calvary swept away all law, freeing Christians from any obligation to obey God's commandments. Yet Scripture presents a more careful distinction—one that preserves the eternal moral law while recognizing the end of the ceremonial system that pointed forward to Christ. Understanding this distinction is essential for every believer who desires to walk in faithful obedience to God.

## Core Truths

### Christ's Own Testimony About the Law

Before examining what was abolished, we must hear Christ's own words on the matter:

> _"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."_ (Matthew 5:17)

> _"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."_ (Matthew 5:18)

Jesus anticipated the very confusion we face today. His emphatic "Think not" warns against the assumption that His mission was to abolish God's moral requirements. The law He came to "fulfil" was not cancelled but rather filled full of meaning—demonstrated in its true spiritual depth and honored by His perfect obedience.

**Key insight**: Heaven and earth have not passed away. Therefore, by Christ's own testimony, the law remains intact.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "destroy" (_kataluo_) in Matthew 5:17 literally means "to loosen down" or "demolish." Jesus explicitly denied any intention of dismantling God's law—He came to establish it by living it perfectly and revealing its true spiritual intent.

### Paul's High Regard for God's Law

The apostle Paul, often misunderstood as teaching against the law, actually held it in highest esteem:

> _"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."_ (Romans 7:12)

> _"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man."_ (Romans 7:22)

A law that is **holy, just, and good**—and in which the apostle **delights**—cannot be the "enmity" that was abolished. Paul's delight in God's law reflects the experience of every truly converted heart (Psalm 119:97).

### The Test of Love

The apostle John provides the ultimate test:

> _"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous."_ (1 John 5:3)

Something "not grievous" cannot be an "enmity" requiring abolition. The commandments are not burdens to the converted soul—they are the natural expression of love for God.

[Q] **"But doesn't Paul say we're 'not under the law'? Doesn't that mean the law is abolished?"**

Being "not under the law" (Romans 6:14) means we are no longer under its condemnation—not that we are free from its guidance. The very next verse asks, "Shall we sin, because we are not under the law?" Paul's answer: "God forbid" (Romans 6:15). Sin is still defined as transgression of the law (1 John 3:4). If the law were abolished, there could be no sin—yet sin clearly remains (1 John 1:8). We are under grace, which both pardons our past transgressions and empowers present obedience.

## Deeper Truths

### Two Distinct Laws in Scripture

Scripture reveals two distinct categories of law, and confusing them leads to serious error:

**1. The Moral Law (Ten Commandments)**

- Written by God's own finger on stone (Exodus 31:18)
- Placed **inside** the Ark of the Covenant (Deuteronomy 10:5)
- Eternal in nature, reflecting God's unchanging character (Psalm 111:7–8)
- Called "the royal law" (James 2:8) and "the law of liberty" (James 2:12)

**2. The Ceremonial Law (Law of Moses)**

- Written by Moses in a book (Deuteronomy 31:24)
- Placed **beside** the Ark of the Covenant (Deuteronomy 31:26)
- Temporary by design, pointing forward to Christ (Colossians 2:16–17)
- Called "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (Ephesians 2:15)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for the ceremonial law in Deuteronomy 31:26 describes it as a "witness against" Israel—anticipating their failures and pointing them to their need of a Saviour. The Ten Commandments, by contrast, were called a "testimony" (Exodus 25:16)—a reflection of God's eternal character.

### What Ephesians 2:15 Actually Teaches

The text often used to argue for law abolition actually proves the opposite:

> _"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace."_ (Ephesians 2:15)

Notice the context carefully (verses 12–14):

- Gentiles were "aliens from the commonwealth of Israel"
- They were "strangers from the covenants of promise"
- Christ "hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us"

**What was the "middle wall of partition"?** The ceremonial system—particularly circumcision and its related ordinances—that separated Jew from Gentile. This was the "enmity" abolished.

> _"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God."_ (1 Corinthians 7:19)

Paul's statement is remarkably clear: circumcision is abolished, but "the commandments of God" remain binding. Two different laws—two different outcomes at the cross.

[ILL] Consider a scaffolding erected around a building under construction. The scaffolding serves an essential purpose during construction—workers depend upon it, and the building cannot be completed without it. But once the building is finished, the scaffolding is removed. No one mourns its loss or considers the building incomplete without it. The ceremonial law was scaffolding—essential for pointing Israel forward to Christ. When the "building" (the Lamb of God) appeared, the scaffolding had served its purpose and was removed. But the building itself—the eternal law of God—remains forever.

### Sin Cannot Exist Without Law

Paul establishes an irrefutable principle:

> _"For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law."_ (Romans 5:13)

> _"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the law."_ (1 John 3:4)

If the moral law were abolished, sin could not exist—for sin is defined as lawbreaking. Yet John writes to Christians:

> _"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."_ (1 John 1:8)

Sin remains because the law remains. The presence of sin in the world is itself proof that God's moral law continues in full force.

[Q] **"But Colossians 2:14 says the handwriting of ordinances was nailed to the cross. Doesn't that include the Ten Commandments?"**

Colossians 2:14 speaks of "the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us." The Ten Commandments were written by God's finger, not human handwriting. The ceremonial "ordinances"—animal sacrifices, feast days, new moons, and sabbath days connected with the ceremonial system (verse 16)—these were shadows pointing to Christ (verse 17). When the Substance came, the shadows passed away. But the eternal moral law, written by God Himself, was never "contrary to us"—it is holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Unchangeable Foundation

At the heart of the great controversy between Christ and Satan lies the question of God's law. Satan has always sought to set aside God's authority, beginning with his rebellion in heaven:

> _"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High."_ (Isaiah 14:14)

If Satan could convince humanity that God's law was changeable or abolishable, he would undermine the very foundation of God's government. But Christ's death, rather than abolishing the law, demonstrated its eternal nature. If the law could have been set aside, Christ need not have died. The cross is the supreme evidence that God's law cannot be changed.

### Sanctuary Connection

The distinction between moral and ceremonial law finds beautiful expression in the sanctuary:

**In the Most Holy Place**, within the Ark of the Covenant, rested the Ten Commandments—the very foundation of God's throne and the standard of the final judgment (Revelation 11:19; Ecclesiastes 12:13–14).

**In the outer court and holy place**, the ceremonial services—animal sacrifices, incense offerings, the daily ministration—all pointed forward to Christ's work. These were "a shadow of good things to come" (Hebrews 10:1), fulfilled when "the Lamb of God" offered Himself once for all (John 1:29; Hebrews 10:12).

The ceremonial law led worshippers _to_ Christ. The moral law shows us our need _of_ Christ and guides our lives _after_ we receive Him. Both serve God's redemptive purpose—one as preparation, the other as eternal standard.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Law

The true relationship between faith and law is not opposition but harmony:

> _"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."_ (Romans 3:31)

Through faith in Christ, the believer receives:

- **Imputed righteousness**: Christ's perfect obedience credited to our account (justification)
- **Imparted righteousness**: Christ's character reproduced in our lives (sanctification)

The law that once condemned us becomes our delight when written upon our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Hebrews 8:10). We keep the commandments not to earn salvation, but because Christ lives within us and His life naturally bears the fruit of obedience.

> _"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:3–4)

## Practical Application

Understanding what Christ abolished—and what remains—has profound implications for daily Christian living:

**1. We are free from ceremonial requirements.** No Christian is bound to observe animal sacrifices, circumcision, or the feast days that pointed forward to Christ. These served their purpose and ended at the cross.

**2. We are bound by eternal moral principles.** The Ten Commandments remain God's standard of righteousness—including the fourth commandment, which calls us to remember the seventh-day Sabbath. No New Testament text exempts any of the ten from ongoing obligation.

**3. We keep the commandments from love, not legalism.** The converted heart delights in God's law (Romans 7:22). Obedience flows not from fear of condemnation but from love for the Saviour who died for us.

**4. We depend wholly on Christ for power to obey.** No human being can keep God's law in their own strength. But through faith, Christ's righteousness both covers and transforms us. He who commands also enables.

**5. We test all teaching by Scripture.** Any doctrine that sets aside God's moral law should be rejected, regardless of how popular or persuasive it appears. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20).

## Appeal

The cross of Christ did not destroy God's eternal standard of righteousness—it demonstrated its unchangeable nature and provided the only means of meeting its requirements. The ceremonial shadows passed away because the glorious Substance had come. But the moral law, reflecting the very character of God, stands forever.

> _"The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness."_ (Psalm 111:7–8)

Dear friend, where do you stand in relation to God's law today? Have you received Christ's righteousness to cover your past transgressions? Have you invited Him to write His law upon your heart, empowering you to walk in joyful obedience?

The same Saviour who died to redeem you from the curse of the law now lives to fulfill the righteousness of the law within you. Will you surrender your heart fully to Him today, trusting not in your own strength but in His mighty power to transform and keep you faithful unto the end?

_"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous."_ (1 John 5:3)
