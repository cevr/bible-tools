# Reading 54: The First Beast of Revelation 13—The Rise of Papal Rome

## Introduction

Revelation 13 unveils one of prophecy's most significant symbols—a beast rising from the sea, combining features of Daniel's four great empires. This study traces how the falling away predicted by Paul developed through the union of church and state into the papal system that dominated Christendom for centuries. Understanding this prophecy is essential for God's people living in the last days, when similar principles will again be at work.

## Core Truths

### The Beast Identified

The first beast of Revelation 13 presents a striking composite image:

> _"And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority."_ (Revelation 13:2)

This beast incorporates characteristics from Daniel's four prophetic kingdoms:

- **Lion** = Babylon (Daniel 7:4)
- **Bear** = Medo-Persia (Daniel 7:5)
- **Leopard** = Greece (Daniel 7:6)
- **Dragon power** = Pagan Rome (Revelation 12:3-4; Daniel 7:7)

[DYK🔎] The beast of Revelation 13 is described in reverse order from Daniel 7 because John looked backward through history while Daniel looked forward. Both prophets saw the same prophetic timeline from different vantage points.

The papacy absorbed territory once ruled by these ancient empires and claimed dominion over them through ecclesiastical authority. As pagan Rome declined, papal Rome arose—receiving the dragon's "power, seat, and great authority."

### The Predicted Falling Away

Paul warned the early church that apostasy must precede Christ's return:

> _"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."_ (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4)

**Falling away**: The Greek word is _apostasia_, from which we derive "apostasy"—a deliberate departure from truth once known and believed (Hebrews 3:12).

This "man of sin" would:

- Oppose God while claiming to represent Him
- Exalt himself above all worship
- Sit in God's temple (the church) claiming divine prerogatives

[Q] **"Isn't it uncharitable to identify any Christian institution as the 'man of sin'?"**

We must distinguish between the system and individuals within it. Many sincere Christians have lived and died within the papal communion, loving God according to the light they had. However, Scripture requires us to identify prophetic fulfillments honestly. Jesus Himself warned of religious deception in the last days (Matthew 24:4-5, 24). The prophetic identification is not an attack on individuals but a warning about a system of error.

## Deeper Truths

### The Process of Apostasy

The falling away did not happen overnight. It developed through gradual compromise with paganism:

**Stage 1: Accommodation (2nd-3rd centuries)**

Early church leaders adopted heathen rites and customs, believing this would ease the conversion of pagans and Jews. The historian Mosheim records that bishops "augmented the number of religious rites in the Christian worship, by way of accommodation" and "proceeded so far, at length, as even to adopt some of the ceremonies" from pagan mysteries.

[ILL] Consider a stream of pure water flowing from a mountain spring. If one introduces a small tributary of muddy water, the stream becomes polluted—not all at once, but gradually darkening until the original purity is lost. So it was with the early church: small compromises, seemingly innocent accommodations, eventually transformed Christianity into something its Founder would not recognize.

**Stage 2: Union with the State (4th century)**

Under Emperor Constantine (312-337 A.D.), the fatal union of church and state was formed. The historian Neander notes that "worldly minded bishops, instead of caring for the salvation of their flocks, were often but too much inclined to travel about, and entangle themselves in worldly concerns."

These bishops "voluntarily made themselves dependent on him by their disputes, and by their determination to make use of the power of the state for the furtherance of their aims."

[DYK🔎] The Council of Nicaea (325 A.D.) was convened not by church authority but by Emperor Constantine—a man who was not even baptized until his deathbed. Its decrees were "published under the imperial authority, and thus obtained a political importance." This set the pattern for centuries of church-state entanglement.

**Stage 3: Changing God's Law**

One of the clearest evidences of this apostasy appeared in the treatment of God's Sabbath:

- The Council of Nicaea standardized Easter celebration, with Constantine urging, "Let us then have nothing in common with the most hostile rabble of the Jews"
- Bishop Sylvester of Rome, under Constantine, changed the names of the days and promoted Sunday as "the Lord's day"
- The Council of Laodicea (364 A.D.) decreed that churches should keep Sunday, pronouncing those who rested on the Sabbath "accursed"

> _"And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws."_ (Daniel 7:25)

[Q] **"But didn't the church have authority to change the day of worship?"**

Scripture nowhere grants any human institution authority to alter God's moral law. The Sabbath commandment declares, "The seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God" (Exodus 20:10)—it belongs to God, not to any earthly power. Jesus said, "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law" (Matthew 5:18). The papal claim to have changed the Sabbath is, in fact, the clearest evidence of its assumption of divine prerogatives.

**Stage 4: Persecution Justified (5th century)**

Augustine of Hippo developed the theology of coercion, arguing that "many, like bad servants, must often be reclaimed to their master by the rod of temporal suffering." The historian Neander observes:

"It was by Augustine, then, that a theory was proposed and founded, which... contained the germ of that whole system of spiritual despotism, of intolerance and persecution, which ended in the tribunals of the inquisition."

This fulfilled the prophecy: "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them" (Revelation 13:7).

### Sanctuary Connections

The papal system represents a counterfeit of Christ's heavenly ministry:

- **Earthly priesthood** replaces Christ's sole mediatorship (1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 7:24-25)
- **Earthly sacrifice** (the Mass) denies the sufficiency of Calvary (Hebrews 10:10-14)
- **Earthly confession** substitutes for direct access to God (Hebrews 4:14-16)
- **Earthly head** usurps Christ's position as Head of the church (Ephesians 1:22; Colossians 1:18)

The true sanctuary message directs us to heaven, where "we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God" (Hebrews 4:14). Any system that interposes human mediators between the soul and Christ obscures the gospel.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Dragon's Strategy

Revelation 13:2 reveals that "the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority." Satan works through earthly institutions to accomplish what he cannot do directly. His consistent strategy involves:

1. **Corruption of truth** through gradual compromise
2. **Union of religious and civil power** to enforce his counterfeit worship
3. **Persecution of the faithful** who refuse to bow to human authority in matters of conscience

These principles have been at work throughout the great controversy, and they will be seen again in the final conflict (Revelation 13:11-17).

### The Character of God at Stake

The papal system misrepresents God's character in fundamental ways:

- **God's government** is based on love and free choice; papal government relied on coercion
- **God's law** is eternal and unchangeable; the papacy claimed authority to alter it
- **God's salvation** is by grace through faith; the papal system introduced human works and merit
- **God's truth** is accessible to all through Scripture; the papacy kept the Bible from the common people

[ILL] A portrait may be skillfully painted, yet if it misrepresents the subject, it does harm rather than good. A picture of a loving father as a cruel tyrant wounds his children's trust. So Satan's great aim has been to present a false picture of God—a God who must be appeased through human works, whose law is arbitrary and changeable, whose favor is dispensed through human intermediaries. The gospel reveals the true picture: a God who gave His only Son because He loved the world (John 3:16).

## Practical Application

### Lessons for God's People Today

**1. Guard against gradual compromise**

The early church did not plan apostasy—it came through small accommodations. We must test every practice and belief by Scripture alone, asking not "Is this popular?" but "Is this biblical?" (Isaiah 8:20).

**2. Maintain separation of church and state**

The union of religious and civil power always leads to persecution. True religion cannot be compelled; it must spring from the heart transformed by grace. We should support religious liberty for all, knowing that conscience belongs to God alone.

**3. Cherish the truths recovered through the Reformation**

The principles that distinguish God's remnant church—the Sabbath, the sanctuary, righteousness by faith alone, the Bible as the only rule of faith—were recovered at great cost. These truths are not negotiable.

**4. Look to Jesus, not human mediators**

> _"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus."_ (1 Timothy 2:5)

We need no earthly priest, no human confessor, no intermediate authority between our souls and the Savior. Through Christ, we have "boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus" (Hebrews 10:19).

**5. Prepare for the final test**

Revelation 13 reveals that the principles of the first beast will be revived in the last days. A similar union of church and state, similar coercion of conscience, similar attack on God's law will characterize the final conflict. Those who understand these prophecies will not be deceived.

## Appeal

> _"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."_ (Revelation 18:4)

God has faithful children in every communion, even in Babylon. But He is calling them out—out of error into truth, out of human tradition into biblical faith, out of spiritual darkness into the light of the three angels' messages.

The same choice that faced believers in the early centuries faces us today: Will we follow human authority or divine? Will we accept the traditions of men or the commandments of God? Will we trust in human mediators or come boldly to Christ alone?

The prophecies of Revelation 13 are not given to frighten us but to prepare us. God's faithful people have faced the beast's power before, and by His grace they overcame—"by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony" (Revelation 12:11). That same power is available today.

Let us be among those who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).
