### Q1. What good things are spoken of the faithful and energetic?

**“He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread." Prov. 28:19. "The hand
of the diligent maketh rich. "Prov. 10:4. "The soul of the diligent shall be
made fat." Prov. 13:4.**

**Answer:**

The Scriptures place a high premium on honest labor and active engagement in
duty. Solomon links diligence directly to provision, satisfaction, and
abundance.

- **The Law of Sowing and Reaping:** God has ordained that effort precedes
  reward. Just as the farmer must till the soil to receive a harvest, the
  Christian must put forth effort to receive spiritual blessings. God gives the
  increase, but man must prepare the ground (Galatians 6:7).
- **Spiritual Fatness:** The text speaks of the soul being made "fat," which in
  biblical imagery means prosperous, nourished, and healthy (Psalm 92:14). A
  diligent prayer life and diligent study of the Word result in a robust
  spiritual constitution.
- **Cooperation with God:** We are "labourers together with God" (1 Corinthians
  3:9). He provides the soil, the seed, and the rain (grace), but He asks us to
  provide the tillage (faith and obedience).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Consider a water wheel at a mill. The river provides all
the power (God’s grace), but the wheel must be positioned correctly and
maintained diligently to catch the current and turn the machinery. If the miller
is lazy and lets the wheel rot or clog with debris, the power of the river
passes by without effect. So it is with faith: we must diligently position
ourselves in the stream of God's power.

### Q2. What is said of the man of opposite characteristics?

**“He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand." Prov. 10:4. "The soul of
the sluggard desireth and hath nothing." Prov. 13:4.**

**Answer:**

Idleness and negligence are not merely neutral states; they are active
destroyers of character and resources.

- **The Slack Hand:** To deal with a "slack hand" implies doing one’s work
  halfway, without heart or precision. In the spiritual life, this represents
  the lukewarm condition—knowing the truth but not allowing it to transform the
  life (Revelation 3:15–16).
- **Desire without Effort:** The sluggard "desireth" and has nothing. Many
  desire the crown of eternal life, but they are unwilling to bear the cross of
  self-denial. They want the victory of Christ without the surrender of the
  will.
- **Spiritual Poverty:** This poverty is the lack of the "gold tried in the
  fire"—faith and love (Revelation 3:18). The one who neglects the daily
  gathering of spiritual manna will find themselves starving when the time of
  trouble comes.

**Definitions:**

- **The Sluggard:** In Scripture, this is not just someone who sleeps too much,
  but someone who is habitually lazy, procrastinating duties and making excuses
  (Proverbs 26:13–16).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A man may stand by a fruit tree desiring an apple. He
may wish for it earnestly. But unless he stretches forth his hand to pick it, or
climbs the ladder to reach it, he will go hungry. Wishing to be righteous does
not make one righteous; we must "strive to enter in at the strait gate" (Luke
13:24), laying hold of Christ’s strength by faith.

### Q3. What social distinction is shown between the diligent man and the slothful one?

**“The hand of the diligent shall bear rule, but the slothful shall be under
tribute." Prov. 12:24.**

**Answer:**

This proverb reveals a principle of authority and freedom. Mastery over one's
own spirit and work leads to influence; lack of self-discipline leads to
bondage.

- **Self-Mastery leads to Liberty:** The man who, by the grace of God, rules his
  own passions and is diligent in his calling becomes a free man in Christ. He
  is not a slave to circumstances or appetites.
- **Sloth leads to Slavery:** "Tribute" implies forced labor or taxation—a state
  of servitude. Spiritually, "whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin"
  (John 8:34). The slothful Christian, failing to watch and pray, eventually
  falls under the tyranny of old habits and the devil’s temptations.
- **Righteousness by Faith connection:** True liberty is found only in the law
  of God (James 1:25). When Christ writes His law in our hearts (the New
  Covenant), we obey diligently out of love, not compulsion. This is the highest
  form of "bearing rule"—ruling one's self through the power of the Holy Spirit.

**[ILL] Illustration:** In the story of the Prodigal Son, as long as the son
demanded his "freedom" to live riotously and lazily, he ended up a slave feeding
pigs. When he returned to his Father’s house to serve, he was restored to the
dignity of a son. True diligence in the Father’s house brings royal dignity;
slothful rebellion brings slavery.

### Q4. What honor awaits the diligent man of business?

**“See thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he
shall not stand before mean men." Prov. 22:29.**

**Answer:**

Competence and faithfulness in small temporal matters prepare a person for
greater responsibilities and higher associations.

- **Witness through Excellence:** God is glorified when His people are the best
  at what they do (Daniel 6:3–4). A careless workman dishonors his profession
  and his Lord, but a diligent one commends the Gospel to "kings" and leaders.
- **The Heavenly Sanctuary Application:** If diligence fits a man to stand
  before earthly kings, how much more does spiritual diligence fit us to stand
  before the King of Kings? We are called to be a "royal priesthood" (1 Peter
  2:9).
- **Christ’s Example:** Jesus was diligent in the carpenter’s shop before He
  entered His public ministry. He was faithful in the "least" things, and thus
  was faithful in the "much" (Luke 16:10).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Daniel and his companions were captives in Babylon. They
did not sulk or work lazily because they were in a foreign land. They applied
themselves to study and duty with such diligence that God blessed them, and they
ended up advising the greatest emperors of the ancient world (Daniel 1:19–20).

### Q5. Give an example of the reward of industry.

**“And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon seeing the young
man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house
of Joseph." 1 Kings 11:28.**

**Answer:**

Even in the case of Jeroboam (who later apostatized), the principle holds true:
industry is recognized and rewarded with responsibility.

- **God Uses Active Men:** Throughout the Bible, God calls those who are busy.
  Moses was tending sheep; Gideon was threshing wheat; Elisha was plowing; Peter
  and John were mending nets. God rarely calls the idle to high holy office.
- **Capacity for Service:** Industry develops the "spiritual muscles" necessary
  to bear burdens. God is looking for men and women who can carry the "charge"
  of His church—people who will not faint under the load of soul-winning and
  intercession.
- **A Warning:** Jeroboam had industry but lacked humility and doctrinal purity.
  Industry alone is not enough; it must be sanctified by the Spirit of God, or
  it may be used for selfish ambition.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A ship that is moving can be steered by the rudder. A
ship that is sitting dead in the water cannot be turned. God can steer an
active, industrious person into the right path, but it is difficult to guide
someone who is not moving at all.

### Q6. May we estimate a man's thrift by the condition of his dwelling?

**“By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands
the house droppeth through." Eccl. 10:18.**

**Answer:**

The physical environment often reflects the internal state of the mind. Neglect
leads to inevitable ruin, a principle known in physics as entropy, and in
Scripture as the corruption of sin.

- **The Body Temple:** Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit (1
  Corinthians 6:19). Slothfulness in health reform—neglecting proper diet,
  exercise, and rest—causes this "building" to decay prematurely, hindering our
  ability to serve God.
- **The Character Structure:** Character is built brick by brick through daily
  habits. If we are idle in checking our conscience or repenting of known sin,
  the "roof" of our protection drops through, allowing the rains of temptation
  to rot the soul.
- **Maintenance is Required:** Just as a house requires constant repair, the
  Christian life requires "dying daily" (1 Corinthians 15:31) and daily renewal
  by the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a homeowner who ignores a small leak in the roof
because he is too comfortable in his chair to fix it. Eventually, the water rots
the beams, ruins the ceiling, and destroys the furniture. The damage of years
was caused by the neglect of a moment. So it is with "little" sins left
unconfessed and un-forsaken.

### Q7. Give a picture of a slack man's farm, as drawn by an eyewitness.

**“I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of
understanding; and lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down." Prov.
24:30, 31.**

**Answer:**

Solomon paints a vivid picture of the curse of sin unchecked by diligence.

- **The Natural State of the Heart:** Since the Fall, the ground produces thorns
  and thistles naturally (Genesis 3:18). Likewise, the human heart produces sin,
  pride, and selfishness naturally. We do not have to _try_ to be sinful; we
  only have to neglect the culture of the soul.
- **The Broken Wall:** Walls in ancient vineyards protected the crop from wild
  beasts. Spiritually, the Law of God and the distinct truths of the Bible are a
  wall of protection. When we are slothful in doctrine and obedience, the wall
  is broken down, and errors and worldly vices rush in.
- **Sanctification:** This is the work of the spiritual gardener. While
  Justification plants us in the garden of grace, Sanctification is the daily
  weeding, pruning, and repairing of the walls, done by the power of Christ
  working in us.

**Definitions:**

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing process where the Holy Spirit imparts the
  nature of Christ to the believer, removing the "weeds" of sin and producing
  the "fruit" of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A beautiful flower garden left unattended for two years
does not remain beautiful; it becomes a weed patch. The gardener does not create
the life in the flowers (only God does that), but the gardener must diligently
remove the weeds that threaten to choke that life.

### Q8. What lesson did the wise man learn as he noticed these things?

**“Then I saw and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received
instruction." Prov. 24:32.**

**Answer:**

True wisdom involves observation, reflection, and application. The wise man does
not just see the ruin; he asks, "How can I avoid this?"

- **Self-Examination:** We are called to "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in
  the faith" (2 Corinthians 13:5). We must look at the "fields" of our own
  lives—our tempers, our words, our use of time—and see if thorns are growing.
- **Learning from Others:** The failures of Israel in the wilderness were
  written "for our admonition" (1 Corinthians 10:11). We should look at the
  results of half-hearted religion in history and determine, by God’s grace, to
  be wholehearted.
- **The investigative Judgment:** God is also looking and considering well. He
  is inspecting the vineyard of our lives. Now is the time to receive
  instruction and cooperate with Jesus to clear the ground.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A driver on a mountain road sees a car that has crashed
through the guardrail because of speeding. The wise driver immediately checks
his own speedometer and slows down. He receives instruction from the tragedy of
another.

### Q9. Is our work for "the life that now is," closely united with that for the one to come?

**“Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord." Rom. 12:11.**

**Answer:**

Paul connects secular duty with spiritual fervor. There is no dichotomy between
"religious" life and "work" life for the Christian; all is to be done as an act
of worship.

- **Fervent in Spirit:** The Greek word for fervent implies "boiling" or "hot."
  We are to be on fire for God _while_ we are attending to our daily business.
- **Serving the Lord:** Whether washing dishes, plowing a field, or preaching a
  sermon, we are serving the Lord Christ (Colossians 3:23–24). Doing our daily
  work with integrity is a testimony to the power of the Gospel.
- **Righteousness by Faith in Daily Life:** The righteousness of Christ is not a
  cloak we wear only on Sabbath. It is a living principle that makes a man a
  better employee, a better father, and a better citizen. The life of Christ in
  the heart manifests as faithfulness in the marketplace.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Jesus spent the majority of His life on earth not in
preaching, but in working as a craftsman. By making perfect yokes and tables, He
was "serving the Lord" and glorifying His Father just as much as when He healed
the sick. He sanctified daily labor.

### Q10. What sentence is pronounced against the man who is unfaithful in God's work?

**“Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully." Jer. 48:10.**

**Answer:**

To do God's work "deceitfully" (or negligently, as the margin reads) is a
fearful thing because it deals with eternal realities.

- **The Stakes are High:** If a builder is negligent, a house may fall. But if a
  Christian is negligent in their witness or their own character building, a
  soul may be lost for eternity.
- **The Sin of Nadab and Abihu:** These priests offered "strange fire" because
  they were negligent and perhaps intoxicated (Leviticus 10:1). They treated the
  holy work as a common thing. We must reverence the work of God.
- **Hypocrisy:** Doing the work "deceitfully" also implies pretending to serve
  God while actually serving self. God desires "truth in the inward parts"
  (Psalm 51:6).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A surgeon scrubbing in for a heart transplant cannot be
casual or negligent about sterilization. One microscopic germ introduced through
carelessness can kill the patient. Dealing with souls and God's truth requires a
spiritual sterilization (cleansing) that is even more critical.

### Q11. In view of the reward to be given at Christ's appearing, what exhortation is given?

**“Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye
may be found of Him in peace, without spot and blameless." 2 Peter 3:14.**

**Answer:**

The expectation of the Second Coming is the greatest motivation for diligence in
character development.

- **Without Spot and Blameless:** This describes the character of the 144,000
  (Revelation 14:5) and the condition of the church Christ comes to claim
  (Ephesians 5:27).
- **The Work of Atonement:** In the ancient Day of Atonement, while the High
  Priest was cleansing the sanctuary, the people were to afflict their souls and
  put away all sin (Leviticus 16). We are living in the antitypical Day of
  Atonement. Jesus is finishing His work in the Heavenly Sanctuary.
- **How is this possible?** It is impossible by human effort alone. We are found
  "without spot" only when we are washed in the blood of the Lamb
  (Justification) and kept from sin by the power of His indwelling life
  (Sanctification). We must be diligent to maintain this connection. "Abide in
  me" (John 15:4).

**Definitions:**

- **Atonement:** The work of reconciling God and man. It includes Christ's
  sacrifice on the cross and His priestly ministry of applying that blood to
  cleanse the sinner and, finally, to blot out sin from the record.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A bride preparing for her wedding day is diligent. She
checks her dress for the slightest stain or wrinkle. She does not do this
because she is afraid of the groom, but because she loves him and wants to be
beautiful for him. Our diligence in holiness is our preparation for the marriage
supper of the Lamb.

### Q12. What blessed assurance is given such as follow this advice?

**“Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
election sure: for if ye do these things ye shall never fall; for so an entrance
shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ." 2 Peter 1:10, 11.**

**Answer:**

Here is the promise of total victory and security for the believer who combines
faith with diligent cooperation with God.

- **Making Election Sure:** God has "elected" (chosen) everyone to be saved (1
  Timothy 2:4), but we must "make it sure" by accepting that election and
  walking in it. We vote "yes" to God's vote for us.
- **Ye Shall Never Fall:** This is a staggering promise. It does not say we
  cannot fall, but that if we "do these things" (add to our faith virtue,
  knowledge, temperance, etc., see verses 5–7), we _will_ not fall. The power of
  God is sufficient to keep us from stumbling (Jude 24).
- **Abundant Entrance:** Not sneaking into heaven "by the skin of our teeth,"
  but entering "abundantly"—victorious, with a character fitted for the society
  of angels.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** This diligence is the "work of faith" (1
  Thessalonians 1:3). It is not working _for_ salvation, but working _out_
  salvation (Philippians 2:12) because God is working in us.

**Definitions:**

- **Calling and Election:** God's invitation to the sinner and His plan for
  their salvation. It becomes effective when the sinner responds by faith and
  perseveres in that faith.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A ship entering the harbor after a long voyage can come
in two ways: it can be towed in as a wreck, barely afloat, having lost its masts
and cargo. Or, it can enter "abundantly"—sails full, cargo intact, crew singing,
driven by the wind (the Spirit). God desires us to have an abundant entrance
into His Kingdom.
