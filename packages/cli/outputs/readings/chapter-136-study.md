# Reading 136: Diligence

## Introduction

The Bible speaks often of diligence—the steady, faithful application of effort to worthwhile work. Yet this is no mere call to human striving or worldly success. Scripture reveals that true diligence flows from a heart transformed by grace, expresses itself in both temporal and eternal pursuits, and finds its ultimate reward not in earthly riches but in entrance into the everlasting kingdom of Christ.

## Core Truths

### The Promise of Diligent Labor

Solomon, the wisest of earthly kings, observed a consistent principle in human affairs: faithful effort yields abundance, while neglect brings poverty.

> _"He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread."_ (Proverbs 28:19)

> _"The hand of the diligent maketh rich."_ (Proverbs 10:4)

> _"The soul of the diligent shall be made fat."_ (Proverbs 13:4)

These promises extend beyond mere material prosperity. The Hebrew word translated "fat" (_dashen_) carries the sense of being satisfied, enriched, and blessed in the fullest sense. God designed work as a blessing, not a curse—even before sin entered the world, Adam was given meaningful labor in Eden (Genesis 2:15).

[DYK🔎] The command to work predates the fall. God placed Adam in the garden "to dress it and to keep it" (Genesis 2:15), showing that purposeful labor is part of God's original design for human flourishing, not merely a consequence of sin.

### The Ruin of Slothfulness

The contrast is sobering:

> _"He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand."_ (Proverbs 10:4)

> _"The soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing."_ (Proverbs 13:4)

The sluggard is marked by desire without action—he wants the fruit but will not tend the tree. His longing produces only frustration, for he refuses the God-appointed means of obtaining what he craves.

> _"The hand of the diligent shall bear rule, but the slothful shall be under tribute."_ (Proverbs 12:24)

Here we see a social consequence: those who work faithfully rise to positions of responsibility, while the idle become dependent upon others. This is not arbitrary punishment but natural law—a harvest principle woven into the fabric of creation.

## Deeper Truths

### The Honor Given to the Faithful Worker

> _"Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men."_ (Proverbs 22:29)

Scripture provides a striking example in Jeroboam:

> _"And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph."_ (1 Kings 11:28)

[Q] **"But wasn't Jeroboam later a wicked king who led Israel into idolatry?"**

Indeed, Jeroboam's later apostasy is a sobering reminder that natural ability and diligence, apart from consecration to God, cannot sustain a man spiritually. His early industry opened doors of opportunity, but when tested, his heart was not fully surrendered to the Lord. This teaches us that diligence must be coupled with fidelity to God, or it becomes merely a tool for self-advancement rather than service to Heaven.

### The Visible Evidence of Character

Solomon was not only a teacher of wisdom; he was an observer of life. Walking past a neglected farm, he drew a powerful lesson:

> _"I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; and, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down."_ (Proverbs 24:30, 31)

> _"Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction."_ (Proverbs 24:32)

The condition of a man's property often reflects the condition of his soul. Broken fences, overgrown weeds, and crumbling walls tell a story of neglect that extends far beyond agriculture.

[ILL] A farmer once said to his neighbor, "I can tell what's going on in a man's heart by looking at his fence line." When we cease to maintain what God has entrusted to us—whether a home, a garden, or a relationship—the decay becomes visible to all. The weeds that overrun our outward affairs often mirror the thorns choking our spiritual life (Mark 4:18–19).

> _"By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through."_ (Ecclesiastes 10:18)

**Droppeth through**: The Hebrew pictures rain leaking through a neglected roof. Small neglects, left unattended, lead to great ruin.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Union of Temporal and Eternal Diligence

The apostle Paul unites what many separate—earthly duty and heavenly devotion:

> _"Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord."_ (Romans 12:11)

These three phrases form a single command. Our daily work, performed with energy and faithfulness, is itself an act of worship when done "as to the Lord" (Colossians 3:23). The Christian does not divide life into sacred and secular compartments; all of life is sacred when consecrated to God.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "business" (_spoude_) can also mean "earnestness" or "zeal." Paul is calling for the same intensity in daily responsibilities that we bring to spiritual pursuits—because in God's economy, they are inseparable.

### The Curse Upon Unfaithful Service

A solemn warning applies especially to those who labor in the Lord's work:

> _"Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully."_ (Jeremiah 48:10)

The margin renders "deceitfully" as "negligently" or "slackly." To serve God with half a heart—going through the motions while withholding true consecration—is to invite divine displeasure. God does not ask for perfection of ability, but He does require faithfulness of effort.

This connects to the sanctuary truth: the priests who served in the earthly tabernacle were to perform their duties with exactness and reverence. Every detail mattered because they were handling holy things. How much more should we, who serve the great High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, give our diligent best to His cause!

### Diligence and the Second Coming

Peter connects diligence directly with preparation for Christ's return:

> _"Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, without spot, and blameless."_ (2 Peter 3:14)

The "such things" Peter references include the dissolution of this present world and the establishment of "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (2 Peter 3:13). In light of these realities, diligence takes on eternal significance.

> _"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."_ (2 Peter 1:10, 11)

[Q] **"Does this mean we must earn our way into heaven by diligent works?"**

Not at all. The context of 2 Peter 1 makes clear that our diligence is the response to grace, not the cause of salvation. God has already "given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness" (2 Peter 1:3). His "exceeding great and precious promises" enable us to become "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4). Our diligence is the exercise of faith—the cooperation with divine power that works out what God has worked in (Philippians 2:12–13).

This is righteousness by faith in action: Christ supplies the power; we supply the consent. He imputes His righteousness for our justification; He imparts His righteousness for our sanctification. Our diligence is simply the outworking of His indwelling life.

## Practical Application

What does diligent Christian living look like in daily experience?

1. **In our daily work**: Whatever our occupation, we labor "heartily, as to the Lord" (Colossians 3:23). Punctuality, thoroughness, and integrity mark the Christian worker. Our employment becomes a mission field.

2. **In our homes**: The condition of our dwelling reflects our stewardship. We maintain what God has given—not for pride, but for usefulness and as a witness to others.

3. **In our spiritual life**: We give diligence to prayer, Bible study, and the cultivation of Christian graces. Spiritual slothfulness produces a soul overgrown with thorns.

4. **In the Lord's work**: Whether in Sabbath School, personal witnessing, or church responsibilities, we serve with fervor, not formality. We avoid the curse upon negligent service.

5. **In preparing for Christ's return**: We give diligence to make our calling and election sure—not by anxious striving, but by daily surrender and cooperation with divine grace.

[ILL] A skilled watchmaker once said, "I give as much care to the gears no one sees as to the face everyone sees—because the hidden parts determine whether the visible hands tell true time." So the Christian cultivates hidden faithfulness in small duties, knowing that these determine whether our public witness rings true.

## Appeal

> _"For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."_ (2 Peter 1:11)

What a promise! Not a narrow, barely-achieved entrance, but an _abundant_ welcome into eternal glory. This awaits those who, by God's grace, give diligence in temporal and spiritual things.

The sluggard's field is overgrown with thorns—but it need not remain so. Today, the Master Gardener offers to work in us and through us. He asks only for our willing cooperation.

Will you give Him your diligence? Not the anxious striving of one trying to earn salvation, but the joyful labor of one who has received it—working out what He has worked in, cultivating the soul-garden that He may bring forth fruit unto eternal life.

Begin today. Mend the broken wall. Pull the first weed. Do the next duty faithfully. And know that He who calls you to diligence supplies the strength to perform it.

> _"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:24)
