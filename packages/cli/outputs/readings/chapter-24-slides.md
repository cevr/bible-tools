## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Standard of Judgment

- **Question:** According to God's standard of judgment, how many can be
  justified?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 143:2 – “And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for
  in thy sight shall no man living be justified.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (The Dilemma)

- **The Standard of Judgment:**
  - God’s law is a transcript of His character (holy, just, and good).
  - Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and
    just, and good.”
  - It requires perfect, perpetual obedience.
- **The Human Condition:**
  - Since the fall, human nature is depraved.
  - Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”
  - If judged solely on our own merits, no living soul can stand.
- **The Definition of Justification:**
  - A legal term meaning to be declared righteous.
  - It means to be acquitted of guilt and treated as if one had never sinned.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Courtroom and the Ledger:**
  - Imagine a man in court with a ledger of unpayable debts (sins).
  - The Judge asks for payment. The man checks his pockets; they are empty.
  - He cannot justify his standing by showing empty pockets.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Like the debtor, we have no "currency" of righteousness to pay our debt to
    the law.
  - We need a benefactor to deposit the full amount before we can stand before
    the Judge.

## Slide 4 – Q2: How to Become Justified

- **Question:** How may one become justified?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 53:11 – “By his knowledge shall My righteous servant
  justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (The Substitute)

- **The Righteous Servant:**
  - The prophecy points to Jesus Christ, the only One who lived a life of
    perfect obedience.
  - Hebrews 4:15 – “For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
    the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we
    are, yet without sin.”
- **Bearing Iniquities:**
  - Christ paid the penalty the law demanded (death) so the sinner could go
    free.
- **Justification by Knowledge:**
  - To "know" God means to be in an intimate, covenant relationship (John 17:3).
  - Through this connection, His righteousness is accounted to us.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration (Sanctuary)

- **The Lamb of God:**
  - In the ancient sanctuary, the sinner brought a lamb and confessed his sin
    over its head.
  - The sin was symbolically transferred from the man to the lamb.
  - The man left clean, not because he was innocent, but because the lamb bore
    his iniquity.
- **The Reality:**
  - Christ is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Source and Method

- **Question:** By whom and by what are men justified?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:23, 24 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the
  glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that
  is in Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **The Source: Grace**
  - Grace is unmerited favor—God giving us what we do not deserve.
  - It is given "freely." It costs us nothing, but it cost Heaven everything.
- **The Method: Redemption**
  - Implies a "buying back" from the slavery of sin.
  - 1 Peter 1:18-19 – “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
    corruptible things... But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb
    without blemish and without spot.”
- **The Agent: Christ Jesus**
  - The Father provides the plan; the Son provides the payment.
  - Acts 4:12 – “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
    other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Function of the Law

- **Question:** Why cannot men be justified by the deeds of the law?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:20 – “For by the law is the knowledge of sin.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **A Diagnostic Tool:**
  - The law reveals God’s standard and our moral deformity.
  - It brings the "knowledge of sin," not the cure for sin.
- **No Power to Save:**
  - The law says, "Do this and live," but the sinner is weak and cannot obey in
    his own strength.
  - Romans 8:3 – “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
    flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
    condemned sin in the flesh.”
- **The Necessity of the Gospel:**
  - Because the law condemns us, we must look away from the law to the Saviour
    for the remedy.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Mirror and the Soap:**
  - A mirror is excellent for showing you that your face is dirty.
  - However, you cannot take the mirror off the wall and use it to wash your
    face.
- **The Application:**
  - Trying to be saved by law-keeping is like trying to wash with a mirror.
  - The Mirror (Law) points you to the Soap and Water (Christ’s blood and
    grace).

## Slide 12 – Q5: Salvation and Unrighteousness

- **Question:** Can the unrighteous be saved?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 6:9 – “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not
  inherit the kingdom of God?”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (No Cheap Grace)

- **The Nature of the Kingdom:**
  - Heaven is a place of perfect purity; the unrighteous would be miserable in
    God’s presence.
- **Real Transformation:**
  - God saves men _from_ sin, not _in_ sin.
  - Justification is not a legal fiction; it begins a real work of holiness.
- **Definition of Sanctification:**
  - The process where the Spirit imparts Christ's nature to the believer.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Remission of Sins

- **Question:** Through whose righteousness is remission of sins obtained?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:24, 25 – “...Christ Jesus, whom God hath set forth to
  be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for
  the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Propitiation:**
  - Refers to the "mercy seat" in the sanctuary.
  - The law (condemnation) was inside the ark; the mercy seat (grace) was above
    it, sprinkled with blood.
- **Christ as Mercy Seat:**
  - Christ stands between the sinner and the broken law.
  - His blood satisfies justice so mercy can be extended.
- **Remission:**
  - Past sins are wiped clean because Christ’s sacrifice is sufficient.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The High Priest’s Work:**
  - In the earthly service, the High Priest sprinkled blood on the mercy seat to
    make atonement (Leviticus 16).
  - This foreshadowed Christ presenting His own blood in the heavenly sanctuary
    to secure our pardon.

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Great Exchange

- **Question:** For what was Christ made sin?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:21 – “For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who
  knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **Christ Took What Was Ours:**
  - He was "made to be sin" though He never sinned.
  - He felt the crushing weight and separation from God that sin causes.
- **We Receive What Is His:**
  - We are "made the righteousness of God."
  - We are credited with the positive, perfect life of Jesus.
- **"In Him":**
  - This righteousness is a relationship, not a commodity. We possess it only
    while connected to Christ by faith.

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Name of the Saviour

- **Question:** Then what may we call the Saviour?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 23:6 – “And this is His name whereby He shall be
  called, The Lord Our Righteousness.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

- **A New Identity:**
  - _Yahweh Tsidkenu_ — "The Lord Our Righteousness."
  - Christ’s very identity relative to us is that He _is_ our standing before
    God.
- **Total Dependence:**
  - We have no righteousness of our own to offer.
  - Isaiah 64:6 – “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
    righteousnesses are as filthy rags...”
- **Assurance:**
  - When accused by Satan, we do not point to our deeds; we point to Jesus.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Condition of Justification

- **Question:** On what condition may we obtain this righteousness and
  justification?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:26 – “To declare, I say, at this time His
  righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth
  in Jesus.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points

- **The Condition: Faith:**
  - Righteousness is not sold for money or penance.
  - It is received solely by believing in Jesus.
- **Just and Justifier:**
  - God is **Just**: He did not ignore the penalty (Christ paid it).
  - God is the **Justifier**: He accepts Christ’s payment on our behalf.
- **Definition of Faith:**
  - The hand that reaches out to accept the gift of God.
  - Trusting God's Word and accepting His provision.

## Slide 23 – Q10: Imputed Righteousness

- **Question:** Who may obtain this imputed righteousness?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:22 – “Even the righteousness of God which is by faith
  of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no
  difference.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points

- **Universal Offer:**
  - The offer is "unto all." No race or class is excluded.
- **Limited Receipt:**
  - It comes "upon all them that believe." Faith is the requirement.
- **Two Aspects of Righteousness:**
  - **Imputed Righteousness:** Christ’s character reckoned to us
    (Justification/Title to Heaven).
  - **Imparted Righteousness:** Christ’s character lived out in us
    (Sanctification/Fitness for Heaven).

## Slide 25 – Q11: Persisting in Sin

- **Question:** Sin is the transgression of God's law... Can one, while
  persisting in sin, expect justification?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 2:17 – “But if, while we seek to be justified by
  Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister
  of sin? God forbid.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points

- **No License to Sin:**
  - Grace is not permission to continue in rebellion ("God forbid").
- **Christ’s Mission:**
  - To save His people _from_ their sins, not _in_ them.
  - Matthew 1:21 – “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his
    name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.”
- **The Goal:**
  - Justification is the gateway to a new life of obedience.
  - Saving faith always produces the fruit of obedience.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Doctor and the Cure:**
  - If a doctor cures a man of alcohol poisoning, he does not do it so the man
    can return to drinking.
  - He cures him to give him a fresh start at a healthy life.
  - To return to the poison is to despise the cure.

## Slide 28 – Q12: Forgiveness and Cleansing

- **Question:** In order to have one's sins forgiven, and his unrighteousness
  cleansed away, what is necessary?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
  forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points

- **Necessity of Confession:**
  - We must acknowledge guilt without excuses.
  - Proverbs 28:13 – “He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
    confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.”
- **Faithful and Just:**
  - **Faithful:** He keeps His promise.
  - **Just:** Justice demands the release of the sinner because Christ paid the
    price.
- **Double Promise:**
  1.  **Forgiveness:** Judicial pardon (Justification).
  2.  **Cleansing:** Removal of unrighteousness (Sanctification).

## Slide 30 – Q13: Purification and Obedience

- **Question:** Can one be purified without obedience?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Acts 15:9 – “And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
    hearts by faith.”
  - 1 Peter 1:22 – “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
    through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren...”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Mechanism:**
  - Hearts are purified "by faith" (Acts 15:9) and "in obeying the truth" (1
    Peter 1:22).
  - True faith inevitably leads to obedience.
- **Obedience of Faith:**
  - You cannot believe God is King while refusing His commands.
  - Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
    fulfilling of the law.”
- **Summary:**
  - Obedience is the visible evidence of invisible faith.

## Slide 32 – Q14: Law and Faith

- **Question:** Does the fact that we are justified, or made righteous, by
  faith, release us from obligation to keep God's law?
- **Key Text:** Romans 3:31 – “Do we then make void the law through faith? God
  forbid: yea, we establish the law.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points

- **Establishing the Law:**
  - To claim faith abolishes the law is to misunderstand the Cross.
  - If the law could be abolished, Christ need not have died.
- **Two Ways Faith Establishes Law:**
  1.  **In the Atonement:** It affirms the justice of the law’s penalty.
  2.  **In the Heart:** Under the New Covenant, God writes the law within us.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant... I will put my laws into their
    mind, and write them in their hearts...”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Paid Fine:**
  - A friend pays a massive fine for a man imprisoned for reckless driving.
  - Does this act of grace mean the man is free to drive recklessly again?
  - No! Gratitude obligates him to drive carefully.
  - The law is not destroyed by the payment; it is honored.

## Slide 35 – Q15: Defining Faith

- **Question:** What is faith?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:1 – “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for,
  the evidence of things not seen.”

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points

- **Substance (Assurance):**
  - Faith is the "title deed" of things not yet seen.
  - It treats God’s promises as present realities.
- **Taking God at His Word:**
  - Faith accepts forgiveness because God says so, regardless of feelings.
- **The Victory:**
  - Faith connects human weakness to Divine power.
  - 1 John 5:4 – “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this
    is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Peace with God

- **Question:** When one does this, and is in perfect accord with all of God's
  commandments, what may he then have?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace
  with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points

- **The End of Hostility:**
  - Sin is war against God’s government.
  - When we accept Christ’s righteousness, the war ends.
- **Reconciliation:**
  - We are no longer enemies, but sons and daughters.
- **Through Christ:**
  - This peace is not just a feeling; it is an objective status mediated by
    Jesus.

## Slide 39 – Q17: Holding Justification

- **Question:** In what way may we hold our justification and fellowship with
  God?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:7 – “But if we walk in the light, as He is in the
  light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His
  Son cleanseth us from all sin.”

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points

- **A Continual Walk:**
  - Justification initiates a walk; it is not a stagnant state.
- **Walking in the Light:**
  - Living in responsiveness to God’s revealed will.
  - To reject new light (truth) is to step back into darkness.
- **Continuous Cleansing:**
  - "Cleanseth" is present continuous.
  - As we walk with Him, the blood of Christ continually covers and cleanses us.

## Slide 41 – Q18: Peace of Mind

- **Question:** How great will be the peace of mind enjoyed by those who have
  this experience?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 4:7 – “And the peace of God, which passeth all
  understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points

- **Beyond Understanding:**
  - The world cannot understand Christian calm amidst trial or judgment.
  - Colossians 3:3 – “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.”
- **A Garrison:**
  - The word "keep" means to guard like a military garrison.
  - God’s peace stands guard over our emotions (hearts) and thoughts (minds).

## Slide 43 – Q19: Waiting for the Lord

- **Question:** What will be a prominent characteristic of those who wait for
  the return of their Lord from heaven?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:37, 38 – “For yet a little while, and He that shall
  come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if
  any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.”

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points

- **Living by Faith:**
  - As the Second Coming approaches, earthly supports will fail.
  - The righteous must live solely by their connection to Christ.
- **Perseverance:**
  - The danger is "drawing back" to the world or doubting God’s word.
  - God takes "no pleasure" in those who draw back because it shows a lack of
    trust.
- **Trusting Completely:**
  - The final generation vindicates God by trusting Him even when they cannot
    buy or sell.

## Slide 45 – Q20: The Faith of Jesus

- **Question:** What will accompany the faith of Jesus?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are
  they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 46 – Q20: Key Points (Law and Gospel United)

- **The Fruit of Justification:**
  - These "saints" are not legalists; they are made holy by Christ.
- **Keeping the Commandments:**
  - Because they have the "faith of Jesus," the law is written on their hearts.
  - They obey because they love the Lawgiver and are saved by Him.
- **Harmony:**
  - Justification by Faith leads to Sanctified Obedience.
  - They prove that God’s law can be kept by humanity through the power of
    Christ.

## Slide 47 – Q20: Illustration

- **The Two Rails:**
  - A train runs on two rails; running on one causes a crash.
  - The Christian life runs on the rails of **Law** (God’s standard) and
    **Gospel** (God’s power/grace).
  - The Third Angel’s Message brings them together: "Here are they that keep the
    commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
