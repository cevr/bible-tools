### Q1. For what purpose did the Saviour utter the parable of the importunate widow?

**"And He spoke a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray,
and not to faint." Luke 18:1.**

**Answer:** The Saviour gave this parable to teach the necessity of perseverance
in prayer. The human heart is prone to discouragement when answers do not come
immediately, or when circumstances seem dark.

- **The Nature of "Fainting":** To "faint" in this context means to lose heart,
  to give up hope, or to cease communicating with God because of discouragement.
- **Constant Dependence:** "Always to pray" does not mean we remain on our knees
  every moment, but that the heart is constantly uplifted to God. It is an
  attitude of unceasing dependence on divine power for every breath of spiritual
  life.
- **The Time of the End:** As we approach the final scenes of earth’s history,
  the temptation to "faint" will increase due to the prevalence of iniquity
  (Matthew 24:12). The believer must maintain a living connection with heaven to
  stand.

**[ILL] The Diver’s Air Line:** Imagine a deep-sea diver. He relies entirely on
the air line connecting him to the surface. He does not breathe deeply only once
a week; he draws breath moment by moment. If the line is cut or if he stops
breathing, he perishes. Prayer is the breath of the soul; to stop praying is to
faint spiritually and die.

### Q2. If one asks in the proper way for what he needs, how will his prayer be regarded?

**"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe
that ye receive them, and ye shall have them." Mark 11:24.**

**Answer:** God regards the prayer of faith as a transaction already completed
in heaven. The condition for receiving is believing that God is true to His
Word.

- **The Definition of Faith:** Faith is not merely a feeling or an emotion; it
  is taking God at His word. It is trusting that what God has promised, He is
  able and willing to perform (Romans 4:21).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** This principle applies directly to our salvation.
  When the repentant sinner asks for pardon and cleansing, they must _believe_
  that Christ’s righteousness is imputed (credited) to them immediately, not
  because they feel different, but because God has promised it (1 John 1:9).
  - _Justification:_ The legal declaration that a sinner is righteous through
    the merits of Christ. We receive this by the same faith described in Mark
    11:24.
- **Present Possession:** The text says "believe that ye receive them" (present
  tense). We claim the blessing by faith before we realize it by sight.

**[ILL] The Certified Check:** If a wealthy, honest friend gives you a check for
a large sum, you count that money as yours the moment you hold the paper, even
before you go to the bank. You make plans based on it. God’s promises are His
checks. When we pray according to His will, we have the "check" in our hands,
and faith treats it as reality.

### Q3. What must accompany faith in order that our hearts shall not condemn us, and that we may have the things of which we ask?

**"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments,
and do those things that are pleasing in His sight." 1 John 3:22.**

**Answer:** Faith must be accompanied by a life of willing obedience. Sin
separates the soul from God (Isaiah 59:2); therefore, cherishing known sin cuts
the line of communication.

- **Harmony of Will:** Prayer is not a way to force God to do our will; it is a
  way of bringing us into harmony with His will. We cannot expect God to favor
  us with blessings if we are knowingly rebelling against His government.
- **The Fruit, Not the Root:** We do not keep the commandments to _earn_ answers
  to prayer (legalism). Rather, keeping the commandments is the evidence that
  Christ is dwelling in us.
  - _Sanctification:_ The work of the Holy Spirit to make the believer holy and
    obedient in character.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** True faith always works by love and purifies the
  soul (Galatians 5:6). If a man claims to have faith but refuses to obey God’s
  law, his faith is dead (James 2:20). The power to obey comes from the same
  Source that answers the prayer: Christ within.

**[ILL] The Clogged Pipe:** A water pipe brings water to a house, just as faith
brings blessings from God. But if the pipe is clogged with mud and debris, the
water cannot flow. The water is still available at the source, but the blockage
stops it. Known sin—refusing to do what pleases God—is the "clog" that hinders
the flow of God's grace.

### Q4. If one does not ask in faith, what does he gain?

**"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is like a
wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think
that he shall receive any- thing of the Lord." James 1:6, 7.**

**Answer:** The one who doubts or wavers gains nothing. God cannot answer the
prayer of a double-minded man because such a person is not truly surrendered to
the outcome God provides.

- **Double-mindedness:** This refers to a person who wants God's blessing but
  also wants to hold onto the world. They want victory over sin, yet they still
  secretly love the sin.
- **The Insult of Unbelief:** To doubt God is to make Him a liar (1 John 5:10).
  If God has promised to hear us, and we doubt He will, we are questioning His
  character.
- **Steadfast Confidence:** In the investigative judgment and the final
  atonement, God’s people will need a faith that endures even when they cannot
  see. We must learn now to trust the Unseen Hand.

**[ILL] The Anchorless Ship:** A ship without an anchor or a rudder is at the
mercy of every wind and wave. It drifts aimlessly and reaches no destination. A
prayer without faith is like that ship—it has no stability and never reaches the
port of Heaven.

### Q5. If prayer is offered while cherishing an unforgiving spirit toward another, of what avail is it?

**"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; that your
Father also which is in heaven may for- give you your trespasses. But if ye do
not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your
trespasses." Mark 11:25, 26.**

**Answer:** Prayer offered while holding a grudge is of no avail. God cannot
forgive us while we remain unforgiving toward others, because the spirit of
unforgiveness is the spirit of Satan, not of Christ.

- **The Condition of Mercy:** We are saved by grace alone, but a heart that has
  truly received grace will inevitably show grace to others. If we refuse to be
  a channel of God's mercy to others, we block the flow of mercy to ourselves.
- **Sanctuary Cleansing:** In the Day of Atonement (the judgment), we seek to
  have our sins blotted out. We cannot have our sins removed if we are holding
  onto bitterness.
- **Practical Righteousness:** "Righteousness by Faith" means having the
  character of Christ imparted to us. Christ prayed for His enemies ("Father,
  forgive them," Luke 23:34). To be a Christian is to have this same spirit.

**[ILL] The Closed Door:** Imagine your heart is a room with one door. If you
slam the door shut to keep your enemy out, you also lock Christ out. You cannot
shut out your brother and keep God in at the same time.

### Q6. What course on the part of husbands or wives will prevent their prayers from being answered?

**"Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour
unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the
grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered." 1 Peter 3:7.**

**Answer:** Contention, discord, and a lack of honor in the home prevent prayers
from being answered.

- **The Home as a Symbol:** The family on earth is to be a symbol of the family
  in heaven. If there is strife, selfishness, or tyranny in the home, the Holy
  Spirit is grieved away.
- **Mutual Respect:** Peter emphasizes that husband and wife are "heirs
  together." Spiritually, they are equals before the Cross. Mistreatment of a
  spouse is a direct offense against God, who is the Father of that spouse.
- **The Barrier:** When the spirit of the home is agitated and unloving, the
  mind is unfit for communion with God. Peace with God requires peace with one
  another as much as lieth in us (Romans 12:18).

**[ILL] The Out-of-Tune Instrument:** If two musicians are trying to play a
duet, but they are constantly fighting and their instruments are out of tune
with each other, they cannot make beautiful music. Prayer is the music of the
soul. Domestic strife puts the heart out of tune, making harmony with heaven
impossible.

### Q7. What answer will he receive who turns away his ear from hearing the law?

**"Even his prayer shall be abomination." Prov. 28:9.**

**Answer:** The prayer of one who willfully rejects God's law is considered an
"abomination" (a detestable thing).

- **Rebellion vs. Ignorance:** This does not refer to those who are ignorant of
  the law, but to those who "turn away their ear"—who willfully refuse to listen
  or obey.
- **Law and Gospel:** One cannot separate the Saviour from His Law. The Law is a
  transcript of His character. To claim to love Jesus while despising His Law is
  a contradiction.
- **The New Covenant:** Under the New Covenant, God writes His law in the heart
  (Hebrews 8:10). Therefore, the true believer delights in the law of God
  (Romans 7:22) and seeks to obey it through the power of the indwelling Christ.
  To reject the law is to reject the covenant of grace.

**[ILL] The Patient and the Prescription:** A man goes to a doctor asking for
health, but he throws the doctor’s prescription in the trash. His request for
health is a mockery because he rejects the method of healing. God’s law is the
prescription for moral health. To pray for blessing while rejecting the law is
an insult to the Great Physician.

### Q8. When the conditions are complied with on which answers to prayer may be expected, for what may petitions be offered?

**Answer:** The Bible authorizes us to bring every need to God. Based on the
texts provided, we may pray for:

1.  **Spiritual Cleansing and Power:**
    - **Forgiveness of Sin:** (2 Chron. 7:14; 1 John 5:16). This is the first
      step in the plan of salvation—Justification.
    - **The Holy Spirit:** (Luke 11:13; John 14:16). We must pray for the "oil"
      in our lamps to be ready for the Bridegroom.
    - **Deliverance from Temptation:** (Matt. 6:13; Ps. 91). We pray for the
      power to overcome sin.
    - **Wisdom:** (James 1:5; Dan. 2:17-19). Especially for understanding
      prophecy and God's will.

2.  **Physical and Temporal Needs:**
    - **Healing of the Sick:** (James 5:14, 15). God is still the Great
      Physician.
    - **Temporal Prosperity:** (James 5:17, 18; Zech. 10:1). We pray for rain,
      food, and resources so that "the work of God be not hindered."

3.  **Intercession for Others:**
    - **Ministers:** (Eph. 6:18, 19). Those on the front lines of spiritual
      warfare need covering.
    - **Rulers:** (Ezra 6:10; Acts 23:5). We pray for peace in the land so the
      Gospel can spread.
    - **The Persecuted:** (Heb. 13:3). We are to remember those in bonds as if
      bound with them.

4.  **The Triumph of the Gospel:**
    - **Vindication of God’s Cause:** (1 Kings 18:30-39). Like Elijah, we pray
      that God will turn hearts back to Him.
    - **The Coming of Christ:** (Matt. 6:10; Rev. 22:20). "Thy Kingdom Come"
      should be the longing of every Adventist heart.

**[ILL] The Child and the Parent:** A child comes to a parent with a scraped
knee (healing), asking for help with homework (wisdom), asking for lunch
(temporal needs), or asking forgiveness for breaking a vase (pardon). A loving
parent is interested in _all_ these things. So is our Heavenly Father.

### Q9. If an answer does not come at the time and in the manner expected, what should be the attitude of the petitioner?

**"Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him." Ps. 37:7.**

**Answer:** When answers are delayed, the believer is to rest in faith and wait
patiently, trusting God's timing and wisdom.

- **God’s Higher Wisdom:** We are finite; God is infinite. We see only the
  present; He sees the end from the beginning. He often answers our prayers in
  the way we _would_ wish them to be answered if we could see all things as He
  sees them.
- **Character Building:** The period of waiting is often a time of
  sanctification. It tests our faith, purifies our motives, and teaches us to
  rely on the Giver rather than the gift.
- **The Sanctuary Analogy:** Just as the Israelites waited outside while the
  High Priest performed the work in the Sanctuary (Luke 1:10, 21), we live in
  the antitypical Day of Atonement. We wait for Christ to finish His work of
  judgment and blotting out of sins. We must not become impatient with the
  delay, for "He that shall come will come, and will not tarry" (Hebrews 10:37).

**[ILL] The Sharp Knife:** A small child may ask his father for a sharp knife,
thinking it a shiny toy. The father, who loves the child, refuses or gives a
dull spoon instead. The child may cry, thinking the prayer unanswered, but the
father has answered according to love and wisdom, not according to the child's
ignorance. We must trust that God knows what is safe for us to handle.
