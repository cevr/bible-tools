# Bible Study: Answers to Prayer

## Introduction

Prayer is the breath of the soul, the channel through which God pours His blessings upon His children. Yet many believers struggle with unanswered prayers, wondering if God hears them at all. Scripture reveals that God has established clear conditions for answered prayer—not to limit His generosity, but to prepare our hearts to receive His gifts. Understanding these conditions transforms prayer from ritual repetition into living communion with the Almighty.

## Core Truths

### The Duty of Persistent Prayer

Christ spoke the parable of the importunate widow "to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint" (Luke 18:1). This woman, who had no advocate and no power, obtained justice from an unjust judge through sheer persistence. How much more shall our loving Father respond to His children who cry unto Him day and night?

> "Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them." (Mark 11:24)

Notice the tense: "believe that ye receive them"—present tense—at the moment of asking. Faith grasps the promise before the answer is visible to mortal eyes.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "faint" in Luke 18:1 (_enkakeō_) means to lose heart, to become weary, or to turn coward. Jesus is teaching that prayer is spiritual warfare—and warriors must not desert their post.

### The Foundation of Living Faith

Faith is essential, but Scripture reveals that genuine faith cannot exist apart from obedience:

> "And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight." (1 John 3:22)

This is not salvation by works—it is the fruit of a heart surrendered to Christ. When we walk in harmony with God's revealed will, our desires become aligned with His purposes, and our prayers rise as sweet incense before His throne.

[Q] **"Does this mean I must be perfect before God will hear my prayers?"**

Not at all. The condition is not sinless perfection but a heart of sincere obedience—one that, when shown truth, embraces it rather than resists it. The publican who cried "God be merciful to me a sinner" went home justified, while the self-righteous Pharisee did not (Luke 18:13-14). God looks upon the heart's attitude toward His law, not upon our imperfect performance.

### Hindrances to Answered Prayer

Scripture identifies several barriers that block our prayers:

**1. Wavering Faith**

> "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord." (James 1:6-7)

**2. An Unforgiving Spirit**

> "And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses." (Mark 11:25)

**3. Discord in Relationships**
Peter warns that husbands who dishonor their wives will find their "prayers hindered" (1 Peter 3:7). Contention in the home closes the door to heaven.

**4. Rejection of God's Law**

> "He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination." (Proverbs 28:9)

[ILL] Imagine a child who deliberately covers his ears when his father speaks, refusing to hear household instructions. Yet when dinner is ready, he comes demanding his portion. Would any wise parent reward such defiance? So God cannot honor the prayers of those who willfully reject His revealed will while seeking His benefits.

## Deeper Truths

### The Breadth of Lawful Petitions

When we walk in obedience and faith, Scripture opens a vast field of prayer:

**Spiritual Blessings:**

- Forgiveness of sin (2 Chronicles 7:14; 1 John 5:16)
- The gift of the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13; John 14:16)
- Deliverance from temptation (Matthew 6:13; Psalm 91)
- Wisdom and understanding (James 1:5; Daniel 2:17-19)

**Blessings for Others:**

- Healing of the sick (James 5:14-15)
- Prosperity of God's ministers (Ephesians 6:18-19)
- Those suffering for truth's sake (Hebrews 13:3; Acts 12:5)
- Civil rulers and authorities (Ezra 6:10)

**Temporal Needs:**

- Rain and harvest (James 5:17-18; Zechariah 10:1)
- God's vindication of His cause (1 Kings 18:30-39)

**The Ultimate Request:**

- The coming of Christ and His kingdom (Matthew 6:10; Revelation 22:20)

[DYK🔎] When Daniel needed God's wisdom to reveal Nebuchadnezzar's dream, he gathered his three companions for united prayer (Daniel 2:17-19). The answer came that very night. There is power in corporate, believing prayer that God delights to honor.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the altar of incense stood directly before the veil separating the holy from the most holy place. Incense ascended continually, representing the prayers of God's people mingled with the merits of Christ's intercession (Revelation 8:3-4).

Today, Christ stands as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, presenting our prayers before the Father. His righteousness—imputed to us by faith—makes our unworthy petitions acceptable. We do not come in our own merit but in the merits of our Intercessor.

> "Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God... Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace." (Hebrews 4:14, 16)

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Prayer as Spiritual Warfare

Satan trembles when he sees the weakest saint upon his knees. Prayer is the arm that moves Omnipotence. In the great controversy, our prayers are weapons—not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers (Ephesians 6:12, 18).

The conditions for answered prayer—faith, obedience, forgiveness, unity—are not arbitrary rules. They are the very qualities of Christlike character that Satan desperately wants to destroy. When we meet these conditions, we are being transformed into the image of Christ, fitting us for heaven while gaining heaven's power on earth.

### Righteousness by Faith and Prayer

The obedience that opens heaven's doors is not generated by human effort. It is the fruit of Christ living within by faith. We obey because we love; we love because He first loved us. The law kept in the heart through faith becomes the very channel of blessing.

[Q] **"If I struggle with doubt, does that mean God won't hear me?"**

There is a difference between the doubt that questions God's existence and power, and the honest struggle of a heart crying, "Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief!" (Mark 9:24). God honors sincere faith, even when weak. The prayer for stronger faith is itself a prayer God delights to answer.

## Practical Application

### When Answers Delay

> "Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him." (Psalm 37:7)

God's delays are not denials. Sometimes He delays to:

- Strengthen our faith through perseverance
- Align our desires more fully with His will
- Prepare circumstances for a greater blessing
- Reveal areas of our hearts that need surrender

[ILL] A farmer plants seed and waits. He does not dig up the soil daily to check for growth—that would destroy the very harvest he seeks. He trusts the laws of nature and the God who ordained them. So must we trust God's timing, knowing that He who began a good work will complete it (Philippians 1:6).

### Daily Practice

1. **Begin with praise and thanksgiving**—acknowledging who God is
2. **Confess known sin**—clearing the channel of communication
3. **Forgive others**—releasing bitterness before it blocks blessing
4. **Ask in faith**—claiming promises, not bargaining with God
5. **Wait patiently**—trusting God's timing and wisdom
6. **Act in harmony with your prayers**—faith without works is dead

## Appeal

> "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." (Matthew 7:7)

God stands ready to pour out blessings beyond what we can imagine. The door is open. The conditions are clear—not to earn His favor, but to position our hearts to receive it.

Will you today surrender any barrier between your soul and heaven? Will you forgive as you wish to be forgiven? Will you embrace the truth God has shown you, walking in the light as He is in the light?

Heaven waits to answer. The question is not whether God is willing—but whether we are ready to receive.
