# Bible Study: The Atonement in the New Testament

## Introduction

The death of Jesus Christ on Calvary was not the end of His saving work, but the beginning of a new phase. When the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom, Heaven declared that the earthly sanctuary system had served its purpose—the true Lamb had been slain. Yet the work of atonement was not complete at the cross. Christ ascended to minister as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, the "true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man" (Hebrews 8:2). Understanding this heavenly ministry is essential to grasping the full scope of God's plan to restore sinners to perfect harmony with His holy law.

## Core Truths

### The Veil Torn: A Divine Declaration

When Jesus breathed His last, something extraordinary occurred:

> _"Jesus, when He had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom."_ (Matthew 27:50, 51)

This was no accident of nature. The veil—a heavy curtain separating the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place—was torn **from top to bottom**, signifying that God Himself had ended the earthly system. The priests standing in the temple that afternoon witnessed Heaven's own hand declaring: "The shadow has met the substance. The type has found its antitype."

[DYK🔎] The temple veil was approximately 60 feet high, 30 feet wide, and four inches thick—so heavy it reportedly required 300 priests to hang it. No human hands could have torn it; this was unmistakably a divine act.

### Christ's Ministry Transferred to Heaven

Where does Christ now minister?

> _"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."_ (Hebrews 8:1, 2)

The earthly sanctuary was always a **shadow** of heavenly realities (Hebrews 8:5). Moses was shown the pattern on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25:40), and everything built on earth pointed to something greater in heaven. Now that the true sacrifice has been offered, the ministry continues—not in a tent made by human hands, but in the very throne room of God.

### Why Christ Could Not Be Priest on Earth

Scripture makes a striking statement:

> _"For if He were on earth, He should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law."_ (Hebrews 8:4)

Christ came from the tribe of Judah, not Levi. Under the Mosaic system, He had no earthly right to priestly office. But His priesthood is of a different order—"after the order of Melchisedec" (Hebrews 7:17)—a royal priesthood, eternal and unchangeable, exercised in the courts above.

[Q] **"If Jesus finished the work of salvation on the cross, why does He need to minister in heaven?"**

The cross provided the sacrifice—the Lamb was slain once for all (Hebrews 10:10). But atonement involves more than sacrifice; it involves the **application** of that sacrifice to individual cases. In the earthly sanctuary, the lamb was killed in the outer court, but the blood was then brought **inside** the sanctuary and ministered by the priest. The killing of the lamb was essential, but it was not the whole atonement. So it is with Christ: His death provided the blood; His priestly ministry applies that blood to our cases before the throne of God.

## Deeper Truths

### The Heavenly Sanctuary Is Real

Some have spiritualized the heavenly sanctuary into mere symbolism, but Scripture speaks of it in concrete terms:

> _"For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true."_ (Hebrews 9:24)

Note carefully: the earthly holy places are called "figures of the true." The heavenly sanctuary is the **reality**; the earthly was the shadow. John beheld this reality in vision:

> _"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament."_ (Revelation 11:19)

The ark of the covenant—containing the Ten Commandments—exists in heaven. The law of God, often dismissed as abolished, is enshrined at the very center of God's throne room. This is no small matter.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "ark" (_aron_) simply means "chest" or "box." But this particular chest, both earthly and heavenly, contains the moral constitution of God's government—His eternal, unchangeable law of love.

### The Heavenly Sanctuary Requires Cleansing

Here is a truth that surprises many:

> _"It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these."_ (Hebrews 9:23)

How can the heavenly sanctuary need cleansing? Has sin defiled heaven? Not in the sense of moral corruption entering God's presence, but in the sense of **recorded sins** transferred there through confession and priestly mediation. Just as the sins of Israel were symbolically transferred to the earthly sanctuary through the blood of sacrifices, so the confessed sins of God's people are recorded in the heavenly sanctuary. These records must be addressed—cases examined, decisions rendered, and sin forever removed.

[ILL] Consider a courtroom where cases are filed but not yet adjudicated. The courthouse itself is not corrupt, but it holds records of crimes awaiting judgment. When the judge renders verdicts and cases are closed, the courthouse is "cleansed" of pending business. So the heavenly sanctuary holds the records of confessed sins awaiting the great Day of Atonement, when all cases will be decided and sin forever removed from God's universe.

### The Day of Atonement: Type and Antitype

In the earthly sanctuary, the atonement was made once yearly on the tenth day of the seventh month (Leviticus 16). This was Israel's day of judgment:

> _"For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD."_ (Leviticus 16:30)

All who humbled their souls on that day were cleansed; all who did not were "cut off" from the congregation (Leviticus 23:29). This solemn day foreshadowed the final work Christ would perform in the heavenly sanctuary—a work of judgment and cleansing that would determine the eternal destiny of every soul.

The earthly high priest made atonement year after year, but Christ offers Himself **once**:

> _"Nor yet that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with the blood of others... but now once in the end of the world hath He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself."_ (Hebrews 9:25, 26)

### The Scapegoat and the Final Removal of Sin

On the Day of Atonement, two goats were presented: one was slain as a sin offering, the other—the scapegoat—was led into the wilderness bearing the confessed sins of Israel (Leviticus 16:20–22).

The first goat represented Christ, whose blood makes atonement for sin. But what of the scapegoat? Notice that **no atonement was made by the scapegoat**—the sins were placed upon it only **after** the high priest had completed the atonement. The scapegoat bore responsibility for sins already atoned for.

This fitly represents Satan, the originator of sin. When Christ finishes His priestly work, the sins of God's people—already atoned for and forgiven—will be placed upon Satan's head. He will bear the ultimate responsibility for the sins he tempted men to commit.

> _"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation."_ (Hebrews 9:28)

When Christ emerges from the heavenly sanctuary, He comes "without sin"—not carrying it, not bearing it—for it has been placed where it belongs: upon the author of rebellion himself.

[Q] **"Isn't this teaching that Satan is our sin-bearer? Doesn't that diminish Christ's work?"**

Not at all. Christ **alone** atones for sin. Satan has no atoning power whatsoever. But Satan is the **responsible party** for originating sin. Just as a crime boss may be held accountable for crimes committed by those he corrupted, so Satan will bear ultimate responsibility for the sins he instigated—not as an atoner, but as an accomplice and instigator receiving his just punishment.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Investigative Judgment

Before Christ returns, a work of judgment must occur. Consider:

> _"But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead."_ (Luke 20:35)

The phrase "accounted worthy" implies examination—a decision rendered **before** the resurrection occurs. When Jesus comes, He brings His reward with Him (Revelation 22:12); the decisions have already been made. This investigative judgment takes place while Christ ministers in the Most Holy Place.

Daniel saw this judgment in vision:

> _"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit... the judgment was set, and the books were opened."_ (Daniel 7:9, 10)

Immediately following, the Son of Man receives His kingdom:

> _"One like the Son of man came... to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him near before Him. And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom."_ (Daniel 7:13, 14)

### When Does This Cleansing Occur?

Daniel was given a specific time:

> _"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."_ (Daniel 8:14)

This cannot refer to the earthly sanctuary, for the angel explained:

> _"Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision."_ (Daniel 8:17)

The earthly sanctuary was destroyed in A.D. 70. This prophecy reaches to the time of the end and points to the cleansing of the **heavenly** sanctuary—the great antitypical Day of Atonement.

[DYK🔎] The 2,300-day prophecy, using the prophetic day-year principle (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6), points to the year 1844, marking the beginning of Christ's final phase of ministry in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.

### The Blotting Out of Sins

Peter called the early Christians to a solemn preparation:

> _"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."_ (Acts 3:19)

Notice the sequence: repentance and conversion **now**, so that sins may be blotted out **then**. The blotting out of sins is a distinct work, connected with "the times of refreshing"—the final cleansing before Christ's return.

What follows immediately?

> _"And He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things."_ (Acts 3:20, 21)

The second coming follows the blotting out of sins. This is the glorious sequence: confession now, blotting out in the judgment, and then the appearing of our Lord.

## Practical Application

### Living in the Day of Atonement

If we are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement, what should characterize our lives?

1. **Deep Heart-Searching**: Israel was commanded to "afflict their souls" on that day (Leviticus 23:27). This was not mere external ritual, but deep self-examination and repentance. We too must search our hearts, confessing every known sin, that nothing may remain against us in the heavenly records.

2. **Full Surrender to Christ**: Righteousness by faith means trusting wholly in Christ's merits—not our own works—while allowing His indwelling Spirit to produce genuine obedience. The judgment examines not merely profession, but character transformed by grace.

3. **Watching and Waiting**: Those who "look for Him" will see Him appear "without sin unto salvation" (Hebrews 9:28). Are we among the waiting ones?

4. **Clearing the Records Now**: The only safe time to confess sin is **now**. Once a case is examined in the judgment, the decision is final. Let us not delay the work of repentance.

[ILL] A student preparing for final examinations does not wait until the exam begins to study. She reviews her notes, identifies weak areas, and seeks help **before** the test. So we, knowing that our cases will be examined in the heavenly court, must prepare now—confessing sin, seeking cleansing, and abiding in Christ.

### The Confidence of Faith

This solemn truth need not produce fear, but confidence:

> _"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."_ (Hebrews 4:16)

We have a High Priest who understands our weakness, who was "in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). He intercedes with His own blood—infinitely sufficient for every repentant soul. The judgment is not designed to condemn the sincere believer, but to vindicate those who have trusted in Christ.

## Appeal

> _"For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17)

Beloved, our High Priest stands even now before the throne of God, pleading His blood on behalf of all who come to Him by faith. The hour is solemn; the judgment is proceeding; the cases of God's people are being examined. But Christ is able to "save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them" (Hebrews 7:25).

Will you come to Him today? Will you confess every known sin, surrendering your life fully to His keeping? Will you trust not in your own righteousness, but in the merits of your Advocate?

The sanctuary truth reveals that God has made full provision for your salvation—a complete sacrifice, a faithful Priest, and a certain promise: those who look for Him will see Him appear "without sin unto salvation."

May we be among that blessed company.
