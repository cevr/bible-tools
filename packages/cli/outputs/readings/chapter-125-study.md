# Bible Study: Trusting in Jesus

## Introduction

Trust in Jesus is the foundation of the Christian life—the golden thread running from Old Testament prophecy through apostolic teaching into our experience today. This study explores what it means to trust fully in Christ: how trust brings salvation, seals us with the Holy Spirit, gives victory over the world, and even affects our temporal lives. In a world filled with anxiety and uncertainty, God invites us to rest wholly upon His Son.

## Core Truths

### Christ: The Object of Universal Trust

Long before Jesus walked the dusty roads of Palestine, the prophet Isaiah foretold that He would become the center of hope for all peoples:

> _"And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious."_ (Isaiah 11:10)

**Root of Jesse**: This title connects Jesus to David's father, emphasizing that the Messiah would come from humble origins yet become a rallying point—an "ensign" or banner—for all nations.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "ensign" (_nes_) is the same word used for the bronze serpent Moses lifted up in the wilderness (Numbers 21:8–9). Just as the Israelites looked to that serpent and lived, all humanity is invited to look to Christ and be saved (John 3:14–15).

The apostle Paul quotes this prophecy to the Romans, confirming its fulfillment in Christ:

> _"And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust."_ (Romans 15:12)

This was revolutionary—the Messiah came not merely for Israel but as the hope of the entire world. Every person, regardless of background, may trust in Him.

### The Sequence of Saving Trust

The apostle Paul, writing to the Ephesian believers, outlines the beautiful order by which trust brings salvation:

> _"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise."_ (Ephesians 1:13)

Notice the sequence:

1. **Hearing** the word of truth (the gospel)
2. **Trusting** (believing) in Christ
3. **Sealing** with the Holy Spirit

**Sealed**: In the ancient world, a seal indicated ownership, authenticity, and protection. The Holy Spirit's presence in the believer is God's mark that we belong to Him—secure and authentic.

The early apostles who "first trusted in Christ" became, as Paul writes, "to the praise of His glory" (Ephesians 1:12). Their lives demonstrated what trusting Jesus produces: transformed character that glorifies God.

[Q] **"Can I know for certain that I have the Holy Spirit's seal?"**

Scripture assures us that genuine trust in Christ brings the Spirit's witness. Paul writes, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God" (Romans 8:16). This is not a feeling-based assurance but a confidence rooted in God's promise and evidenced by the fruit of the Spirit in our lives (Galatians 5:22–23).

### The Gospel: Power Through Faith

> _"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."_ (Romans 1:16)

**Power** (_dunamis_): This Greek word gives us "dynamite." The gospel is not merely good advice or moral teaching—it is God's explosive, transforming energy released in those who believe.

[ILL] Consider electricity flowing through a wire. The power is present, but it accomplishes nothing unless connected to an appliance. So the gospel carries infinite saving power, but it becomes effective only when connected through faith. The moment we believe, God's power flows into our lives, transforming us from within.

## Deeper Truths

### Living Faith: The Just Shall Live

The writer of Hebrews sounds a solemn warning:

> _"Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him."_ (Hebrews 10:38)

This is not merely a statement about initial conversion but about ongoing, moment-by-moment dependence upon Christ. The "just"—those made righteous through faith—continue to _live_ by that same faith.

**Draw back**: The Greek suggests shrinking away, retreating from trust. God finds "no pleasure" in such retreat—not because He is vindictive, but because drawing back severs the connection through which His life flows to us.

[DYK🔎] This verse quotes Habakkuk 2:4, one of the most influential Old Testament texts in the New Testament. Paul uses it in Romans 1:17 and Galatians 3:11. Luther's discovery of this truth sparked the Protestant Reformation. The entire plan of salvation hinges on this principle: righteousness comes through trusting God, not through human achievement.

### Faith: The Victory Over the World

> _"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."_ (1 John 5:4)

**The world**: In John's writings, "the world" often represents the system of values, temptations, and pressures opposed to God—materialism, pride, lust, self-sufficiency.

**Overcometh**: Present tense in Greek, indicating continuous, ongoing victory. This is not a one-time battle but a lifestyle of conquest through faith.

[Q] **"How can faith be called 'the victory'? Doesn't victory require effort and struggle?"**

The victory _is_ faith because faith connects us to Christ, who has already overcome (John 16:33). We do not generate victory through willpower; we receive it through trusting the One who has already won. Our faith is the hand that grasps Christ's triumph and applies it to our experience. As we behold Him, we are "changed into the same image from glory to glory" (2 Corinthians 3:18).

### Peace in Tribulation

Jesus Himself connects trust with inner peace amid outer turmoil:

> _"These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."_ (John 16:33)

Christ does not promise removal of trials but peace _in the midst of_ them. His own victory becomes the ground of our confidence.

**Be of good cheer** (_tharseo_): This is a command, not a suggestion. Jesus calls us to courage based on His accomplished victory. He overcame the world at Calvary; our trust appropriates that victory daily.

### The Full Arsenal of Overcoming

Is trusting Jesus merely a passive, silent experience? Scripture reveals a more complete picture:

> _"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."_ (Revelation 12:11)

The overcomers in this text employ three weapons:

1. **The blood of the Lamb** – Christ's atoning sacrifice, claimed by faith
2. **The word of their testimony** – Public confession of what God has done
3. **Loving not their lives unto death** – Total surrender, holding nothing back

[ILL] A soldier in battle does not merely believe his general has a winning strategy—he also bears arms, follows orders, and engages the enemy. So the trusting Christian does not remain passive but actively claims Christ's blood, testifies of His power, and surrenders completely to His will. This is faith made active through love (Galatians 5:6).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Trust and the Sanctuary

The sanctuary reveals how trust connects us to Christ's saving work:

- **At the altar of burnt offering** (outer court), we trust in Christ's sacrifice—His blood shed for our sins. This is justification: God's declaration that we are righteous because of Christ.

- **In the holy place**, we trust Christ's daily intercession for us. The candlestick, table of shewbread, and altar of incense represent the ongoing light, nourishment, and prayer life sustained by our connection to our High Priest.

- **In the most holy place**, we trust Christ's final work of judgment and the blotting out of sins. The investigative judgment reveals that those who have trusted Christ will be vindicated—their records showing not perfect performance but persistent faith in a perfect Savior.

Throughout, faith is the golden cord binding the believer to Christ's ministry. We bring nothing but our trust; He supplies everything else.

### Righteousness by Faith and Victory

The Bible's teaching on trusting Jesus is the heart of righteousness by faith:

- **Imputed righteousness**: When we first trust Christ, His perfect righteousness is credited to our account (Romans 4:5, 22–24). We stand before God as though we had never sinned.

- **Imparted righteousness**: As we continue trusting, Christ's life within transforms our character (Galatians 2:20). The same faith that justifies also sanctifies.

This is not self-improvement but Christ-reception. "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption" (1 Corinthians 1:30).

[Q] **"If trusting Jesus brings victory over sin, why do Christians still struggle?"**

Struggle is not the same as defeat. Victory over the world (1 John 5:4) does not mean the absence of temptation but the presence of power to overcome. When we trust, the Holy Spirit provides strength for every battle. Failure comes when we shift our eyes from Christ to self, attempting to fight in our own strength. Peter walked on water while looking at Jesus but began to sink when he noticed the wind (Matthew 14:28–31). Continuous victory comes through continuous trust.

### Temporal Blessings Through Faith

While the primary focus of trust is eternal salvation, Scripture shows that faith also affects temporal circumstances:

> _"For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour."_ (Matthew 9:21–22)

Similar accounts are found throughout the Gospels:

- **Bartimaeus** received sight: "Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole" (Mark 10:52).
- **The ten lepers** were cleansed as they went in obedience, and one was told: "Thy faith hath made thee whole" (Luke 17:19).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "made thee whole" (_sozo_) is the same word for "saved." Physical healing was a visible demonstration of the spiritual salvation Christ offers. The faith that healed their bodies was the same faith that could heal their souls.

God does not promise physical healing in every case—Paul's thorn remained despite prayer (2 Corinthians 12:7–9). Yet these accounts reveal that trusting Jesus has power beyond what we often expect. Whether healed or sustained through suffering, the trusting believer never touches Christ in vain.

## Practical Application

### What Trusting Jesus Looks Like Today

1. **Morning surrender**: Begin each day consciously placing yourself in Christ's hands. "Lord, I trust You with this day. Live Your life through me."

2. **Claiming promises in temptation**: When temptation arises, claim the blood of Christ. "I overcome by the blood of the Lamb—this sin has no power over me because Jesus is stronger."

3. **Testimony**: Share what God has done for you. Your words of witness are weapons in the spiritual battle and encouragements to others.

4. **Holding nothing back**: Surrender your plans, possessions, relationships, and reputation to Christ. Trust that He knows better than you what is for your good.

5. **Peace in trials**: When difficulties come, consciously choose to trust Christ's goodness and sovereignty. He has overcome; His victory is yours.

6. **Bringing needs to Jesus**: Physical, emotional, financial—no burden is too small or too great. The woman touched merely His garment and was healed. Come boldly (Hebrews 4:16).

## Appeal

> _"Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit."_ (Jeremiah 17:7–8)

Friend, what burdens do you carry that you have not trusted to Jesus? What battles do you fight in your own strength? What fears grip your heart that faith has not yet conquered?

Christ stands today as the "Root of Jesse," the ensign lifted up for all nations. He invites you—not merely to believe _about_ Him but to _trust in_ Him. There is a profound difference. Many believe Jesus is the Savior; fewer actually trust their souls to His keeping.

Will you today renew your trust? Will you surrender your will, your failures, your future wholly to Him? The same gospel that saved the first apostles is still "the power of God unto salvation" for you. The same faith that healed the sick still overcomes the world today.

Look to Christ, rest in His finished work, depend on His present ministry, and trust His promised return. You will find, as countless believers before you, that "in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength" (Isaiah 30:15).

Trust Him. He has overcome the world—and in Him, so shall you.
