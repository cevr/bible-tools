## Slide 1 – Q1: Overcoming Evil

- **Question:** Does God want Christians to overcome evil in their lives?
- **Key Text:** Romans 12:21 – “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with
  good.”
- **Key Text:** Matthew 1:21 – “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt
  call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Victory & Sanctification)

- **Not Just Forgiveness:** God’s plan is not merely forgiveness of past sins,
  but complete victory over the power of sin in the present life.
- **The Gospel:** Jesus saves man _from_ his sins, not _in_ them.
- **Nature of Conflict:**
  - Evil is both an external force and an internal tendency.
  - To “overcome” means to subdue and prevail through the Holy Spirit.
- **Method of Victory:**
  - We do not drive out darkness with darkness, but with light.
  - Victory comes not by human willpower alone, but by filling the mind with
    Christ (Philippians 4:8 – “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true...
    think on these things.”).
- **Sanctification:** The progressive work of grace where the believer is
  renewed in God's image, resulting in obedience (1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For
  this is the will of God, even your sanctification...”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **Title:** The Empty Vessel
- **The Problem:** You cannot empty a glass of air by trying to scoop the air
  out with a spoon.
- **The Solution:** If you pour water into the glass, the air is displaced
  automatically.
- **Application:** We cannot overcome evil merely by trying hard not to sin. We
  must be filled with the “water of life”—the Spirit of Christ—and the evil is
  displaced by His good.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Overcoming the World

- **Question:** What only can overcome the world?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 5:4 – “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
  world...”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (The New Nature)

- **Source of Power:**
  - The natural heart is at enmity with God (Romans 8:7).
  - Victory requires the **New Birth** (John 3:3).
- **Defining "The World":** It refers to principles of selfishness, pride, and
  rebellion (1 John 2:16 – “For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh,
  and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is
  of the world.”).
- **Shared Victory:**
  - The new life received at rebirth is the life of Christ Himself.
  - Because Christ has overcome the world (John 16:33), those who possess His
    life share in His victory.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **Title:** The Submarine
- **The Image:** A submarine remains submerged in crushing ocean depths without
  collapsing because the pressure _inside_ is equal to or greater than the
  pressure _outside_.
- **Application:** A Christian lives in a crushing world of sin. We do not
  collapse under the pressure of the world only if the power of the Holy Spirit
  _inside_ us is greater than the pressure _outside_.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Quality Needed for Success

- **Question:** What special quality is needed in order to succeed in our
  efforts to overcome?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 5:4 – “...and this is the victory that overcometh the
  world, even our faith.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Instrument:** Faith is the connection to God's power.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We do not fight alone; we trust Christ’s victory.
  - **Justification:** Faith lays hold of Christ’s merits for the past (Romans
    3:24-26).
  - **Sanctification:** Faith lays hold of Christ’s power for the present (Jude
    24).
- **Transfer of Battle:**
  - Faith is not just mental assent; it is a transaction of surrender.
  - We hand the battle to the Lord: “The battle is not yours, but God's” (2
    Chronicles 20:15).
  - Success comes when we trust Christ to live in us (Galatians 2:20).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **Title:** The Drowning Man
- **The Image:** A drowning man cannot save himself by pulling on his own hair.
  He must stop struggling and trust the lifeguard to carry him.
- **Application:** In the battle against sin, “faith” is the act of reaching out
  and holding tight to the Savior, allowing His strength to pull us through the
  waves of temptation.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Promises to the Overcomer (Part 1)

- **Question:** What promises are made by Christ to the overcomer?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 2:7 – “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of
  the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.”
- **Key Text:** Revelation 2:11 – “He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
  second death.”
- **Points:**
  - **Restoration:** Adam lost the tree through disobedience; the overcomer
    regains it through faith.
  - **Immunity:** The "second death" is the final destruction of sin (Revelation
    20:14). The overcomer has no fear of this judgment.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Promises to the Overcomer (Part 2 - Sanctuary)

- **Key Text:** Revelation 2:17 – “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of
  the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone...”
- **Key Text:** Revelation 3:5 – “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed
  in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life...”
- **Sanctuary Connections:**
  - **Hidden Manna:** Refers to the ark in the Most Holy Place; Christ is our
    secret source of life.
  - **White Stone:** An ancient token of acquittal; we are declared "Not
    Guilty."
  - **Book of Life:** Points to the **Investigative Judgment**. Unrepentant
    names are blotted out, but the overcomer is confessed by Jesus before the
    Father.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Promises to the Overcomer (Part 3 - Exaltation)

- **Key Text:** Revelation 2:26 – “He that overcometh... to him will I give
  power over the nations...”
- **Key Text:** Revelation 3:12 – “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in
  the temple of My God...”
- **Key Text:** Revelation 3:21 – “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit
  with me in my throne...”
- **Points:**
  - **Permanence:** A "pillar" supports the structure and is fixed. We will "go
    no more out"—wandering is over.
  - **Exaltation:** The highest promise is fellowship; sitting _with_ Him on His
    throne.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **Title:** The Victor's Crown
- **The Image:** In ancient games, the winner received a fading wreath of
  leaves.
- **The Contrast:** Christ offers the "crown of life."
- **Application:** Unlike the athlete who wins by his own strength, the
  Christian wins by depending entirely on the Coach (Christ).

## Slide 14 – Q5: The Summary Promise

- **Question:** In what one promise are all of these promises to the overcomers
  summarized?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 21:7 – “He that overcometh shall inherit all things;
  and I will be his God, and he shall be My son.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Inheritance:** We become joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17).
  - **Relationship:** "I will be his God, and he shall be My son." This is the
    Covenant formula.
  - **Character:** Sonship implies possessing the family likeness—the character
    of God.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Jacob’s New Name

- **Question:** What new name was given to Jacob?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 32:28 – “And he said, Thy name shall be called no more
  Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and
  hast prevailed.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Jacob:** Meant "Supplanter" or "Deceiver."
  - **Israel:** Means "Prince with God" or "One who wrestles with God."
  - **Context:** The name change came after wrestling with the Angel (Christ).
    This typifies the "Time of Trouble" where God's people must struggle in
    prayer and prevail by faith.

## Slide 16 – Q7: The Children of Israel

- **Question:** What group of people later were called by that name?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 1:1-5 – “Now these are the names of the children of
  Israel, which came into Egypt: ...Reuben, Simeon, Levi... Joseph.”
- **Key Points:**
  - The literal descendants of Jacob—the twelve tribes.
  - Called to be a "kingdom of priests" (Exodus 19:6).
  - Chosen to preserve the knowledge of the true God.

## Slide 17 – Q8: Blessings of Israel

- **Question:** What special blessings were conferred upon the Israelites?
- **Key Text:** Romans 9:4, 5 – “Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the
  adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the
  service of God, and the promises; whose are the fathers, and of whom as
  concerning the flesh Christ came...”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Glory:** The Shekinah presence in the Sanctuary.
  - **Law:** The Ten Commandments.
  - **Service:** The Sanctuary service illustrating the plan of salvation.
  - **Lineage:** Their greatest honor was that the Messiah came through their
    line.

## Slide 18 – Q9: The True Israel

- **Question:** Who constitutes the true Israel of God, the seed of Abraham?
- **Key Text:** Romans 9:6-8 – “They are not all Israel, which are of Israel...
  That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children
  of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Not by Blood:** DNA does not make one a true Israelite in God's eyes.
  - **Children of Promise:** Just as Isaac (child of promise) was the heir
    rather than Ishmael (child of flesh), God’s people are those born of the
    Spirit.
  - **Definition:** A true Israelite is an overcomer—one with the spiritual
    experience of Jacob.

## Slide 19 – Q10: John the Baptist’s Warning

- **Question:** Speaking to the Pharisees and Sadducees, what did John the
  Baptist have to say about this?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 3:9 – “And think not to say within yourselves, We have
  Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to
  raise up children unto Abraham.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **False Security:** Religious leaders relied on genealogy for salvation.
  - **God's Sovereignty:** God can raise spiritual children from "stones"
    (stony-hearted Gentiles).
  - **Lesson:** Salvation is not based on heritage or church membership, but on
    a living connection with God.

## Slide 20 – Q11: The Deciding Factor

- **Question:** What is it that decides whether or not a person is a child of
  Abraham?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:7 – “Know ye therefore that they which are of faith
  the same are the children of Abraham.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Faith is Key:** Abraham "believed God, and it was accounted to him for
    righteousness" (Galatians 3:6).
  - **Spiritual DNA:** Those who trust God and are justified by faith are the
    true spiritual descendants.
  - This opens the door of "Israel" to every nation and people.

## Slide 21 – Q12: Belonging to the Seed

- **Question:** To whom must one belong in order to be Abraham's seed?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:29 – “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's
  seed, and heirs according to the promise.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **The One Seed:** Galatians 3:16 explains the promises were made to
    Abraham's "Seed" (singular)—which is **Christ**.
  - **Union with Christ:** We become heirs only by being _in Him_.
  - **Conclusion:** Christ defines true Israel. Believing Gentiles are grafted
    in; unbelieving Jews are cut off.

## Slide 22 – Q12: Illustration

- **Title:** The Passport (Bride of Christ)
- **The Analogy:** Imagine a country that grants citizenship only to the King's
  Son.
- **The Access:** Anyone who marries the Son automatically gains citizenship.
- **Application:** We are the "Bride of Christ." By our union with Him, we gain
  His passport to the heavenly Canaan.

## Slide 23 – Q13: The Church as Israel

- **Question:** In what passage of Scripture are the believers in Christ called
  "Israel"?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 6:16 – “And as many as walk according to this rule,
  peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.”
- **Key Points:**
  - Paul bestows the title "Israel of God" upon the church.
  - The "rule" is becoming a "new creature" in Christ (v. 15).
  - The church continues the spiritual heritage of ancient Israel.

## Slide 24 – Q14: The Power of the Gospel

- **Question:** To whom is the gospel the power of God unto salvation?
- **Key Text:** Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for
  it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew
  first, and also to the Greek.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Universal Scope:** For "everyone that believeth."
  - **Historical Order:** "To the Jew first" acknowledges their role as
    custodians of the law.
  - **Equality:** Both Jew and Greek are saved the exact same way: by faith in
    Jesus Christ.

## Slide 25 – Q15: The First Mission

- **Question:** To what group did Jesus first send the disciples?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 10:5, 6 – “Go not into the way of the Gentiles... but go
  rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Covenant Fulfillment:** God gave the Jewish nation every final opportunity
    to accept their King.
  - **Probation:** This aligns with the "70 weeks" of Daniel 9, confirming the
    covenant for one week (7 years) ending in A.D. 34.

## Slide 26 – Q16: Zacchaeus the Son of Abraham

- **Question:** While eating dinner with Zachaeus, what did Christ tell him?
- **Key Text:** Luke 19:9 – “This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch
  as he also is a son of Abraham.”
- **Key Points:**
  - Zacchaeus was a despised tax collector.
  - When he exercised faith and repentance, Jesus called him a "son of Abraham."
  - **Lesson:** Being a true son of Abraham is a matter of **character and
    faith**, not social standing.

## Slide 27 – Q17: Turning to the Gentiles

- **Question:** When the Jews rejected Paul's preaching of Christ, what did Paul
  and Barnabas reply?
- **Key Text:** Acts 13:46 – “...It was necessary that the word of God should
  first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge
  yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **The Tragedy:** Leaders judged themselves "unworthy" by rejecting the
    Source of life.
  - **The Pivot:** The Gospel focus shifted to the Gentiles.
  - **God's Plan:** God's "Israel" continued through the multi-ethnic body of
    believers who accepted the Messiah.

## Slide 28 – Q18: The Olive Tree

- **Question:** What illustration is given to describe the coming of the
  Gentiles (non-Jews) into the true Israel of God?
- **Key Text:** Romans 11:17, 18 – “And if some of the branches be broken off,
  and thou being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them
  partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the
  branches.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **The Root:** The covenant promises/Christ.
  - **Natural Branches:** The Jewish people (some broken off by unbelief).
  - **Wild Shoots:** The Gentiles.
  - **Grafting:** Gentiles are grafted _into_ the stock of Israel; they do not
    replace the tree but join it to drink from the same root.

## Slide 29 – Q18: Illustration

- **Title:** The Graft
- **The Process:** A gardener splices a wild branch into a cultivated stock.
- **The Result:** The branch drops its old nature and produces the fruit of the
  cultivated tree.
- **Application:** By faith, we drop our "wild" nature of sin and produce the
  "fruit of the Spirit" by drawing life from Christ, the Root.

## Slide 30 – Q19: Warning Against Pride

- **Question:** Lest the Gentile grafts should boast, saying that the Jews were
  broken off to let them come in, what warning is given to them?
- **Key Text:** Romans 11:20-21 – “Well; because of unbelief they were broken
  off, and thou standest by faith. Be not high minded but fear: for if God
  spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **No Superiority:** Gentiles are not superior to Jews.
  - **The Condition:** We stand only by "faith." If a Christian stops trusting
    and obeying, they can be broken off.
  - **Principle:** God has no favorites; He deals based on relationship to His
    Son.

## Slide 31 – Q20: Returning to the Vine

- **Question:** Is it possible for members of the Jewish race to return to the
  vine?
- **Key Text:** Romans 11:23 – “And they also, if they abide not still in
  unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Open Door:** Individual Jews can be saved if they turn from unbelief to
    the Messiah.
  - **God's Desire:** God longs for their salvation. Many will find their true
    Messiah and join the remnant church.

## Slide 32 – Q21: The Gentile Condition

- **Question:** Before the Gentiles became Israelites, what was their condition?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:11, 12 – “...at that time ye were without Christ,
  being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants
  of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Without Christ:** The ultimate loss.
  - **Aliens:** Foreigners with no rights in the Kingdom.
  - **No Hope:** No assurance of eternal life.
  - **Without God:** Spiritual orphans.
  - The gospel reverses this, making us "fellow citizens" (Ephesians 2:19).

## Slide 33 – Q22: The Last-Day Remnant

- **Question:** How are God's remnant, last-day people described?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are
  they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Commandments of God:** Sanctified obedience; the law written on the heart.
    They obey because they love the Lawgiver.
  - **Faith of Jesus:** Not just faith _in_ Jesus, but the _faith of_ Jesus.
    - Possessing His quality of trust and dependence on the Father.
    - This faith carries them through the final crisis.

## Slide 34 – Q23: Foundations of the City

- **Question:** Whose names are written in the foundations of the Holy City?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 21:14 – “And the wall of the city had twelve
  foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.”
- **Key Points:**
  - The New Jerusalem rests on the foundation of the New Testament gospel.
  - The church is built upon the "foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus
    Christ himself being the chief corner stone" (Ephesians 2:20).

## Slide 35 – Q24: Gates of the City

- **Question:** Whose names are written on the twelve gates of that city?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 21:12 – “And [the wall] had twelve gates... and names
  written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
  Israel.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Unity:** The city unites the Old (Tribes) and New (Apostles)
    Dispensations.
  - **Spiritual Entry:** To enter, one passes through a gate named after a
    tribe.
  - **Conclusion:** All the saved are reckoned as part of the "Israel of God."
    Whether Jew or Gentile by birth, we enter as spiritual Israel.

## Slide 36 – Q25: Walking in the Light

- **Question:** Who will walk in the light of the city?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 21:24 – “And the nations of them which are saved
  shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory
  and honour into it.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Fulfillment:** The promise that Abraham would be the father of many
    nations is realized.
  - **One Fold:** Earthly distinctions are gone.
  - **The Citizens:** Those who have washed their robes and made them white in
    the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 7:14).

## Slide 37 – Q25: Illustration

- **Title:** The Prism
- **The Image:** A prism takes white light and breaks it into many colors.
- **The Application:** Humanity is broken into many races and nations
  ("colors"). But in the New Jerusalem, all these distinct people are gathered
  back into the pure white light of God's presence, united in Christ.
