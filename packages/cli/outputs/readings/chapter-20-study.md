# Bible Study: Baptism — Buried with Christ, Raised to Newness of Life

## Introduction

Baptism stands as one of the most profound and beautiful ordinances given to the
Christian church. Far more than an outward ceremony or religious formality, it
represents the believer's union with Christ in His death, burial, and
resurrection. Through this sacred act, the repentant sinner publicly declares
that the old life of sin has been crucified with Christ and that, through faith
in God's mighty power, a new life has begun—a life hidden in Christ and destined
for glory.

## Core Truths

### Christ's Commission

The ordinance of baptism rests upon divine authority. Just before His ascension,
Jesus gave this charge to His disciples:

> _"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
> Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all
> things whatsoever I have commanded you."_ (Matthew 28:19–20)

Notice the order Christ established: **teach first, baptize second**. The
candidate must understand and receive the gospel before entering the baptismal
waters. This commission remains binding upon the church until the end of time.

### The Prerequisites: Repentance and Faith

Scripture is clear that baptism is not for everyone indiscriminately. Two things
must precede it:

**1. Repentance toward God**

> _"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the
> name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins."_ (Acts 2:38)

> _"Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God,
> and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (Acts 20:21)

**Repentance**: A genuine sorrow for sin that leads to turning away from it
(2 Corinthians 7:10). This repentance is "toward God" because sin is ultimately
an offense against Him and His holy law.

Why must we repent toward God? _"For all have sinned, and come short of the
glory of God"_ (Romans 3:23). Every soul stands guilty before the divine
tribunal. The law of God reveals our condition:

> _"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin
> revived, and I died."_ (Romans 7:9)

The commandment acts as a mirror (James 1:23–25), showing us our true state. We
thought ourselves alive spiritually until God's standard exposed our sinfulness.
This conviction leads the honest heart to cry out for mercy.

**2. Faith toward Christ**

> _"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not
> shall be damned."_ (Mark 16:16)

Faith must accompany repentance. When Philip preached Jesus to the Ethiopian
eunuch, the man asked, _"See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be
baptized?"_ Philip replied, _"If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
mayest"_ (Acts 8:36–37).

[DYK🔎] The requirement of belief before baptism is why the early church
practiced only adult (or "believer's") baptism. The practice of infant baptism
developed centuries later and finds no support in Scripture, since infants
cannot repent, believe, or be taught the gospel.

## Deeper Truths

### The Meaning of Baptism: Death, Burial, and Resurrection

Baptism is far more than a washing or a symbolic cleansing. Paul unfolds its
profound significance in Romans 6:

> _"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin
> might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."_ (Romans 6:6)

> _"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with
> Him."_ (Romans 6:8)

> _"Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ
> was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should
> walk in newness of life."_ (Romans 6:4)

Baptism represents three great realities:

| **Symbol**            | **Spiritual Reality**                   | **Scripture**   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Going down into water | Death to the old life of sin            | Romans 6:6      |
| Being submerged       | Burial of the old man with Christ       | Romans 6:4      |
| Rising from water     | Resurrection to walk in newness of life | Colossians 2:12 |

The candidate identifies with Christ's literal death, burial, and resurrection.
As Christ died for sin, we die to sin. As He was buried, we bury the old life.
As He rose triumphant, we rise to serve Him in the power of an endless life.

[ILL] Consider a man who has been condemned to death for his crimes. The
sentence is executed; he dies and is buried. That man no longer owes anything to
the law—death has paid his debt in full. So it is with the one who is baptized
into Christ. The old man of sin is reckoned dead. The law's condemnation against
him is satisfied. He rises from that watery grave a new creature, no longer
under the dominion of sin, but alive unto God (Romans 6:10–11).

### One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism

> _"One Lord, one faith, one baptism."_ (Ephesians 4:5)

The Bible recognizes only **one mode of baptism**—immersion. The very meaning of
the Greek word _baptizo_ is "to dip, plunge, or immerse." Sprinkling or pouring
cannot fulfill the symbolism of burial and resurrection.

[DYK🔎] Even scholars from churches that practice sprinkling acknowledge this
truth. Conybeare and Howson, eminent Church of England clergymen, wrote: "It
must be a subject of regret that the general discontinuance of this original
form of baptism... has rendered obscure to popular apprehension some very
important passages of Scripture."

The baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch illustrates the biblical practice:

> _"And they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he
> baptized him. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
> Lord caught away Philip."_ (Acts 8:38–39)

Both Philip and the eunuch went _down into_ the water and came _up out of_ the
water. This is immersion, nothing else.

[Q] **"But how could 3,000 people be baptized on the day of Pentecost? Wouldn't
that take too long?"**

Consider that about 120 disciples were present (Acts 1:15). If only half of them
(60) engaged in baptizing, each would need to immerse only 50 persons—a task
requiring perhaps an hour. Jerusalem also had numerous pools and water sources,
including the Pool of Siloam and Bethesda, making multiple simultaneous
baptisms practical.

### Why Not Delay?

Ananias urged the converted Saul:

> _"And now why tarriest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins,
> calling on the name of the Lord."_ (Acts 22:16)

The Philippian jailer was baptized "the same hour of the night" following his
conversion (Acts 16:33). When the heart is convicted and faith has been
exercised, delay is unnecessary and even dangerous. Satan works to cool
convictions and raise obstacles. Obedience should follow conviction promptly.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Baptism and the Law of God

The reading includes an important digression on the law, and rightly so. Baptism
presupposes sin, and sin presupposes law:

> _"I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the
> law had said, Thou shalt not covet."_ (Romans 7:7)

> _"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
> so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."_ (Romans 5:12)

Some argue that God's law did not exist before Sinai. But Paul declares, _"Death
reigned from Adam to Moses"_ (Romans 5:14), and death is the penalty for sin.
Where there is penalty, there must be law: _"Sin is not imputed when there is no
law"_ (Romans 5:13). The existence of death from Adam onward proves the law
existed and was transgressed.

This matters for baptism because we are baptized in response to **conviction of
sin by the law** and **faith in Christ who kept the law perfectly and died for
our transgression of it**.

### The Sanctuary Connection

Baptism connects beautifully with the sanctuary message:

- **The laver** stood between the altar of sacrifice and the holy place. The
  priests washed there before ministering (Exodus 30:17–21). So the believer,
  having accepted Christ's sacrifice (the altar), is washed in baptism before
  entering the daily walk of sanctification (the holy place ministry).

- Baptism represents our entrance into Christ's death and resurrection. Christ's
  sacrifice (outer court) provides the foundation. His resurrection opens the
  way for His heavenly ministry on our behalf (holy place and most holy place).

- As baptism symbolizes death to sin and resurrection to righteousness, it
  points forward to the final work of the sanctuary: the complete blotting out
  of sin and the preparation of a people who reflect Christ's character fully.

### Righteousness by Faith

Baptism is not a work by which we earn salvation. It is a public confession of
faith in Christ's finished work _and_ His ongoing work in us:

> _"Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the
> faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead."_
> (Colossians 2:12)

Notice: we are raised **"through the faith of the operation of God."** It is
God's power—not ours—that raises us to newness of life. Baptism declares our
faith that the same power which raised Christ from the dead is able to raise us
from spiritual death and keep us walking in righteousness.

> _"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."_
> (Galatians 3:27)

To "put on Christ" is to be clothed with His righteousness—both imputed
(justification) and imparted (sanctification). Baptism marks the beginning of a
life lived not in self-effort, but in constant dependence upon Christ's power.

## Practical Application

### Before Baptism

1. **Hear and understand the gospel** (Matthew 28:19–20; Acts 8:35)
2. **Repent of all known sin** (Acts 2:38)
3. **Believe with all your heart** (Acts 8:37; Mark 16:16)
4. **Do not delay** once conviction has come (Acts 22:16)

### At Baptism

1. **Understand what you are doing**: publicly declaring death to the old life
   and resurrection to newness of life in Christ
2. **Enter the water in faith**, trusting not in the ceremony but in the God who
   raises the dead
3. **Receive it as a covenant sign** of your union with Christ and membership in
   His body, the church

### After Baptism

> _"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where
> Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."_ (Colossians 3:1)

1. **Set your affections on heavenly things** (Colossians 3:2)
2. **Walk in newness of life**—let the old sins remain buried (Romans 6:4)
3. **Daily claim Christ's power** for victory over temptation
4. **Fellowship with believers** in the church to which you have been added
   (Acts 2:41, 47)

[Q] **"What if I fall into sin after baptism? Does that mean my baptism was
invalid?"**

Baptism is not a guarantee of sinless perfection, but a commitment to walk with
Christ and a declaration of faith in His power to save. If you stumble, you have
an Advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1). Confess, repent, and continue in
faith. The goal is growth—to be progressively conformed to Christ's image
(2 Corinthians 3:18). God's grace is sufficient, and His power is available to
overcome every besetting sin (Hebrews 4:16; Jude 24).

## Appeal

> _"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were
> baptized into His death? Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into
> death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
> Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."_ (Romans 6:3–4)

Dear friend, have you responded to the Savior's call? Has the law of God
convicted you of sin? Has the Spirit drawn your heart to Christ? Have you
believed in Him who died and rose again for you?

If so, what hinders you from being baptized?

The same power that rolled away the stone from Christ's tomb, the same power
that called forth Lazarus from the grave, is offered to you. God will bury your
old life of sin and raise you to walk in newness of life—a life of victory, a
life of peace, a life hidden with Christ in God.

Arise, and be baptized, calling on the name of the Lord.
