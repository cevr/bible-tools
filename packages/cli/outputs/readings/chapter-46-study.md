# Reading 46: A Great Prophetic Period

## Introduction

The 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14 stands as one of the most significant time prophecies in all of Scripture. This remarkable prophecy stretches from the days of the Persian Empire to the very threshold of Christ's return, revealing God's precise timetable for the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary and the final work of atonement. Understanding this prophecy unlocks the meaning of Christ's present ministry for His people and reveals where we stand in the stream of time.

## Core Truths

### The Vision and Its Setting

Daniel received this vision while in Shushan (Susa), the capital of the Persian province of Elam, by the river Ulai (Daniel 8:2). This geographic detail is not merely incidental—Daniel was positioned in the very seat of the empire that would soon overthrow Babylon, the first power represented in his earlier visions.

> "And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." (Daniel 8:14)

The vision presented symbolic beasts representing successive world powers:

- **The Ram with Two Horns**: Media and Persia (Daniel 8:3, 20)
- **The He-Goat**: Greece (Daniel 8:5-7, 21)

[DYK🔎] The ram was the national symbol of Persia, and Persian kings wore ram's head crowns when leading their armies. The goat was similarly associated with Macedonia—ancient coins depict a goat as the symbol of the Macedonian kingdom.

### Daniel's Perplexity and the Incomplete Explanation

The angel Gabriel was commissioned to explain the vision: _"Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision"_ (Daniel 8:16). Gabriel explained the symbols of the ram and goat, but when he came to the time element—the 2300 days—something unexpected occurred.

> "And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it." (Daniel 8:27)

Daniel was overwhelmed. The Hebrew word translated "understood" (בִּין, _bin_) indicates that the vision remained unexplained—specifically, the portion concerning the 2300 days and the cleansing of the sanctuary.

[Q] **"Why would Daniel faint at a vision about the sanctuary?"**

Daniel understood the sanctuary's significance. He had witnessed its destruction by Babylon and knew Jeremiah's prophecy that Jerusalem would lie desolate for seventy years (Jeremiah 25:11-12). To hear of 2300 days (prophetic years) before the sanctuary would be cleansed must have seemed an unbearable extension of his people's suffering. The vision of "the evening and the morning" (the 2300 days) was specifically noted as requiring sealing "for it shall be for many days" (Daniel 8:26)—it pointed to events far in the future.

### Gabriel Returns to Complete His Mission

Years passed. Daniel studied Jeremiah's prophecy concerning the seventy years of captivity and realized that time was nearly fulfilled (Daniel 9:1-2). Burdened for his people and the desolate sanctuary, he poured out his heart in prayer:

> "Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake." (Daniel 9:17)

While Daniel was still praying, Gabriel returned—the same angel who had been commanded to make Daniel understand the vision:

> "At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision." (Daniel 9:23)

[DYK🔎] Gabriel's instruction to "consider the vision" (מַרְאֶה, _mar'eh_) uses the same Hebrew word for "vision" found in Daniel 8:26-27, directly linking chapters 8 and 9. Gabriel was returning to complete his unfinished explanation.

## Deeper Truths

### The Seventy Weeks "Cut Off"

Gabriel now provided the key to unlock the 2300-day prophecy:

> "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city." (Daniel 9:24)

The Hebrew word translated "determined" (חָתַךְ, _chathak_) literally means "to cut off" or "to decree." Seventy weeks were to be "cut off" for Daniel's people. But cut off from what? The only time period under discussion was the 2300 days. Thus, the 70 weeks (490 prophetic days/years) were a portion carved out from the larger 2300-year period.

**The significance of seventy weeks (490 years):**

1. To finish the transgression
2. To make an end of sins
3. To make reconciliation for iniquity
4. To bring in everlasting righteousness
5. To seal up vision and prophecy
6. To anoint the Most Holy (Daniel 9:24)

These purposes were to be accomplished through the Messiah's work—His life, death, resurrection, and the establishment of the new covenant.

### The Starting Point: 457 B.C.

> "Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks." (Daniel 9:25)

The prophecy begins with "the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem." Three decrees concerning Jerusalem were issued by Persian kings:

1. **Cyrus (536 B.C.)**: Authorized rebuilding the temple (Ezra 1:1-4)
2. **Darius (519 B.C.)**: Confirmed Cyrus's decree (Ezra 6:1-12)
3. **Artaxerxes (457 B.C.)**: Authorized full restoration including civil government (Ezra 7:11-26)

Only Artaxerxes' decree in the seventh year of his reign (457 B.C.) provided for the complete restoration of Jerusalem—rebuilding, self-governance, and judicial authority. This is the "commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem."

[ILL] Consider a man who receives permission to rebuild a house but is given no authority to live in it, manage it, or make it his own. The house may stand, but it is not truly restored. So it was with Cyrus's and Darius's decrees—they authorized the temple but not the full restoration of Jerusalem as a living city with its own government. Artaxerxes' decree completed what the earlier ones began.

### Testing the Prophecy: 69 Weeks to Messiah

Sixty-nine weeks (7 + 62 = 69 weeks = 483 prophetic days/years) were to reach "unto the Messiah the Prince" (Daniel 9:25).

**The calculation:**

- Starting point: 457 B.C.
- Add 483 years
- Result: A.D. 27 (accounting for no year zero)

**What happened in A.D. 27?**

> "Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him." (Luke 3:21-22)

"Messiah" (Hebrew) and "Christ" (Greek) both mean "the Anointed One." Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit at His baptism. Following this, He declared: _"The time is fulfilled"_ (Mark 1:15)—acknowledging that the prophetic timetable had reached its appointed moment.

> "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power." (Acts 10:38)

[DYK🔎] Luke 3:1 dates John the Baptist's ministry to "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar." Tiberius became co-regent with Augustus in A.D. 12, making his fifteenth year A.D. 27—precisely when Jesus was baptized and anointed, exactly 483 years from 457 B.C.

### The Seventieth Week and the Cross

One week (7 years) remained of the 490 years allotted to the Jewish nation.

> "And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease." (Daniel 9:27)

**The timeline:**

- A.D. 27: Christ's baptism (beginning of 70th week)
- A.D. 31: Christ's crucifixion (midst of the week—3½ years later)
- A.D. 34: End of 70 weeks (3½ years after the cross)

"In the midst of the week"—after 3½ years of ministry—Christ "caused the sacrifice and the oblation to cease." Not by decree, but by fulfillment. When Jesus cried, "It is finished" (John 19:30), the temple veil was torn from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51). The earthly sacrificial system met its Antitype. Every lamb had pointed to this moment.

[Q] **"What happened in A.D. 34 to mark the end of the 490 years?"**

In A.D. 34, the stoning of Stephen marked Israel's final national rejection of the gospel. Shortly after, the disciples were "scattered abroad" and began preaching to the Gentiles (Acts 8:1-4). Paul, converted on the Damascus road, became the apostle to the Gentiles (Acts 9). The gospel commission expanded: "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you... lo, we turn to the Gentiles" (Acts 13:46).

### The 2300 Years and 1844

With the 70 weeks (490 years) established, we can now complete the calculation:

**The calculation:**

- Total prophecy: 2300 years
- Subtract the 490 years cut off for Israel: 1810 years remain
- Beginning point: 457 B.C.
- Add 2300 years: A.D. 1844

> "And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." (Daniel 8:14)

What happened in 1844? The earthly sanctuary had long been destroyed. The prophecy must therefore point to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ ministers as our High Priest (Hebrews 8:1-2; 9:11-12).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Key

The earthly sanctuary service included a daily ministry and a yearly ministry. Throughout the year, sins were confessed over sacrificial victims and symbolically transferred to the sanctuary. Once each year, on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), the high priest entered the Most Holy Place to cleanse the sanctuary of these accumulated sins (Leviticus 16).

**The antitype in heaven:**

- **Daily ministry** (Holy Place): Christ's continual intercession for repentant sinners—forgiveness, justification, daily sanctification
- **Yearly ministry** (Most Holy Place): The final cleansing—the investigative judgment, the blotting out of sins, the vindication of God's character

In 1844, Christ entered the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary to begin the final phase of His atoning work—the investigative judgment that precedes His return.

[ILL] When a court case is decided, the verdict must be rendered before the sentence is executed. So it is with God's judgment. Before Christ returns to reward every person "according as his work shall be" (Revelation 22:12), there must be an examination of the records—not for God's benefit, who knows all things, but for the vindication of His justice before the universe.

### The Investigative Judgment

Daniel 7 presents this same heavenly scene:

> "I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit... the judgment was set, and the books were opened." (Daniel 7:9-10)

This judgment scene occurs _before_ Christ's return, while the little horn power is still active (Daniel 7:21-22). It is not the executive judgment at the second coming but an investigative work that determines who among the professed followers of God will be granted eternal life.

**The records examined:**

- The book of life (Philippians 4:3; Revelation 3:5)
- The book of remembrance (Malachi 3:16)
- The books containing the deeds of all (Revelation 20:12)

Every case is examined. Those who have genuinely repented and placed their faith in Christ have their sins blotted out—removed forever. Those who have professed faith but clung to known sins have their names blotted from the book of life.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Final Generation

The cleansing of the sanctuary is not merely a heavenly procedure—it corresponds to a work in the lives of God's people. As Christ removes the record of sin from the heavenly books, His people on earth must experience the removal of sin from their characters.

> "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." (2 Corinthians 7:1)

This is not legalism but the highest expression of righteousness by faith. As the judgment proceeds, God is preparing a people who reflect Christ's character fully—not by their own strength, but by His indwelling power.

**The twofold work:**

- **In heaven**: Christ blots out the sins of His people from the sanctuary records
- **On earth**: Christ blots out sin from the characters of His people

[Q] **"Isn't this teaching about sinless perfection before Christ returns?"**

It is not teaching human perfectionism or sinlessness by effort. It is teaching that Christ, who has all power, will finish in His people what He began. "He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ" (Philippians 1:6). The final generation will not have more human ability than previous generations—but they will have _more complete surrender_ and _more perfect trust_ in Christ's power to keep them from falling (Jude 24).

## Practical Application

### Where We Stand in Prophecy

We are living in the time of the investigative judgment—the antitypical Day of Atonement. This is the most solemn period in earth's history.

**Practical implications:**

1. **Self-examination**: "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith" (2 Corinthians 13:5). Is our confession of Christ genuine? Are we clinging to any known sin?

2. **Confession and forsaking**: "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy" (Proverbs 28:13). Now is the time for thorough heart-work.

3. **Abiding in Christ**: "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me" (John 15:4). Our only safety is continual dependence on Christ.

4. **Watching and waiting**: "Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man" (Luke 21:36).

### The Certainty of Prophetic Fulfillment

The precision of this prophecy—spanning 2300 years and pinpointing Christ's baptism, crucifixion, and the end of Israel's special status—demonstrates God's absolute foreknowledge and control of history. If the first 1843 years were fulfilled with such exactness, we may have complete confidence that the final events will also unfold precisely as God has revealed.

[DYK🔎] This is the longest time prophecy in Scripture. Its fulfillment can be verified by secular history—the decree of Artaxerxes, the ministry of Christ, the persecution of early Christians. We are not asked to believe blindly; we are given evidence sufficient to establish faith.

## Appeal

> "Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation." (2 Corinthians 6:2)

The judgment is in session. The books are open. Your name, my name—each will be examined. But we need not fear if we are hidden in Christ.

The same Jesus who offered Himself on Calvary now stands as our Advocate before the Father. "If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John 2:1). He will not fail any soul who has truly trusted Him.

**Three questions for your heart:**

1. Have you confessed every known sin and forsaken it?
2. Are you daily surrendered to Christ, depending on His power rather than your own?
3. Are you allowing Him to cleanse not only the record of sin but sin itself from your life?

The typical Day of Atonement lasted but one day. The antitypical day of judgment has already been in session for many years. We know not how soon our names may come up in review—or how soon the judgment will close and Christ will declare, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still" (Revelation 22:11).

But there is hope—blessed, certain hope. For "the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin" (1 John 1:7). Christ is both our Judge and our Advocate. If we surrender fully to Him today, we have nothing to fear from the judgment, for "there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Romans 8:1).

Will you, today, yield your whole heart to Christ—trusting not in your own righteousness but in His alone? Will you invite Him to complete His cleansing work in you, that when your name is called in heaven's tribunal, He may stand as your living, present Savior?

_"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."_ (Hebrews 7:25)
