### Chapter 46: A Great Prophetic Period

This study explores the longest time prophecy in the Bible, linking the ancient
history of Israel with the final ministry of Jesus Christ in heaven. It reveals
the "mathematics of the gospel," showing that God has a set time for the final
eradication of sin and the vindication of His people through the judgment.

### Q1. At what time according to the prophecy of Daniel, was the sanctuary to be cleansed?

**“And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed." Dan. 8:14.**

**Answer:**

This verse contains the central pillar of the prophetic message for the last
days. To understand it, we must define two key terms:

1.  **The Days:** In symbolic Bible prophecy, a "day" represents a literal year
    (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). Therefore, this period covers 2,300 literal
    years of history.
2.  **The Sanctuary:** In the Old Testament, God dwelt among His people in an
    earthly tent (and later a temple). This was a "type" or model of the **true
    Sanctuary in heaven**, where Christ now ministers (Hebrews 8:1–2).
3.  **The Cleansing:** In the earthly service, sins were symbolically
    transferred to the sanctuary all year long via the blood of sacrifices. Once
    a year, on the **Day of Atonement** (Yom Kippur), the High Priest entered
    the Most Holy Place to "cleanse" the sanctuary, symbolically removing the
    record of sin (Leviticus 16).

Daniel 8:14 predicts a time when Christ, our High Priest, would begin the final
work of cleansing the heavenly sanctuary—removing the record of confessed sins
and preparing a people for His return. This is often called the **Investigative
Judgment**.

- **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry where He reviews
  the lives of professed believers to distinguish true faith from false
  profession, blotting out the sins of those who are covered by His blood
  (Daniel 7:9–10; Acts 3:19).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a dusty ledger book where debts are recorded
daily. For a long time, the debts accumulate. Finally, the auditor comes not to
condemn the debtor who has a wealthy sponsor, but to officially "blot out" the
debt pages with red ink, verifying they are paid in full and the account is
closed forever. The "cleansing of the sanctuary" is the opening of heaven’s
books to permanently erase the record of sin for God’s friends.

### Q2. Where was Daniel when the vision of this chapter was given?

**“And I saw the vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan
in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I
was by the river Ulai." Dan 8:2.**

**Answer:**

Daniel was in Elam, a province of Babylon (later becoming a capital of Persia).
Even though God’s people were in exile, far from Jerusalem, the Spirit of
Prophecy could still reach them.

- **God’s Presence in Exile:** God is not limited to holy ground or church
  buildings. He reveals His deep truths to His servants wherever they are
  faithful—even in the center of a pagan empire.
- **The River:** Many of Daniel’s visions occurred by rivers (like Ezekiel by
  the Chebar). Nature often serves as a backdrop for God’s revelation, reminding
  us that the Creator of the world is also the Controller of history.

---

### Q3. What first appeared to the prophet?

**“Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the
river a ram which had two horns." Dan. 8:3.**

**Answer:**

Daniel sees a ram with two horns, one higher than the other. As we will see
later in the chapter, the Bible interprets its own symbols. This beast
represents a mighty political power that would arise on the world stage.

---

### Q4. What next appeared upon the scene?

**“And as I was considering, behold a he goat came from the west... And he came
to the ram that had two horns,... and smote the ram, and brake his two horns."
Dan. 8:5-7.**

**Answer:**

A rough male goat attacks the ram with incredible speed ("touched not the
ground," verse 5). This symbolizes the clash of nations.

- **The Conflict of Nations:** History is not merely a sequence of random wars.
  God foresaw the rise and fall of empires centuries in advance.
- **The Great Controversy:** Behind the movements of armies is the spiritual
  conflict between truth and error. While nations fight for earthly dominion,
  God is orchestrating history to preserve a remnant and bring about the
  Messiah.

---

### Q5. What happened after the prophet heard the time announced for the cleansing of the sanctuary?

**“And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought
for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a
man." Dan. 8:15.**

**Answer:**

Daniel did not merely watch the vision as entertainment; he "sought for the
meaning."

- **The Duty to Study:** Prophecy is not given to satisfy curiosity but to be
  understood. Jesus later commanded us to read Daniel and "understand" (Matthew
  24:15).
- **Spiritual Hunger:** God delights to answer the questions of those who hunger
  and thirst for righteousness and truth (Matthew 5:6). When we seek the meaning
  of Scripture with an honest heart, Heaven draws near.

---

### Q6. What command did Daniel hear given to this angel?

**” And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said,
Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision." Dan. 8:16.**

**Answer:**

The command comes from a Being superior even to the angel Gabriel—likely the
pre-incarnate Christ (Michael).

- **Gabriel's Role:** Gabriel is a high-ranking angel, one who stands in the
  presence of God (Luke 1:19). He is the special messenger of prophecy regarding
  the Messiah.
- **Divine Intent:** It is the will of God that His people understand the events
  of the "time of the end." If the vision was meant to remain a mystery forever,
  this command would not have been given.

---

### Q7. What were the first words that the angel then uttered before the prophet?

**” I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto, me, Understand, a son
of man; for at the time of the end shall be the vision." Dan, 8:17.**

**Answer:**

The vision of the 2300 days extends to "the time of the end." This clearly
indicates that the prophecy would not be fulfilled in Daniel's day, nor in the
immediate future of the Old Testament Jews. It stretches far down the stream of
time to the final era of human history.

---

### Q8. How did the angel then proceed to fulfill his mission to Daniel?

**“The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia." Dan.8:20, 21.**

**Answer:**

Here the Bible provides its own dictionary. We do not need to guess the symbols:

- **The Ram:** Medo-Persia (which conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.). The two horns
  represent the dual nature of the empire (Medes and Persians), with the
  Persians eventually becoming dominant (the higher horn).
- **The Goat:** Greece (led by Alexander the Great).

This confirms the **Historicist** method of prophecy—that these visions outline
a continuous timeline of history from Daniel’s day until the end of the world.

---

### Q9. What part of the vision did the angel say was to be shut up, and why?

**“And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true:
wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days." Dan. 8:26.**

**Answer:**

The "vision of the evening and the morning" refers back to the 2300 days (Dan
8:14). This specific part—the _time_ element—was "shut up" or sealed because it
concerned a distant future ("many days").

- **Sealed until the End:** This suggests that the full understanding of the
  2300-day prophecy would not be available until the "time of the end" arrived
  (Daniel 12:4).
- **Many Days:** The phrase implies a very long period, supporting the
  day-for-a-year principle. A literal 2300 days (approx. 6.5 years) would not be
  considered "many days" in the grand scope of national history, but 2300
  _years_ fits the description perfectly.

---

### Q10. What did Daniel say about the vision?

**“And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did
the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood
it." Dan. 8:27.**

**Answer:**

Daniel understood the symbols of the Ram and Goat (because Gabriel explained
them in verses 20-21), but he did _not_ understand the time period of 2300 days.
The thought of the sanctuary being desolate for such a vast time caused him
physical illness.

- **Pastoral Concern:** Daniel loved God’s house. The idea of prolonged
  desolation broke his heart.
- **Faithfulness in Duty:** Note that despite his anxiety and illness, he "rose
  up, and did the king's business." A true believer does not use prophecy as an
  excuse to be lazy or neglect practical duties. We wait for the Lord while
  working diligently.

---

### Q11. Although Daniel said nothing of his astonishment at what he had seen, so that the king's courtiers did not perceive it, what did he do?

**“In the first year of Darius,... I Daniel understood by books the number of
the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he
would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem." Dan. 9:1, 2.**

**Answer:**

Daniel turned to Scripture. He studied the prophecies of Jeremiah (Jeremiah
25:11–12; 29:10), which predicted a 70-year captivity for the Jews.

- **Problem:** The 70 years were nearly over, but in Daniel 8, Gabriel had
  mentioned 2300 days. Daniel was confused—was God extending the 70 years to
  2300 years because of Israel's sins?
- **Method:** He compared Scripture with Scripture. This is the safest way to
  understand truth.

---

### Q12. In view of this, what did the prophet do?

**” And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications,
with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes." Dan. 9:3.**

**Answer:**

Daniel responded with intense intercessory prayer. He did not demand an answer;
he humbled himself.

- **Fasting and Sackcloth:** Symbols of deep mourning and earnestness.
- **The Conditions of Enlightenment:** God reveals His secrets to those who
  humble themselves. "The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him" (Psalm
  25:14).

---

### Q13. What, in Daniel's prayer, showed that he was still anxious about the sanctuary question?

**“Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his
supplications, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary that is desolate,
for the Lord's sake." Dan. 9:17.**

**Answer:**

This verse reveals the link between Daniel 8 and Daniel 9. Daniel is praying
about the "desolate sanctuary"—the very subject of the 2300-day vision.

- **For the Lord's Sake:** This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**.
  Daniel does not ask for restoration because the people are good, but for God’s
  own name and character. He relies entirely on God’s mercy, not human merit.
- **Identification with Sinners:** In this prayer, Daniel, though a righteous
  man, says "We have sinned" (Dan 9:5). He counts himself among the needy
  sinners. This is the attitude of the true saint in the judgment—relying wholly
  on the righteousness of Christ.

---

### Q14. How did the Lord regard his petition?

**"Yea, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in
the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the
time of the evening oblation." Dan. 9:21.**

**Answer:**

Heaven is responsive to the prayer of faith. Gabriel returns "swiftly."

- **The Evening Oblation:** This was the time of the evening sacrifice in the
  earthly sanctuary. Even though the temple was destroyed, Daniel still observed
  the time of the sacrifice in his heart.
- **The Lamb of God:** The sacrifice pointed to Christ. Prophetic understanding
  is given in the context of the Atonement. We can only understand prophecy
  correctly when we view it through the lens of the Cross.

---

### Q15. What did Gabriel tell Daniel?

**“At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am
come to show thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the
matter, and consider the vision." Dan. 9:23.**

**Answer:**

Gabriel commands Daniel to "consider the vision." Which vision? The vision of
Daniel 8—specifically the 2300 days, which was the only part left unexplained
("none understood it," Dan 8:27).

- **Greatly Beloved:** What a beautiful assurance! God does not reveal the
  future to frighten us, but because He loves us.
- **Connection:** Daniel 9 is the key that unlocks Daniel 8.

---

### Q16. What application did Gabriel proceed to make of the vision?

**“Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to
finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation
for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the
vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy." Dan. 9:24.**

**Answer:**

Gabriel introduces a shorter time period: 70 weeks (490 days, representing 490
years). The word "determined" literally means "cut off."

- **Cut Off From What?** From the longer 2300-day prophecy. The 490 years are
  the first segment of the 2300 years, allotted specifically to the Jewish
  nation ("thy people").
- **The Purpose:** To bring in "everlasting righteousness." This points to the
  work of the Messiah.
  - **Reconciliation:** The word used here is related to _Kippur_ (atonement).
  - **Everlasting Righteousness:** Humans have only "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6).
    Jesus came to weave a robe of perfect righteousness that He imputes
    (credits) to us for justification and imparts to us for sanctification.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a long measuring tape of 2300 inches. You take a
pair of scissors and "cut off" the first 490 inches. The 490 inches and the full
tape must start at the exact same point. If we find the starting point of the 70
weeks, we have found the starting point of the 2300 days.

---

### Q17. When did the angel say that the seventy weeks (490 years) were to commence?

**“Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment
to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven
weeks, and three- score and two weeks; the street shall be built again, and the
wall, even in troublous times." Dan. 9:25.**

**Answer:**

The starting gun for the prophecy is the "commandment to restore and to build
Jerusalem."

- **The Calculation:** The angel divides the 70 weeks into segments:
  - 7 weeks (49 years) for rebuilding the city.
  - 62 weeks (434 years) reaching "unto the Messiah."
  - Total: 69 weeks (483 years) until the Messiah appears.

- **Messiah the Prince:** "Messiah" (Hebrew) and "Christ" (Greek) both mean "The
  Anointed One."

---

### Q18. How was Jesus anointed?

**“God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power." Acts
10:38.**

**Answer:**

Jesus was not anointed with oil like Aaron or David, but with the Holy Spirit.
This anointing empowered His earthly ministry.

---

### Q19. At what time did Jesus receive the special anointing of the Holy Spirit?

**“Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy
Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from
heaven, which said, Thou art My beloved Son." Luke 3:21, 22.**

**Answer:**

The anointing took place at His baptism in the Jordan River. This marks the
exact historical fulfillment of the prophecy.

- **Dates:** The baptism occurred in the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar (Luke
  3:1), which history places in the autumn of **27 A.D.**

---

### Q20. What did Jesus say shortly after this?

**“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the
gospel to the poor." Luke 4:18 (Mark 1:15).**

**Answer:**

Jesus announced, "The time is fulfilled" (Mark 1:15). Which time? The 69 weeks
of Daniel 9! The Messiah appeared exactly on schedule.

- **Practical Note:** If God was punctual regarding the First Advent, He will be
  punctual regarding the judgment and the Second Advent.

---

### Q21. When was a decree made to restore and build Jerusalem?

**“This Ezra went up from Babylon... And there went up some of the children of
Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters,
and the Nethinim, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.
And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of
the king." Ezra 7:6-8.**

**Answer:**

The decree that fully restored Jerusalem's civil and religious autonomy was
issued by Artaxerxes Longimanus in his seventh year. Historical records place
this date at **457 B.C.**

- **The Math:** From 457 B.C., if we move forward 69 prophetic weeks (483
  years), we arrive at 27 A.D. (Remembering there is no "year zero" when
  crossing from B.C. to A.D.).
  - 483 - 457 = 26. Add 1 year for the B.C./A.D. crossover = 27 A.D.

---

### Q22. At the close of 483 years, in 27 A.D., one week, or seven years of the 490 yet remained. What was to be done in the midst of that week?

**“And He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of
the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease." Dan. 9:27.**

**Answer:**

The final "week" (7 years) runs from 27 A.D. to 34 A.D. In the "midst" (middle)
of that week—3½ years after His baptism—Christ was crucified (Spring, **31
A.D.**).

- **Sacrifice Ceased:** When Jesus died, the veil of the temple was torn from
  top to bottom (Matthew 27:51). The earthly sacrificial system, which had
  pointed to Christ for centuries, was no longer necessary. The True Lamb had
  died.
- **Confirming the Covenant:** For the remainder of the week (until 34 A.D.),
  the gospel was preached exclusively to the Jews. In 34 A.D., Stephen was
  stoned (Acts 7), marking the rejection of the gospel by the Sanhedrin, and the
  gospel went to the Gentiles (Acts 8-10).

- **Atonement:** The death of Christ in 31 A.D. provided the **sacrificial
  atonement** (Justification). This allows God to legally forgive us.

---

### Q23. And what did the angel say would then take place?

**” And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall
the sanctuary be cleansed." Dan. 8:14.**

**Answer:**

Now we complete the calculation. The 2300 years began at the same time as the
490 years (457 B.C.).

- **Calculation:** 2300 years - 457 B.C. = 1843. Adding 1 year for the lack of a
  "year zero" brings us to **1844 A.D.**
- **The Event:** In 1844, Jesus did not return to earth. Instead, He entered the
  Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary to begin the work of Judgment
  (Cleansing the Sanctuary).

**Doctrinal Summary:**

1.  **The Court is in Session:** Since 1844, we have been living in the great
    antitypical Day of Atonement. Christ is examining the records.
2.  **Righteousness by Faith:** How can a sinner survive this judgment? Not by
    their own works. The only ones "cleansed" are those who are abiding in
    Christ.
    - **Justification:** We claim His death for our past sins.
    - **Sanctification:** We claim His life (intercession) for our present
      victory over sin.
3.  **The Call:** This prophecy calls us to a life of holiness and deep
    repentance. We must cooperate with our High Priest as He seeks to blot sin
    not only from the heavenly books but from our hearts and characters.

**[ILL] Illustration:** In the old Jewish service, while the High Priest was in
the Most Holy Place, the people outside were to "afflict their souls"—searching
their hearts and putting away sin. They did not party; they prayed. We are now
living in that solemn time. But we do not pray in fear; we pray with confidence,
knowing our High Priest is also our Savior.
