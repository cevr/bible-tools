## Slide 1 – Q1: The Source of Scripture

- **Question:** By what means is all Scripture given?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:16 – “All scripture is given by inspiration of God,
  and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction
  in righteousness.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Inspiration and Authority

- **The Definition of Inspiration:**
  - The word _Inspiration_ (Greek _theopneustos_) literally means
    "God-breathed."
  - It is the process by which the Holy Spirit communicated God’s eternal truth
    to human agents.
  - 2 Peter 1:21 – “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:
    but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”
- **The Authority of the Word:**
  - Because Scripture is breathed out by God, it stands above human tradition or
    personal feelings.
  - It is the supreme standard for all doctrine and experience.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
    to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Four-Fold Purpose

- **The Work of the Word:** 2 Timothy 3:16 highlights four practical purposes:
  1. **Doctrine:** Teaching us the truth about God’s character and His law.
  2. **Reproof:** Convicting us of our sin and our need for a Savior.
  3. **Correction:** Restoring us to the right path when we have strayed.
  4. **Instruction in righteousness:** Training us how to live in harmony with
     God's law.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Trumpet and the Breath:**
  - Think of a musician playing a trumpet.
  - The trumpet (the human writer) has a specific shape and tone.
  - However, the breath that creates the melody comes entirely from the musician
    (the Holy Spirit).
  - Without the breath, the instrument is silent; with it, a clear, certain
    sound is produced.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Purpose of Scripture

- **Question:** For what purpose?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:17 – “That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
  furnished unto all good works.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Perfection and Righteousness

- **Defined:**
  - _Perfect_ (Greek _artios_) means "complete," "mature," or "fitted for its
    purpose."
  - It refers to a character fully restored to the image of God through grace.
  - Matthew 5:48 – “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
    heaven is perfect.”
  - Colossians 1:28 – “Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man
    in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We are not saved _by_ works, but we are created _unto_ good works.
  - Ephesians 2:10 – “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto
    good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Sanctification and the Standard

- **The Work of Sanctification:**
  - Using the Word of God to become "thoroughly furnished" is the work of a
    lifetime.
  - It equips us to overcome temptation and reflect Christ’s love.
- **The Standard:**
  - God’s law is the standard of righteousness.
  - The Word provides the "equipment" (promises, warnings, revelation of Christ)
    to bring our lives into harmony with that standard.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Master Carpenter’s Toolbox:**
  - A master carpenter brings a toolbox containing every tool necessary to build
    a house (hammer, saw, level, plane).
  - The Bible is the Christian’s toolbox.
  - It contains every spiritual tool needed to build a character that can stand
    the storms of life and fit us for heaven.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Revealed Things

- **Question:** To whom do the things revealed belong?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 29:29 – “The secret things belong unto the Lord our
  God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
  forever, that we may do all the words of this law.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Our Responsibility

- **A Gift to be Used:**
  - Prophecy is not given for idle curiosity, but to be understood and applied.
  - When God reveals truth (such as end-time prophecies or the sanctuary), we
    are responsible for that light.
- **For Our Children:**
  - We are commanded to teach these truths to the next generation.
  - The "revealed things" are the legacy we leave to guide our families through
    the last days.
- **Limits of Speculation:**
  - We must study what is _revealed_ rather than speculating on _secret things_
    (such as mysteries God has not explained).

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Last Will and Testament:**
  - Imagine a wealthy father leaves a Will for his children.
  - The children may not know the father's secret business dealings, but the
    Will explicitly outlines what belongs to them.
  - It would be foolish for the heirs to ignore the Will that secures their
    inheritance.

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Focus of Revelation

- **Question:** What is the last book of the Bible called?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 1:1 – “The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave
  unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass;
  and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Unveiling Christ

- **The Definition:**
  - _Revelation_ (Greek _apokalypsis_) means an "unveiling" or "uncovering."
- **The Central Figure:**
  - The book is not primarily about beasts; it is the Revelation of _Jesus
    Christ_.
  - The Gospels show Him as the suffering Sacrifice on earth.
  - Revelation shows Him as the conquering King and High Priest in heaven.
- **The Sanctuary Context:**
  - Hebrews 8:1-2 – “We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand
    of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; A minister of the sanctuary,
    and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.”
  - Revelation 11:19 – “And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there
    was seen in his temple the ark of his testament...”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Unveiling of the Statue:**
  - If a statue is covered by a thick canvas, its form is hidden.
  - When the canvas is pulled away, the statue is "revealed."
  - Revelation pulls back the curtain of the natural world to show the
    supernatural reality: Jesus controlling destiny and caring for His church.

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: The Blessing of Study

- **Question:** What is said of those who read or study this book?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 1:3 – “Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear
  the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein:
  for the time is at hand.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Reading, Hearing, and Keeping

- **The Condition of the Blessing:**
  - It is not enough to just read or hear; one must _keep_ the words.
  - _Keeping_ implies obedience and practical application in daily life.
- **Harmony of Law and Gospel:**
  - Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
    keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”
  - **Justification:** Receiving the message of Christ’s blood (Revelation 1:5).
  - **Sanctification:** Allowing His life to produce obedience in us.
- **Urgency:**
  - "The time is at hand" calls for immediate action and preparation for
    judgment.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Doctor’s Prescription:**
  - A doctor gives a patient a prescription for a life-saving cure.
  - It is not enough to _read_ the prescription or _hear_ the explanation.
  - The patient is only blessed (healed) if he _keeps_ the instruction by
    actually taking the medicine.

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Source of Prophecy

- **Question:** How were the Old Testament prophecies given?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:21 – “For the prophecy came not in old time by the
  will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Divine Agency

- **The Source:**
  - Prophecy does not originate in the "will of man" (human calculation or
    guesswork).
  - The Holy Ghost is the active agent who "moved" (carried along) the prophets.
- **Holy Men:**
  - God chose surrendered individuals as His vessels.
  - They retained their personalities, but the truths conveyed were entirely
    divine.
- **Certainty:**
  - Isaiah 46:9-10 – “...I am God, and there is none like me, Declaring the end
    from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet
    done...”

## Slide 20 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Pen and the Writer:**
  - Consider a pen in the hand of a writer.
  - The pen does not decide what to write; it yields to the movement of the
    hand.
  - The prophets were the pens; the Holy Spirit was the Writer.

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Prophetic Interpretation

- **Question:** What is said of the interpretation of these prophecies?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:20 – “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the
  scripture is of any private interpretation.”

## Slide 22 – Q7: No Private Opinions

- **The Rule of Interpretation:**
  - Since prophecy comes from God, it cannot be interpreted by private human
    opinion.
  - We cannot force a meaning onto the text that originates with the reader.
- **Scripture Interprets Scripture:**
  - The only safe rule is to allow the Bible to explain itself.
  - If Revelation uses a symbol, we look to other scriptures (like Daniel) for
    the definition.
- **Protection against Error:**
  - We must always ask, "What saith the Lord?" rather than "What do I think?"

## Slide 23 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Puzzle Piece:**
  - You cannot force a single puzzle piece into the picture wherever you choose.
  - You must look at the shape and the surrounding picture to see where the
    creator intended it to fit.
  - We do not force our meaning into the Bible; we let the Bible fit us into its
    truth.

---

## Slide 24 – Q8: The Goal of Prophecy

- **Question:** In giving their prophetic utterances, what did the prophets
  seek?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:9-10 – “Receiving the end of your faith, even the
  salvation of your souls. Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and
  searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you.”

## Slide 25 – Q8: Salvation and Grace

- **The Central Theme:**
  - Prophecy is not just about history or empires; it is about the **salvation
    of the soul**.
  - The prophets traced the "crimson thread" of redemption.
- **Grace:**
  - They prophesied of the grace—God's unmerited favor—that would come through
    the Messiah.
- **Our Privilege:**
  - We are living in the days the prophets looked forward to.
  - We have the privilege of seeing the fulfillment of what they searched for
    diligently.

## Slide 26 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Watchmen:**
  - Imagine watchmen on a high city wall during a long night of war.
  - They scan the horizon not for scenery, but diligently searching for the
    arrival of the King who brings rescue.
  - The prophets were those watchmen, searching for the Messiah.

---

## Slide 27 – Q9: The Spirit of Christ

- **Question:** By whose spirit were they actuated?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:11 – “Searching what, or what manner of time the
  Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand
  the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.”

## Slide 28 – Q9: Christ the Author

- **The Spirit of Christ:**
  - Jesus is the Word of God (John 1:1 – “In the beginning was the Word, and the
    Word was with God, and the Word was God.”).
  - It was the pre-incarnate Spirit of Christ speaking through Isaiah, Jeremiah,
    and Daniel.
- **The Two-Fold Message:**
  1. **The Sufferings:** Christ's first coming as the Lamb of God (Atonement).
  2. **The Glory:** His second coming as King and His high priestly work.
- **Sanctuary Pattern:**
  - This mirrors the sanctuary: first the sacrifice (sufferings), then the glory
    of the High Priest’s work.

## Slide 29 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Autobiography:**
  - If a man writes an autobiography, he knows his own story better than anyone
    else.
  - The Bible is the autobiography of Christ, dictated to the prophets by His
    own Spirit before He even came to earth as a man.

---

## Slide 30 – Q10: Apostolic Confirmation

- **Question:** How did Peter confirm his former preaching on the coming of
  Christ?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:16 – “For we have not followed cunningly devised
  fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
  Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.”

## Slide 31 – Q10: Historical Reality

- **Not Fables:**
  - The Christian faith is based on historical fact, not mythology.
- **Eyewitness Testimony:**
  - The apostles saw His miracles and His resurrection.
  - Peter specifically refers to the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1–5), where he
    saw a preview of the Kingdom of Glory.
  - This proves that the promise of His return in power is true.

---

## Slide 32 – Q11: The Voice of God

- **Question:** When did the apostle see the majesty (kingship) of Christ, and
  hear the a probative words of God?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:18 – “And this voice which came from heaven we heard,
  when we were with him in the holy mount.”

## Slide 33 – Q11: The Holy Mount

- **Divine Confirmation:**
  - The event took place on the "holy mount" during the Transfiguration.
  - Peter heard the literal voice of the Father: “This is my beloved Son, in
    whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 17:5).
- **Significance:**
  - Our faith is anchored in an event that happened in time and space.
  - It is witnessed by credible men who were willing to die for what they saw.

## Slide 34 – Q11: Illustration

- **Courtroom Testimony:**
  - In a court of law, hearsay or rumor is not admissible.
  - The strongest evidence is a reliable witness who says, "I was there, I saw
    it happen, and I heard the voice."
  - Peter offers this sworn testimony to the church.

---

## Slide 35 – Q12: The Sure Word

- **Question:** What other and more certain evidence did he have of the power
  and coming of Christ?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:19 – “We have also a more sure word of prophecy;
  whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
  place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts.”

## Slide 36 – Q12: More Sure Than Senses

- **Objective Evidence:**
  - Peter says prophecy is "more sure" even than his own vision on the mount.
  - Senses can be deceived, but the fulfilled Word (history of nations) is an
    immovable rock.
- **Light in a Dark Place:**
  - Psalm 119:105 – “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”
  - Prophecy shows us where we are in the stream of time.
- **The Day Star Within:**
  - The goal is for Christ (the Day Star) to arise _in your hearts_.
  - Galatians 4:19 – “My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until
    Christ be formed in you.”
  - External evidence leads to the internal reality of Righteousness by Faith.

## Slide 37 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Lighthouse vs. Lightning:**
  - Imagine a ship in a storm. Lightning flashes (experiences) give blinding,
    momentary glimpses.
  - A lighthouse (prophecy) provides a steady, constant beam to guide the ship
    to harbor.
  - We must trust the steady light of prophecy over the flashes of feeling.

---

## Slide 38 – Q13: Authenticating Daniel

- **Question:** To what prophecy did Christ refer His disciples when predicting
  the destruction of Jerusalem?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:15 – “When ye therefore shall see the abomination of
  desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso
  readeth, let him understand:)”

## Slide 39 – Q13: The Abomination of Desolation

- **Christ Authenticates Daniel:**
  - Jesus specifically pointed to the book of Daniel as the key to survival.
- **Dual Application:**
  - **Historical:** The Roman armies surrounding Jerusalem (Luke 21:20 – “And
    when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the
    desolation thereof is nigh.”).
  - **End Time:** The antichrist power (Daniel’s little horn) which casts down
    truth and attempts to change God's law.
- **"Let Him Understand":**
  - Jesus commands us to study Daniel. Our safety against deception depends on
    it.

## Slide 40 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Tornado Siren:**
  - A tornado siren is designed to warn people of approaching danger.
  - If you know what the siren sounds like, you can take shelter and live.
  - Jesus points to the book of Daniel as the siren for the end times.

---

## Slide 41 – Q14: The Time of the End

- **Question:** When were all the prophecies in the book of Daniel to be
  understood?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 12:4 – “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal
  the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
  knowledge shall be increased.”

## Slide 42 – Q14: Unsealing the Book

- **The Time of the End:**
  - A prophetic period beginning in 1798 (following the 1260 years of Daniel
    7:25).
- **Running To and Fro:**
  - This refers to diligent Bible study—running through the pages of Scripture.
- **Knowledge Increased:**
  - Since 1798, the prophecies of Daniel (the 2300 days, the sanctuary, the
    judgment) have been opened.
  - We understand what Daniel himself could not fully comprehend.
  - This places a solemn responsibility on us to share this "sure word."

## Slide 43 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Time-Lock Safe:**
  - A time-lock safe cannot be opened until the clock reaches the set hour.
  - No amount of force or skill can open it early.
  - God placed a "time-lock" on Daniel’s prophecies.
  - That time-lock expired at the "time of the end," and now the treasures are
    open for all.
