# Bible Study: The Two Resurrections

## Introduction

Death entered our world through Adam's sin, and now all humanity faces this
solemn reality. Yet the gospel does not leave us hopeless in the grave. Scripture
reveals that death is but a sleep, and two distinct resurrections await
humanity—one to eternal life, and one to eternal condemnation. Understanding
these truths transforms how we view both death and the life to come.

## Core Truths

### The Universal Reality of Death

Because of Adam's transgression, death has passed upon all mankind:

> _"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."_ (1
> Corinthians 15:22)

> _"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
> so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."_ (Romans 5:12)

**Death**: The cessation of life, the separation of the breath of life from the
body, resulting in complete unconsciousness (Genesis 2:7; Ecclesiastes 12:7).

This is not merely physical mortality but the direct consequence of broken
relationship with the Source of life. In Adam, we inherit both a sinful nature
and its inevitable result—death.

### The State of Man in Death

Scripture speaks plainly about the condition of the dead:

> _"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no
> work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou
> goest."_ (Ecclesiastes 9:10)

The dead have no consciousness, no activity, no awareness:

> _"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing,
> neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."_
> (Ecclesiastes 9:5)

> _"The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence."_
> (Psalm 115:17)

> _"Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no
> help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his
> thoughts perish."_ (Psalm 146:3–4)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word "sheol" (grave) appears 65 times in the Old Testament.
It never refers to a place of conscious existence but always to the silent realm
of the dead where all—righteous and wicked alike—await the resurrection.

### Death as Sleep

Jesus Himself described death as sleep—a state of unconscious rest awaiting
awakening:

> _"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep."_
> (John 11:11)

When the disciples misunderstood, Jesus spoke plainly:

> _"Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead."_ (John 11:14)

This metaphor appears throughout Scripture (Daniel 12:2; 1 Thessalonians 4:13–14;
1 Corinthians 15:51). Sleep implies:

- **Unconsciousness**—no awareness of passing time
- **Rest**—cessation from labor and sorrow
- **Awakening**—the certain expectation of resurrection

[ILL] Consider a person under deep anesthesia. Though hours may pass during
surgery, they experience no passage of time. When they awaken, it seems but a
moment. So it is with death. For Lazarus, four days in the tomb passed as
nothing. For the righteous who sleep in Jesus, whether their rest be four days
or four thousand years, the next conscious moment will be the voice of the
Life-giver calling them forth.

## Deeper Truths

### The Two Resurrections Revealed

Scripture clearly teaches not one but two resurrections, separated by purpose
and by time:

> _"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the
> graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good,
> unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
> resurrection of damnation."_ (John 5:28–29)

**The First Resurrection**—the resurrection of life:

> _"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the
> second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ,
> and shall reign with him a thousand years."_ (Revelation 20:6)

**The Second Resurrection**—the resurrection of damnation:

> _"But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were
> finished."_ (Revelation 20:5)

[Q] **"Why two resurrections? Why not raise everyone at once?"**

The two resurrections reflect God's justice and the distinct destinies of the
righteous and the wicked. The righteous are raised to immortality at Christ's
coming, to reign with Him during the millennium. The wicked are raised after the
thousand years to face the executive judgment. This separation demonstrates that
character—formed in this life through our response to God's grace—determines
eternal destiny. God forces no one into His presence who has not chosen to be
there.

### The First Resurrection: Life and Immortality

At Christ's second coming, the righteous dead will be raised:

> _"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
> of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise
> first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
> them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with
> the Lord."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16–17)

This resurrection brings transformation:

> _"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
> changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
> trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
> be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
> must put on immortality."_ (1 Corinthians 15:51–53)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "dead in Christ" (1 Thessalonians 4:16) reveals that even in
death, believers maintain their covenant relationship with Jesus. They are not
forgotten souls but precious ones "asleep in Jesus," safe in His keeping until
the resurrection morning.

### The Second Resurrection: Judgment and Destruction

After the thousand years, the wicked are raised to face final judgment:

> _"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were
> opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead
> were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to
> their works."_ (Revelation 20:12)

This resurrection leads not to eternal torment but to the second death:

> _"And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second
> death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into
> the lake of fire."_ (Revelation 20:14–15)

**Second Death**: The final, eternal extinction of the wicked—the complete end
of existence with no possibility of resurrection (Revelation 20:14; Malachi
4:1–3).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Resurrection Hope

The sanctuary service illuminates the resurrection truth. On the Day of
Atonement, the high priest emerged from the Most Holy Place to bless the waiting
congregation (Leviticus 16:17, 23–24). This typified Christ's emergence from His
heavenly ministry to raise His people:

> _"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look
> for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."_ (Hebrews
> 9:28)

The righteous dead wait in their graves as ancient Israel waited for the high
priest to emerge. When Christ completes His mediatorial work in heaven's Most
Holy Place, He will come forth to gather His people—both living and resurrected.

### Victory Over Death Through Christ

The resurrection is possible only because Christ conquered death:

> _"I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore,
> Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death."_ (Revelation 1:18)

Christ holds the keys! Death has no independent power. The grave cannot hold
those for whom Christ died and rose again. His resurrection is the guarantee of
ours:

> _"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them
> that slept."_ (1 Corinthians 15:20)

[ILL] A firstfruit is not merely a sample—it is the first portion of the
harvest, guaranteeing that the full harvest will follow. Christ's resurrection
on the morning of the firstfruits offering (Leviticus 23:10–11) was no
coincidence. He is the firstfruit; His people are the harvest. As surely as He
rose, so shall all who sleep in Him.

### The Great Controversy Settled

The two resurrections bring the great controversy to its final resolution. The
first resurrection vindicates God's people, proving that His grace was
sufficient to transform sinners into saints fit for heaven. The second
resurrection, following the millennium of review (1 Corinthians 6:2–3;
Revelation 20:4), demonstrates God's justice to the entire universe. Every knee
shall bow, acknowledging that God has been righteous in all His ways:

> _"That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and
> things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should
> confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."_
> (Philippians 2:10–11)

## Practical Application

Understanding the two resurrections calls us to:

1. **Live with eternal perspective**. This life determines which resurrection we
   will experience. Every day is preparation for eternity.

2. **Grieve with hope**. When loved ones who knew Christ die, we sorrow not as
   those who have no hope (1 Thessalonians 4:13). The separation is temporary;
   the reunion will be eternal.

3. **Reject spiritualism's deceptions**. The dead know nothing (Ecclesiastes
   9:5). Any "spirit" claiming to be a departed loved one is a demonic
   deception. This truth protects us from Satan's masterful delusions in the
   last days.

4. **Rest in Christ's finished work**. Immortality is not inherent in man—it is
   the gift of God through Christ (Romans 6:23; 2 Timothy 1:10). We cannot earn
   it; we receive it by faith in the One who holds the keys of death.

5. **Share the blessed hope**. The resurrection message brings comfort to the
   grieving and urgency to the careless. It is the heart of the gospel: _"If in
   this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But
   now is Christ risen"_ (1 Corinthians 15:19–20).

## Appeal

> _"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth
> in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
> believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?"_ (John 11:25–26)

Dear friend, Christ asks you the same question He asked Martha: "Believest thou
this?" Do you believe that He who conquered death has power to raise you? Do you
trust that your sleeping loved ones are safe in His keeping?

The grave is not the end. For those in Christ, it is but a moment's rest before
the eternal morning. Choose today to be among those who have part in the first
resurrection—those over whom the second death has no power.

Christ holds the keys. Will you trust Him with yours?
