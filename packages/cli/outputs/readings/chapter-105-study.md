### Q1. Because of the Fall, what comes to every man?

**“In Adam all die.” 1 Corinthians 15:22.** (See also Romans 5:12.)

**Answer:**

The Scriptures teach clearly that the inevitable consequence of the Fall is
**death**. This is not merely a biological process but the result of separation
from God, who is the only Fountain of Life (Psalm 36:9).

1.  **The Entrance of Sin and Death** Through the disobedience of one man, Adam,
    sin entered the world. The Bible explains that "death passed upon all men,
    for that all have sinned" (Romans 5:12). God had warned Adam regarding the
    tree of the knowledge of good and evil: "in the day that thou eatest thereof
    thou shalt surely die" (Genesis 2:17). When Adam fell, humanity was cut off
    from the sustaining power of enduring life, and the sentence of mortality
    began to work in the human race.

2.  **Solidarity in Adam** The text says, "In Adam all die." By natural birth,
    we partake of Adam's fallen nature. We inherit a nature that is subject to
    weakness, decay, and ultimately the cessation of life (Job 14:1–2). We
    possess no inherent immortality in ourselves; we are mortal beings dependent
    entirely on breath from God (Genesis 2:7).

3.  **The Necessity of the Second Adam** This grim reality highlights our
    desperate need for a Savior. If "in Adam" we find only condemnation and
    death, we must be found "in Christ" to find righteousness and life.
    - **Righteousness by Faith:** The gospel promise is that while the first
      Adam brought death, Christ (the Second Adam) brings life. Faith unites us
      to Christ so that His victory becomes ours. "For as by one man's
      disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many
      be made righteous" (Romans 5:19).
    - **Justification:** (God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is
      righteous). Just as death passed to all through Adam, the free gift of
      justification comes to all who believe in Jesus (Romans 5:18).

4.  **The Sanctuary Connection** In the earthly sanctuary, the slaying of the
    sacrifice in the outer court signified that "the wages of sin is death"
    (Romans 6:23). The innocent victim died in the sinner's place. This points
    to Christ, the Lamb of God, who tasted death for every man (Hebrews 2:9).
    Because He died the death that was ours, He can offer us the life that is
    His.

**[ILL] The Broken Mold:** Imagine a potter working with a mold that has a deep
crack in it. Every vessel poured into that mold will come out with the same
defect—a crack. Adam is like that broken mold. Because he was marred by sin,
every descendant "poured" from his line comes out marred and subject to breaking
(death). We cannot fix the crack by polishing the vessel (human works); we must
be re-molded in the image of Jesus Christ (regeneration).

### Q2. In what condition is man while in death?

**“Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no
work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.”
Ecclesiastes 9:10.** **NOTE.** - That is, man, when dead, has no use of the
powers of mind or body. He cannot, therefore, while in the grave, praise God, or
even think of Him (Psalm 6:5); for in the day he dies his thoughts perish. Psalm
146:2-4. (See preceding chapter, Eternal Life)

**Answer:**

The Bible consistently describes the condition of man in death as a state of
**unconscious sleep**, silence, and inactivity.

1.  **Total Unconsciousness** The verse in Ecclesiastes is explicit: in the
    grave, there is no working, planning ("device"), knowing, or wisdom.
    - **Thoughts Perish:** The Psalmist declares that when man's breath goes
      forth, he returns to the earth; "in that very day his thoughts perish"
      (Psalm 146:4). If the thoughts perish, there is no conscious joy in heaven
      nor conscious torment in hell immediately upon death.
    - **No Praise:** "The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down
      into silence" (Psalm 115:17). If the righteous went straight to glory,
      they would certainly be praising God; but Scripture says they are in
      silence.

2.  **The Metaphor of Sleep** Jesus referred to death as "sleep." When Lazarus
    died, Jesus said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake
    him out of sleep" (John 11:11–14).
    - This implies a period of rest and unconsciousness between death and the
      resurrection.
    - Just as a sleeping person is unaware of the passing of time until they
      wake, so the dead rest in the grave until the voice of the Son of God
      calls them forth (John 5:28–29).

3.  **Protection Against Deception** Understanding the true state of the dead is
    a vital safeguard against **Spiritualism** (the belief that the dead can
    communicate with the living). Satan’s first lie was, "Ye shall not surely
    die" (Genesis 3:4). If we believe the dead are actually alive spirits, we
    open the door to demonic impersonations. The Bible forbids seeking the dead
    (Isaiah 8:19) because the dead "know not anything" (Ecclesiastes 9:5).

4.  **The Hope of Resurrection** If man possessed an immortal soul that went to
    God immediately, there would be no need for a resurrection. But the Bible
    centers our hope on the **Resurrection** at the Second Coming.
    - **Sanctuary Connection:** Currently, Christ is interceding in the Heavenly
      Sanctuary. The dead in Christ are "sleeping" in the dust, their life "hid
      with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3). When Christ finishes His work of
      **Atonement** (reconciling God and man) and leaves the Most Holy Place, He
      will descend to wake His people.
    - **Faith in the Life-Giver:** Our confidence is not in our own natural
      immortality, but in Christ who says, "I am the resurrection, and the life"
      (John 11:25). We trust Him to keep that which we have committed unto Him
      against that day (2 Timothy 1:12).

**[ILL] The Unconscious Patient:** Consider a patient undergoing major surgery
who is placed under general anesthesia. They are given the anesthetic, their
eyes close, and they drift into a deep, dreamless sleep. Five hours may pass
during the operation, but to the patient, it feels like a single moment. One
second they are closing their eyes; the very next second (in their
consciousness) they are waking up in the recovery room. So it is with death. The
believer closes their eyes in death, and the very next conscious moment is
seeing Jesus coming in the clouds of heaven. The thousands of years in between
are as nothing to them.
