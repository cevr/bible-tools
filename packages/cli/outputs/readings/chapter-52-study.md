# Reading 52: The Third Angel's Message

## Introduction

The third angel's message of Revelation 14 constitutes the most solemn warning ever given to humanity—a divine alert against receiving the mark of the beast, coupled with a call to keep God's commandments and the faith of Jesus. This message reveals the final battle line in the great controversy: will we worship the Creator according to His revealed will, or bow to a counterfeit system of worship? Understanding this prophecy prepares God's people for the decisive crisis ahead.

## Core Truths

### The Solemn Warning

The third angel follows the first two with heaven's most urgent proclamation:

> _"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God."_ (Revelation 14:9–10)

This warning concerns:

- **The beast** — a power demanding false worship
- **The image of the beast** — a replica of that power's character and methods
- **The mark** — a sign of allegiance to this counterfeit system

The consequence—"the wine of the wrath of God"—is the seven last plagues poured out without mixture of mercy (Revelation 15:1). No warning in Scripture carries weightier consequences.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "without mixture" in Revelation 14:10 refers to wine not diluted with water. In the ancient world, wine was typically mixed with water to reduce its potency. God's wrath upon those who worship the beast will be undiluted—full strength—because mercy's day has closed.

### Identifying the Beast Power

The Scriptures provide clear identifying marks for this beast:

> _"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy."_ (Revelation 13:1)

**Key characteristics:**

- **Rises from the sea** — emerges from a populated, established region (Revelation 17:15: "waters... are peoples, and multitudes")
- **Has blasphemous names** — claims divine prerogatives
- **Makes war with the saints** — persecutes God's faithful people (Revelation 13:7)
- **Receives worldwide worship** — "all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him" (Revelation 13:8)

The parallel symbol in Revelation 17—the woman "drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus" (verse 6)—confirms this power's persecuting nature. History records that millions died during the medieval period for refusing to compromise their faith.

[DYK🔎] Historians estimate that between 50 and 150 million people perished during the centuries of religious persecution in Europe. Fox's Book of Martyrs and other historical records document the systematic destruction of those who held Scripture above church tradition.

### The Two-Horned Beast

A second power enters the prophetic scene:

> _"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon."_ (Revelation 13:11)

**Distinct characteristics:**

- **Rises from the earth** — emerges from a sparsely populated region
- **Lamb-like horns** — appears peaceful, Christian, freedom-loving
- **Speaks as a dragon** — eventually enforces worship through coercion

This nation appears at the time when the first beast receives its deadly wound (around 1798), rises in a new territory, professes Christian principles, yet ultimately betrays those principles by forcing religious observance.

**This beast's work:**

- Commands an **image to the beast** to be made (verse 14)
- Causes all to receive **a mark** (verse 16)
- Enforces economic penalties: **"no man might buy or sell"** without the mark (verse 17)
- Finally, decrees that **non-worshipers should be killed** (verse 15)

[Q] **"Isn't this interpretation just anti-Catholic bias?"**

Historicist interpretation—the method used by virtually all Protestant Reformers—follows scriptural markers rather than prejudice. The identifying features are drawn directly from the biblical text: duration of power (1,260 years), location, blasphemous claims, persecution of saints, and wound that heals. The Reformers—Luther, Calvin, Knox, Wesley, and others—unanimously identified this power based on these biblical criteria, not from personal animosity. Our concern is not with individual Catholics, whom we regard as fellow seekers of truth, but with a _system_ that claims prerogatives belonging only to God.

## Deeper Truths

### The Mark vs. The Seal

Scripture sets the mark of the beast in direct contrast with the seal of God:

| **Seal of God** (Revelation 7:2–3) | **Mark of the Beast** (Revelation 13:16–17) |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Placed on the **forehead**         | Placed on **forehead or hand**              |
| Identifies God's servants          | Identifies beast's followers                |
| Connected with God's law           | Connected with beast's law                  |
| Voluntary, from the heart          | Involves coercion and economic pressure     |

The forehead represents the **mind**—willing, intelligent worship. The hand represents **actions**—compliance from expediency rather than conviction. God accepts only heart service; the beast accepts either.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "seal" (_chotham_) refers to an official mark of authentication, ownership, and authority. Ancient kings sealed documents with their signet ring containing their name, title, and territory. The fourth commandment—the Sabbath—contains all three elements of God's seal: His name ("the LORD thy God"), His title ("that made"), and His territory ("heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is") (Exodus 20:8–11).

### The Commandments of God and the Faith of Jesus

Against the mark of the beast, God presents His identifying sign:

> _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:12)

**"The commandments of God"** — What does Scripture define as God's commandments?

> _"And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone."_ (Deuteronomy 4:13)

These ten precepts are complete and unalterable:

> _"These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount... with a great voice; and He added no more."_ (Deuteronomy 5:22)

**"The faith of Jesus"** — This phrase carries dual meaning:

1. **Faith in Jesus** — trust in His atoning sacrifice and priestly ministry
2. **The faith which Jesus had** — the same quality of faith He demonstrated, enabling perfect obedience through dependence on the Father

The final generation keeps **all** the commandments—not through human effort, but through Christ living within (Galatians 2:20).

[Q] **"Didn't Christ abolish the law at the cross?"**

Scripture declares the opposite. Jesus said, _"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil"_ (Matthew 5:17). The word "fulfil" means to fill full—to demonstrate its deepest meaning—not to abolish. He continued: _"Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law"_ (verse 18). The ceremonial laws pointing to Christ's sacrifice ended at the cross (Colossians 2:14–17), but the moral law—the ten commandments—remains God's eternal standard of righteousness (Romans 3:31; 7:12; James 2:10–12).

### The Heart of the Controversy

James illuminates why partial obedience fails:

> _"For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill."_ (James 2:10–11)

The issue is not merely external compliance but loyalty to the _Lawgiver_. Breaking one commandment—even while keeping nine—reveals a heart that reserves the right to choose which divine commands to obey. This is the spirit of the beast's worship: human authority determining religious observance rather than divine command.

[ILL] A married man may be faithful to his wife in ninety-nine ways, but if he breaks his vow in one way, he is unfaithful. The wedding ring on his finger does not prove his loyalty if his heart wanders elsewhere. So it is with God's law. We may keep nine commandments perfectly, but if we deliberately violate the fourth because human tradition says we may, we have set man's word above God's. The wedding ring of our covenant—the Sabbath—becomes meaningless when our hearts follow another.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

The third angel's message is inseparable from the sanctuary truth. In the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary stands the ark of God's covenant containing His ten commandments (Revelation 11:19). The investigative judgment now in session examines whether professed believers truly keep God's commandments through the faith of Jesus.

**The sanctuary reveals:**

- **Outer court** (cross): Christ's sacrifice provides forgiveness for transgression of the law
- **Holy place** (daily ministry): Christ's intercession provides power for daily victory over sin
- **Most Holy Place** (final atonement): Christ's investigative work prepares a people who fully reflect His character—commandment keepers in heart and practice

Those who receive the mark of the beast have rejected heaven's sanctuary ministry, choosing human mediation and human authority over God's appointed way.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Commandments

How can sinful humans keep God's holy law? Not by self-effort, but through Christ:

> _"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."_ (Galatians 2:20)

**Righteousness by faith produces commandment keepers:**

- Christ's righteousness **imputed** — we stand forgiven before God
- Christ's righteousness **imparted** — His obedient life is reproduced in us
- The law is written **in our hearts** — we love to do God's will (Hebrews 8:10)
- We keep commandments **not to be saved** but **because we are saved**

The beast system offers a counterfeit: human works, church merit, and altered commandments. True faith receives Christ's gift of righteousness that transforms the life.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "here is the patience of the saints" (Revelation 14:12) uses the Greek word _hupomone_, meaning enduring steadfastness under trial. This same word describes Job's perseverance (James 5:11). The final generation will need this endurance when they cannot buy or sell, and face a death decree, yet they trust fully in God and refuse to worship the beast.

### The Dragon's Wrath Against the Remnant

> _"And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."_ (Revelation 12:17)

Two characteristics identify the remnant church:

1. **Keep the commandments of God** — including the Sabbath
2. **Have the testimony of Jesus** — the spirit of prophecy (Revelation 19:10)

Satan's fury is directed specifically against commandment keepers. The final persecution arises not because of murder, theft, or immorality, but because faithful believers refuse to violate God's law by receiving a counterfeit mark.

## Practical Application

### Preparing for the Crisis

The third angel's message calls us to:

1. **Study the commandments of God** — Know what they require; examine every detail of the ten precepts (Psalm 119:97–104)

2. **Cultivate faith in Jesus** — Daily surrender brings Christ's indwelling presence, making obedience possible (John 15:4–5)

3. **Separate from spiritual Babylon** — Come out of false systems of worship before the final crisis (Revelation 18:4)

4. **Practice present faithfulness** — Those who compromise now will not stand then; obedience in small things prepares for obedience in great ones (Luke 16:10)

5. **Receive the seal of God** — The Sabbath, kept from a heart renewed by grace, identifies us as belonging to the Creator

### Questions for Self-Examination

- Am I keeping all ten commandments, including the fourth, from love to God?
- Am I trusting Christ's righteousness or depending on my own works?
- Have I fully separated from false worship systems?
- Am I prepared to stand faithful even when buying and selling are forbidden?

## Appeal

> _"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."_ (Revelation 3:22)

The third angel's message divides humanity into two classes: those who worship the beast and those who keep the commandments of God. There is no middle ground. Every soul must choose.

But hear the gracious invitation: God does not call us to keep His commandments in our own strength. He offers Christ—His righteousness, His indwelling power, His victorious life—to live within us, producing the obedience we could never manufacture.

The question is not, "Can I stand?" but "Will I let Christ stand in me?"

Today, while mercy lingers, receive His gift. Let His law be written in your heart. Become, by His grace, one of those who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

The third angel's message is not merely a warning—it is heaven's final appeal of love, calling you to stand on the side of your Creator before probation closes forever.

> _"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."_ (Revelation 22:14)
