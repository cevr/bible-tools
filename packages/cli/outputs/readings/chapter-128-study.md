# Reading 128: A Good Conscience

## Introduction

The conscience is one of God's most precious gifts to humanity—an inner faculty that bears witness to right and wrong, approving or condemning our actions. Yet this sacred monitor can be either purified by the blood of Christ or seared into silence through persistent rejection of the Spirit. This study explores how the gospel transforms the conscience, enabling the believer to live in peace with God and man.

## Core Truths

### What Is Conscience?

Conscience is more than mere feelings of guilt or approval—it is the moral faculty within every human being that applies knowledge of right and wrong to our own actions and character.

> _"For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another."_ (Romans 2:14–15)

The word itself reveals its meaning: **con** (with) + **science** (knowledge) = **self-knowledge** regarding moral matters. The conscience does not create the standard of right and wrong—it applies an existing standard (God's law) to our own conduct.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for conscience, _suneidesis_, appears over thirty times in the New Testament. It literally means "to know together with oneself"—suggesting an inner witness that testifies alongside our actions, either for or against us.

### The Purging of the Conscience

Under the old covenant system, the blood of bulls and goats could ceremonially cleanse the worshiper, but it could never reach the conscience—the inner man remained burdened with the knowledge of sin.

> _"How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"_ (Hebrews 9:14)

Here is the glorious truth of the gospel: Christ's sacrifice does what no animal sacrifice ever could—it purges the conscience itself. The word "purge" (_katharizo_) means to cleanse thoroughly, to purify from defilement. Through faith in Christ's blood, the condemning voice of conscience is answered, and the believer is freed to serve God with joy rather than dread.

**"Dead works"** refers not only to sinful deeds but to all human efforts to earn salvation apart from Christ. These works are "dead" because they spring from a heart still under condemnation. Only when the conscience is purged by Christ's blood can we render living service—works that flow from a heart at peace with God.

### The Conscience Once Purged

> _"Because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins."_ (Hebrews 10:2)

This does not mean believers become unaware of sin or indifferent to it. Rather, it means that those who have truly received Christ's cleansing no longer carry the crushing, condemning guilt of unforgiven sin. The conscience, having been answered by Christ's blood, finds rest.

[ILL] Consider a man who owes a crushing debt he cannot possibly repay. Every waking moment, the knowledge of that debt weighs upon him—he cannot enjoy a meal, cannot sleep peacefully, cannot look his creditors in the eye. But suppose a wealthy friend pays the debt in full and presents him with the receipt marked "PAID." From that moment, though he still knows the debt existed, he no longer carries the burden of it. The conscience of debt is gone. So it is with the sinner who trusts in Christ's atoning sacrifice—the debt of sin is paid, and the conscience is freed from its condemning weight.

## Deeper Truths

### Living in Good Conscience

The Apostle Paul's testimony reveals what a purged conscience looks like in daily life:

> _"Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day."_ (Acts 23:1)

> _"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward men."_ (Acts 24:16)

Notice Paul's language: **"I exercise myself."** A good conscience is not passive—it requires diligent effort, constant watchfulness, and moment-by-moment dependence on Christ. The word "exercise" (_askeo_) is the term from which we derive "ascetic"—it means to train, to practice, to discipline oneself toward a goal.

[Q] **"But didn't Paul persecute Christians before his conversion? How could he claim a good conscience?"**

Paul's statement does not mean he was always right—he admits elsewhere that he persecuted the church in ignorance and unbelief (1 Timothy 1:13). What he means is that he always acted according to the best light he had at the time. Before Damascus, his conscience was sincere but poorly enlightened; afterward, it was both sincere and illuminated by truth. A good conscience must be guided by God's word, not merely by sincerity. One can be sincerely wrong.

### Baptism: The Answer of a Good Conscience

> _"The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), by the resurrection of Jesus Christ."_ (1 Peter 3:21)

Peter is careful to explain that baptism's saving power does not lie in the water itself (which only washes external filth), but in what the act represents: **the answer of a good conscience toward God.**

The Greek word for "answer" (_eperotema_) can mean a pledge, a request, or a response. Baptism is the believer's public pledge—made from a conscience already cleansed by faith in Christ—to walk in newness of life. It is the outward confession of an inward reality: "My conscience is now clear before God through Christ's resurrection, and I commit myself to live accordingly."

[DYK🔎] Some scholars believe _eperotema_ was a legal term used in contracts, meaning a formal pledge or commitment. In this light, baptism becomes the believer's covenant response to God's grace—a sacred contract sealed in water, witnessed by heaven and earth.

### Conscience and Suffering

A good conscience empowers believers to endure unjust suffering without bitterness:

> _"For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully."_ (1 Peter 2:19)

When we suffer for doing right, the conscience bears witness that we are in God's will, and this testimony sustains us. The martyr at the stake, the prisoner of conscience in the dungeon—these have found a peace the world cannot understand, because their conscience testifies that they suffer for Christ's sake.

### The Seared Conscience

But the conscience can be destroyed through persistent rejection of truth:

> _"Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron."_ (1 Timothy 4:2)

A seared conscience is one that has been cauterized—burned until the nerve endings are dead. Such a person can commit terrible sins without a twinge of guilt. This condition is not reached suddenly but through a gradual process: first ignoring the conscience's voice, then arguing against it, then silencing it, and finally killing it altogether.

[ILL] A farmer develops callouses on his hands through repeated friction. What once caused pain no longer registers. Similarly, the conscience develops spiritual callouses when we repeatedly ignore its warnings. Each refusal to heed its voice makes the next refusal easier, until at last we can sin without feeling anything at all. This is the most dangerous condition a soul can reach—to be lost and not know it, to be sick unto death and feel perfectly well.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Conscience and the Sanctuary

The book of Hebrews connects the purging of the conscience directly with Christ's sanctuary ministry. Under the earthly type, worshipers brought their sacrifices year after year, but these could never perfect the conscience (Hebrews 10:1–4). The veil remained, and the way into the Most Holy was not yet made manifest.

But Christ, through His own blood, entered the heavenly sanctuary "once for all" and obtained eternal redemption (Hebrews 9:12). His sacrifice reaches where animal blood never could—into the inner man, cleansing the conscience from the defilement of sin.

**In the outer court**, we see Christ's sacrifice on the cross—the foundation of all conscience-cleansing. **In the holy place**, His ongoing intercession applies that cleansing blood to every repentant sinner who comes to God through Him. **In the most holy place**, the investigative judgment reveals those whose consciences have been truly purged—not merely forgiven, but transformed; not merely pardoned, but purified.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Conscience

Here is where the gospel meets the conscience in transforming power: We cannot cleanse our own conscience through works. Every human effort to silence guilt through self-improvement, religious ritual, or good deeds is ultimately futile—these are the "dead works" from which we must be purged.

Only the blood of Christ, received by faith, can answer the conscience's accusations. But when that blood is applied, the conscience is not merely silenced—it is satisfied. Christ's righteousness, imputed to the believer, answers every charge the law brings against us. Christ's righteousness, imparted through the indwelling Spirit, progressively transforms us so that the conscience increasingly testifies to actual conformity to God's will.

This is the mystery of godliness: the same Christ who justifies us also sanctifies us. The conscience that once condemned us for our failures now rejoices in what God is doing in us by His grace.

> _"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world."_ (2 Corinthians 1:12)

Paul's good conscience was not the product of self-righteousness but of genuine transformation by God's grace. His conscience testified that his conduct came not from "fleshly wisdom" (human scheming or hypocrisy) but from "godly sincerity" wrought by the Spirit.

### The Threefold Cord

Scripture binds a good conscience together with other essential graces:

> _"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned."_ (1 Timothy 1:5)

Here is a threefold cord not easily broken:

1. **A pure heart** – the inner springs of life cleansed from secret sin
2. **A good conscience** – the moral faculty enlightened and responsive to God's will
3. **Faith unfeigned** – genuine trust in God, not mere profession

From these three springs **charity** (_agape_)—the love of God shed abroad in the heart. This is the goal of all God's commandments: not mere outward compliance, but inward transformation that produces spontaneous, self-forgetful love.

## Practical Application

### How to Maintain a Good Conscience

1. **Submit your conscience to Scripture.** The conscience must be educated by God's word, not by tradition, culture, or personal preference. Study the Bible daily to keep your moral compass aligned with divine truth (Psalm 119:105).

2. **Respond immediately to conviction.** When the conscience speaks, do not delay. Confession, repentance, and restitution should follow promptly. Each delay weakens the conscience's voice (Hebrews 3:7–8).

3. **Depend wholly on Christ's blood.** Do not try to cleanse your own conscience through works, penance, or self-punishment. Only the blood of Jesus can purge the conscience. Come to Him daily, confessing your sins and receiving His cleansing (1 John 1:7–9).

4. **Walk in the light you have.** Live according to your present understanding of truth, while remaining open to further light. A conscience can be sincere but poorly informed; seek always to grow in knowledge (Proverbs 4:18).

5. **Guard against callousness.** Be sensitive to the Spirit's promptings. If you notice your conscience troubling you less about certain sins, take alarm—this may indicate dangerous hardening rather than genuine victory.

6. **Make restitution where possible.** A good conscience toward men requires that we make right whatever wrongs we can. If you have injured someone by word or deed, seek reconciliation (Matthew 5:23–24).

## Appeal

> _"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offense toward God, and toward men."_ (Acts 24:16)

Dear reader, what is the testimony of your conscience today? Does it speak peace, having been purged by the blood of Christ? Or does it still accuse you, burdened with unforgiven sin?

Perhaps you have been trying to silence your conscience through distraction, argument, or religious activity. These efforts cannot succeed—the conscience will not be satisfied with anything less than the blood of the Lamb.

Or perhaps you fear that your conscience has grown dull through years of neglect. Take heart: the same Christ who raised the dead can quicken even a seared conscience. Come to Him just as you are. Confess your condition honestly. Ask Him to do what you cannot do for yourself—to purge your conscience and restore your sensitivity to His Spirit.

The promise is sure: _"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"_ (1 John 1:9).

Will you come to Christ today and receive the cleansing only His blood can give? Will you commit, by His grace, to live in all good conscience before God and man?

The choice is yours. The blood has been shed. The invitation stands open. Come.
