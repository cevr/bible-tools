# Reading 30: Present Truth

## Introduction

Throughout salvation history, God has sent specific messages for specific times. These messages, when believed and obeyed, bring salvation; when rejected, they bring destruction. Today, as in every generation, God has a "present truth"—a timely message designed to prepare a people for what lies ahead. Understanding this principle transforms how we read Scripture and respond to God's call in our own day.

## Core Truths

### The Foundation: Truth Sanctifies

God's word is the instrument of sanctification: _"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth"_ (John 17:17). This is not mere intellectual agreement with facts, but a transforming power that purifies the soul.

**Sanctification** (definition): The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit, making the believer holy in character and conduct through the truth of God's word (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

Notice the divine progression revealed in Scripture:

1. **Knowledge of truth** — God desires all to attain it (1 Timothy 2:4)
2. **Belief of truth** — "Sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth" (2 Thessalonians 2:13)
3. **Obedience to truth** — "Sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience" (1 Peter 1:2)
4. **Purification through truth** — "Ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit" (1 Peter 1:22)

Truth is not a passive possession but an active power. We do not merely _hold_ truth; truth _holds_ us—and transforms us.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "sanctify" (_hagiazō_) shares the same root as "holy" (_hagios_). To be sanctified is literally to be "made holy"—set apart for sacred use, cleansed from common defilement.

### Worship in Spirit and Truth

_"God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth"_ (John 4:24).

Acceptable worship requires both elements:

- **Spirit** — Sincere heart devotion, empowered by the Holy Spirit
- **Truth** — Accordance with God's revealed will in Scripture

One without the other is incomplete. Emotional fervor without truth becomes superstition. Doctrinal correctness without the Spirit becomes cold formalism. God calls us to both.

### The Value of Truth

_"Buy the truth, and sell it not"_ (Proverbs 23:23).

This striking command treats truth as the most valuable commodity. We should:

- **Buy it** — Pursue it at any cost (time, effort, sacrifice)
- **Never sell it** — Refuse to compromise it for popularity, ease, or worldly advantage

[Q] **"But isn't sincerity enough? If someone is sincere in their beliefs, does the specific content of truth really matter?"**

Sincerity is essential—but insufficient. A man sincerely drinking poison will still die. God desires both sincerity _and_ truth. Jesus said, _"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free"_ (John 8:32). Freedom comes through knowing actual truth, not merely through sincere intentions. This is why God "will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth" (1 Timothy 2:4). He links salvation to truth-knowledge because truth alone has saving power.

## Deeper Truths

### The Principle of "Present Truth"

The apostle Peter speaks of being _"established in the present truth"_ (2 Peter 1:12). This remarkable phrase reveals that while all Scripture is eternally true, certain truths have special urgency for particular times.

**Present truth** (definition): That portion of God's revealed will which has special relevance and testing power for a specific generation, requiring immediate response.

This principle runs throughout Scripture. God does not merely give timeless abstractions—He speaks specific words for specific moments in salvation history.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "present truth" (_parousē alētheia_) in 2 Peter 1:12 literally means "truth that is present" or "truth that has arrived." Peter implies that certain truths become urgent when their time comes—like a letter that arrives demanding immediate attention.

### Historical Examples of Present Truth

#### Noah's Generation (Genesis 6:13-14)

**The message**: _"The end of all flesh is come before Me... Make thee an ark."_

**The response required**: Build the ark by faith, warn others, enter before the flood.

**The result**: _"By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith"_ (Hebrews 11:7).

_"Eight souls were saved by water"_ (1 Peter 3:20).

For 120 years, Noah preached a message that seemed absurd to his contemporaries. No worldwide flood had ever occurred. The warning tested faith—and only eight passed the test.

[ILL] Consider a town built below a great dam. If engineers discover a fatal crack and issue warnings, that warning becomes "present truth" for that moment. Those who heed it and relocate are saved; those who dismiss it as alarmist perish when the dam breaks. It matters nothing that they were sincere, respectable citizens. The warning was truth for _that hour_—and response to it determined destiny.

#### Nineveh (Jonah 3:3-5, 10)

**The message**: _"Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown."_

**The response**: _"The people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast... from the greatest of them even to the least of them."_

**The result**: _"God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that He had said He would do unto them."_

Here is mercy's triumph! Unlike Noah's generation, Nineveh believed the warning. Their repentance was genuine—evidenced by works. And the threatened destruction was averted.

[DYK🔎] Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, Israel's brutal enemy. God sent a Hebrew prophet to save Israel's oppressors! This reveals God's character—He desires the salvation of all, even those we might consider beyond redemption.

#### John the Baptist's Message (John 1:6-7, 23)

**The message**: _"Make straight the way of the Lord"_ — prepare for Messiah's arrival.

**The response divided the nation**:

- Those who received John's baptism _"justified God"_ (Luke 7:29)
- Those who rejected it _"rejected the counsel of God against themselves"_ (Luke 7:30)

John's message was present truth for his generation. Those who rejected it were unprepared for Christ when He came. The Pharisees, who prided themselves on Scripture knowledge, missed the very Messiah those Scriptures foretold.

[Q] **"Why did the religious leaders reject John and Jesus? Weren't they the ones most qualified to recognize truth?"**

Their very confidence became their snare. They said of Jesus, _"We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence He is"_ (John 9:29). They used past revelation to reject present truth. They honored Moses while rejecting the One Moses wrote about (John 5:46). They venerated the prophets their fathers killed while preparing to kill the Prophet of prophets (Matthew 23:30-31).

This pattern is deadly: using _yesterday's truth_ as an excuse to reject _today's message_. Each generation must respond to the light God gives _them_—not merely rest on their ancestors' faith.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Testing Power of Present Truth

Every generation faces its own test. Present truth separates those who truly love God from those who merely follow tradition or convenience.

Consider the pattern:

- **Noah's generation** — tested on the flood warning (most failed)
- **Nineveh** — tested on the overthrow warning (they passed)
- **Israel at Christ's coming** — tested on accepting Messiah (most failed)

The test is always the same in principle: _Will you believe and obey the message God sends for your time?_

_"If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes"_ (Luke 19:41-42).

Jesus wept over Jerusalem because they missed "this thy day"—the specific time of their visitation. God times His messages. Missing the appointed moment has eternal consequences.

[ILL] A farmer must plant in planting season and harvest in harvest season. No amount of sincerity will produce a crop if he plants in December or harvests in April. Spiritual opportunities also have their seasons. _"Seek ye the LORD while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near"_ (Isaiah 55:6). Present truth is truth whose time has come—and which will not wait forever.

### The Connection to Christ's Ministry

In the sanctuary services, the high priest had specific duties for specific times. The daily ministry differed from the Day of Atonement ministry. Each service was valid only in its appointed time.

So it is with God's messages. Each era has its "present truth" corresponding to what Christ is doing in His heavenly ministry:

- **Noah** proclaimed judgment coming—escape through the ark (type of Christ)
- **John** proclaimed Messiah arriving—prepare the heart
- **The apostles** proclaimed Christ crucified and risen—salvation through His sacrifice
- **The Reformation** restored justification by faith—corresponding to Christ's mediation
- **The final generation** must receive the message corresponding to Christ's final work in the Most Holy Place

### Righteousness by Faith and Present Truth

Notice Hebrews 11:7 carefully: Noah _"became heir of the righteousness which is by faith."_ His ark-building was not works-based salvation—it was faith expressing itself in obedience. He believed God's word about what he could not see, and his actions demonstrated his faith.

This is the eternal principle: righteousness comes by faith, and true faith produces obedience. _"Faith without works is dead"_ (James 2:26), but works without faith cannot save. Noah was saved by grace through faith—a faith that worked.

So it will be with those who receive God's final message. They will keep _"the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"_ (Revelation 14:12)—not to earn salvation, but because living faith produces obedient love.

## The Last Generation's Present Truth

### A Message for the Final Hour

_"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?"_ (Matthew 24:44-45).

Christ asks: Who will give "meat in due season"—timely spiritual food for the final generation? This implies that the last days will have their own present truth, appropriate to the crisis.

**Blessed are those found doing this work**: _"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when He cometh shall find so doing"_ (Matthew 24:46).

### The Content of the Final Message

_"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"_ (Revelation 14:12).

This verse follows the three angels' messages (Revelation 14:6-11) and describes the people shaped by those messages. The final present truth produces:

1. **Patience** (_hupomonē_) — steadfast endurance under trial
2. **Commandment-keeping** — full obedience to God's moral law
3. **The faith of Jesus** — the same quality of faith Jesus exercised

[DYK🔎] The phrase "faith of Jesus" (_pistin Iēsou_) can mean both "faith _in_ Jesus" and "the faith _which Jesus had_." Both meanings apply: we trust in Jesus, and we exercise the same trusting relationship with the Father that He demonstrated.

### The Urgency of the Work

_"Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled"_ (Luke 14:23).

The final message is to go everywhere—highways (public places) and hedges (hidden corners). "Compel" (_anagkazō_) means to urgently persuade, to press the invitation. Not force—but earnest, persistent appeal.

Why such urgency? Because present truth has an expiration date. Noah's door closed. Nineveh's forty days ended. Christ's generation passed. The final invitation will also close—and those who delay response may find the door shut.

## Practical Application

### How to Respond to Present Truth

**1. Pursue knowledge of truth eagerly**

- Study Scripture systematically, not superficially
- Ask God to reveal His will: _"Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law"_ (Psalm 119:18)

**2. Believe what God reveals**

- Faith means taking God at His word, even when it seems unreasonable to the world
- Noah had no evidence of floods; he had God's word—and that was enough

**3. Obey promptly and fully**

- Partial obedience is disobedience in disguise
- The Pharisees knew much truth but obeyed selectively—and missed salvation

**4. Never trade truth for comfort or acceptance**

- "Buy the truth, and sell it not"
- Truth will often cost reputation, relationships, or worldly advantage
- But what is gained by losing one's soul? (Mark 8:36)

**5. Share truth urgently with others**

- Present truth is not for hoarding but for proclaiming
- The faithful servant gives "meat in due season"
- Go into highways and hedges with the invitation

### Warning Signs of Rejecting Present Truth

- Trusting past religious experience instead of present light
- Using loyalty to tradition as an excuse to reject new understanding
- Assuming sincerity substitutes for obedience
- Delaying response until a more convenient time
- Dismissing unpopular truth because few accept it

[Q] **"How can I know if something is genuine 'present truth' or just a new idea?"**

Apply these tests:

1. **Scripture test**: Does it align with the whole counsel of Scripture? _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them"_ (Isaiah 8:20).
2. **Fruit test**: Does it produce holiness, love, and obedience—or pride and division?
3. **Christ-centered test**: Does it exalt Jesus and His saving work?
4. **Prophetic test**: Does it fit the prophetic timeline of Scripture?

True present truth will be ancient truth newly urgent—not novel invention, but timely recovery of neglected biblical teaching.

## Appeal

_"Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth."_ (2 Peter 1:12)

We stand in the final hours of earth's history. The messages God sends now are not optional information but urgent, testing truth. Noah's generation heard warnings for 120 years—and only eight were saved. Nineveh believed and was spared. Israel knew the Scriptures but rejected their Messiah.

Which will characterize your response?

God calls you today to:

- **Know** the truth He reveals in His word
- **Believe** it with the faith of Noah
- **Obey** it through the Spirit's power
- **Share** it with those still in darkness

The door of mercy stands open—but it will not remain open forever. _"Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation"_ (2 Corinthians 6:2).

May we each be found among those who receive present truth with gladness, obey it with faithfulness, and share it with urgency—that when Christ returns, He may find us faithful servants, giving meat in due season to a perishing world.
