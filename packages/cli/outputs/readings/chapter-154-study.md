# Bible Study: Gossiping — The Tongue and the Ninth Commandment

## Introduction

The ninth commandment, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" (Exodus 20:16), reaches far beyond the courtroom witness stand. It touches every word we speak about another human being—whether true or false, helpful or harmful. This study reveals how the uncontrolled tongue reflects a deeper heart problem that only Christ can solve, and how victory over this "unruly evil" is possible through yielding ourselves wholly to God.

## Core Truths

### The Commandment's Reach

The ninth commandment forbids more than outright perjury. It guards the sacred ground of human reputation and relationships:

> _"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor."_ (Exodus 20:16)

Every slander, half-truth, exaggeration, and malicious insinuation falls under this divine prohibition. Our neighbor's good name is a sacred trust, and God holds us accountable for how we speak of others.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word translated "false witness" (_sheqer_) means not only outright lies but also deception, emptiness, and disappointment. It covers any speech that misrepresents reality or misleads the hearer about another person's character.

### The Tongue's Terrible Power

James presents a sobering paradox about human speech:

> _"Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be."_ (James 3:10)

The same tongue that praises God on Sabbath morning can wound a brother by Sabbath afternoon. This inconsistency reveals a heart problem that mere self-discipline cannot cure:

> _"The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."_ (James 3:7, 8)

[Q] **"If no man can tame the tongue, are we then helpless? Is victory impossible?"**

Notice carefully: James says "no _man_ can tame" the tongue. Human willpower, education, and self-control are insufficient. But what is impossible with man is possible with God (Luke 18:27). The very impossibility of self-reformation points us to our need of a Savior who can do in us what we cannot do for ourselves.

### The Heart Connection

Jesus reveals the root cause of evil speech:

> _"Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."_ (Matthew 12:34)

Our words are not random accidents—they are the overflow of what fills our hearts. Gossip, slander, and talebearing flow from hearts harboring envy, pride, insecurity, or malice. This is why mere "tongue control" fails; we need heart transformation.

## Deeper Truths

### Talebearing — The Specific Sin

Scripture names a particular form of speech that violates the ninth commandment:

> _"Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am the Lord."_ (Leviticus 19:16)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "talebearer" (_rakil_) comes from a root meaning "to go about" or "to traffic." A talebearer is literally a peddler of information—one who trades in the private affairs of others for social currency.

The talebearer's words inflict real damage:

> _"The words of a talebearer are as wounds."_ (Proverbs 26:22)

The Hebrew here suggests words that go down into the innermost parts of a person. Gossip wounds deeply—often more than physical blows—because it strikes at identity, reputation, and relationships.

### The Destruction of Fellowship

> _"He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends."_ (Proverbs 17:9)

Here is love's contrast to gossip: love covers; gossip repeats. Love protects; gossip exposes. Love builds unity; gossip destroys it.

[ILL] Consider a small spark falling on dry leaves in a forest. Left alone, it grows into a raging fire consuming everything in its path. But remove the fuel, and the fire dies. Solomon writes: _"Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth"_ (Proverbs 26:20). The talebearer is the wood that feeds the fire of strife. Remove the gossip, and conflict has no fuel to burn.

### Words in the Judgment

Jesus places our speech in eternal perspective:

> _"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."_ (Matthew 12:37)

This is not salvation by works of the tongue. Rather, our words reveal the true state of our hearts—justified by faith or still condemned in unbelief. In the investigative judgment now proceeding in heaven's sanctuary, the record of our words testifies to the reality of our profession.

[DYK🔎] The word "idle" in Matthew 12:36 (_argos_ in Greek) literally means "workless" or "useless"—words that accomplish no good purpose. Even careless, thoughtless speech enters the record of judgment.

### God Hears Every Word

> _"For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether."_ (Psalm 139:4)

Nothing escapes divine notice—not the whispered criticism, not the subtle insinuation, not the private conversation shared "in confidence." This reality should produce holy reverence, not fearful bondage, in those who love God.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Character of Satan Reflected

Gossip and slander bear the mark of Satan himself. His very name—_diabolos_ in Greek—means "accuser" or "slanderer." Revelation 12:10 calls him "the accuser of our brethren." When we gossip, we participate in Satan's work of accusation; when we speak words of grace and truth, we reflect Christ's ministry of intercession.

### The Sanctuary and Speech

In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ ministers as our Advocate, pleading His blood for repentant sinners (1 John 2:1; Hebrews 7:25). His ministry is one of defense, not accusation. As we behold Him by faith in His intercessory work, we are transformed into His likeness—becoming advocates rather than accusers, covering rather than exposing, building up rather than tearing down.

### The Law Written in the Heart

The new covenant promise is that God will write His law upon our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). This includes the ninth commandment. When Christ's righteousness is not merely imputed (covering our past sins) but imparted (transforming our present character), even our speech reflects His nature. The law becomes our delight, not our burden.

## Practical Application

### The Path to Victory

Paul shows us the way:

> _"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God."_ (Romans 6:13)

> _"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 7:25)

Victory over the tongue comes through:

1. **Acknowledging our helplessness** — "The tongue can no man tame"
2. **Yielding to God** — surrendering our speech to His control
3. **Thanking God through Christ** — claiming victory by faith, not by effort

[Q] **"But practically, how do I stop gossiping when the temptation comes?"**

The answer lies not in "trying harder" but in "yielding fully." When tempted to speak evil of another:

- **Pause** — remember that God hears every word (Psalm 139:4)
- **Pray** — silently ask Christ to control your tongue
- **Consider** — Is this true? Is it kind? Is it necessary? Does it build up?
- **Cover** — choose love that "covereth a transgression" (Proverbs 17:9)
- **Redirect** — speak a blessing instead of a criticism

### The Beauty of Right Speech

> _"A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver."_ (Proverbs 25:11)

[ILL] Imagine a master craftsman setting golden apples in an ornate silver frame—precious, beautiful, perfectly suited to its setting. Such is a word spoken at the right time, in the right way, for the right purpose. The tongue, surrendered to Christ, becomes an instrument of healing rather than wounding, of unity rather than division.

### Practical Questions to Ask Before Speaking

1. **Is it true?** Not merely technically accurate, but fairly representing the person?
2. **Is it necessary?** Must this information be shared, or is it mere "peddling"?
3. **Is it kind?** Would I say this if the person were present?
4. **Is it building up?** Does it edify the hearer and honor the subject?
5. **Is it surrendered?** Have I asked Christ to guide this conversation?

## Appeal

> _"Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips."_ (Psalm 141:3)

Dear friend, the tongue that no man can tame _can_ be transformed by the indwelling Christ. The heart from which evil speech flows _can_ be cleansed and filled with love. The ninth commandment that seems impossible to keep _can_ become your delight when written upon your heart by the Holy Spirit.

Will you today surrender your tongue—that small member capable of such great destruction—to the One who spoke worlds into existence? Will you invite Christ to guard the door of your lips and fill your heart with His love?

He who began a good work in you will complete it (Philippians 1:6). The same power that created the universe can re-create your speech. Trust Him. Yield to Him. And watch as "apples of gold" begin to replace the "wounds" of a talebearer.

> _"Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer."_ (Psalm 19:14)
