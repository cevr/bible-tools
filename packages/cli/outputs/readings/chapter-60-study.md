# Reading 60: The World's Conversion—A Biblical Reality Check

## Introduction

One of the most comforting yet dangerously misunderstood doctrines in popular Christianity is the idea that the gospel will eventually convert the entire world before Jesus returns. While this hope appeals to our desires for peace and universal harmony, Scripture paints a strikingly different picture of earth's final days. Understanding what the Bible actually teaches about the world's condition at Christ's coming is essential for spiritual preparedness—and for avoiding the deceptive cry of "Peace and safety" that will lull millions into false security.

## Core Truths

### The Days of Noah—A Pattern for the End

Jesus Himself provided the clearest picture of what the world would look like just before His return:

> _"As it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."_ (Luke 17:26-27)

What were those days like? Genesis describes them with sobering clarity:

> _"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually... The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."_ (Genesis 6:5, 11)

Notice carefully: Jesus did not say, "Before I return, the earth will be converted and filled with righteousness." He said it would mirror the days of Noah—a time of:

- **Universal wickedness** (not universal conversion)
- **Moral corruption** pervading every level of society
- **Violence** filling the earth
- **Business as usual**—eating, drinking, marrying—with no thought of coming judgment

[DYK🔎] In Noah's day, only **eight people** out of the entire world's population were saved in the ark (1 Peter 3:20). Jesus' comparison suggests that the proportion of the saved at His coming will similarly be small—a sobering thought for those expecting worldwide revival.

### The Parable of the Wheat and Tares

Christ's parable in Matthew 13 directly addresses whether evil will be eradicated before the end:

> _"The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one... Let both grow together until the harvest... The harvest is the end of the world."_ (Matthew 13:38, 30, 39)

**Key insight**: The wheat (God's people) and the tares (the wicked) grow together in the same field (the world) **until the harvest** (the end of the world). There is no intermediate period when only wheat remains. The separation happens at Christ's coming—not before.

[Q] **"But doesn't the Great Commission promise that the gospel will triumph over all evil?"**

Let us examine what Jesus actually said about worldwide gospel preaching:

> _"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."_ (Matthew 24:14)

Notice the purpose: **"for a witness"**—not "for universal conversion." The gospel goes to all nations so that every person has opportunity to hear and choose. This ensures that God's justice is vindicated and no one perishes without having had a chance to respond. But widespread hearing does not guarantee widespread accepting. The preaching of the gospel serves as a witness both to those who receive it and to those who reject it.

## Deeper Truths

### Paul's Prophetic Portrait of the Last Days

The apostle Paul, writing under inspiration, described the moral climate of earth's final era:

> _"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof."_ (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

**Eighteen characteristics** of last-day society—and not one suggests conversion or moral improvement! Rather, Paul concludes:

> _"Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."_ (2 Timothy 3:13)

**"Worse and worse"**—not "better and better." This is progressive deterioration, not progressive sanctification of society.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "perilous" (chalepos) appears only one other time in the New Testament—to describe the demon-possessed men of Gadara who were "exceeding fierce" (Matthew 8:28). Paul chose a word that communicates extreme danger and violent difficulty.

### The Deception of "Peace and Safety"

One of the most dangerous end-time deceptions involves false expectations of peace:

> _"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:3)

The prophet Joel describes the true international situation:

> _"Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong."_ (Joel 3:9-10)

[ILL] A doctor who tells a dying patient, "You're perfectly healthy—go home and enjoy life," is not showing kindness but criminal negligence. The patient, deceived into thinking all is well, takes no action to address his true condition and dies unprepared. So it is with false teachers who proclaim coming world peace when Scripture announces coming judgment. Their soothing message leads souls to eternal ruin. True physicians of the soul tell the truth—however uncomfortable—that patients might be healed.

Jeremiah confronted the same problem in his day:

> _"They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace."_ (Jeremiah 6:14)

[Q] **"Isn't it negative and defeatist to deny that the world will be converted?"**

Not at all. Consider:

- **It is truthful**—we honor God by believing what He says
- **It is realistic**—it prepares us for the trials ahead
- **It is hopeful**—our hope is not in human reformation but in Christ's return
- **It preserves urgency**—if we expected gradual world improvement, why watch and pray?

The conversion that God promises is not of the world but of His people—a remnant who keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Final Separation

In the earthly sanctuary service, the Day of Atonement was a time of **judgment and separation**, not universal blessing. Those who did not afflict their souls were "cut off" from among the people (Leviticus 23:29). The end of the world corresponds to this final work in the heavenly sanctuary.

Christ, our High Priest, is now engaged in the investigative judgment in heaven's Most Holy Place (Daniel 7:9-10; Revelation 14:6-7). This work results not in world conversion but in the sealing of God's faithful people and the final separation between those who serve God and those who serve Him not (Malachi 3:18).

### The Great Controversy Perspective

Satan's claim has always been that God's law cannot be kept, that His government is arbitrary, and that rebellion is justified. If the entire world were converted before Christ's return, it would actually support Satan's claim that God's law requires favorable circumstances to obey.

Instead, God's plan allows evil to fully ripen (Revelation 14:18-19) while simultaneously perfecting a people who demonstrate that His law **can** be kept—even amid the worst circumstances earth has ever seen. The 144,000, who live through the time of trouble without a Mediator, vindicate God's character before the universe by showing that faith and obedience are possible by His grace even when the whole world lies in wickedness.

### Righteousness by Faith in Perilous Times

The doctrine of righteousness by faith teaches that:

- **Christ's righteousness covers us** (justification)—we need not fear condemnation
- **Christ's righteousness transforms us** (sanctification)—we need not be overcome by prevailing evil
- **Christ's indwelling enables victory**—we can stand when others fall

> _"When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him."_ (Isaiah 59:19)

The Christian's hope is not that the flood of evil will somehow dry up, but that Christ will lift up a standard—His people will overcome by His power regardless of what surrounds them.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for the Believer Today

**1. Anchor your expectations in Scripture, not popular teaching.**

The doctrine of pre-advent world conversion leads to:

- False security (things are getting better)
- Delayed preparation (plenty of time yet)
- Misplaced hope (in human progress rather than Christ's return)

**2. Be awake when others sleep.**

> _"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:4-6)

**3. Let declining conditions lift your heart, not crush your spirit.**

> _"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."_ (Luke 21:28)

[ILL] A woman in the final weeks of pregnancy does not despair when labor pains begin—she knows they signal the arrival of her child. Similarly, the believer who sees the signs of earth's final crisis should not fear but rejoice, for these are birth pangs announcing the coming of Christ and the new world He brings.

**4. Do not fear what the world fears.**

> _"Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread."_ (Isaiah 8:12-13)

The world fears economic collapse, war, climate disaster, political upheaval. The Christian fears only one thing: grieving the Holy Spirit and losing connection with Christ. Everything else is temporary; our relationship with God is eternal.

**5. Work while it is day.**

> _"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work."_ (John 9:4)

If the world will not be converted, souls must be won one by one while opportunity remains. Every person we reach is one more rescued from the coming destruction.

## Appeal

> _"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."_ (Luke 21:36)

Dear friend, the question is not whether the world will be converted, but whether **you** will be. The multitudes around us may continue eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage—oblivious to the approaching storm. But you need not be among them.

Christ invites you today to enter the ark of His salvation. He offers His righteousness to cover your past and His power to transform your present. He promises to keep you through the perilous times ahead—not by removing you from them, but by preserving you through them.

Will you be among those who lift up their heads when these things begin to come to pass, knowing their redemption draws nigh? Or will you be lulled to sleep by the cry of "Peace and safety"?

The choice is yours. The time is now. Jesus is coming soon—not to a converted world, but to a world in rebellion, to gather out a people who love Him more than life itself.

> _"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."_ (Revelation 22:20)
