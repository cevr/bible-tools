# Reading 153: Debts—The Christian's Obligation to Financial Integrity

## Introduction

The Scriptures reveal that God cares deeply about how we handle our financial obligations to others. Far from being merely practical advice, the biblical teaching on debts touches the very character of God and exposes the condition of our hearts. In a world where financial dishonesty has become commonplace, Heaven calls believers to a standard of integrity that reflects the righteousness of Christ.

## Core Truths

### God Requires Prompt Payment to the Poor

The Lord's concern for the vulnerable worker is unmistakable in His law:

> _"Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates: at his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee."_ (Deuteronomy 24:14, 15)

Notice the tender phrase: **"he setteth his heart upon it."** The poor laborer depends on his wages for that day's bread. To withhold payment—even overnight—is not merely inconvenient; it is **sin** in God's eyes.

[DYK🔎] In ancient Israel, day laborers were typically paid at sunset because they needed the money to purchase food for their families that very evening. There were no savings accounts or credit—delay meant hunger.

### Wage Fraud is a Last-Day Sin

The apostle James pronounces solemn judgment upon those who withhold wages:

> _"Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth."_ (James 5:4)

**Lord of Sabaoth** means "Lord of Hosts"—the Commander of heaven's armies. The unpaid wages do not merely sit in ledger books; they **cry out** to the God who commands angelic armies. This is listed among the sins characterizing the last days (James 5:1–6), alongside the hoarding of treasure and living in pleasure.

### The Company of the Unjust

Malachi places those who defraud workers in startling company:

> _"And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages."_ (Malachi 3:5)

The employer who withholds fair wages stands alongside:

- **Sorcerers** (those who deal with occult powers)
- **Adulterers** (those who break marriage covenants)
- **False swearers** (those who lie under oath)

And what becomes of such? _"For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie."_ (Revelation 22:15)

[Q] **"Isn't this harsh? How can withholding wages be compared to sorcery or adultery?"**

All these sins share a common root: **the violation of sacred trust for selfish gain.** The sorcerer trades spiritual integrity for power; the adulterer trades covenant faithfulness for pleasure; the wage-defrauder trades human dignity for money. Each reveals a heart that values self above God and neighbor. The gravity lies not in the external act alone, but in what it reveals about the character.

## Deeper Truths

### The Principle of Full Restitution

Scripture establishes a comprehensive system of responsibility for losses caused to others:

**Through theft or negligence of entrusted goods:**

> _"If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbor's goods."_ (Exodus 22:8)

**Through personal carelessness:**

> _"If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution."_ (Exodus 22:6)

**Through intentional harm:**

> _"If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution."_ (Exodus 22:5)

Notice the graduated principle: for intentional harm, restitution comes from **"the best"** of one's own goods. The more deliberate the wrong, the more complete the restoration required.

[ILL] Consider a child who carelessly breaks his neighbor's window with a ball. A loving parent does not simply apologize and walk away—the child must work to pay for the repair. This is not punishment for punishment's sake, but training in responsibility. So our heavenly Father trains His children: when we cause loss to others, love requires that we make it right, even at personal cost.

### Borrowed Goods and Personal Responsibility

> _"And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good."_ (Exodus 22:14)

**Borrowing creates obligation.** The borrower assumes responsibility for the condition of the borrowed item. If damaged while in our care—regardless of fault—we bear the loss. This principle cuts against the modern tendency to borrow carelessly or return things in worse condition than received.

### The Sin of Usury

> _"Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother, usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury."_ (Deuteronomy 23:19)

**Usury**: Exorbitant or oppressive interest charged on loans, especially to the poor or desperate.

God's law distinguished between legitimate business lending and predatory practices that exploit the needy. The Scriptures consistently condemn those who profit from others' desperation (Psalm 15:5; Ezekiel 18:13).

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for usury (_neshek_) literally means "a bite"—like a serpent's bite that poisons slowly. Usurious interest "bites" into the borrower's substance, consuming their livelihood piece by piece.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Character of God Revealed in Financial Dealings

Why does God care so deeply about wages, debts, and restitution? Because these matters reveal whether His law of love truly dwells in our hearts.

Satan's accusation in the great controversy is that God's law cannot be kept—that it demands the impossible. But when believers, by the grace of Christ, deal honestly in financial matters even at personal cost, they demonstrate that the law of love **can** be lived. Every just wage paid, every debt honored, every restitution made becomes a testimony to the transforming power of the gospel.

### Sanctuary Connection: Cleansing the Heart

In the sanctuary service, the Day of Atonement required Israel to **afflict their souls** and examine their lives (Leviticus 23:27–29). No one could approach that solemn day with unconfessed sin or unrighted wrongs.

We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement. Christ, our High Priest, is cleansing the heavenly sanctuary and preparing a people who will stand before God without spot (Revelation 14:5). This preparation includes:

- **Confessing** our financial sins
- **Making restitution** where we have wronged others
- **Establishing habits** of prompt, honest dealing

The investigative judgment reveals not merely what we believed, but how we lived—including how we treated the poor and whether we paid our debts.

### The Law of Love Summarized

Paul brings the entire subject to its beautiful conclusion:

> _"Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor. Owe no man anything, but to love one another."_ (Romans 13:7, 8)

**"Owe no man anything"**—what comprehensive counsel! Not merely financial debt, but every obligation:

- **Tribute and custom** (taxes and duties)
- **Fear and honor** (respect owed to authorities and elders)
- **Love** (the one debt that can never be fully discharged)

The Christian's goal is to live free from every claim except the perpetual debt of love—which we pay daily yet never exhaust.

## Practical Application

### Examining Our Financial Lives

This study calls us to honest self-examination:

1. **Do I pay promptly?** When services are rendered, do I delay payment unnecessarily? Do employees or contractors wait for what is owed them?

2. **Do I borrow responsibly?** When I borrow, do I treat others' property with greater care than my own? Do I return items in the same or better condition?

3. **Do I make restitution?** Have I caused loss to others through carelessness or wrongdoing? Have I made it right—or merely apologized?

4. **Do I avoid exploiting the needy?** In my business dealings, do I charge fair prices, or do I take advantage of others' desperation?

5. **Do I honor all my debts?** This includes not only money, but respect, gratitude, and recognition owed to others.

### The Debt We Cannot Escape

[ILL] A businessman once boasted that he owed no man anything. A wise friend replied, "You owe every man the debt of love. That debt grows larger with every kindness shown you, and can only be paid by kindness given. You will never be out of debt as long as you live." The businessman was silent, for he realized he had indeed neglected this greatest obligation.

Even our enemies are our debtors—and we are theirs:

> _"If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him."_ (Exodus 23:4, 5)

Love does not calculate whether kindness is deserved. Love simply gives.

## Appeal

> _"Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law."_ (Romans 13:8)

Dear friend, our financial dealings are not separate from our spiritual life—they are a window into our soul. Every unpaid debt, every withheld wage, every careless borrowing testifies either for or against the work of Christ in our hearts.

But here is the glorious truth: **we who were bankrupt in sin have been freely forgiven a debt we could never pay** (Matthew 18:23–35). Christ has paid our account in full. Shall we not, then, deal honestly and generously with those who owe us?

If there are wrongs to be made right, financial or otherwise, let us not delay. The Day of Atonement demands a people without spot—clean in conscience, clear in accounts, owing nothing but love.

Will you commit today to bring your financial life into harmony with God's law? Will you make restitution where needed, pay promptly what is owed, and live as one who knows the full price paid for your own redemption?

Heaven waits for a people who will demonstrate that the law of love can be lived—in the marketplace as well as the sanctuary.
