# Reading 129: Our Words

## Introduction

The tongue, though small, wields enormous power for good or evil. Scripture reveals that our words are not mere breath and sound—they are the overflow of the heart, the index of character, and will stand as evidence in the day of judgment. This study examines what God's Word teaches about speech, why it matters eternally, and how Christ alone can transform our tongues into instruments of blessing.

## Core Truths

### The Stakes Are Higher Than We Realize

The Bible makes a startling claim about human speech:

> _"Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof."_ (Proverbs 18:21)

This is no exaggeration. Our words can:

- **Give life**—encouraging the weary, speaking truth that saves, pointing souls to Christ
- **Deal death**—destroying reputations, crushing spirits, spreading falsehood

Peter connects our speech directly to the quality and length of our days:

> _"For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile."_ (1 Peter 3:10)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "guile" (_dolos_) originally referred to bait used in fishing—something designed to deceive and entrap. Our speech, Peter warns, must be free from all such hidden hooks.

### Words Reveal the Heart

Jesus cuts to the root of the matter:

> _"For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."_ (Matthew 12:34)

Our words are not random. They are symptoms—the visible overflow of what fills our inner being. A bitter spring cannot produce sweet water (James 3:11). This is why external speech correction alone will always fail. The heart itself must be transformed.

**Justification**: God declaring us righteous through Christ's merits (Romans 3:24).
**Sanctification**: God's ongoing work making us holy in character and life, including our speech (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

[Q] **"Can't I simply learn better communication habits?"**

Certainly, habits matter. But Jesus taught that the mouth speaks from the heart's abundance. You may temporarily restrain your tongue, but without a changed heart, the old patterns will resurface under pressure. Only the indwelling Christ can produce lasting transformation: _"A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things"_ (Matthew 12:35). The solution is not primarily behavior modification but heart renovation.

## Deeper Truths

### Categories of Sinful Speech

Paul identifies several classes of speech that grieve the Holy Spirit:

**Corrupt communication**: _"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."_ (Ephesians 4:29)

The word "corrupt" (_sapros_) means rotten, putrid—like spoiled fruit. Such speech pollutes both speaker and hearer.

**Filthiness, foolish talking, and jesting**: _"Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks."_ (Ephesians 5:4)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "jesting" (_eutrapelia_) can mean wit that easily turns—speech that twists situations for a laugh, often at others' expense. Paul contrasts this with thanksgiving, suggesting that gratitude to God is the antidote to careless humor.

**Idle words**: Jesus warned, _"But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."_ (Matthew 12:36)

"Idle" (_argos_) means inactive, useless, accomplishing nothing good. Even our thoughtless chatter will face divine scrutiny.

### The Power of Wholesome Speech

Scripture equally celebrates the positive power of godly words:

> _"A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger."_ (Proverbs 15:1)

> _"A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit."_ (Proverbs 15:4)

[ILL] Consider the difference between a bucket of water and a bucket of gasoline when thrown on a fire. Both take the same effort to throw. But one extinguishes flames while the other causes an explosion. So it is with our words in conflict—soft answers or grievous words require similar breath, yet produce opposite results. Which will you throw today?

> _"There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health."_ (Proverbs 12:18)

Words can wound as deeply as physical violence—or they can bring healing to troubled souls.

### The Test of True Religion

James makes a penetrating observation:

> _"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain."_ (James 1:26)

The word "vain" (_mataios_) means empty, worthless, accomplishing nothing. A profession of faith that does not reach the tongue is self-deception.

Conversely:

> _"If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body."_ (James 3:2)

**Perfect** (_teleios_): Complete, mature, having reached the intended goal. Control of the tongue indicates mastery over the entire person—because if you can control the most difficult member, you can govern all the rest.

[DYK🔎] James uses the image of a horse's bridle (James 3:3) and a ship's rudder (James 3:4) to illustrate how small things control large bodies. The tongue, though tiny, directs the whole course of life.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Speech and the Judgment

Our words carry eternal weight:

> _"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."_ (Matthew 12:37)

This does not mean salvation comes by eloquence. Rather, words reveal character, and character determines destiny. In the investigative judgment now proceeding in heaven's sanctuary, the recording angels have faithfully preserved every word (Ecclesiastes 12:14; Revelation 20:12). Nothing is hidden from God's sight.

[Q] **"This sounds terrifying. How can anyone be saved if every idle word is recorded?"**

The same Jesus who spoke these solemn words also promised, _"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"_ (1 John 1:9). The records in heaven's sanctuary show not only our sins but also our confessions—and beside every confessed sin stands the blood of Christ, our Advocate. The judgment need not terrify those who have fled to Jesus for refuge.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest wore a golden plate on his forehead inscribed "HOLINESS TO THE LORD" (Exodus 28:36). Everything about him—including his words—was to be consecrated to God.

As believers, we are called to be a kingdom of priests (1 Peter 2:9). Our lips, like the altar of incense in the holy place, should send up fragrant offerings of prayer, praise, and edifying speech. When we speak corruptly, we defile the temple of the Holy Spirit and misrepresent the God whose name we bear.

### Truth vs. Falsehood

> _"The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment."_ (Proverbs 12:19)

This contrast echoes the great controversy itself. Satan is "the father of lies" (John 8:44), and his kingdom is built on deception. God is truth (John 14:6), and His kingdom shall endure forever. When we speak truth, we align with heaven; when we lie, we serve the enemy's cause—whatever our profession.

## Practical Application

### The Wisdom of Silence

> _"Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles."_ (Proverbs 21:23)

> _"Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding."_ (Proverbs 17:28)

Sometimes the wisest speech is no speech at all. Before speaking, consider:

- Is it true?
- Is it kind?
- Is it necessary?
- Does it glorify God?

If your words cannot pass these tests, silence is golden.

### The Daily Prayer

David understood his need:

> _"Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer."_ (Psalm 19:14)

Notice that David prays about both words _and_ meditations—because you cannot have pure speech without pure thoughts. He also acknowledges God as his "strength" and "redeemer"—recognizing that only divine power can accomplish this transformation.

[ILL] A polluted well cannot be purified by cleaning the pump handle. You must go to the source. So with our speech: we cannot merely discipline our lips while leaving the heart unchanged. Christ must cleanse the well of the heart, and then pure words will flow naturally.

### Practical Steps Toward Victory

1. **Begin each day with David's prayer** (Psalm 19:14)—inviting God to guard your heart and lips
2. **Confess speech sins immediately**—do not let corrupt words accumulate unconfessed
3. **Replace corrupt speech with thanksgiving** (Ephesians 5:4)—gratitude crowds out criticism
4. **Practice the soft answer**—when provoked, pause and choose words that turn away wrath
5. **Guard your media intake**—what goes into the heart eventually comes out the mouth
6. **Memorize Scripture about speech**—fill the heart's treasury with God's Word

## Appeal

> _"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."_ (Ephesians 4:29)

Friend, your words today will either minister grace or minister poison. They will build up or tear down. They will give life or deal death. And every one of them is recorded in heaven's books.

But take heart—the same Christ who will judge our words also offers to transform our hearts. He who spoke and worlds came into being can speak peace to your restless tongue. He who silenced storms can quiet the tempest of careless speech within you.

Will you surrender your tongue to Him today? Will you make David's prayer your own—asking that your words and your heart's meditations be acceptable in God's sight?

The One who never spoke an idle word, who answered reviling with blessing, who spoke grace to sinners and truth to hypocrites—He offers to live His life through you. In His strength, and only in His strength, you can become a person whose speech is "a tree of life."

_"O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer"_—let this be your cry today, and every day, until that glorious morning when we shall speak with new tongues the praises of Him who saved us.
