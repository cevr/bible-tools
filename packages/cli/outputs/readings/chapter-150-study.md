### Q1. How does God regard the covetous man?

"For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom
the Lord abhorreth." Ps. 10:3.

**Answer:** The Bible uses strong language here, stating that the Lord
"abhorreth" (hates/detests) the covetous. To understand why God regards
covetousness with such severity, we must look at the nature of sin and the
character of God in the Great Controversy.

1.  **The Nature of Covetousness:**
    - **Definition:** Covetousness is an uncontrolled desire to possess what
      belongs to others or to hoard what God has entrusted to us. It is
      Selfishness in its purest form.
    - It is directly opposed to the Tenth Commandment ("Thou shalt not covet,"
      Exodus 20:17).
    - Paul calls it "idolatry" (Colossians 3:5) because it places material gain
      on the throne of the heart where God alone should sit.

2.  **Why God Abhors It:**
    - God is Love (1 John 4:8), and His law is a law of self-sacrificing love.
      His nature is to give. "God so loved... that He gave" (John 3:16).
    - Satan’s principle is "get" and "keep." Covetousness is the very spirit of
      Satan, who desired the throne of God for himself (Isaiah 14:13–14).
    - God abhors covetousness because it hardens the heart, closes the eyes to
      the needs of others, and makes it impossible for the Holy Spirit to dwell
      within. A vessel filled with self has no room for Christ.

3.  **The Cure:**
    - The only remedy for a covetous heart is the "new heart" promised in the
      New Covenant (Ezekiel 36:26).
    - **Sanctification:** The process by which the Spirit of God replaces our
      natural selfishness with the generosity of Christ.

[ILL] **The Monkey and the Jar:** Hunters in some countries catch monkeys by
placing a nut inside a jar with a narrow neck. The monkey reaches in, grabs the
nut, and makes a fist. The fist is too wide to pull back out. Because the monkey
refuses to let go of the prize (covetousness), it remains trapped and is easily
captured. Similarly, holding tightly to worldly gain traps the sinner in Satan’s
snare. To be free, one must let go.

### Q2. What kind of men does God require to occupy responsible positions in His work?

"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God,
men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of
thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens." Ex.
18:21.

**Answer:** In the organization of Israel, God required leaders who possessed
spiritual integrity. This standard remains for the church today.

1.  **Qualifications of Leadership:**
    - **Able men:** Competent and sound in judgment.
    - **Fear God:** Men who live with a sense of God’s presence and coming
      judgment (Ecclesiastes 12:13).
    - **Men of Truth:** Those who love the law of God and engage in no
      deception.
    - **Hating Covetousness:** It is not enough to simply _not_ steal; a leader
      in God's cause must actively _hate_ the spirit of greed.

2.  **Sanctuary Application:**
    - Just as the priests in the earthly sanctuary had to be physically whole
      and ceremonially clean to minister before the Lord (Leviticus 21), those
      who handle the "holy things" of church leadership must be morally clean.
    - A leader driven by financial gain or power cannot represent the humble,
      self-sacrificing High Priest, Jesus Christ, who "washed us from our sins
      in his own blood" (Revelation 1:5).

3.  **Practical Implication:**
    - If a man loves money, his judgment will be warped. He will favor the rich
      and neglect the poor (James 2:1–4). Only the man who hates covetousness
      can administer God's affairs with equity.

### Q3. What warning does the Saviour give against covetousness?

"And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's life
consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth." Luke 12:15.

**Answer:** Jesus strikes at the root of the human delusion that "having more"
equals "being more."

1.  **"Take Heed and Beware":**
    - This double warning suggests a hidden danger. Covetousness is subtle; it
      often disguises itself as "prudence," "preparation for the future," or
      "good business."
    - It is a sin that few people confess, yet it acts as a spiritual poison.

2.  **The Definition of Life:**
    - The world defines life by possessions (houses, lands, bank accounts).
    - **Righteousness by Faith:** Jesus defines life as knowing the only true
      God (John 17:3). Our life is "hid with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3).
    - Possessions are merely tools to be used, not the substance of our
      existence. When we die, the "things" remain here; only the character goes
      with us to the judgment.

[ILL] **The Painting and the Frame:** A man would be foolish to buy a
masterpiece painting and then spend all his time admiring the cheap wooden
frame, ignoring the art. Our physical life and possessions are just the frame;
the "painting" is the image of Christ being restored in the soul. Covetousness
makes us worship the frame and neglect the picture.

### Q4. How did God regard the rich man who laid up his goods for his own ease?

"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of
thee; then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?" Luke 12:20.

**Answer:** This question refers to the Parable of the Rich Fool. The world
likely called this man "successful," "prudent," and "blessed." God called him a
"fool."

1.  **Why was he a fool?**
    - Not because he was rich (Abraham was rich).
    - Not because his ground brought forth plentifully (God sends the rain).
    - He was a fool because he lived as if God did not exist and as if death
      would never come. He used the singular pronouns "I" and "my" repeatedly
      (Luke 12:17–19), showing he suffered from the disease of
      self-centeredness.

2.  **Stewardship vs. Ownership:**
    - **Definition of Stewardship:** Recognizing that God is the Owner of
      everything, and we are managers (stewards) acting on His behalf.
    - This man thought he was the owner. He failed to consult the True Owner on
      how the surplus grain should be used (to feed the poor and advance God's
      work).
    - Because he hoarded the blessings intended to flow through him to others,
      the blessing became a curse.

---

### Q5. What does Christ say of those who do as the man in the parable?

"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God." Luke
12:21.

**Answer:** The parable concludes with a universal application: This is the
destiny of everyone who prioritizes self over God.

1.  **Laying up Treasure for Self:**
    - This is the pursuit of earthly security. It is an attempt to build a
      "heaven" on earth, ignoring the fact that this earth is passing away (1
      John 2:17).

2.  **Rich Toward God:**
    - What does it mean to be "rich toward God"? It means possessing the "gold
      tried in the fire"—faith and love (Revelation 3:18).
    - It means having a record of good works in the books of heaven—not as a
      means of earning salvation (legalism), but as the natural fruit of a
      saving relationship with Christ (Ephesians 2:10).
    - When we give to God's cause and the poor, we are transferring currency
      from earth, where it loses value, to heaven, where it lasts eternally.

---

### Q6. How much can one carry out of the world?

"For we brought nothing into this world, and its is certain we can carry nothing
out." Deut. 8:18. [Note: The text quoted here is 1 Timothy 6:7, though the
source lists Deut. 8:18.]

**Answer:** The reality of death levels all distinctions of wealth.

1.  **The Great Equalizer:**
    - At birth, we bring nothing. At death, we take nothing material.
    - Job understood this when he said, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb,
      and naked shall I return thither" (Job 1:21).

2.  **What REMAINS?**
    - While we cannot carry money out, we _do_ carry our character.
    - **Sanctuary Context:** In the investigative judgment, God does not weigh
      our bank accounts; He weighs our characters against the standard of His
      law.
    - If we have spent our lives gathering "wood, hay, and stubble" (material
      things), they will be burned up. If we have built with "gold, silver, and
      precious stones" (character developed through the grace of Christ), they
      will endure (1 Corinthians 3:12–15).

### Q7. Who gives man power to get wealth?

"But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power
to get wealth." Deut. 8:18.

**Answer:** This verse destroys human pride. We often think, "My power and the
might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth" (Deuteronomy 8:17), but this is a
deception.

1.  **The Source of Ability:**
    - Physical strength, mental clarity, business acumen, and even the breath in
      our lungs are gifts from God (Acts 17:25).
    - If God were to withdraw His sustaining power for one moment, the
      wealthiest man would return to dust.

2.  **The Purpose of Wealth:**
    - God gives this power not for selfish indulgence, but "that he may
      establish his covenant" (Deuteronomy 8:18).
    - Financial blessings are entrusted to us so we may be co-workers with
      Christ in the plan of salvation, supporting the proclamation of the Three
      Angels' Messages to the world.

[ILL] **The Reservoir:** A reservoir that receives water but has no outlet
becomes a stagnant swamp (like the Dead Sea). A reservoir that receives and
dispenses water remains fresh and full of life. God gives us power to get wealth
so we may be channels of blessing, not stagnant pools.

### Q8. What is said concerning those who trust in their riches?

"He that trusteth in his riches shall fall." Prov. 11:28.

**Answer:** Trusting in riches is a spiritual foundation of sand.

1.  **The Fall:**
    - Riches are "uncertain" (1 Timothy 6:17). Markets crash, thieves steal,
      inflation rises.
    - More importantly, riches cannot buy a pardon for sin. In the day of
      judgment, "riches profit not" (Proverbs 11:4).
    - To trust in riches is to reject the Righteousness of Christ. It implies we
      feel self-sufficient ("I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need
      of nothing," Revelation 3:17), which prevents us from seeking the gold of
      faith and the white raiment of Christ's righteousness.

2.  **The Contrast:**
    - The verse continues: "...but the righteous shall flourish as a branch."
    - The righteous trust in Christ, the Vine. Their supply is living and
      eternal, drawing sap from the infinite resources of God.

### Q9. What charge was Timothy required to give the rich?

"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor
trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God." 1 Tim. 6:17.

**Answer:** The Apostle Paul instructs the young pastor Timothy to warn the
wealthy against two specific spiritual dangers: Pride and False Security.

1.  **"High-minded" (Pride):**
    - Wealth often breeds a spirit of superiority. This is dangerous because
      "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble" (James 4:6).
    - A high-minded person feels no need for a Savior. He feels capable of
      managing his own life. This blocks the work of Justification (being
      declared righteous), which requires a broken and contrite spirit.

2.  **"Uncertain Riches":**
    - To trust in money is idolatry.
    - We are to trust in "the living God." Money is a dead god; Jehovah is the
      Living God who provides "all things richly to enjoy."
    - **Experiential Application:** The believer must learn to hold possessions
      loosely, ready to use them for God at a moment's notice, relying on God
      rather than the bank balance for peace of mind.

---

### Q10. What ought they to do with their means?

"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute,
willing to communicate." 1 Tim. 6:18.

**Answer:** This is the antidote to the poison of covetousness.

1.  **"Rich in Good Works":**
    - True wealth is measured by what we _give_, not what we _keep_.
    - **Definition:** "Willing to communicate" here means willing to share or to
      have things in common with others (from the Greek _koinonikos_).

2.  **Righteousness by Faith and Works:**
    - We are not saved _by_ our giving (Ephesians 2:8-9). We are saved _for_
      good works (Ephesians 2:10).
    - A heart that has truly been justified by faith and is being sanctified by
      the Holy Spirit _will_ be generous.
    - Selfishness is the nature of the old man; generosity is the nature of the
      new man in Christ. If there is no giving, there is likely no genuine
      conversion.

---

### Q11. What will they thus do for themselves?

"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come,
that they may lay hold on eternal life." 1 Tim. 6:19.

**Answer:** By using their means for God's glory, they are investing in
eternity.

1.  **A Good Foundation:**
    - This echoes Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount about building on
      the rock (Matthew 7:24).
    - When we obey God in our finances, we prove that our faith is real. We are
      "laying hold" on the reality of the next life.

2.  **Title vs. Fitness for Heaven:**
    - **Justification** (Christ's work _for_ us) gives us the _title_ to heaven.
    - **Sanctification** (Christ's work _in_ us) fits us for heaven.
    - Overcoming selfishness through giving is part of that fitness. A selfish
      person would be miserable in heaven, where the atmosphere is one of
      unselfish love. By learning to give now, we are adapting to the climate of
      heaven.

### Q12. By giving of one's substance to the Lord's work, what does he thus do?

"Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine
increase." Prov. 3:9.

**Answer:** Giving is an act of worship. It is a way of honoring God's
sovereignty.

1.  **"Honor the Lord":**
    - We acknowledge that He is the Great Provider.
    - By returning the tithe and giving offerings, we practically declare, "God,
      you are the owner of all I have."

2.  **"Firstfruits":**
    - **Sanctuary Type:** In the ancient harvest laws, the first sheaf of grain
      was brought to the priest and waved before the Lord (Leviticus 23:10–11).
      This consecrated the entire harvest.
    - **Practical Application:** We should not give God the leftovers after we
      have paid our bills and satisfied our luxuries. God demands the _first_
      portion. This requires faith—trusting that the remaining nine-tenths with
      God's blessing will go further than ten-tenths without it.

---

### Q13. How does the Lord look upon the spirit of giving to the cause?

"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye have
showed toward His name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do
minister." Heb. 6:10.

**Answer:** God takes personal notice of every sacrifice made for His kingdom.

1.  **"Labor of Love":**
    - God values the _motive_ more than the _amount_. A "labor of love" is
      service motivated by gratitude for Christ's atoning sacrifice.
    - Legalistic giving ("I give so God will bless me") is a trade, not an
      offering. Gospel giving ("I give because God has blessed me") is worship.

2.  **God Remembers:**
    - **The Book of Remembrance:** Malachi 3:16 speaks of a book written for
      those who fear the Lord. Every act of kindness, every dollar given in
      secret, is recorded in heaven.
    - In the investigative judgment, these deeds stand as evidence of the Holy
      Spirit's work in the believer's life (Matthew 25:34–40).

---

### Q14. If a person has but little of this world's goods, is he not excused from giving?

"Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy
God which He hath given thee." Deut. 16:17.

**Answer:** No one is excused from the privilege of giving, for no one is
without some blessing from God.

1.  **"As He is Able":**
    - God's plan is equitable. He does not demand a fixed amount from everyone,
      but a fixed _proportion_ (tithe) and free-will offerings based on ability.
    - The poor man's small offering is as necessary to his spiritual growth as
      the rich man's large offering. If the poor do not give, they are denied
      the blessing of overcoming selfishness.

2.  **Systematic Benevolence:**
    - Paul instructed the Corinthians: "Upon the first day of the week let every
      one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him" (1 Corinthians
      16:2).
    - This habit keeps the heart open and the conscience clear.

---

### Q15. Then can it be the amount a man gives that is so acceptable to God?

"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man
hath, and not according to that he hath not." 2 Cor. 8:12.

**Answer:** God weighs the gift by the love and sacrifice behind it, not by its
market value.

1.  **The Willing Mind:**
    - God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).
    - If a man desires to give thousands but only has a dollar, and gives that
      dollar with a heart full of love, God records the sacrifice as if it were
      the larger amount.

2.  **The Widow's Mite:**
    - Jesus watched the treasury (Mark 12:41–44). The rich cast in much, but the
      widow cast in two mites (a fraction of a cent).
    - Jesus said she cast in "more than they all." Why? because she gave "all
      that she had."
    - **RBF Principle:** Total surrender. The widow gave her whole living, just
      as we must surrender our whole life to Christ. The rich gave a portion,
      but kept their lives for themselves.

[ILL] **The Child's Gift:** If a small child draws a picture for his father, it
may be just scribbles on a scrap of paper. To an art dealer, it is worthless. To
the father, it is priceless because it represents the child's whole heart and
ability. So it is with our offerings to God.

### Q16. What does one provide for himself who gives freely to the cause of God?

"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a
treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither
moth corrupteth." Luke 12:33.

**Answer:** Christ invites us to transfer our assets to a bank that can never
fail.

1.  **"Bags which wax not old":**
    - Earthly purses wear out; investments fail; currency devalues.
    - Heavenly treasure is imperishable.

2.  **Sanctuary Connection:**
    - Christ is currently ministering in the heavenly sanctuary. If we are His
      people, our interests should be centered where He is.
    - By supporting the spread of the Gospel, we are helping to populate heaven.
      Souls won to Christ through our means are the "treasure" that will greet
      us in the Kingdom.

---

### Q17. If one's treasure has been transferred to heaven by giving to God's cause, where will his heart be?

"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." Luke 12:34.

**Answer:** This is a spiritual law of gravity: The heart follows the treasure.

1.  **The Mechanism of the Heart:**
    - If we invest our money in worldly stocks, we eagerly check the stock
      market news. Our mind is there.
    - If we invest our money in the Lord's work (missions, the poor, the
      church), our interest follows. We will pray for the work; we will care
      about the progress of the gospel.
    - Giving is therefore a method God uses to draw our affections away from
      this dark world and anchor them in heaven (Colossians 3:1–2).

2.  **Conclusion:**
    - We cannot serve God and mammon (Luke 16:13).
    - To overcome the world and its covetousness, we must look to Jesus, the
      Author and Finisher of our faith. As we behold His infinite sacrifice on
      the cross, our hearts are melted, selfishness is broken, and we respond by
      giving our all to Him who gave His all for us. This is the path of
      victory.
