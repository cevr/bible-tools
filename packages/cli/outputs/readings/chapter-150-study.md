# Bible Study: Free-Will Offerings

## Introduction

The subject of giving reveals the true condition of the heart. Throughout Scripture, God connects our relationship with material possessions to our spiritual standing with Him. This study examines how the Lord views covetousness, the proper use of wealth, and the eternal principles governing Christian stewardship—ultimately showing that giving is not a burden but a pathway to lasting treasure and a transformed heart.

## Core Truths

### God's View of Covetousness

The Scriptures declare plainly that covetousness is abhorrent to God:

> _"For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth."_ (Psalm 10:3)

**Covetousness**: An inordinate desire for what belongs to others or an excessive love of possessing wealth (Exodus 20:17; Colossians 3:5).

This is no minor character flaw. Paul equates covetousness with idolatry (Colossians 3:5), for it places material things in the place that belongs to God alone. The covetous man's heart is divided—he cannot serve God and mammon (Matthew 6:24).

When God gave instruction for choosing leaders among His people, freedom from covetousness was essential:

> _"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers."_ (Exodus 18:21)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "covetousness" (_betsa_) literally means "unjust gain" or "cutting off" a piece for oneself—suggesting that covetousness always involves taking what rightfully belongs elsewhere, whether to God or to others.

### Christ's Solemn Warning

Jesus Himself spoke directly against covetousness:

> _"Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."_ (Luke 12:15)

Notice the double warning: "Take heed" and "beware." This is no casual caution. Christ knew that the love of possessions would be one of Satan's most effective snares to capture souls.

The parable of the rich fool illustrates the danger:

> _"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?"_ (Luke 12:20)

> _"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."_ (Luke 12:21)

[ILL] Consider a man who spends his entire life filling a house with beautiful furniture, fine paintings, and costly treasures. He bars the windows, locks the doors, and refuses all visitors—hoarding his collection for himself alone. When death comes, strangers auction his belongings, and none remember him with affection. He lived for things, and things cannot weep at a funeral. So it is with those who lay up treasure for themselves and are not rich toward God. Their investments perish with them; only what is given in love to God and humanity endures.

## Deeper Truths

### The Source and Stewardship of Wealth

Scripture reminds us of a fundamental truth often forgotten:

> _"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."_ (1 Timothy 6:7)

> _"But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth."_ (Deuteronomy 8:18)

Every ability to earn, every opportunity to prosper, every resource we possess comes from God. We are not owners but stewards—managers of that which belongs to Another.

[Q] **"But haven't I worked hard for what I have? Isn't my wealth the result of my own effort?"**

Scripture does not deny human labor or effort. Yet it reminds us that the strength to work, the intelligence to plan, and the opportunities to succeed all flow from God's providence. The danger lies not in possessing wealth but in forgetting its Source and trusting in it rather than in the living God.

> _"He that trusteth in his riches shall fall."_ (Proverbs 11:28)

> _"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God."_ (1 Timothy 6:17)

**Riches are called "uncertain"** because they can vanish overnight. Markets crash, thieves break in, inflation erodes savings, and death separates us from all possessions. Only what is invested in eternity remains secure.

### The Privilege of Giving

What should the wealthy—and indeed all believers—do with their means?

> _"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate."_ (1 Timothy 6:18)

**Willing to communicate**: This phrase means willing to share generously, to participate with others in meeting needs (the Greek _koinōnikous_ suggests fellowship through sharing).

And what is the result?

> _"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."_ (1 Timothy 6:19)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "laying up in store" uses the same Greek word family (_apothēsaurizontas_) as "laying up treasure" (Matthew 6:20). Jesus and Paul both teach that giving to God's cause is not losing wealth but transferring it to an incorruptible account.

### Honoring God with Our Substance

> _"Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase."_ (Proverbs 3:9)

**Firstfruits**: The first and best portion, given to God before personal use. This principle acknowledges God's priority and ownership.

When we give to God's work, we honor Him—we acknowledge His sovereignty, trust His promises, and participate in His mission.

> _"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward His name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister."_ (Hebrews 6:10)

God remembers every sacrifice made in love for His cause. Nothing given to Him is ever lost or forgotten.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Giving According to Ability

[Q] **"But I have so little. What difference could my small offering make?"**

Scripture never measures acceptable giving by the amount:

> _"Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which He hath given thee."_ (Deuteronomy 16:17)

> _"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not."_ (2 Corinthians 8:12)

**The principle is clear**: God looks first at the heart, then at the hand. A poor widow's two mites, given in love and sacrifice, outweighed the large gifts of the wealthy (Mark 12:41–44). What makes an offering acceptable is not its size but its spirit.

### Treasure in Heaven

Christ invites His followers to transfer their investments to an incorruptible realm:

> _"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth."_ (Luke 12:33)

> _"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."_ (Luke 12:34)

Here is a profound spiritual law: **Our hearts follow our treasure.** If we invest in earthly things, our affections become earthly. If we invest in heaven's work, our hearts become heavenly.

[ILL] A farmer has two fields. One is in a valley subject to floods; the other is on high ground, safe from every storm. If he is wise, he will sow his seed in the secure field. So it is with our treasure. We may invest in this world's system—subject to loss, decay, and destruction—or we may invest in heaven, where neither moth nor rust nor thief can touch it. The question is not whether we can afford to give, but whether we can afford not to.

### Giving and the Sanctuary

In the sanctuary service, free-will offerings were distinct from required tithes and sacrifices. They expressed gratitude, love, and voluntary devotion beyond obligation (Leviticus 7:16; Deuteronomy 12:6). These offerings were used for the tabernacle's construction, its ongoing maintenance, and care for the priests and Levites.

In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ presents not only His own blood but the prayers and offerings of His people before the Father (Revelation 8:3–4). Our giving becomes part of heaven's ministry—resources consecrated to God's work on earth, presented before the throne as a sweet savor.

When Israel withheld their offerings, the sanctuary work suffered, and God's purposes were hindered (Malachi 3:8–10). When they gave willingly and abundantly, the work prospered, and they themselves were blessed.

### The Heart of the Matter

The great controversy between Christ and Satan is fought in the human heart over the question: **Whom will we trust? Whom will we serve?**

Covetousness is Satan's way of binding the soul to earth. It keeps men anxious, fearful, and dependent on uncertain riches. It hardens the heart against the needs of others and the call of God's cause.

Giving, by contrast, is an act of faith. It declares that we trust God more than gold, that we value eternal things above temporal, and that we have chosen to invest where our heart may safely follow.

## Practical Application

This truth calls us to:

1. **Examine our hearts**: Is there covetousness—a secret love of money or possessions that competes with love for God? Christ's call to "beware" is personal.

2. **Recognize God's ownership**: Every resource we have comes from Him. We are stewards, not owners. This changes how we view "our" money and possessions.

3. **Give according to our ability**: Whether much or little, we are to give as God has prospered us, with a willing heart. The spirit matters more than the sum.

4. **Transfer our treasure**: By giving to God's cause, we move our investments from perishable to permanent accounts. Our hearts will follow our treasure.

5. **Trust in the living God**: Riches are uncertain, but God never fails. Our security is not in what we possess but in Whom we trust.

## Appeal

> _"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."_ (Luke 12:34)

Dear friend, where is your treasure today? If you have laid it up on earth, your heart is earthbound, subject to anxiety and loss. But if you will, by faith, transfer your treasure to heaven through loving gifts to God's work, you will find your heart lifted, your spirit freed, and your future secured.

This is not a burden but a blessed privilege. God does not need our money—He owns the cattle on a thousand hills (Psalm 50:10–12). But He invites us to participate in His work, that we might share in His joy and receive a "good foundation against the time to come."

Will you honor the Lord with your substance? Will you be rich toward God? The choice is before you. May the Holy Spirit give you grace to invest where neither moth nor rust corrupts, and where your heart may safely dwell forever.
