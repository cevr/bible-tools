# Reading 72: Moral Obligation in the Patriarchal Age

**God's law did not begin at Sinai — it existed from eternity, and all humanity has always been accountable to it.**

---

## Sin Before Sinai: The Cosmic Origin

- **Sin began in heaven** — with Satan himself
  - "He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the beginning" (1 John 3:8)
  - "beginning" = before earth existed
  - [→] if Satan sinned, a standard existed to violate

- **Angels transgressed** before mankind
  - "God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment" (2 Peter 2:4)
  - sin → judgment; law preceded both

- **Paul's principle** — no law = no transgression
  - "Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression" (Rom 4:15)
  - [→] sin existed → therefore law existed

[DYK🔎] Greek "hamartia" (sin) = to miss the mark — implies a standard (mark) to miss. No target, no miss.

[Q] **Wasn't the law given at Sinai?**
→ Sinai = formal codification for Israel, not creation of the law
→ God's character (love) never changes — His law reflects His character (Mal 3:6; James 1:17)

[TANGENT] Lucifer's original sin — pride, self-exaltation (Isa 14:12-14; Eze 28:15-17); the great controversy begins

---

## Cain and Abel: Law in the First Family

- **First murder** — Cain slew Abel
  - "And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him" (Gen 4:8)

- **Root cause** — works, not just action
  - "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous" (1 John 3:12)
  - evil works vs. righteous works — a moral standard distinguished them

- **God held Cain accountable**
  - "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door" (Gen 4:7)
  - "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground... now art thou cursed from the earth" (Gen 4:10-11)
  - [→] Cain knew right from wrong; God expected obedience

[ILL] Parent warns child before crossing street: "Look both ways."
Child disobeys, nearly hit. "But you didn't write it on paper!"
→ Spoken or unwritten, the rule existed. Ignorance no excuse.

[Q] **How did Cain know murder was wrong?**
→ Adam walked with God; divine instruction passed to children
→ Conscience + direct revelation = moral knowledge (Rom 2:14-15)

---

## The Flood: Worldwide Judgment for Lawbreaking

- **Earth's condition** — corruption and violence
  - "The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence" (Gen 6:11)
  - corruption = moral decay; violence = transgression of "thou shalt not kill"

- **God's response** — destruction
  - "And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth" (Gen 6:13)
  - [→] universal judgment implies universal moral standard

- **Noah's role** — preacher of righteousness
  - "And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness" (2 Peter 2:5)
  - righteousness = right doing; Noah proclaimed God's standard

[DYK🔎] Noah preached 120 years (Gen 6:3) — God gave ample warning before judgment. Mercy precedes wrath.

[→] God judged the antediluvian world by a law — same law that still exists

---

## Sodom: Unlawful Deeds Before Moses

- **Sodom's wickedness** — exceedingly sinful
  - "The men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly" (Gen 13:13)
  - "We will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord" (Gen 19:13)

- **The standard of judgment** — "unlawful deeds"
  - "And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked; for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds" (2 Peter 2:7-8)
  - **athesmos** (unlawful) = contrary to law
  - [→] law existed; Sodom broke it; God destroyed them

[Q] **What law did Sodom violate?**
→ Sexual immorality, violence, pride, neglect of poor (Eze 16:49-50)
→ Same principles later codified in Ten Commandments

[ILL] Fire inspector condemns building: "Violated code."
Owner: "What code? We built before regulations!"
Inspector: "Fire burns the same, code or no code."
→ God's moral principles are built into reality itself.

---

## Joseph: Conscience Guided by Divine Law

- **Temptation resisted** — Joseph fled Potiphar's wife
  - "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" (Gen 39:9)

- **Key insight** — Joseph called adultery:
  - "great wickedness"
  - "sin against God"
  - [→] he knew the seventh commandment principle — 400 years before Sinai

[DYK🔎] Joseph was sold into Egypt ~1728 BC; Sinai ~1491 BC — yet he knew adultery was sin against God.

[→] The patriarchs possessed moral knowledge consistent with the Decalogue

---

## The Amorites: Iniquity Measured Over Centuries

- **God's timing** — iniquity accumulating
  - "But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full" (Gen 15:16)
  - God measured their sin over 400 years — implies a fixed standard

- **Specific sin** — idolatry
  - "And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel" (1 Kings 21:26)
  - [→] first and second commandment principles violated

- **Canaanite nations judged** — by known moral standard
  - "Ye shall therefore keep all My statutes, and all My judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you; for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them" (Lev 20:22-23)
  - same sins = same judgment; the standard is consistent

[Q] **Is it just to judge people by a law they didn't formally receive?**
→ "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these... shew the work of the law written in their hearts" (Rom 2:14-15)
→ Conscience testifies; creation reveals God (Rom 1:19-20); all are accountable

---

## Abraham: Obedience Before Sinai

- **God's commendation** — Abraham kept the law
  - "Because that Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws" (Gen 26:5)
  - commandments, statutes, laws — comprehensive obedience
  - [→] these existed for Abraham to keep

- **Abraham's faith** — inseparable from obedience
  - "By faith Abraham, when he was called... obeyed" (Heb 11:8)
  - faith without works is dead (James 2:17-21)

[DYK🔎] Hebrew terms in Gen 26:5: "mitzvot" (commandments), "chuqqot" (statutes), "torot" (laws) — same vocabulary used for Sinai legislation.

---

## Abraham's Children: The Test of Genuine Faith

- **True children do Abraham's works**
  - "Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham" (John 8:39)
  - works = obedience flowing from faith

- **Who are Abraham's seed?**
  - "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (Gal 3:29)
  - belonging to Christ = belonging to Abraham's family
  - [→] same faith, same obedience, same law

[ILL] Family resemblance — you know a man's children by their likeness.
Abraham believed God and obeyed. His true children do the same.
→ Faith produces obedience; obedience proves faith genuine.

## The Eternal Nature of God's Law

- **Summary**: Every patriarchal example proves the law existed before Sinai:
  - **Satan and angels** — sinned before creation
  - **Cain** — judged for murder
  - **Flood generation** — destroyed for violence and corruption
  - **Sodom** — burned for unlawful deeds
  - **Joseph** — knew adultery was sin against God
  - **Amorites** — iniquity measured for centuries
  - **Abraham** — kept God's commandments, statutes, and laws

- **Sinai's purpose** — not creation, but codification
  - Israel needed written law after 430 years in pagan Egypt
  - "Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions" (Gal 3:19)
  - "added" = made explicit, not invented

- **God's character** — unchanging
  - "For I am the Lord, I change not" (Mal 3:6)
  - His law reflects His character; eternal as He is eternal

[TANGENT] Sabbath in Eden (Gen 2:1-3) — moral law existed from creation week; the fourth commandment predates Sinai by millennia

---

## Sanctuary Connection

- **Ark of the covenant** — law at center of worship
  - Ten Commandments placed in Most Holy Place (Exo 25:16)
  - law = foundation of God's throne (Ps 89:14)
  - [→] heavenly sanctuary contains the original (Rev 11:19)

- **Christ's ministry** — vindicates the law
  - "Think not that I am come to destroy the law... I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil" (Matt 5:17)
  - His blood covers transgression; His Spirit writes law on hearts (Heb 8:10)

---

## Appeal

- **The law is eternal** — not a temporary Jewish code
- **You are accountable** — conscience and Scripture both witness
- **Christ offers righteousness** — imputed and imparted
  - "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth" (Rom 10:4)
  - "end" (telos) = goal, purpose — not abolition

Will you, like Abraham, believe God and walk in obedience?
Will you, like Joseph, refuse sin because it offends your God?

_"If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."_ (Gal 3:29)
