# Reading 72: Moral Obligation in the Patriarchal Age

## Introduction

A common assumption holds that God's moral law was first given at Mount Sinai, and that people before Moses lived without clear moral obligation. This study examines the biblical evidence that God's eternal law of righteousness governed mankind from the very beginning—long before Sinai's thunders—and that sin, judgment, and righteousness were understood realities throughout the patriarchal age.

## Core Truths

### Sin Existed From the Beginning

The apostle John traces sin's origin to the very dawn of the conflict:

> _"He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the beginning."_ (1 John 3:8)

Satan's rebellion in heaven was the first sin—and it was recognized as sin because it violated God's eternal moral law. Peter confirms that angels also transgressed:

> _"God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."_ (2 Peter 2:4)

**The angels sinned before any law was given to mankind.** This demonstrates that God's moral law is eternal, existing before the creation of this earth.

[DYK🔎] The word "sin" in 1 John 3:8 comes from the Greek _hamartia_, meaning "to miss the mark"—implying a standard that existed to be missed. Sin is always measured against God's unchanging law of love.

### Where No Law Is, There Is No Transgression

Paul states a fundamental principle:

> _"Where no law is, there is no transgression."_ (Romans 4:15)

This is not merely a philosophical statement—it is a divine axiom. **If there can be no sin without law, and sin clearly existed before Sinai, then the law must also have existed before Sinai.**

Consider the implications:

- Cain sinned by murdering Abel (Genesis 4:8)
- The antediluvians filled the earth with violence (Genesis 6:11)
- Sodom was destroyed for wickedness (Genesis 13:13; 19:13)
- The Amorites were judged for iniquity and idolatry (Genesis 15:16)

**Every one of these judgments preceded Mount Sinai.** God held these people accountable—which means they had a law to which they were accountable.

## Deeper Truths

### The Case of Cain: God's Law in Eden

The first recorded murder provides clear evidence of moral law in the earliest age:

> _"And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."_ (Genesis 4:8)

John reveals the spiritual reality behind this act:

> _"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."_ (1 John 3:12)

Notice carefully—before the murder, God warned Cain:

> _"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door."_ (Genesis 4:7)

God spoke of "sin" as a known reality—a crouching beast at Cain's door. This was not a new concept being introduced, but an appeal to a standard Cain already understood. After the murder, God pronounced judgment:

> _"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground... now art thou cursed from the earth."_ (Genesis 4:10-11)

[Q] **"But how could Cain know murder was wrong if the Ten Commandments weren't given until Sinai?"**

The commandments at Sinai were not the _creation_ of God's law—they were the _codification_ of principles that had always existed. The law "Thou shalt not kill" reflects the eternal character of God, who is life and love. Adam and Eve had walked with God in Eden; they knew His character. This knowledge was transmitted to their children. Cain knew precisely what he was doing—hence God's direct rebuke and punishment.

### The Antediluvian World: Judgment for Lawlessness

The generation destroyed by the flood was held accountable to a clear moral standard:

> _"The earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence."_ (Genesis 6:11)

> _"And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."_ (Genesis 6:13)

God destroyed an entire world for their wickedness. Would a just God destroy billions of people for violating a standard they did not know existed?

Yet in the midst of this darkness, one man stood apart:

> _"And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness."_ (2 Peter 2:5)

[DYK🔎] Noah is called "a preacher of righteousness"—from the Greek _dikaiosunē_, meaning conformity to God's standard. Noah preached _righteousness_ for 120 years before the flood. Righteousness implies a standard of right—the very definition of law.

[ILL] Imagine a man hauled before a judge for a crime, who protests, "But I never knew there was a law against this!" The judge replies, "You are condemned because you violated the law." "What law?" asks the man. "The one I'm about to write tomorrow," says the judge. Such "justice" would be monstrous. Yet some would have us believe that God destroyed an entire world, and condemned Cain, and overthrew Sodom—all for violating laws that did not yet exist! The God of heaven is not such a judge. His law is eternal, and mankind has always been accountable to it.

### Sodom: Wickedness Measured by Law

The destruction of Sodom provides further evidence:

> _"The men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly."_ (Genesis 13:13)

> _"We will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD."_ (Genesis 19:13)

Peter describes the standard by which Sodom was measured:

> _"And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked; for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds."_ (2 Peter 2:7-8)

Notice the word: **unlawful**. Peter, writing under inspiration, calls the deeds of Sodom "unlawful" (_athesmos_ in Greek—"contrary to law"). Their actions violated a recognized moral standard. Lot is called "just" and "righteous"—terms that have no meaning apart from a law that defines justice and righteousness.

### Joseph: Conscience Bound by God's Law

When Potiphar's wife tempted Joseph, his response reveals a heart that understood God's moral requirements:

> _"How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"_ (Genesis 39:9)

Joseph recognized that adultery was:

1. **Wickedness**—morally wrong
2. **Sin**—transgression of God's law
3. **Against God**—a violation of the Creator's standard

This was centuries before Sinai. Yet Joseph knew precisely what constituted sin, and his conscience was bound by God's law.

### The Amorites: Iniquity and Judgment

God told Abraham that his descendants would not possess Canaan for four hundred years:

> _"But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full."_ (Genesis 15:16)

God was measuring the Amorites' wickedness against a known standard. Their particular sin is later identified:

> _"And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel."_ (1 Kings 21:26)

**Idolatry**—the violation of the first two commandments—was their chief offense. God further explains:

> _"Ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you; for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them."_ (Leviticus 20:22-23)

The Canaanite nations were judged for moral violations that the Ten Commandments would later codify. They were held accountable because the law existed in principle, even before it was written on stone.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Eternal Law and the Character of God

God's moral law is not an arbitrary set of rules imposed upon creation—it is the transcript of His eternal character. Love, truth, purity, faithfulness, reverence—these attributes of God are expressed in the Ten Commandments.

This law existed before:

- The creation of angels
- The creation of this world
- The rebellion of Satan
- The fall of Adam

Satan's original accusation was that God's law was unjust, impossible to keep, and unnecessary. The great controversy has always centered on the validity and permanence of God's law.

[DYK🔎] Ellen White writes: "The law of God existed before the creation of man or else Adam could not have sinned... The principles of the law were made more explicit that man in his fallen condition might better comprehend them" (_Signs of the Times_, March 14, 1878). Sinai was not the origin of the law—it was God's merciful clarification of eternal principles to a fallen race.

### Abraham: The Pattern of Faith and Obedience

God's testimony concerning Abraham reveals the relationship between faith and law:

> _"Because that Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws."_ (Genesis 26:5)

Notice the terminology: **commandments, statutes, laws**. This is legal language describing moral obligation. Abraham lived approximately 430 years before Sinai—yet he kept God's commandments.

How did Abraham obtain righteousness? Not by his own works, but by faith:

> _"And he believed in the LORD; and He counted it to him for righteousness."_ (Genesis 15:6)

Yet this faith-righteousness produced obedience to God's law. This is the pattern for all of Abraham's spiritual children.

### The True Children of Abraham

Jesus made clear who Abraham's real descendants are:

> _"If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham."_ (John 8:39)

And Paul defines this spiritual lineage:

> _"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."_ (Galatians 3:29)

The children of Abraham are those who:

1. **Believe** as Abraham believed—trusting wholly in God's promises
2. **Obey** as Abraham obeyed—keeping God's commandments through faith

This is righteousness by faith in its fullness: justification by faith alone, producing sanctification that keeps God's law from a transformed heart.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for Us Today

1. **God's moral law is eternal and unchanging.** It did not begin at Sinai and will not end. We are accountable to the same standard that governed Adam, Abraham, and the apostles.

2. **Sin is still transgression of God's law.** We cannot redefine sin by cultural standards or personal preference. "Sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4)—and this definition has never changed.

3. **Righteousness still comes by faith, producing obedience.** We cannot earn salvation by keeping the law, but genuine faith will always produce law-keeping as its fruit. "Faith which worketh by love" (Galatians 5:6) is the same faith Abraham possessed.

4. **We are accountable for what we know.** The patriarchs were judged by the light they had. We, with the full revelation of Scripture and the example of Christ, bear even greater responsibility.

5. **Christ alone can write the law in our hearts.** Under the new covenant, God promises: "I will put My laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). This is the work of sanctification—Christ living out His righteous life within the believer.

[Q] **"If the patriarchs had the law, why was Sinai necessary?"**

Sin had so darkened the human mind that the race was losing sight of God's requirements. The four hundred years in Egypt had particularly corrupted Israel's understanding. Sinai was God's gracious act of clarification—putting His eternal principles in clear, codified form. The law written on stone was not new in content, but new in form—a permanent reminder of eternal truths.

## Appeal

> _"Because that Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws."_ (Genesis 26:5)

> _"If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."_ (Galatians 3:29)

Friend, the same God who walked with Abraham, who sustained Noah, who delivered Joseph—this God calls you today to be His faithful child. His law has not changed. His grace has not diminished. His power to transform hearts is as mighty now as it was in Eden.

Will you, like Abraham, believe God's promises and walk in obedience to His eternal law? Will you, like Joseph, refuse to sin against God even when temptation presses hard? Will you, like Noah, be a preacher of righteousness in a corrupt generation?

The true children of Abraham are those who share his faith—a faith that trusts God completely and obeys Him fully. By the indwelling power of Christ, you can be counted among that blessed company. "This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous" (1 John 5:3).
