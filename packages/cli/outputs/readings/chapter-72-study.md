# Moral Obligation in the Patriarchal Age

## Introduction

A question of profound importance confronts every student of Scripture: Did God hold men accountable to His moral law before the formal giving of the Ten Commandments at Sinai? Some have supposed that the law of God began with Moses, and that the patriarchs—Adam, Noah, Abraham, and others—lived in an age of moral freedom without divine commandments. This study will demonstrate from Scripture that God's moral law has always existed, that sin has always been the transgression of that law, and that men in every age have been called to obedience through faith in the coming Redeemer. The principles we uncover bear directly upon our own standing before God and our understanding of righteousness by faith.

## Core Truths

### Sin Has Existed from the Beginning

The apostle John declares plainly: "He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the beginning" (1 John 3:8). Here we learn that sin did not originate with humanity, nor at Sinai, but "from the beginning"—with Satan himself. The very existence of sin presupposes a standard against which it is measured.

**Sin defined:** Sin is the transgression of God's law (1 John 3:4). It is not merely a failure to reach an ideal, but a rebellion against the expressed will of God. Wherever sin exists, law must also exist; for "where no law is, there is no transgression" (Romans 4:15).

Thus, if the Devil sinned "from the beginning," then God's law existed from the beginning. The angels who joined Satan in rebellion were cast down and reserved for judgment (2 Peter 2:4). Heaven itself was governed by moral law, and the fall of Satan was its violation.

### The Law Preceded Sinai

The logic of Scripture is clear:

- Sin existed before Sinai (Genesis 4:7; 6:5; 13:13).
- Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4).
- Therefore, law existed before Sinai.

Paul confirms: "Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression" (Romans 4:15). If there was transgression from Adam to Moses—and Scripture abundantly testifies there was—then the law was in force throughout that period.

## Deeper Truths: Evidence from the Patriarchal Age

### Cain and Abel—Murder and the Sixth Commandment

The first death recorded in Scripture was not by natural causes, but by murder: "Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him" (Genesis 4:8). God held Cain accountable: "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground... now art thou cursed from the earth" (Genesis 4:10–11).

What law did Cain violate? The sixth commandment: "Thou shalt not kill" (Exodus 20:13). Yet Exodus had not yet been given. The commandment was known and binding, written upon the conscience by the Creator Himself.

John explains the root: "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous" (1 John 3:12). The difference between Cain and Abel was not ceremonial but moral—one had a righteous character, the other did not. This distinction implies a standard of righteousness—God's law.

**Note:** God warned Cain before the murder: "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door" (Genesis 4:7). "Doing well" and "not doing well" are moral categories requiring a moral standard.

### The Antediluvian World—Violence and the Law

Before the flood, "the earth also was corrupt before God; and the earth was filled with violence" (Genesis 6:11). God declared: "The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth" (Genesis 6:13).

Violence is a violation of the sixth commandment. Corruption before God implies idolatry and impurity—violations of the first, second, and seventh commandments. The flood was God's judgment upon sin—and judgment presupposes law.

In contrast, "Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord" (Genesis 6:8). He is called "a preacher of righteousness" (2 Peter 2:5). What righteousness did he preach? Not a lawless righteousness, but the righteousness of God, which is always in harmony with His law (Psalm 119:172; Romans 8:4).

**Righteousness defined:** Righteousness is conformity to the will of God as expressed in His law. It is not merely legal standing, but right-doing—a life that reflects the character of God Himself (1 John 3:7).

### Sodom—Unlawful Deeds

The men of Sodom were "wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly" (Genesis 13:13). The angels declared: "We will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord" (Genesis 19:13).

Peter tells us the specific nature of their sins: Lot, "that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds" (2 Peter 2:8).

Mark the word: **unlawful**. Their deeds were contrary to law—God's law. The seventh commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14), and the principles underlying it, were binding and violated. This was centuries before Sinai.

### Joseph—The Seventh Commandment

When tempted by Potiphar's wife, Joseph replied: "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9).

Joseph recognized adultery as **sin against God**—not merely a social offense. He knew God's law, though Moses had not yet received it on tables of stone. The law was written in his heart by faith.

### The Amorites and the Nations of Canaan

God told Abraham: "In the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full" (Genesis 15:16). The Amorites were guilty of great sin, especially idolatry: "He did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites" (1 Kings 21:26).

The Lord declared to Israel: "Ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them" (Leviticus 20:23).

God judged these nations for breaking His law—the first and second commandments forbidding idolatry, and the moral precepts governing life and purity. If there was no law binding them, there could be no just ground for judgment. But God's judgments are always righteous (Psalm 19:9; Genesis 18:25).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law of God Is Eternal

What these examples demonstrate is not merely that the law existed before Sinai, but that God's moral law is as eternal as God Himself. It is the transcript of His character, the expression of His will, the standard of righteousness for all intelligent beings—angelic and human—in all ages.

- Satan and his angels were judged by it in heaven (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6).
- Adam and Eve were judged by it in Eden (Genesis 3).
- The antediluvians, the Sodomites, and the Canaanites were all judged by it before Sinai.

**The Ten Commandments** at Sinai were not the creation of a new moral code, but the formal, written proclamation of principles that had always been in force. God wrote on stone what had long been written in the conscience of mankind (Romans 2:14–15).

### Abraham—Obedience by Faith

Why did God make His promises to Abraham's seed? "Because that Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws" (Genesis 26:5).

Abraham was not justified by his obedience; he was justified by faith (Genesis 15:6; Romans 4:3). But his faith produced obedience. He kept God's commandments—not to earn favor, but because faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).

This is the very heart of **Righteousness by Faith**:

- **Justification (imputed righteousness):** God counts the believing sinner as righteous because of Christ's merits (Romans 4:5–8).
- **Sanctification (imparted righteousness):** God works in the believer to produce actual conformity to His law (Philippians 2:13; Ezekiel 36:26–27).

Abraham's life demonstrates that faith and obedience are inseparable. "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:26). True faith in Christ always results in the keeping of God's commandments from the heart.

### Who Are Abraham's Children?

Jesus declared: "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham" (John 8:39). Abraham's true seed are those who walk in the footsteps of his faith—trusting in God's promises and obeying His law.

Paul confirms: "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (Galatians 3:29).

The children of Abraham are not those who have physical descent, but those who have his faith—a faith that receives Christ's righteousness and produces a life of loving obedience.

## Sanctuary Connection

The patriarchal age was not without a sanctuary message. From the gates of Eden, where God placed cherubim and a flaming sword (Genesis 3:24), to the altars of Abel, Noah, and Abraham, the way of approach to God was through sacrifice—pointing forward to the Lamb of God.

**The outer court** of the sanctuary system, with its altar of sacrifice, was foreshadowed in every burnt offering of the patriarchal age. The blood of lambs and bulls testified: "Without shedding of blood is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22). The patriarchs looked forward in faith to the cross, where Christ would bear the penalty of the broken law (1 Peter 1:18–20).

The law, therefore, was never opposed to grace. It was the law that revealed sin (Romans 3:20) and pointed men to the Redeemer. The sacrificial system taught that God would provide a substitute, a way of reconciliation, an atonement—a bringing together of God and man through the blood of the Promised Seed.

**Atonement defined:** The work by which God and man are reconciled, and sin is removed. In the sanctuary, the blood of the sacrifice made atonement for the sinner, covering and ultimately blotting out sin (Leviticus 17:11; Hebrews 9:22–26).

## Practical Application

### The Law Stands Over Us Today

If God held the patriarchs accountable to His law, how much more are we accountable who have received the full revelation of Jesus Christ and the written Word?

"For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified" (Romans 2:13).

This does not mean we are saved by works, but that genuine faith will produce a life that honors the law of God. The one who truly believes in Jesus will say with David: "O how love I Thy law! It is my meditation all the day" (Psalm 119:97).

### The Possibility of Victory

What was true for Abraham, Joseph, and Noah is true for us: Through faith in Christ, we may keep God's commandments. Not in our own strength, but by the indwelling life of Christ (Galatians 2:20).

"This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith" (1 John 5:4).

"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).

The last-day people of God will demonstrate that the law can be kept—not by human effort, but by the power of Christ working within.

[ILL]

A man once stood before a judge, accused of stealing. His defense was simple: "I did not know the law against theft was in force in this county. No one showed me the statute book."

The judge replied: "Ignorance of the law is no excuse. The law is the law, whether you read the statute or not. And in truth, you did know it was wrong—for your conscience condemned you even as you did it."

So it was in the patriarchal age. The written tables of stone had not yet been given, but the law was written in the conscience. Every man who sinned knew he was sinning—for "sin lieth at the door" even when no book of statutes sits upon the shelf. God's law is eternal, and all are accountable to it.

## Appeal

The great question is not whether the law existed before Sinai—Scripture is abundantly clear that it did. The question is: What will you do with the law of God today?

Will you, like Cain, resist the Spirit's conviction and let sin master you? Or will you, like Abel, come to God by faith, offering the blood of the Lamb, and by grace walk in righteousness?

Will you, like the men of Sodom, continue in unlawful deeds until judgment falls? Or will you, like righteous Lot, be vexed with sin and cry out for deliverance?

Will you, like the Amorites, fill up the cup of iniquity? Or will you, like Abraham, obey God's voice, and keep His charge, His commandments, His statutes, and His laws—not to earn salvation, but because you love the God who has saved you by His grace?

"If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise" (Galatians 3:29).

Come to Christ. Receive His righteousness—both imputed and imparted. Let His law be written in your heart, and by faith, walk in the footsteps of faithful Abraham, looking for that city "which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10).
