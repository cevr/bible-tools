## Slide 1 – Q1: The Meaning of Hospitality

- **Question: What is the meaning of the word hospitality?**
- **Definition:** “Reception and entertainment of strangers or guests, without
  reward, or with kind and generous liberality." (Webster)
- **Key Text:**
  - Ephesians 2:19 – “Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but
    fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.”
  - Isaiah 32:8 – “But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal
    things shall he stand.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Spirit of the Gospel)

- **More Than Food and Shelter:**
  - Hospitality is not just a physical act; it is the spirit in which the act is
    done.
  - It implies a spirit of openness that seeks no personal gain ("without
    reward").
- **Selflessness:**
  - True hospitality kills selfishness.
  - The natural heart asks, "What is in it for me?"
  - The converted heart asks, "What can I do for you?"
- **A Type of the Gospel:**
  - We model our behavior after Christ.
  - Just as He received us when we were "strangers and foreigners" without
    asking for payment, we are to receive others.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Open Door:**
  - Imagine a home with the door bolted, curtains drawn, and the owner hoarding
    supplies inside.
  - This represents the heart of the sinner turned inward.
  - Hospitality is the unbolting of the door, allowing the light of God’s love
    to shine out and the weary traveler to come in.
  - It is the evidence that the heart has been unlocked by the keys of the
    Kingdom.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Characteristics of Hospitality

- **Question: What, then, are the characteristics of true hospitality?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Proverbs 31:26 – “She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is
    the law of kindness.”
  - James 1:5 – “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
    all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Grace of the Spirit)

- Hospitality is a grace of the Holy Spirit, characterized by:
  - **Kindness:** The atmosphere of heaven; the "law of kindness" on the tongue
    and hands.
  - **Generosity:** A reflection of the Creator, who gives liberally to all.
  - **Charity (Agape Love):**
    - Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
      thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”
    - This is self-sacrificing, divine love in action.
    - It seeks the eternal and temporal welfare of others, regardless of their
      merit.

## Slide 6 – Q3: Fulfillment of the Law

- **Question: As genuine hospitality must flow from love for our fellow beings,
  what is fulfilled by its exercise?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is
    fulfilling of the law.”
  - Galatians 5:14 – “For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this;
    Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points (Law and Gospel)

- **The Purpose of the Law:**
  - God's law is a transcript of His character, which is love (1 John 4:8).
  - To keep the law is to love.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot fulfill this law by mere human effort.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
  - Only when Christ dwells in the heart by faith can we truly love our neighbor
    and fulfill the law.
- **Active Obedience:**
  - Hospitality is the positive side of the commandments.
  - It is not just _avoiding_ killing or stealing; it is actively preserving and
    nourishing life.

## Slide 8 – Q4: The Specific Law

- **Question: What law is here referred to?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 13:9 – “For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not
    kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt
    not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended
    in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

## Slide 9 – Q4: Key Points (The Second Table)

- **The Second Table of the Decalogue:**
  - Paul refers to the commandments governing our relationship with fellow men.
  - You cannot break one commandment without violating the principle of love
    underlying them all (James 2:10).
- **Hospitality as Commandment-Keeping:**
  - Turning away a needy stranger violates the spirit of the Sixth Commandment
    (life preservation) and Eighth Commandment (stewardship).
- **Sanctification:**
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
    Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
    and write them in their hearts...”
  - When the Spirit writes the law within, hospitality becomes our nature.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Fruit Tree:**
  - A command to "bear apples" is a heavy burden to a thorn bush.
  - But to an apple tree, bearing apples is natural—it is the result of the life
    within.
  - When we are grafted into Christ (the Vine), keeping the law of love through
    hospitality becomes the natural fruit of our connection to Him.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Hospitality as a Duty

- **Question: Is hospitality enjoined as a duty?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Hebrews 13:2 – “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some
    have entertained angels unawares.”
  - Leviticus 19:34 – “But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you
    as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were
    strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points (Divine Imperative)

- **A Duty, Not an Option:**
  - The Bible commands hospitality as bindingly as "Thou shalt not steal."
- **Continuity of Truth:**
  - Leviticus (OT) and Hebrews (NT) teach the same doctrine.
  - God’s standard of love is unchanging.
- **Our Homes as Sanctuaries:**
  - A sanctuary is a holy place of refuge and worship.
  - Our homes are to be "little sanctuaries" where God's presence is felt and
    the weary find rest.

## Slide 13 – Q6: Motivation for Charity

- **Question: Why ought we thus to exercise charity, or hospitality, to
  strangers?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Deuteronomy 10:17-19 – “For the LORD your God is God of gods... and loveth
    the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. Love ye therefore the
    stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points (Imitating God)

- **God’s Character:**
  - God loves the stranger and provides for them.
  - If we claim to be His children, we must share His character.
- **Our Past Condition:**
  - Ephesians 2:12 – “That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens
    from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of
    promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.”
  - We practice hospitality because God first practiced hospitality toward us,
    bringing us into His family.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Moon:**
  - The moon has no light of its own; it merely reflects the sun.
  - If the moon goes dark, it is because the earth has come between it and the
    sun.
  - If we have no love for strangers, it is because the "world" has come between
    us and the Sun of Righteousness.

## Slide 16 – Q7: Foundation of Character

- **Question: Prove that it enters into the foundation of Christian character.**
- **Key Text:**
  - James 1:27 – “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
    To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself
    unspotted from the world.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points (Faith and Works)

- **Evidential Faith:**
  - True religion is not just holding correct doctrines (orthodoxy) but living
    the life of Christ (orthopraxy).
- **The Test of Character:**
  - It is easy to love those who love us back.
  - Christian character is tested by how we treat those who cannot repay us
    ("widows and fatherless").
- **Purity:**
  - Selfishness defiles the soul; self-sacrificing love purifies it.

## Slide 18 – Q8: Obligation of Hospitality

- **Question: Who are under the obligation to exercise hospitality?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 12:13 – “Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to
    hospitality.”
  - Ecclesiastes 12:13 – “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear
    God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.”
  - 1 Timothy 5:10 – “...if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the
    saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted...”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points (Universal Duty)

- **Every Believer:**
  - The obligation rests on the whole church ("brethren") and even those with
    little means (widows).
- **Whole Duty of Man:**
  - No one is exempt from the law of love.
- **Practical Application:**
  - You do not need a palace to be hospitable.
  - A cup of water or a listening ear offered in Jesus' name is precious to God.

## Slide 20 – Q9: Ministers and Hospitality

- **Question: But are not those who are called to be ministers of the gospel
  exempt from this obligation?**
- **Key Text:**
  - 1 Timothy 3:2 – “A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife,
    vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach.”
  - Titus 1:8 – “But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
    holy, temperate.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points (Leadership by Example)

- **Not Exempt:**
  - Ministers and elders ("bishops") are called to be examples of hospitality.
- **Open Heart, Open Home:**
  - The shepherd must lead in lifestyle, not just doctrine.
  - Just as Christ is accessible to all, the under-shepherd must be welcoming to
    the flock.

## Slide 22 – Q10: Recipients of Hospitality

- **Question: Upon whom should hospitality be bestowed?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Galatians 6:10 – “As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
    men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.”
  - 1 Peter 4:9 – “Use hospitality one to another without grudging.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points & Illustration

- **The Balance:**
  1.  **"One to Another":** We have a special duty to care for our spiritual
      family ("household of faith").
  2.  **"All Men":** Our love must extend to the stranger and the unbeliever.
- **[ILL] The Circles:**
  - Think of a stone dropped in a pond.
  - The ripples start at the center (home/church) but expand outward to the very
    edge (the world).

## Slide 24 – Q11: Hospitality to Enemies

- **Question: Should hospitality be exercised to those who are our enemies?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 12:20 – “Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst,
    give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points (Victory Over Self)

- **Supernatural Love:**
  - Human nature hates an enemy; the divine nature feeds an enemy.
  - This is a test of **Righteousness by Faith**: relying on Christ’s Spirit to
    do what is impossible for the carnal mind.
- **The Example of Jesus:**
  - Romans 5:8 – “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were
    yet sinners, Christ died for us.”
- **Sanctification:**
  - Feeding an enemy requires a death to self and total reliance on Christ.

## Slide 26 – Q12: Respect of Persons

- **Question: What is said of those who make a distinction between rich and
  poor?**
- **Key Text:**
  - James 2:3-4 – “And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
    say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou
    there, or sit here under my footstool: Are ye not then partial in
    yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?”
  - James 2:9 – “But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are
    convinced of the law as transgressors.”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points (The Sin of Partiality)

- **Violation of Love:**
  - Treating people differently based on wealth or status is "sin."
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ ministers for the beggar as earnestly as
    for the king.
  - The church on earth must reflect the sanctuary in heaven.
- **God Looks at the Heart:**
  - To judge by "gold rings" is to judge by worldly standards, not God's (1
    Samuel 16:7).

## Slide 28 – Q13: The Spirit of Hospitality

- **Question: In what spirit should hospitality be exercised?**
- **Key Text:**
  - 1 Peter 4:9 – “Use hospitality one to another without grudging.”
  - 1 Corinthians 13:3 – “And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and
    though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me
    nothing.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Key Points (Motive is Everything)

- **Without Grudging:**
  - God loves a cheerful giver (2 Cor 9:7).
  - Service accompanied by complaining is rejected by Heaven.
- **Love vs. Works Alone:**
  - You can give everything away, but if the motive isn't _agape_ love, it
    counts for nothing.
  - Works are valuable only as the visible fruit of a saving relationship with
    Love Himself.

## Slide 30 – Q14: Honoring Christ

- **Question: Whom do we honor when we exercise hospitality?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Matthew 25:40 – “And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say
    unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my
    brethren, ye have done it unto me.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: Key Points (The Incarnational Principle)

- **Identifying with Humanity:**
  - Jesus identifies so closely with suffering humanity that He feels their
    hunger and loneliness.
- **Hosting the King:**
  - We often wish we could have hosted Jesus in Galilee.
  - We _can_ do this today: when we welcome the outcast, we are hosting the King
    of Glory.

## Slide 32 – Q15: The Context of Judgment

- **Question: What was the Saviour speaking about on this occasion?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Matthew 25:35-36 – “For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was
    thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked,
    and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye
    came unto me.”

## Slide 33 – Q15: Key Points (Faith Manifested)

- **The Final Judgment:**
  - Christ describes the separation of the sheep and goats.
  - While we are justified by faith alone, the judgment reviews the life record
    for the _fruit_ of that faith.
- **The Nature of the Saved:**
  - The "sheep" served instinctively because they possessed the nature of
    Christ.
  - Genuine righteousness imparted by the Spirit always results in service to
    humanity.
  - A "faith" without hospitality is a counterfeit.

## Slide 34 – Q16: Effect on the Giver

- **Question: What effect has hospitality on those who exercise it?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Acts 20:35 – “...It is more blessed to give than to receive.”
  - Proverbs 11:25 – “The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth
    shall be watered also himself.”

## Slide 35 – Q16: Key Points & Illustration

- **Spiritual Health:**
  - Stagnant water becomes poisonous; a stagnant soul becomes selfish.
  - We cannot pour out blessings on others without getting "watered" ourselves.
- **[ILL] The Two Seas:**
  - **Sea of Galilee:** Takes water in and gives it out; it is full of life.
  - **Dead Sea:** Takes water in but gives nothing out; it is dead and salty.
  - Hospitality makes us like Galilee; selfishness makes us like the Dead Sea.

## Slide 36 – Q17: Effect on the Enemy

- **Question: What is the effect of hospitality shown to an enemy?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Romans 12:20 – “Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst,
    give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.”

## Slide 37 – Q17: Key Points (Redemptive Love)

- **Melting Hardness:**
  - The metaphor refers to smelting metal by piling hot coals around it to melt
    it.
- **Transforming Power:**
  - Kindness shown to an enemy "burns" their conscience.
  - The goal is not to destroy them, but to melt down their hatred and turn an
    enemy into a friend.

## Slide 38 – Q18: The Promise of Reward

- **Question: Is there any reward promised to those who show hospitality?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Matthew 10:42 – “And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
    ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto
    you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.”

## Slide 39 – Q18: Key Points (God’s Memory)

- **Participation in Ministry:**
  - Supporting a worker/prophet through hospitality makes you a partner in their
    work.
- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - God notes every act of kindness.
  - Not even a "cup of cold water" escapes the notice of our High Priest.
  - These acts are preserved as evidence of a transformed character.

## Slide 40 – Q19: Loss or Gain?

- **Question: Will a person lose anything in this life by being hospitable?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Proverbs 19:17 – “He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and
    that which he hath given will he pay him again.”
  - Luke 6:38 – “Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed
    down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your
    bosom...”

## Slide 41 – Q19: Key Points (Divine Economics)

- **Lending to God:**
  - When you give to the needy, God considers Himself the borrower.
  - He always repays His debts.
- **Faith vs. Fear:**
  - Fear says, "If I share, I won't have enough."
  - Faith says, "My God shall supply all your need" (Philippians 4:19).

## Slide 42 – Q20: The Final Reward

- **Question: What will be the final reward for hospitality?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Matthew 25:34 – “Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come,
    ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
    foundation of the world.”

## Slide 43 – Q20: Key Points (Homecoming)

- **Inheritance:**
  - The ultimate reward is the Kingdom of Glory.
- **From Stranger to Son:**
  - We who were strangers on earth are welcomed into the mansions Christ has
    prepared (John 14:1-3).
- **Sanctuary Fulfilled:**
  - Revelation 21:3 – “And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold,
    the tabernacle of God is with men...”
  - God will exercise eternal hospitality toward us, feeding us from the Tree of
    Life.

## Slide 44 – Q21: Biblical Example

- **Question: What Bible characters were especially noted for hospitality?**
- **Key Text:**
  - Genesis 18:2 – “And he [Abraham] lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three
    men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent
    door, and bowed himself toward the ground.”

## Slide 45 – Q21: Key Points (Abraham’s Example)

- **Eagerness to Serve:**
  - Abraham _ran_ and _hastened_; he did not serve begrudgingly.
- **Unaware of Dignity:**
  - He thought he was serving weary travelers, but he was serving the Lord and
    angels.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Like Abraham, we should treat every guest with the dignity we would afford a
    messenger from heaven.
