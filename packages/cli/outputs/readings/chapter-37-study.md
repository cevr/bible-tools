### Q1. What is the first work the Bible ascribes to the Spirit of God?

"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the
deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." Gen. 1:2.

**Answer:** The very first mention of the Holy Spirit in Scripture reveals Him
as the Divine Agent of creation and order. Before God spoke light into
existence, the Spirit was present, "moving" (or brooding) over the chaos.

- **From Chaos to Order:** The earth was "without form, and void"—a state of
  emptiness and confusion. The Spirit’s work was to prepare the raw material to
  receive the creative Word of God.
- **The Agent of Life:** The word "moved" implies a fluttering or hovering
  motion, like a bird over its nest, suggesting the imparting of life and
  energy.
- **The New Creation (Righteousness by Faith):** This physical creation
  parallels the spiritual work of salvation. When a sinner comes to Christ,
  their heart is often "without form and void"—dark and confused by sin. The
  Holy Spirit hovers over the soul to bring order, light, and the life of Christ
  (2 Corinthians 4:6; Ephesians 2:1).
  - **Justification:** God speaks the word of forgiveness.
  - **Sanctification:** The Spirit organizes the life, bringing every thought
    into obedience to Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5).

**[ILL]** Think of a master potter looking at a shapeless, muddy lump of clay.
The clay has no form or beauty on its own. The potter’s hands (representing the
Spirit) must move over the clay, centering it and applying pressure to shape it
into a vessel of honor. Without the potter's touch, the clay remains formless;
with His touch, it becomes a beautiful vessel fit for use (Isaiah 64:8).

### Q2. By what power did Christ work miracles?

“But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come
unto you." Matt. 12:28.

**Answer:** This is a vital truth regarding the nature of Christ and His example
for us. Though Jesus was fully God, He voluntarily humbled Himself (Philippians
2:5–8) and chose not to use His own divine power for His own benefit or
ministry.

- **Total Dependence:** Jesus performed miracles, resisted temptation, and lived
  a holy life not by His own inherent power, but by the power of the Holy Spirit
  dwelling in Him. He said, "I can of mine own self do nothing" (John 5:30).
- **The Example for Humanity:** Because Jesus overcame sin and worked
  righteousness through the Spirit, He proved that humanity, connected to God by
  faith, can also live a victorious life.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** If Jesus had used power that is not available to
  us, He could not be our perfect example. But because He relied on the Spirit,
  we can follow in His steps. The same Spirit that empowered Christ to cast out
  devils and heal the sick is available to give us victory over besetting sins
  (Romans 8:11).

**[ILL]** Imagine a powerful king who removes his royal robes, puts on the
clothes of a common soldier, and goes into battle using only the standard issue
sword and shield. He wins the battle not because of his royal rank, but because
of his skill and reliance on his commander. Jesus laid aside His royal robes of
glory to fight the battle of sin as a man, armed with the Spirit, showing us
that we too can win the war against sin using the same weapon.

---

### Q3. To what is His resurrection ascribed?

“For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He
might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the
Spirit." 1 Peter 3:18.

**Answer:** The resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of the Christian faith,
and Peter ascribes this act of life-giving power to the Holy Spirit.

- **Quickened (Made Alive):** The Spirit is the source of life (Romans 8:2). He
  raised Jesus from the physical grave.
- **Spiritual Resurrection:** This text connects directly to our salvation. We
  are naturally "dead in trespasses and sins" (Ephesians 2:1). Just as the
  Spirit raised Jesus from the dead, He raises the repentant sinner to "walk in
  newness of life" (Romans 6:4).
- **The Guarantee:** The resurrection of Christ is the Father's "Amen" to
  Christ's sacrifice. It proves that the sacrifice was accepted and that the
  power of the Spirit is stronger than death and sin.

**[ILL]** A battery may be perfectly structured, but until the electrical charge
enters it, it is dead and useless. A human body may have all its parts, but
without the breath of life, it is a corpse. The Holy Spirit is the "charge" of
divine life. He entered the tomb, and the cold body of Jesus breathed again.
That same "charge" enters the dead heart of a sinner and produces a living,
breathing Christian.

### Q4. How is conviction produced in the mind of the sinner?

“And when He [the Spirit] is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment." John 16:8 (Gen. 6:3).

**Answer:** Conversion is impossible without the work of the Holy Spirit. Before
a man can accept a Savior, he must realize he is lost.

- **Reprove (Convict):** To bring to light, to expose, or to convince with
  evidence.
- **Threefold Conviction:**
  1.  **Of Sin:** Specifically, the sin of unbelief in Christ and the violation
      of God’s law (1 John 3:4). The Spirit acts as a mirror, showing us the
      dirt on our souls.
  2.  **Of Righteousness:** The Spirit points away from our "filthy rags"
      (Isaiah 64:6) to the perfect righteousness of Christ. He shows us the
      standard of God's character which we have failed to meet.
  3.  **Of Judgment:** The Spirit warns that there is a final reckoning. The
      "prince of this world" (Satan) is judged, and all who cling to sin will
      share his fate.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner had to place
  his hand on the victim's head and confess sin (Leviticus 4:29). The Spirit is
  the One who prompts this confession by showing us our guilt (the broken law)
  and the remedy (the blood of the Lamb).

**[ILL]** A man walking through a dark room may feel safe and clean. But if a
bright light is suddenly turned on, he sees the dust, the cobwebs, and the
stains on his clothes. The light did not create the dirt; it only revealed it.
The Holy Spirit is that Light. He reveals our true condition so that we might
run to the water of life to be washed.

### Q5. What office does the Spirit perform for the Christian?

“And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He
may abide with you for ever." John 14:16.

**Answer:** The term "Comforter" comes from the Greek _Paracletos_, meaning "one
called alongside to help."

- **Another Comforter:** Jesus was the first Comforter to the disciples while on
  earth. He promises "another" of the same kind—one who would represent Him.
- **Constant Companion:** Unlike the physical presence of Jesus, which was
  limited to one place, the Spirit can "abide with you for ever" and be
  everywhere at once.
- **His Work:** He guides, instructs, sustains, and comforts the believer in
  times of trial. He makes the presence of Christ real to the soul.
- **Definitions:**
  - _Imputed Righteousness:_ Christ's merit credited to us (our title to
    heaven).
  - _Imparted Righteousness:_ The Spirit dwelling in us, enabling us to live
    righteously (our fitness for heaven). The Comforter provides this daily
    power.

**[ILL]** Imagine a child learning to walk. The parent walks right alongside,
holding their hand, catching them when they stumble, and encouraging them
forward. The Spirit is that divine Companion, walking beside us on the path of
sanctification, ensuring we are never orphans in this world.

---

### Q6. What other work does the Spirit perform?

“God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of
the Spirit and belief of the truth." 2 Thess. 2:13.

**Answer:** Salvation is not merely a legal adjustment (forgiveness); it is a
transformation of character.

- **Definition of Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit makes
  the believer holy, setting them apart for God’s use and purifying their heart
  from the love of sin (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
- **Belief and Experience:** Paul links "sanctification of the Spirit" with
  "belief of the truth." True faith always leads to a changed life. We are not
  saved _by_ our works, but we are saved _for_ good works (Ephesians 2:10).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** The Spirit writes the Law of God on the heart
  (Hebrews 8:10). This means the believer begins to love what God loves and hate
  what God hates. It is the restoration of the image of God in man.

**[ILL]** A rough diamond must be cut and polished to reflect light.
Justification is finding the diamond and claiming it. Sanctification is the
process of cutting and polishing that stone. The Spirit uses the "truth" as the
chisel to remove the rough edges of selfishness, pride, and anger, until we
reflect the character of Jesus perfectly.

---

### Q7. What is the word of God said to be?

“And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the
word of God." Eph. 6:17.

**Answer:** In the armor of God, the Sword is the only offensive weapon
mentioned.

- **The Sword of the Spirit:** The Bible is the instrument through which the
  Spirit works. The Spirit does not lead men apart from the Word; He works
  _through_ the Word.
- **Testing Spirits:** Any spirit that contradicts the written Word is not the
  Spirit of God (Isaiah 8:20).
- **Victory over Temptation:** Jesus demonstrated how to use this sword in the
  wilderness. When tempted, He did not debate Satan; He quoted Scripture: "It is
  written" (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10). To overcome sin, we must hide the Word in our
  hearts (Psalm 119:11).

**[ILL]** A surgeon uses a scalpel to cut out a tumor. The scalpel is sharp and
effective, but it needs the surgeon's hand to guide it. The Bible is the scalpel
that cuts out sin ("sharper than any two-edged sword," Hebrews 4:12), and the
Holy Spirit is the Surgeon who wields it to heal our souls.

---

### Q8. In what manner did the Spirit make known the word?

“For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21.

**Answer:** The Bible is not a collection of human opinions or philosophies; it
is the voice of God.

- **Not of Human Will:** The prophets did not invent their messages. Often, they
  delivered messages that were unpopular or difficult even for them to
  understand (1 Peter 1:10–11).
- **Moved by the Holy Ghost:** The Greek implies being "borne along," like a
  ship driven by the wind. The Spirit took possession of their minds and
  communicated God's thoughts, which they expressed in human language.
- **Authority:** Because the Author is the Holy Spirit, the Scriptures are the
  supreme authority for doctrine, reproof, and instruction (2 Timothy 3:16).

**[ILL]** Consider a stained-glass window. The light (God's truth) passes
through different colored panes (the personalities of the prophets—Moses, David,
Paul). The light is the same, but it takes on the texture and style of the
instrument used. The Spirit ensures the message (the light) remains pure and
true, even while using human instruments.

---

### Q9. In what manner did the Lord speak to these holy men?

“After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision, saying,
Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward." Gen. 15:1
(Num. 12:6) (lsa.1:1) (Eze. 1:1).

**Answer:** The Spirit often communicated through visions and dreams.

- **The Prophetic Mode:** God stated in Numbers 12:6, "If there be a prophet
  among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will
  speak unto him in a dream."
- **Visual Revelation:** In a vision, the prophet's physical senses are often
  suspended, and the Holy Spirit presents scenes, symbols, or direct instruction
  to the mind (Daniel 10:8–17).
- **Consistency:** From Genesis (Abram) to Revelation (John), this has been
  God's established method of giving special light to His people.

**[ILL]** A telescope allows a person to see things that are far away as if they
were near. The Holy Spirit acts as a spiritual telescope for the prophet,
bringing the distant future or heavenly realities into sharp focus to be shared
with the people.

---

### Q10. Was this gift of the Spirit to be confined mostly to the time of the Old Testament?

“And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My spirit upon all
flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream
dreams, your young men shall see visions." Joel 2:28.

**Answer:** No, the gift of prophecy and the outpouring of the Spirit were
promised to expand, not cease.

- **"Afterward":** This points to a future time (from Joel's perspective).
- **"Upon All Flesh":** In the Old Testament, the Spirit came primarily upon
  specific leaders (kings, prophets, judges). The promise here is for a general
  outpouring upon the church—men, women, old, and young.
- **The Purpose:** To prepare a people for the "great and terrible day of the
  Lord" (Joel 2:31).

---

### Q11. How did Peter by inspiration render this term afterward?

“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My
Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your
young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams." Acts 2:17.

**Answer:** Peter applies Joel's prophecy to the Christian era, specifically the
"last days."

- **Pentecost:** Peter quoted this on the day of Pentecost (the Early Rain),
  identifying the outpouring of the Spirit as the fulfillment of prophecy.
- **The Last Days:** While Pentecost was a partial fulfillment, the "last days"
  extend to the very end of time. We may expect a final, even greater outpouring
  (the Latter Rain) to finish God's work on earth (Zechariah 10:1; Revelation
  18:1).
- **Prophetic Guidance:** The text explicitly states that in the last days,
  God's people would be guided by the spirit of prophecy (visions and dreams). A
  church claiming to be the remnant of the last days should expect to see this
  gift manifested (Revelation 12:17; 19:10).

**[ILL]** A farmer relies on two major rains. The "early rain" falls at planting
time to germinate the seed (Pentecost). The "latter rain" falls just before
harvest to ripen the grain (the final work of the Spirit). Both are necessary.
We are living in the time to pray for the Latter Rain.

---

### Q12. What does Paul call the Spirit?

“In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of
promise." Eph. 1:13.

**Answer:** Paul describes the Spirit as the "seal" of God upon the believer.

- **What is a Seal?** In ancient times, a seal signified three things:
  1.  **Ownership:** The object belongs to the one whose seal is upon it (2
      Timothy 2:19).
  2.  **Security:** The object is under the protection of the owner.
  3.  **Likeness:** The wax takes the exact impression of the signet ring.
- **The Sealing Work:** To be sealed by the Spirit means to be settled into the
  truth so intellectually and spiritually that one cannot be moved. It involves
  the impression of God's character (His law) upon the heart.
- **RBF Connection:** The seal is not a stamp on a corrupt heart. It is the mark
  of God placed upon a character that has been cleansed by Christ’s blood and is
  being sanctified by His Spirit.

**[ILL]** When canning fruit, a seal is placed on the jar only after the fruit
has been prepared and the jar filled. If the seal is tight, the fruit is
preserved from spoiling. The Holy Spirit seals us in Christ, preserving us from
the corruption of the world for the heavenly garner.

---

### Q13. Why was it thus designated?

“Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the
Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, He hath shed forth this, which ye now see
and hear." Acts 2:33 (Acts 1:4, 5).

**Answer:** The Spirit is called the "Holy Spirit of promise" because His
outpouring was the specific promise of the Father to the Son upon the Son’s
victory.

- **The Sequence:** Christ lived a perfect life, died as a sacrifice, rose
  again, and ascended to heaven.
- **The Coronation Gift:** When Christ was inaugurated as our High Priest in the
  heavenly sanctuary, the Father gave Him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon His
  church on earth.
- **Proof of Acceptance:** The outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost was the
  signal to the disciples that Jesus had arrived safely in heaven and that His
  sacrifice was accepted.

**[ILL]** When a new King is crowned, he often scatters gifts to the crowd
below. When Jesus was crowned with glory and honor at the right hand of God, He
"shed forth" the gift of the Holy Spirit to His waiting people.

---

### Q14. Why did Jesus say it was necessary for Him to go unto the Father?

“For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I
will send Him unto you." John 16:7.

**Answer:** This seems like a hard saying—how could it be better for Jesus to
leave?

- **Bodily Limitation:** While on earth in human flesh, Jesus could only be in
  one place at a time. If He was in Jerusalem, He could not be in Galilee.
- **Universal Presence:** By ascending to heaven to minister as High Priest,
  Jesus could send the Spirit, who is omnipresent. Through the Spirit, Jesus can
  dwell in the heart of every believer worldwide simultaneously (Galatians
  2:20).
- **Sanctuary Ministry:** Jesus had to enter the Heavenly Sanctuary to begin His
  work of intercession. Without His intercession and the application of His
  blood in heaven, the plan of salvation could not move forward.

**[ILL]** As long as the sun is on the horizon, it casts long shadows and lights
only one side of the mountain. But at noon, when the sun is high above, its
light fills the whole valley. Jesus ascended to the "zenith" of the universe—the
throne of God—so that His light (via the Spirit) could fill the entire earth.

---

### Q15. Were the gifts of the Spirit referred to in this promise?

“Wherefore he saith, When He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive, and
gave gifts unto men." Eph. 4:8.

**Answer:** Yes. The outpouring of the Spirit involves the distribution of
specific spiritual gifts to the church.

- **Led Captivity Captive:** Christ conquered death and Satan. He took a
  multitude of captives (those raised at His resurrection, Matthew 27:52–53) to
  heaven as the firstfruits of His victory.
- **Gifts to Men:** Having secured the right to redeem humanity, He distributes
  abilities and offices to His people to continue His work on earth.

---

### Q16. What are these gifts?

“And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and
some, pastors and teachers." Eph. 4:11.

**Answer:** These serve as the leadership and foundational gifts for the church.

1.  **Apostles:** Sent ones, pioneers, those who plant the work in new fields.
2.  **Prophets:** Those who receive direct revelation from God to guide, warn,
    and comfort the church.
3.  **Evangelists:** Those gifted in preaching the gospel to unbelievers and
    winning souls.
4.  **Pastors:** Shepherds who care for the local flock.
5.  **Teachers:** Those who explain doctrine and ground the members in the
    truth.

- **Purpose:** These are given "for the perfecting of the saints" (Eph 4:12).
  The church cannot reach full maturity or unity without these gifts operating.

---

### Q17. Were all these gifts by the same Spirit?

“Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit." 1 Cor. 12:4 (Eph.
4:4).

**Answer:** Yes. There is one Source, though there are many functions.

- **Unity in Diversity:** Just as the human body has many parts (eye, ear, hand)
  but one life-blood flowing through it, the body of Christ has many gifts but
  one Spirit.
- **No Pride or Jealousy:** Because the same Spirit distributes the gifts "as He
  will" (1 Cor 12:11), no member should boast of their gift or envy another's.
  All are necessary.
- **Harmony:** The Spirit never contradicts Himself. The gift of prophecy will
  align with the gift of teaching, and both will align with Scripture.

**[ILL]** An orchestra has many different instruments—violins, trumpets, drums.
They look different and make different sounds. But they are all reading the same
music and following the same conductor (the Spirit). The result is a harmonious
symphony, not noise.

---

### Q18. What commission did Christ give to His disciples?

“And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature." Mark 16:15.

**Answer:** This is the "Great Commission."

- **The Scope:** "All the world," "every creature." The gospel is not for one
  nation, but for the human race.
- **The Message:** The Gospel—the good news that Christ has lived, died, and
  risen to save sinners from the power and penalty of sin.
- **The Impossible Task:** To reach the whole world was impossible for a small
  group of uneducated Galileans—unless they had supernatural aid.

---

### Q19. Why did they not proceed immediately to that work?

“And, behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city
of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high." Luke 24:49 (Acts
1:8).

**Answer:** Activity without the Spirit is fruitless. Jesus commanded them to
wait ("tarry").

- **Endued with Power:** The Greek word implies being "clothed" with power.
  Without this spiritual clothing, their preaching would be naked and
  ineffective.
- **Preparation:** While they waited, they did not sit idly. They spent the time
  in repentance, confession, and earnest prayer (Acts 1:14). They put away all
  differences and came into "one accord."
- **Application for Today:** We often rush into church work with human plans and
  human energy. We need to learn to "tarry" in the presence of God until we are
  baptized afresh with the Holy Spirit. Only then can we finish the work.

**[ILL]** A sailboat cannot move until the wind blows. The sailors can polish
the deck and fix the ropes (preparation), but they must wait for the wind (the
Spirit) to drive the ship. If they try to row across the ocean, they will fail.
We must hoist our sails and wait for the Power from on high.

---

### Q20. How long did Jesus promise to be with those who preach the gospel?

“Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I
am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." Matt. 28:20.

**Answer:** This promise closes the Gospel of Matthew and covers the entire
history of the church until the Second Coming.

- **"I am with you":** How? Through the agency of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is
  Christ's representative. Where the Spirit is, Christ is.
- **"Unto the end":** The need for the Spirit's power, the gifts of the Spirit,
  and the guidance of the Spirit does not cease until the work is done.
- **Condition:** The promise is linked to the command: "Teaching them to observe
  all things." If we teach obedience to God's commandments and the faith of
  Jesus, we are guaranteed His presence.
- **Hope:** We are not alone in the Great Controversy. The Captain of our
  salvation walks with us.

**[ILL]** When a general sends his troops to the front lines, he stays in
command at headquarters, but he maintains constant communication via radio. The
soldiers on the front line move under his direct orders. Through the Spirit, our
Commander communicates with us instantly, directing the battle until the final
victory is won.
