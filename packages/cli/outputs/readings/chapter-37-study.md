# Reading 37: The Work of the Holy Spirit

## Introduction

The Holy Spirit is not a distant, abstract force, but a divine Person who has been actively at work from creation's first moments to the present hour. Understanding His work is essential to the Christian life, for without the Spirit, there is no conviction, no conversion, no sanctification, and no power for witness. This study traces the Spirit's multifaceted ministry throughout Scripture, revealing how God comes near to His people through this blessed Comforter.

## Core Truths

### The Spirit in Creation and Redemption

From the Bible's opening verses, the Holy Spirit appears as an active agent in God's work:

> _"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."_ (Genesis 1:2)

The Hebrew word for "moved" (_rachaph_) pictures a bird hovering protectively over its young—the Spirit brooding over chaos, bringing order, life, and beauty from nothing.

[DYK🔎] This same Hebrew word appears in Deuteronomy 32:11, where God is compared to an eagle hovering over its young. The Spirit's creative work is always tender, life-giving, and purposeful.

This creative power did not cease in Genesis. The same Spirit:

- **Empowered Christ's miracles**: _"But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you."_ (Matthew 12:28)
- **Raised Christ from the dead**: _"Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit."_ (1 Peter 3:18)

The Spirit who brought light from darkness at creation brings life from death in redemption. He is the active agent in all God's saving work.

### The Spirit's Work in the Sinner

Before a soul can be converted, the Spirit must first awaken the conscience:

> _"And when He is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment."_ (John 16:8)

**Reprove** (Greek: _elegchō_) means to convict, to bring evidence that exposes guilt. The Spirit acts as a divine prosecutor, but one whose purpose is mercy—to lead the sinner to repentance.

[Q] **"Why do I sometimes feel an uncomfortable sense of guilt when I consider my life?"**

This is not condemnation to destroy you, but conviction to save you. The Spirit's reproving work is evidence of God's pursuing love. He reveals sin not to crush, but to heal. _"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation"_ (2 Corinthians 7:10). When you feel this conviction, respond—it is the Spirit drawing you to Christ.

## Deeper Truths

### The Spirit as Comforter and Sanctifier

Jesus promised His disciples a gift that would more than compensate for His physical absence:

> _"And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever."_ (John 14:16)

The word "another" (Greek: _allos_) means "another of the same kind"—not a different kind of helper, but one equal to Christ Himself. The Spirit is Christ's representative, making the Savior's presence real to believers in every age.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "Comforter" (_paraklētos_) means "one called alongside to help." It was used of a legal advocate, a counselor, and a helper in distress. The Spirit is all these to the believer.

Beyond comfort, the Spirit performs an even deeper work:

> _"God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth."_ (2 Thessalonians 2:13)

**Sanctification** is the Spirit's work of making the believer holy—not merely in standing before God, but in actual character and life. This is not human effort, but divine power working within:

[ILL] A gardener may prepare the soil, plant the seed, and water the ground—but only life from above can cause the seed to grow. So it is with sanctification. We cooperate with God by faith and obedience, but the transforming power is wholly the Spirit's. We cannot change our own hearts any more than a seed can make itself grow. _"It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure"_ (Philippians 2:13).

### The Spirit and the Word

The Spirit works through a specific instrument:

> _"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."_ (Ephesians 6:17)

> _"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."_ (2 Peter 1:21)

The Spirit authored Scripture and continues to work through it. He speaks to us today not apart from the Word, but through it. When we read the Bible prayerfully, the same Spirit who inspired the prophets illuminates our minds to understand.

[Q] **"How did God communicate with the prophets?"**

Scripture reveals several means:

- **Visions**: _"The word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision"_ (Genesis 15:1)
- **Dreams**: _"Your old men shall dream dreams"_ (Joel 2:28)
- **Direct communication**: _"And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend"_ (Exodus 33:11)

In every case, the Spirit was the agent of revelation, ensuring that God's message was faithfully delivered (Numbers 12:6; Isaiah 1:1; Ezekiel 1:1).

### The Promise Extended to the Last Days

Some might suppose the Spirit's prophetic gifts were limited to ancient times. But Joel's prophecy declares otherwise:

> _"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions."_ (Joel 2:28)

Peter, under inspiration, clarified when this "afterward" would be:

> _"And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh."_ (Acts 2:17)

The prophetic gift was not to diminish but to increase as the end approaches. The Spirit of prophecy is promised to the remnant church (Revelation 12:17; 19:10).

[DYK🔎] Paul calls the Spirit "that holy Spirit of promise" (Ephesians 1:13) because He is the fulfillment of what the Father promised through the prophets and what Christ assured His disciples before His ascension (Acts 1:4–5; 2:33).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Why Christ Had to Depart

Jesus made a remarkable statement:

> _"For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you."_ (John 16:7)

Why was Christ's departure necessary for the Spirit's coming? In His incarnation, Christ was limited to one place at a time. But through the Spirit, Christ could be present with every believer, everywhere, always.

This connects directly to Christ's heavenly ministry. When Jesus ascended to the Father, He:

- Entered the heavenly sanctuary as our High Priest (Hebrews 8:1–2)
- Received from the Father the promised Spirit (Acts 2:33)
- Poured out that Spirit upon His church

The Spirit's work on earth is inseparable from Christ's work in heaven. As our High Priest ministers in the sanctuary above, the Spirit applies the benefits of that ministry to our hearts below.

### The Gifts of the Spirit

When Christ ascended, He gave gifts to His church:

> _"And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers."_ (Ephesians 4:11)

These gifts are diverse, yet unified:

> _"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."_ (1 Corinthians 12:4)

The gifts are not for personal glory but for the building up of the body of Christ. Every believer has a Spirit-given role in God's work.

### Power for Witness

Christ gave His disciples a great commission:

> _"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."_ (Mark 16:15)

Yet He commanded them to wait:

> _"Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high."_ (Luke 24:49)

[Q] **"Why didn't the disciples begin preaching immediately?"**

Because human eloquence and effort are insufficient for the gospel work. Only the Spirit can convict hearts and convert souls. The disciples needed not better arguments but divine power. So do we.

And this power is not limited to the apostolic age:

> _"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."_ (Matthew 28:20)

Christ promises His presence—through the Spirit—to all who labor in the gospel until His return.

## Practical Application

The Spirit's work calls us to:

1. **Respond to conviction**: When the Spirit reproves, do not harden your heart. Yield to His voice while it still speaks (Hebrews 3:7–8).

2. **Receive the Comforter**: The Spirit is offered to all who ask. _"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"_ (Luke 11:13).

3. **Cooperate in sanctification**: The Spirit works within, but He does not force. Daily surrender to His leading, study His Word, and obey His promptings.

4. **Depend on divine power**: Do not attempt God's work in human strength. Tarry in prayer. Seek the Spirit's filling before you venture forth in service.

5. **Discover your spiritual gift**: The Spirit has equipped you for a place in Christ's body. Ask God to reveal your gift, then use it for His glory.

## Appeal

> _"And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever."_ (John 14:16)

The Holy Spirit is heaven's greatest gift to the church. He convicts, He comforts, He sanctifies, He empowers. He is Christ's own representative, making the Savior's presence real in every willing heart.

Will you open your heart to His work today? Will you respond to His conviction, receive His comfort, and submit to His sanctifying power? Christ is waiting to send Him in fullness to all who ask.

_"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."_ (Revelation 2:7)
