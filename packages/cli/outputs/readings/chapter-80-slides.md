## Slide 1 – Q1: The Condition of Humanity

- **Question:** In what condition did the sin of Adam place the human family?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:12 – “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the
  world, and death by sin: and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
  sinned.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Original Sin)

- **The Universality of Sin:**
  - Sin is an inherited condition of separation from God.
  - Adam stood as the representative head; his fall brought the infection of
    selfishness upon all descendants.
- **The Penalty of Death:**
  - Physical and spiritual death is the result.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- **Total Helplessness:**
  - Humans are born with a nature unable to render perfect obedience without
    divine aid.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Poisoned Reservoir:**
  - Imagine a reservoir at the top of a mountain that is poisoned at the source.
  - Every river and faucet flowing from that source carries the same
    contamination.
  - **Application:** Adam was the headwaters of humanity. When he fell, the
    stream of human life became contaminated with sin, affecting all who drink
    from it.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Offer of Salvation

- **Question:** How does the offer of salvation come to all?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:18 – “Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came
  upon all men to condemnation: even so by the righteousness of one the free
  gift came upon all men unto justification of life.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Justification)

- **The Second Adam:**
  - Christ succeeded where Adam failed.
  - 1 Corinthians 15:45 – “And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a
    living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.”
- **Imputed Righteousness:**
  - Christ’s perfect life is credited to the believer’s account (Justification).
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - The life of Christ is given to empower the believer for a new life.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Bankrupt Debtor:**
  - A man accumulates a debt of millions he cannot pay and faces prison.
  - A wealthy benefactor pays the entire debt and deposits a fortune into the
    debtor's account.
  - **Application:** Adam bankrupted humanity; Christ paid the debt and credits
    His infinite righteousness to our account.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Only Way

- **Question:** Is there any other way to obtain salvation?
- **Key Text:** Acts 4:12 – “Neither is there salvation in any other; for there
  is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Uniqueness of Christ)

- **No Human Merit:**
  - Salvation cannot be earned by works, culture, or rituals.
- **The Unique Bridge:**
  - Only a Being who is both God and Man could bridge the gulf caused by sin.
- **Unity of Salvation:**
  - Old Testament saints were saved by the Messiah to come.
  - New Testament saints are saved by the Messiah who came.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Saved by Grace

- **Question:** Through what are men saved?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:8 – “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and
  that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points (Grace and Faith)

- **Grace (The Source):**
  - God’s unmerited favor and enabling power.
  - Titus 2:11 – “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
    all men.”
- **Faith (The Instrument):**
  - Faith is not the cause of salvation; it is the hand that accepts it.
  - Even the capacity to believe comes from God’s Word.
  - Romans 10:17 – “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
    God.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Beggar and the Bread:**
  - A starving beggar is offered a loaf of bread by a king.
  - The beggar stretches out a trembling hand to take it.
  - The hand did not bake or earn the bread; it only received it.
  - **Application:** Faith is the beggar's hand; Grace is the King’s gift.

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Promise to the Patriarchs

- **Question:** By what were the patriarchs to receive the promises of God?
- **Key Text:** Romans 4:16 – “Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by
  grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Sure Promises)

- **The Guarantee:**
  - If the promise depended on our works, it would fail because of our frailty.
  - Because it rests on grace, God ensures it is "sure."
- **All the Seed:**
  - Includes physical descendants (Jews) and spiritual descendants (Gentile
    believers).
  - The central object of faith—Christ—remains the same for both groups.

## Slide 14 – Q6: Prophetic Teaching on Faith

- **Question:** What did the prophets teach concerning justification through
  faith?
- **Key Text:** Habakkuk 2:4 – “Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not
  upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Living by Faith)

- **Continuous Dependence:**
  - The righteous do not trust in their own strength.
  - Moment by moment, they draw spiritual life from God.
- **Transformation:**
  - True faith is active; as we trust God, His Spirit writes the law in our
    hearts.
  - Hebrews 10:38 – “Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back,
    my soul shall have no pleasure in him.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Deep-Sea Diver:**
  - A diver exists in an environment where he naturally cannot survive
    (underwater).
  - He lives only because he is connected by a hose to a source of life above.
  - **Application:** "The just shall live by his faith" means constantly
    breathing the atmosphere of heaven while walking on earth.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Remission of Sins

- **Question:** Through whom did the prophets teach should come the remission of
  sins?
- **Key Text:** Acts 10:43 – “To Him give all the prophets witness, that through
  His name whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Sanctuary & Remission)

- **Universal Witness:**
  - All prophets pointed to the "Lamb of God."
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, sin required blood (death) to be remitted.
  - Leviticus 17:11 – “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have
    given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls...”
- **The Reality:**
  - John 1:29 – “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,

    was glad.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Imputed Righteousness)

- **Counted for Righteousness:**
  - Abraham was justified not by nature, but by believing God’s promise.
- **Seeing Christ’s Day:**
  - Through the offering of Isaac, Abraham saw a vivid enactment of the Father
    giving the Son.
  - He understood the substitutionary sacrifice of the Messiah.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Gospel to Abraham

- **Question:** How did Abraham have a view of Christ's day?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:8 – “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would
  justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham,
  saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (The Eternal Gospel)

- **The Covenant of Grace:**
  - The promise "in thee shall all nations be blessed" was a reference to Jesus.
- **Justifying the Heathen:**
  - God's plan was always to save all nations through faith, not by bloodline.
- **Unity of the Bible:**
  - Abraham was saved by the Gospel just as we are today.

## Slide 23 – Q10: Children of Faith

- **Question:** Whose children are all that believe?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:7 – “Know ye therefore that they which are of faith,
  the same are the children of Abraham.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (True Israel)

- **Spiritual Lineage:**
  - To be a "child of Abraham" is to share Abraham's faith in Christ.
  - Galatians 3:29 – “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and
    heirs according to the promise.”
- **One People:**
  - Righteousness by Faith unifies God's people across all history.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Moses’ Faith and Choice

- **Question:** What did faith in Christ enable Moses to do?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:24-26 – “By faith Moses, when he was come to years,
  refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer
  affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
  season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in
  Egypt.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **Refusing the World:**
  - Faith gave Moses vision to see that the "pleasures of sin" are temporary.
- **Choosing the Reproach:**
  - He identified with the suffering Messiah rather than earthly power.
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - Faith empowered him to deny self and follow the path of obedience.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Marshmallow vs. The Feast:**
  - A child grabs a marshmallow now rather than waiting for a feast later.
  - A mature person waits for the greater reward.
  - **Application:** Faith gives us spiritual maturity to reject the
    "marshmallow" of fleeting sin for the "feast" of eternal life in Christ.

## Slide 28 – Q12: Spiritual Life in the Wilderness

- **Question:** From what source did the children of Israel draw spiritual life?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 10:4 – “And did all drink the same spiritual
  drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock
  was Christ.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (Christ in the OT)

- **The Smitten Rock:**
  - The water from the rock typified the living water Jesus offers.
  - John 4:14 – “But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall
    never thirst...”
- **Christ's Presence:**
  - Jesus was the Angel of the Lord leading Israel in the cloud and fire.

  Testament was written?
- **Key Text:** John 5:46-47 – “For had ye believed Moses, ye would have
  believed Me; for he wrote of Me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall
  ye believe My words?”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points (Types and Shadows)

- **Foundation:**
  - Understanding the law and the prophets is essential to grasping the full
    Gospel.

## Slide 32 – Q14: Inspiration of the Prophets

    (The Finisher).
  - **Application:** Philippians 1:6 – “Being confident of this very thing, that
    he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of
    Jesus Christ.”
