## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s View of Covetousness

- **Question:** How does God regard the covetous man?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 10:3 – “For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and
  blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Nature of Covetousness**
  - It is selfishness in its purest form.
  - Defined as an uncontrolled desire to possess what belongs to others or to
    hoard God's gifts.
  - Paul calls it “idolatry” (Colossians 3:5 – “Mortify therefore your members
    which are upon the earth... and covetousness, which is idolatry”) because it
    places things on the throne of the heart.
- **Why God Abhors It**
  - God is Love (1 John 4:8); His nature is to give ("God so loved... that He
    gave").
  - Covetousness is the spirit of Satan ("get" and "keep").
  - It hardens the heart and leaves no room for Christ.
- **The Cure**
  - The only remedy is the "new heart" (Ezekiel 36:26).
  - **Sanctification:** The Spirit replaces natural selfishness with the
    generosity of Christ.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Monkey and the Jar**
  - Hunters catch monkeys by placing a nut inside a narrow-necked jar.
  - The monkey grabs the nut, making a fist that is too wide to pull out.
  - Because the monkey refuses to let go of the prize, it remains trapped.
  - **Lesson:** Holding tightly to worldly gain traps the sinner in Satan’s
    snare. To be free, one must let go.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Qualifications for Leaders

- **Question:** What kind of men does God require to occupy responsible
  positions in His work?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 18:21 – “Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the
  people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and
  place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds,
  rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Qualifications of Leadership**
  - **Able men:** Competent and sound in judgment.
  - **Fear God:** Living with a sense of God’s presence and judgment
    (Ecclesiastes 12:13).
  - **Men of Truth:** Loving God's law and rejecting deception.
  - **Hating Covetousness:** Not just avoiding theft, but actively hating greed.
- **Sanctuary Application**
  - Priests in the earthly sanctuary had to be physically and ceremonially
    clean.
  - Leaders handling "holy things" today must be morally clean.
  - A leader driven by gain cannot represent Jesus, our self-sacrificing High
    Priest.
- **Practical Implication**
  - A lover of money will have warped judgment, favoring the rich (James 2:1–4).

## Slide 6 – Q3: The Saviour’s Warning

- **Question:** What warning does the Saviour give against covetousness?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:15 – “And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of
  covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
  which he possesseth.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points

- **"Take Heed and Beware"**
  - A double warning suggesting a hidden danger.
  - Covetousness often disguises itself as "prudence" or "good business."
  - It is a spiritual poison that few confess.
- **The Definition of Life**
  - The world defines life by possessions.
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** Jesus defines life as knowing the true God (John
    17:3).
  - Our life is "hid with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3).
  - Possessions are merely tools; only character survives into the judgment.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Painting and the Frame**
  - It would be foolish to buy a masterpiece painting and spend all your time
    admiring the cheap wooden frame.
  - **Lesson:** Our physical life and possessions are just the frame.
  - The "painting" is the image of Christ being restored in the soul.
  - Covetousness makes us worship the frame and neglect the picture.

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Rich Fool

- **Question:** How did God regard the rich man who laid up his goods for his
  own ease?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:20 – “But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy
  soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be, which thou
  hast provided?”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **Why was he a fool?**
  - Not because he was rich or successful.
  - He was a fool because he lived as if God did not exist.
  - He was consumed by "I" and "my" (self-centeredness).
- **Stewardship vs. Ownership**
  - **Stewardship:** Recognizing God is the Owner; we are managers.
  - This man acted as the owner, failing to consult God on how to use the
    surplus.
  - By hoarding blessings intended for others, his blessing became a curse.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Self vs. God

- **Question:** What does Christ say of those who do as the man in the parable?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:21 – “So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and
  is not rich toward God.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points

- **Laying up Treasure for Self**
  - The pursuit of earthly security.
  - Trying to build a "heaven" on a passing earth (1 John 2:17).
- **Rich Toward God**
  - Possessing faith and love, the "gold tried in the fire" (Revelation 3:18).
  - Having a record of good works in heaven.
  - **Note on Salvation:** These works do not earn salvation (legalism). They
    are the natural fruit of a saving relationship with Christ (Ephesians 2:10).
  - Giving transfers currency from earth (where it fades) to heaven (where it
    lasts).

## Slide 13 – Q6: Leaving the World

- **Question:** How much can one carry out of the world?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:7 – “For we brought nothing into this world, and it
  is certain we can carry nothing out.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Great Equalizer**
  - Death levels all distinctions of wealth.
  - Job 1:21 – “Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return
    thither.”
- **What Remains?**
  - We cannot carry money, but we _do_ carry our character.
  - **Sanctuary Context:** In the investigative judgment, God weighs character
    against the Law, not bank accounts.
  - Material works ("wood, hay, stubble") burn; character built by grace ("gold,
    silver") endures (1 Corinthians 3:12–15).

## Slide 15 – Q7: The Source of Wealth

- **Question:** Who gives man power to get wealth?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 8:18 – “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God;
  for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Source of Ability**
  - Strength, intellect, and life itself are gifts from God (Acts 17:25).
  - If God withdrew His power, the wealthiest would return to dust.
- **The Purpose of Wealth**
  - Not for selfish indulgence.
  - Given to "establish his covenant."
  - We are co-workers with Christ to support the Gospel message.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Reservoir**
  - A reservoir that receives water but has no outlet becomes a stagnant swamp
    (like the Dead Sea).
  - A reservoir that receives and dispenses water remains fresh and full of
    life.
  - **Lesson:** God gives us power to get wealth so we may be channels of
    blessing, not stagnant pools.

## Slide 18 – Q8: Trusting in Riches

- **Question:** What is said concerning those who trust in their riches?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 11:28 – “He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but
  the righteous shall flourish as a branch.”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points

- **The Fall**
  - Riches are "uncertain" (1 Timothy 6:17).
  - Riches cannot buy a pardon for sin; in judgment, they profit nothing
    (Proverbs 11:4).
  - Trusting riches implies self-sufficiency (Laodicean condition), preventing
    us from seeking Christ’s righteousness.
- **The Contrast**
  - "...but the righteous shall flourish as a branch."
  - The righteous trust in Christ, the Vine, drawing life from God’s infinite
    resources.

## Slide 20 – Q9: Warning the Wealthy

- **Question:** What charge was Timothy required to give the rich?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:17 – “Charge them that are rich in this world, that
  they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God,
  who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points

- **"High-minded" (Pride)**
  - Wealth often breeds superiority.
  - Pride is dangerous because God resists the proud but gives grace to the
    humble (James 4:6).
  - A proud heart feels no need for Justification.
- **"Uncertain Riches"**
  - Trusting money is idolatry (worshipping a dead god).
  - We must trust "the living God."
  - **Application:** Hold possessions loosely; rely on God, not the bank, for
    peace.

## Slide 22 – Q10: Using Means for God

- **Question:** What ought they to do with their means?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:18 – “That they do good, that they be rich in good
  works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points

- **"Rich in Good Works"**
  - True wealth is measured by what we give, not what we keep.
  - "Willing to communicate" implies a willingness to share life (Greek
    _koinonikos_).
- **Righteousness by Faith and Works**
  - We are not saved _by_ giving, but saved _for_ good works (Ephesians 2:10).
  - A heart justified by faith will naturally produce generosity.
  - Selfishness is the old nature; generosity is the new nature in Christ.

## Slide 24 – Q11: Investing in Eternity

- **Question:** What will they thus do for themselves?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:19 – “Laying up in store for themselves a good
  foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points

- **A Good Foundation**
  - Obedience in finances proves that our faith is real (building on the Rock).
  - We "lay hold" on the reality of the next life.
- **Title vs. Fitness for Heaven**
  - **Justification** (Christ’s work _for_ us) = Our Title.
  - **Sanctification** (Christ’s work _in_ us) = Our Fitness.
  - Overcoming selfishness fits us for the unselfish atmosphere of heaven.

## Slide 26 – Q12: Honoring God

- **Question:** By giving of one's substance to the Lord's work, what does he
  thus do?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 3:9 – “Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the
  first fruits of all thine increase.”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points

- **"Honor the Lord"**
  - Giving is an act of worship acknowledging God as Owner.
- **"Firstfruits"**
  - **Sanctuary Type:** The first sheaf was waved before the Lord to consecrate
    the harvest (Leviticus 23:10–11).
  - **Application:** We give God the _first_ portion, not the leftovers.
  - This requires faith—trusting that 9/10ths with God's blessing is more than
    10/10ths without it.

## Slide 28 – Q13: God’s Remembrance

- **Question:** How does the Lord look upon the spirit of giving to the cause?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 6:10 – “For God is not unrighteous to forget your work
  and labor of love, which ye have showed toward His name, in that ye have
  ministered to the saints, and do minister.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Key Points

- **"Labor of Love"**
  - God values the motive.
  - Gospel giving is motivated by gratitude for Christ’s sacrifice, not by a
    desire to "buy" blessings.
- **God Remembers**
  - Malachi 3:16 speaks of a "book of remembrance."
  - Every secret act of kindness is recorded.
  - These deeds stand as evidence of the Spirit's work in the judgment (Matthew
    25:34–40).

## Slide 30 – Q14: The Poor and Giving

- **Question:** If a person has but little of this world's goods, is he not
  excused from giving?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 16:17 – “Every man shall give as he is able,
  according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which He hath given thee.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: Key Points

- **"As He is Able"**
  - God’s plan is equitable: a fixed proportion (tithe) and offerings based on
    ability.
  - The poor need the spiritual blessing of giving just as much as the rich.
  - Giving overcomes selfishness in every heart.
- **Systematic Benevolence**
  - 1 Corinthians 16:2 – "Upon the first day of the week let every one of you
    lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him."

## Slide 32 – Q15: Measuring the Gift

- **Question:** Then can it be the amount a man gives that is so acceptable to
  God?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 8:12 – “For if there be first a willing mind, it
  is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath
  not.”

## Slide 33 – Q15: Key Points

- **The Willing Mind**
  - God looks at the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).
  - A small gift with great love is valued highly by heaven.
- **The Widow's Mite**
  - She gave "two mites," yet Jesus said she gave more than the wealthy (Mark
    12:41–44).
  - **Reason:** She gave "all that she had."
  - **Principle:** Total surrender. The rich gave a portion; she gave her life.

## Slide 34 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Child's Gift**
  - A child’s scribble is worthless to an art dealer but priceless to a father.
  - Why? Because it represents the child’s whole heart and best effort.
  - **Lesson:** So it is with our offerings to God—He values the love behind the
    gift.

## Slide 35 – Q16: Heavenly Treasure

- **Question:** What does one provide for himself who gives freely to the cause
  of God?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:33 – “Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide
  yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not,
  where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.”

## Slide 36 – Q16: Key Points

- **"Bags which wax not old"**
  - Earthly investments fail; heavenly treasure is imperishable.
- **Sanctuary Connection**
  - Christ is ministering in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Our interests should be centered where He is.
  - Souls won to Christ through our means are the "treasure" that awaits us in
    the Kingdom.

## Slide 37 – Q17: The Heart’s Location

- **Question:** If one's treasure has been transferred to heaven by giving to
  God's cause, where will his heart be?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:34 – “For where your treasure is, there will your heart
  be also.”

## Slide 38 – Q17: Key Points

- **Spiritual Gravity**
  - The heart follows the treasure.
  - If we invest in the world, our mind dwells on the world.
  - If we invest in God's work, our interest and prayers follow (Colossians
    3:1–2).
- **Conclusion**
  - We cannot serve God and mammon.
  - Victory over covetousness comes by beholding Jesus.
  - Seeing His sacrifice breaks our selfishness and leads us to give our all.
