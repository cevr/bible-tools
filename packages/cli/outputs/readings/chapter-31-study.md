### Q1. What command did the God of heaven give to Abraham?

“Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy
kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee. "
Genesis 12:1.

**Answer:**

God called Abraham to a complete separation from his idolatrous surroundings to
become the father of the faithful. This command highlights the first essential
step in the life of faith: **surrender**. Before God could build a new nation
through whom the Messiah (the Seed) would come, Abraham had to be willing to
leave the familiar comforts of Ur.

- **The Call to Separate:** Faith often requires us to leave behind "country"
  (worldly politics), "kindred" (social pressure), and "father’s house"
  (inherited traditions) when they conflict with God’s will (2 Corinthians
  6:17).
- **Walking by Faith, Not Sight:** Notice that God did not immediately name the
  land. He simply said, "a land that I will shew thee." True faith trusts God's
  character even when the roadmap is hidden.
- **The Great Controversy:** In calling Abraham out, God was establishing a
  beachhead of truth in a world that had largely been taken captive by Satan’s
  deceptions following the Flood and the Tower of Babel.

[ILL] **Illustration:** Imagine a captain of a ship receiving sealed orders from
the Admiral. The captain is told to leave the harbor and sail into the open
ocean, and only after he has left port will the next destination be revealed. If
the captain refuses to leave the dock until he sees the destination, he is not
acting in faith. Abraham was the captain who cast off the lines, trusting fully
in the Admiral of the universe.

### Q2. Did Abraham obey this command?

“So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and
Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran." Verse 4.

**Answer:**

Yes, Abraham’s response was immediate and literal. He did not debate the command
or delay until it was convenient. This verse establishes a fundamental principle
of the Bible: **Faith and obedience are inseparable.**

- **Obedience acts:** Belief is not merely an intellectual agreement with truth;
  it is an active response to God's voice.
- **No Age Limit:** Abraham was seventy-five years old. The call to walk by
  faith and obey God applies to both the young and the aged. There is no
  retirement from the service of the King.
- **The "So" of Faith:** The text says, "So Abram departed." This small word
  indicates a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Because God spoke, Abraham
  moved. This is the essence of the commandment-keeping life—it is a response to
  the Word of God.

### Q3. Of what was Abraham's obedience the result, or fruit?

“By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he
was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he
went." Hebrews 11:8, R.V.

**Answer:**

The Apostle Paul clarifies that Abraham’s obedience was the direct fruit of his
**faith**. He did not obey in order to earn God's favor; he obeyed because he
believed God's promise.

- **The Source of Action:** In the Christian life, outward obedience flows from
  the inward spring of faith. If we try to obey God without faith, it is
  **legalism** (works of the flesh). If we claim to have faith but do not obey,
  it is **presumption**.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Abraham’s journey illustrates the Righteousness by
  Faith message. He believed God (faith), and that belief propelled him to move
  (obedience).
  - _Definition—Faith:_ The substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
    things not seen (Hebrews 11:1). It is taking God at His word.
  - _Definition—Legalism:_ Attempting to produce righteousness by one's own
    power to merit salvation.
- **Trusting in the Dark:** "Not knowing whither he went." Faith is willing to
  be led by the Spirit even when human reason cannot see the end from the
  beginning (Proverbs 3:5–6).

---

### Q4. What later command did the Lord give to Abraham?

“And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get
thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one
of the mountains which I will tell thee of ." Genesis 22:2.

**Answer:**

This was the supreme test of Abraham’s life. God asked for the one thing that
meant more to Abraham than his own life—his son of promise, Isaac.

- **The Sanctuary Typology:** This event on Mount Moriah was a dramatic type
  (prophetic shadow) of the plan of salvation. Abraham represented the Father,
  and Isaac represented Christ, the only begotten Son, who would be offered for
  the sins of the world (John 3:16).
- **The Test of Idolatry:** God tests us to see if any gift He has given has
  taken the place of the Giver in our hearts. Abraham proved that he loved God
  supremely, fulfilling the essence of the first commandment (Exodus 20:3).
- **Surrender:** True obedience holds nothing back. It places the dearest
  objects of earthly affection upon the altar.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A refiner of gold keeps the metal in the fire until he
can see his face reflected in it perfectly. God brought Abraham to the fire of
testing not to destroy him, but to refine his character until the image of
God—self-sacrificing love—was perfectly reflected in him.

---

### Q5. Upon what ground were the previous promises made to Abraham later renewed?

“And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done
this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: that in blessing I
will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the
heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess
the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed; because thou hast obeyed My voice." Verses 16-18.

**Answer:**

The covenant blessings were ratified and renewed because Abraham **"obeyed My
voice."** While the covenant is based on God's grace, its fulfillment in the
human agent is conditional upon the obedience of faith.

- **Conditional Promises:** God’s promises are often conditional. "If ye be
  willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land" (Isaiah 1:19). God
  cannot pour the fullness of His blessing into a rebellious vessel.
- **The Seed:** The promise that "in thy seed shall all nations... be blessed"
  refers ultimately to Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:16). Through Abraham’s line,
  the Saviour of the world would come.
- **Atonement Connection:** Because Abraham was willing to offer his son, God
  could demonstrate to the universe the nature of the sacrifice He Himself would
  make at the cross. Abraham’s obedience justified God’s choice of him as the
  father of the faithful.

---

### Q6. What was it that enabled Abraham to obey the great test?

“By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received
the promises offered up his only begotten son." Hebrews 11: 17.

**Answer:**

Whatever the trial or command, the enabling power is always **faith**. Abraham
believed that God was able to raise Isaac from the dead (Hebrews 11:19).

- **Faith Graps Omnipotence:** Faith connects human weakness to God’s infinite
  power. Abraham obeyed because he trusted that God’s promise ("in Isaac shall
  thy seed be called") could not fail, even if death intervened.
- **The Principle of Victory:** This is how the Christian overcomes sin today.
  We do not overcome by grit or willpower alone, but by faith in the power of
  Christ to kill the sin and raise us to newness of life (Romans 6:4; 1 John
  5:4).
- **Sanctuary Application:** Just as the sinner lays his hand on the head of the
  sacrifice in the sanctuary service, transferring his sin and trusting in the
  substitute, Abraham laid his total trust in God’s provision.

---

### Q7. Of what were the works of Abraham an evidence?

“Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his
son upon the altar?" James 2:21.

**Answer:**

James teaches that Abraham’s works were the **evidence** that his faith was
genuine. This does not contradict Paul’s teaching that we are justified by faith
(Romans 4:2–3); rather, it completes it.

- **Definitions of Justification:**
  1.  **Before God:** We are justified (declared righteous) solely by faith in
      the blood of Jesus, without any merit of our own (Romans 3:24–28). God
      reads the heart.
  2.  **Before Men/Universe:** We are justified (shown to be righteous) by our
      works. Men cannot read the heart; they can only see the life. Abraham’s
      work on Mount Moriah proved to the watching universe that his faith was
      real.
- **The Trial:** God said, "Now I know that thou fearest God" (Genesis 22:12).
  The outward act demonstrated the inward reality.

---

### Q8. By his actions, or works, what was shown to be perfect?

"Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made
perfect?" Verse 22.

**Answer:**

Works make faith "perfect" (complete). Faith without works is like a body
without breath—it is dead (James 2:26).

- **Faith Wrought with Works:** The Greek implies they worked together, like two
  hands on a plow. You cannot separate the root (faith) from the fruit (works).
- **The Goal of the Gospel:** God’s plan is to restore man to perfection of
  character. The "faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12) always produces the
  "commandments of God."
- **Sanctification:** This process where faith produces obedience is called
  **Sanctification**. It is the work of a lifetime where the Holy Spirit writes
  the law upon the heart (Hebrews 10:16).

[ILL] **Illustration:** Consider a fruit tree. The life is in the sap (faith),
which is invisible and underground in the roots. But if that sap is truly
flowing, the tree _must_ produce apples (works). If a tree produces no fruit, we
know it is dead at the root. We do not tape apples onto the branches to make the
tree alive (legalism); we nurture the root, and the fruit comes naturally.

---

### Q9. What is genuine faith?

“In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision;
but faith which worketh by love." Galatians 5:6.

**Answer:**

Genuine faith is not a passive belief; it is an active principle that **"worketh
by love."**

- **Love and the Law:** "Love is the fulfilling of the law" (Romans 13:10). If
  our faith does not make us loving, kind, and obedient to God's moral law, it
  is not the faith of Jesus.
- **Ceremony vs. Character:** Paul contrasts external ceremonies (circumcision)
  with the internal dynamic of faith-filled love. The ceremonies of the Jewish
  economy passed away at the cross, but the moral obligation to love God and man
  remains forever.
- **Motivation:** The true Christian obeys not to avoid hell or buy heaven, but
  because they love the One who died for them (John 14:15).

---

### Q10. What is the purpose of the grace of Christ?

“Through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among
all nations, for His name's sake." Romans 1:5, R.V.

**Answer:**

The ultimate purpose of grace is not merely to forgive the past, but to bring
about the **"obedience of faith."**

- **Definition—Grace:** Grace is the unmerited favor of God toward the
  undeserving, but it is also the _power_ of God to do for us what we cannot do
  for ourselves (2 Corinthians 12:9; Titus 2:11–12).
- **Restoration:** The Gospel is a repair plan. Sin is lawlessness (1 John 3:4).
  Grace restores the sinner to harmony with God's law. A gospel that does not
  lead to obedience is a false gospel.
- **Christ's Name:** This obedience is for "His name's sake." When Christians
  obey God through faith, they vindicate God’s character before the world.

---

### Q11. What was the effect of the Apostles' preaching upon the hearers?

“And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in
Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the
faith." Acts 6:7.

**Answer:**

The power of the Holy Spirit in the early church was so great that even the
Jewish priests—who were deeply entrenched in tradition and legalism—became
**"obedient to the faith."**

- **Victory of Truth:** This shows that no one is beyond the reach of the
  Gospel. The "faith" here refers to the body of Christian truth, which calls
  for a surrender of human pride and tradition.
- **Sanctuary Shift:** These priests moved from ministering in the earthly
  temple, which had lost its significance after the veil tore, to faith in the
  High Priest of the heavenly sanctuary, Jesus Christ.

---

### Q12. How highly does God regard obedience in the lives of men?

“And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and
sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than
sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." 1 Samuel 15:22.

**Answer:**

God regards humble obedience as far superior to outward religious forms,
ceremonies, or sacrifices.

- **The Context:** King Saul had partially obeyed God but reserved the "best of
  the sheep" for a sacrifice, contrary to God's command. He tried to cover his
  disobedience with a religious act.
- **The Principle:** Religious activity (church attendance, tithe paying,
  singing) is an abomination if it is used as a cloak for willful disobedience
  (Proverbs 28:9).
- **Atonement:** The sacrificial system was provided _because_ man disobeyed. It
  was a remedy, not a license to continue in sin. To prefer the remedy
  (sacrifice) while continuing the disease (disobedience) is to mock God.
- **True Worship:** The highest form of worship is the surrender of the will to
  God.

---

### Q13. What example of obedience to the will of the Father has Christ given to us?

“And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient
unto death, even the death of the cross." Philippians 2:8.

**Answer:**

Christ is our perfect pattern. As the "Second Adam," He came to succeed where
the first Adam failed. His life was one of continuous, humble obedience,
culminating in the cross.

- **Imputed Righteousness:** Christ’s perfect life of obedience is credited
  (imputed) to the believer for their **Justification**. When God looks at the
  repentant sinner, He sees Christ’s perfect obedience.
- **The Cost:** Obedience led Jesus to the cross. The "obedience of faith" often
  involves suffering and self-denial. "If any man will come after me, let him
  deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me" (Luke 9:23).
- **Even unto Death:** There is no point at which the believer is released from
  the duty to obey God, even if it costs them their life (Revelation 12:11).

---

### Q14. At what great cost did even He learn the lesson of obedience?

“Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He
suffered." Hebrews 5:8.

**Answer:**

Christ did not learn obedience by ceasing to be disobedient (for He never
sinned), but He learned the _experience_ and _cost_ of obedience in a world of
sin.

- **Sympathetic High Priest:** Because He suffered in His obedience, He is able
  to succor (help) us when we are tempted (Hebrews 2:18). He knows how hard it
  is for human flesh to submit to the will of God.
- **The School of Suffering:** Suffering is often God’s chosen method to teach
  us reliance on Him. It refines our faith and purifies our character.

[ILL] **Illustration:** A captain may know the theory of sailing from a book,
but he "learns" the ocean only by steering the ship through a storm. Jesus, in
His humanity, learned the reality of obedience by steering through the storms of
Satan's fiercest temptations.

---

### Q15. To whom did Christ become the author of salvation?

“And being made perfect, He became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them
that obey Him." Verse 9.

**Answer:**

Christ is the Author of salvation specifically to those who **"obey Him."**
While we are saved _by_ grace _through_ faith, we are saved _unto_ good works
(Ephesians 2:8–10).

- **No License to Sin:** The Gospel does not provide insurance for rebellion. A
  person who claims to be saved but willfully continues to disobey Christ is
  deceiving themselves. "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his
  commandments, is a liar" (1 John 2:4).
- **A Completed Work:** Christ was "made perfect" (completed/qualified) as our
  High Priest through His life and death. Now, from the Heavenly Sanctuary, He
  dispenses this salvation to those who follow Him.

---

### Q16. How complete should this obedience be?

“Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against
the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
of Christ." 2 Corinthians 10:5.

**Answer:**

True obedience is not just skin deep; it must penetrate the mind and the
motives. Every thought is to be brought into subjection to Christ.

- **The Battleground:** The Great Controversy is fought primarily in the mind.
  "Imaginations" and human reasoning often exalt themselves against God's Word.
- **Internal Obedience:** The 10th Commandment ("Thou shalt not covet") proves
  that God’s law reaches the thoughts. Murder begins with anger; adultery begins
  with lust (Matthew 5:21–28).
- **The Remedy:** We cannot control our thoughts by willpower alone. We must
  invite the Spirit of Christ to occupy the mind. When Christ dwells within, the
  thoughts are brought into harmony with Him.

---

### Q17. What important fact did Jesus mention about the Pharisees?

“And He said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may
keep your own tradition." Mark 7:9.

**Answer:**

Jesus exposed the danger of placing human tradition above the law of God. The
Pharisees were rigorous in outward forms (washings, tithes) but were breaking
God’s moral law.

- **Tradition vs. Truth:** Throughout history, the church has often substituted
  human ordinances for divine commands.
  - _Example:_ The substitution of Sunday (a tradition of men) for the
    Seventh-day Sabbath (the commandment of God) is a modern parallel to the
    Pharisees' error.
- **The Test of Authority:** The question is, whom do we obey? The "obedience of
  faith" accepts the Bible as supreme authority, rejecting any tradition that
  conflicts with "Thus saith the Lord" (Acts 5:29).

---

### Q18. What will be the future of those who refuse to obey the gospel of Christ?

"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them
that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ." 2
Thessalonians 1:7, 8.

**Answer:**

This solemn text reveals that there is a final accountability. Those who "obey
not the gospel" will confront the consuming presence of God at the Second
Coming.

- **Obeying the Gospel:** Note that the Gospel is something to be _obeyed_, not
  just mentally accepted. It involves repentance (turning from sin) and faith
  (turning to Christ).
- **The End of Sin:** God’s love requires Him to eventually destroy sin, which
  causes all suffering. Those who cling to sin and refuse the remedy of
  obedience-by-faith will be consumed with their sin.
- **The Investigative Judgment:** Before this event, the judgment determines who
  has the "seal of God" (obedience) and who has the "mark of the beast"
  (rebellion).

---

### Q19. What is the result of faithfully obeying the truth by the enabling grace of Christ?

“Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto
unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart
fervently." 1 Peter 1:22.

**Answer:**

The result of obeying the truth is a purified soul and a heart filled with
**unfeigned (genuine) love**.

- **Sanctification defined:** Peter describes sanctification here: it is the
  purifying of the soul _through_ the Spirit _in_ obeying the truth.
- **The Goal is Love:** The end of the commandment is charity (love) (1 Timothy
  1:5). Obedience that makes a person cold, critical, or self-righteous is not
  the obedience of Christ. True obedience softens the heart and fills it with
  love for the brethren.
- **"Through the Spirit":** We cannot purify our own souls. It is the Holy
  Spirit's work, but He works only as we choose to obey the truth He reveals.

---

### "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land." Isaiah 1:19.

**Conclusion:** The promise of the New Earth ("the good of the land") is for
those who, through the merits of Christ and the power of His Spirit, have been
restored to the joy of obedience. The law of God is the law of the universe;
only those who love that law can be happy in heaven. Righteousness by Faith
brings the believer to the place where they delight to do God's will (Psalm
40:8).
