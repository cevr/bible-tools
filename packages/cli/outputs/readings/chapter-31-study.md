# Reading 31: The Obedience of Faith

## Introduction

True faith and genuine obedience are not opposing forces but inseparable companions in the Christian life. Through the life of Abraham—the father of the faithful—Scripture reveals that saving faith always produces willing obedience, and that obedience flows not from human effort but from a living trust in God. This study explores how faith works by love to bring the believer into complete harmony with God's will.

## Core Truths

### Faith That Obeys

When God called Abraham to leave everything familiar and journey to an unknown land, the patriarch responded with simple, trusting obedience:

> _"Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee."_ (Genesis 12:1)

> _"So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him."_ (Genesis 12:4)

What enabled such radical obedience? Scripture gives us the answer:

> _"By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went."_ (Hebrews 11:8, R.V.)

Notice the beautiful simplicity: **"By faith... obeyed."** Abraham did not know the destination; he knew the One who called him. His obedience was not blind duty but intelligent trust.

[DYK🔎] Abraham was seventy-five years old when he left Haran—an age when most would seek security and comfort. Yet faith made him willing to become a pilgrim, dwelling in tents for the rest of his life (Hebrews 11:9). True faith transforms our relationship to earthly security.

### The Supreme Test

Years later, God gave Abraham an even more difficult command:

> _"Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering."_ (Genesis 22:2)

Isaac was not merely Abraham's beloved son—he was the child of promise, the one through whom God had said all nations would be blessed. Humanly speaking, this command seemed to contradict everything God had promised.

Yet Abraham obeyed:

> _"By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son."_ (Hebrews 11:17)

**Faith**: The conviction that God's character is trustworthy even when His commands seem impossible to understand (Hebrews 11:1).

[ILL] Consider a child learning to swim. The father stands in the water, arms outstretched, calling, "Jump! I will catch you!" The child cannot see beneath the surface; she does not know the depth. But she knows her father. When she leaps, it is not because she understands the water—it is because she trusts the one who calls her. So Abraham leaped into the unknown, not because he understood God's plan, but because he knew God's heart.

## Deeper Truths

### How Faith and Works Relate

James asks a penetrating question:

> _"Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?"_ (James 2:21–22)

This passage has confused many, but the truth is beautifully simple:

- **Faith** is the root
- **Works** are the fruit
- The fruit reveals the life in the root

James does not teach salvation by works. He teaches that genuine faith **produces** works as naturally as a living tree produces fruit. Abraham's willingness to offer Isaac did not earn him righteousness—it **demonstrated** the living faith already present in his heart.

[Q] **"But doesn't Paul say we are justified by faith without works? How can James say Abraham was justified by works?"**

Paul and James address different questions. Paul (Romans 4:1–5) asks: _How does a sinner become right with God?_ Answer: By faith alone, not by earning merit through works. James (James 2:14–26) asks: _How can you tell if faith is genuine?_ Answer: By the works it produces. A faith that produces no obedience is not saving faith—it is mere intellectual assent, the kind even demons possess (James 2:19). The two apostles do not contradict; they complement. Faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is never alone—it always works by love.

### The Nature of Genuine Faith

Paul gives us the defining characteristic of saving faith:

> _"In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."_ (Galatians 5:6)

**Faith which worketh by love**—this is the essence of true religion. Genuine faith:

- **Trusts** God's promises
- **Loves** the One who promises
- **Obeys** because love delights in the will of the Beloved

This is not legal obedience driven by fear of punishment or hope of reward. It is the spontaneous response of a heart captivated by divine love.

[DYK🔎] The Greek phrase translated "faith which worketh by love" (pistis di' agapēs energoumenē) uses the word from which we derive "energy." Faith is not passive—it is energized, made active and powerful, by love. Love is the operating principle that sets faith in motion.

### Grace Designed for Obedience

Some imagine that grace excuses disobedience. But Paul reveals grace's true purpose:

> _"Through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all nations, for His name's sake."_ (Romans 1:5, R.V.)

Grace is given **for** obedience—"obedience of faith"—not as a covering for continued rebellion. The same grace that forgives also empowers. When the early church proclaimed this gospel, the result was remarkable:

> _"And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith."_ (Acts 6:7)

**Obedient to the faith**—they did not merely believe doctrines; they submitted their lives to the transforming power of the gospel.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### God Values Heart-Obedience Above All

Through Samuel, God declared a principle that echoes throughout Scripture:

> _"Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."_ (1 Samuel 15:22)

This truth strikes at the heart of all false religion. Fallen humanity constantly seeks to substitute external forms for internal surrender. We offer God our activities, our rituals, our religious performances—anything except what He actually asks: the obedience of a loving heart.

[Q] **"Doesn't this contradict righteousness by faith? Isn't emphasizing obedience legalism?"**

Not at all. Legalism is the attempt to earn salvation through obedience. Righteousness by faith is receiving Christ's righteousness freely, then allowing that same Christ to live His obedient life within us. The difference is not between faith and obedience—it is between human effort and divine enabling. Christ does not save us _in_ our sins but _from_ our sins (Matthew 1:21). The faith that receives His pardon also receives His power for holy living.

### Christ Our Example and Enabler

Jesus Himself demonstrates perfect obedience:

> _"And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."_ (Philippians 2:8)

> _"Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered."_ (Hebrews 5:8)

Christ's obedience was not effortless. He "learned" obedience through suffering. As a man, He faced every temptation we face, yet chose His Father's will at infinite cost. And now:

> _"Being made perfect, He became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him."_ (Hebrews 5:9)

**Author**: The Greek (aitios) suggests both source and cause. Christ is both the origin and the ongoing power of our salvation. His obedience is credited to us (justification) and reproduced in us (sanctification).

[ILL] A skilled musician does not simply perform a piece and leave the student to imitate. She takes the student's hands, guides the fingers, demonstrates the pressure and timing until, gradually, the music flows through the student's own hands. Christ does not merely show us obedience from afar—He enters our lives by His Spirit and produces His obedience through us. "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13).

### The Completeness of Surrender

How thorough must our obedience become?

> _"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."_ (2 Corinthians 10:5)

**Every thought**—not merely outward actions, but the inner life of the mind. This is the standard God's grace makes possible. The work is not merely behavioral modification but heart transformation, reaching to the very springs of thought.

This stands in sharp contrast to the religion of the Pharisees:

> _"Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."_ (Mark 7:9)

The Pharisees were outwardly religious but inwardly rebellious. They substituted human tradition for divine commandment—appearing obedient while actually rejecting God's authority. True faith obeys God's word, not human substitutes.

## Practical Application

### What the Obedience of Faith Looks Like Daily

**1. It begins with surrender, not effort.**
Before we can obey, we must yield. Each morning, present yourself to God: "Lord, I cannot obey in my own strength. Live Your life through me today."

**2. It trusts when it cannot see.**
Abraham "went out, not knowing whither he went." We may not understand every providence, every trial, every closed door. Faith obeys anyway, trusting the character of the One who leads.

**3. It values God's commands above human traditions.**
Are there areas where convenience, culture, or personal preference override clear biblical instruction? The obedience of faith chooses God's word over comfortable compromise.

**4. It extends to the thought life.**
Victory is not merely refraining from sinful actions but bringing "every thought" into captivity. This requires moment-by-moment dependence on the indwelling Christ.

**5. It produces love for others.**
The ultimate evidence of genuine faith-obedience is transformation of character:

> _"Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently."_ (1 Peter 1:22)

Obedience to truth produces genuine love. If our religion makes us harsh, critical, or unloving, something is fundamentally wrong with our faith.

### The Consequences of Disobedience

Scripture speaks solemnly of those who refuse the obedience of faith:

> _"The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (2 Thessalonians 1:7–8)

To "obey the gospel" means to respond to its invitation—repenting, believing, surrendering, following. Those who persistently refuse this invitation choose their own destiny.

## Appeal

> _"If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land."_ (Isaiah 1:19)

**Willing and obedient**—not merely one, but both. God seeks not forced compliance but glad surrender. He desires not slaves but sons and daughters who delight to do His will.

Abraham's faith-obedience led him on an incredible journey—from Ur to Canaan, from barrenness to promise fulfilled, from the altar on Moriah to a legacy that blesses all nations. Your faith-obedience leads somewhere equally significant: from slavery to sin into the glorious liberty of God's children, from the uncertainty of self-effort into the security of Christ's righteousness, from this present world into the eternal kingdom.

Will you, like Abraham, trust the One who calls—even when you cannot see where the path leads? Will you let faith work by love, producing glad obedience to every known duty?

Christ is both your Example and your Enabler. He walked the path of perfect obedience before you; now He offers to walk it again—in you, through you, for His name's sake.

_"Being confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ."_ (Philippians 1:6)

Surrender to Him today. He who calls you is faithful; He will surely do it.
