### Q1. In what order do the Sabbath and the first day stand in the week?”

> “In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the
> week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.” Matthew
> 28:1.

**Answer:** The inspired record of the New Testament provides an undeniable
chronological sequence for the events of the resurrection weekend. The text
places the Sabbath as the day _preceding_ the first day of the week (Sunday).

1.  **The Unbroken Cycle:** God established the weekly cycle at Creation
    (Genesis 2:1–3). This verse confirms that throughout the Old Testament era,
    down to the time of Christ, and even in the gospel record, the order
    remained unchanged. The Sabbath is the seventh day; Sunday is the first day.
2.  **No Sacred Transition:** There is no indication in this text—or any
    other—that the sanctity of the Sabbath was transferred to the day that
    followed it. The Sabbath ended before the first day began. The two days
    remain distinct: one is the holy rest day of the Creator; the other is a
    working day on which the women came to do labor (anointing the body).
3.  **A Fixed Memorial:** Just as a birthday commemorates a specific historical
    event that cannot be moved to a different date, the Sabbath commemorates a
    specific historical fact: God’s finished work of Creation.

**Definition:**

- **Sabbath:** From the Hebrew _shabbat_, meaning "to cease" or "to rest." It is
  the seventh day of the week, set apart by God for holy use.

**[ILL]** Imagine a row of seven books on a shelf. The seventh book is bound in
gold, while the first six are bound in common leather. If you take the first
book (Sunday) and place it at the end of the row, you have changed the order,
but you have not changed the nature of the book itself. It is still a common
book. Only the one God gilded (the seventh day) possesses the inherent value He
placed upon it. We cannot change God’s order.

### Q2. After the crucifixion, what day was kept by the women who followed Jesus?

> “And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath
> day according to the commandment.” Luke 23:56.

**Answer:** This verse is one of the most powerful testimonies regarding the
perpetuity of the Law of God in the New Testament.

1.  **Obedience in Crisis:** Even in their deepest grief, with their Lord dead
    and their hopes seemingly crushed, these faithful women did not forget the
    Law of God. Their love for Jesus did not lead them to ignore the
    commandment; rather, true love manifests itself in obedience (John 14:15).
2.  **"According to the Commandment":** Luke, writing under the inspiration of
    the Holy Spirit decades after the resurrection, does not say they rested
    according to "the old Jewish custom." He calls it "the commandment." This
    refers to the Fourth Commandment of the Decalogue (Exodus 20:8–11), showing
    it was still binding on Christians.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** These women illustrate the "patience of the
    saints" (Revelation 14:12). They had a living faith that produced works of
    obedience. They had prepared the spices (a work of love), but the
    commandment of God arrested their work. They rested in trust, waiting for
    God's time, which is the essence of the Sabbath experience—resting in God’s
    finished work rather than our own anxious labor.

**Definition:**

- **Decalogue:** A term for the Ten Commandments, the moral law of God written
  by His own finger (Exodus 31:18).

**[ILL]** A loyal soldier does not cease to obey the general's standing orders
just because the general has fallen on the battlefield. If anything, the soldier
is more meticulous to honor the leader's memory by adhering strictly to the last
command given. These women honored the Lord of the Sabbath by keeping the
Sabbath of the Lord, even while He lay in the tomb.

### Q3. What day is the Sabbath "according to the commandment?

> “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not
> do any work.” Exodus 20:10.

**Answer:** The commandment specified in Luke 23:56 is found here in Exodus.

1.  **Specific Identity:** God is precise. He did not say "a seventh day" or
    "one day in seven," but "_the_ seventh day." It is a specific segment of
    time made holy by God’s presence.
2.  **God’s Property:** The text calls it "the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." It
    is not "the Sabbath of the Jews." It belongs to Jehovah. To misappropriate
    this day for common use, or to substitute another day in its place, is to
    infringe upon the sovereignty of God.
3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:** This law was placed inside the Ark of the
    Covenant in the Most Holy Place (Deuteronomy 10:5; Revelation 11:19). Just
    as the Ark was the center of the earthly sanctuary, the Law of God
    (including the Sabbath) is the foundation of His government. Righteousness
    by faith means having this very law written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10),
    leading the believer to delight in the specific day God has chosen.

**[ILL]** If a wealthy benefactor writes a check for a specific person, only
that person can cash it. If the check is made out to "John," "James" cannot
claim it. God has placed His blessing on the Seventh Day. We cannot claim that
blessing on the First Day, because the "check" of God's blessing was not written
for that day.

### Q4. How did the holy women regard the first day of the week?

> “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto
> the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others
> with them.” Luke 24:1.

**Answer:** The actions of the disciples clearly distinguish between holy time
and working time.

1.  **A Day for Labor:** The women treated the first day of the week (Sunday) as
    a day for secular activity—traveling, carrying burdens, and applying spices.
    They did not regard it as sacred.
2.  **No Instruction of Change:** Had Jesus instructed them that the Sabbath
    would change to Sunday in honor of the resurrection, they would not have
    come to do this labor on Sunday morning. They would have treated Sunday as
    they treated the Sabbath—by resting.
3.  **Consistency:** Their practice reflects the consistent teaching of
    Scripture: six days are for labor, and the seventh is for rest. To keep
    Sunday as a Sabbath is a tradition of men, not a commandment of God (Matthew
    15:9).

**[ILL]** If a shopkeeper closes his store on a national holiday to honor the
king, but opens it wide for business the very next morning, he demonstrates
clearly which day he considers the holiday and which day he considers a business
day. The women "closed shop" on Sabbath and "opened for business" on Sunday.

### Q5. What was the custom of Christ in regard to the Sabbath?

> “And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and, as His custom
> was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.”
> Luke 4:16.

**Answer:** Jesus Christ, the Author of our salvation, was a Sabbath keeper.

1.  **Our Perfect Example:** The Apostle John writes, "He that saith he abideth
    in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked" (1 John 2:6). If we
    are to be Christians (Christ-followers), we must follow His steps. His
    custom was to worship on the Sabbath.
2.  **Righteousness Imputed:** Jesus lived a life of perfect obedience to the
    Law _for us_. This includes His observance of the fourth commandment. When
    we are justified by faith, Christ's perfect Sabbath-keeping is credited to
    our account.
3.  **Righteousness Imparted:** When Christ lives _in_ us by the Holy Spirit
    (Galatians 2:20), He will not do differently today than He did then. He is
    "the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever" (Hebrews 13:8). The
    indwelling Christ will lead the believer to keep the Sabbath just as the
    historical Christ did.

**Definition:**

- **Custom:** A habitual practice or established manner of behavior. For Jesus,
  Sabbath-keeping was not an accident; it was His lifestyle.

**[ILL]** A master artist teaches his apprentices by letting them watch him
paint. He guides their hands to follow his strokes. Jesus is the Master Artist
of life. He painted a perfect life on the canvas of time. He painted a "Sabbath
rest" on the seventh day. If we claim to be His students, why would we paint
over His work with a different color?

### Q6. In predicting the overthrow of Jerusalem, and the necessity of fleeing from Judea before that time, what did He enjoin upon His disciples regarding the Sabbath?

> “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath
> day.” Matthew 24:20.

**Answer:** This is a prophetic command that projects the sanctity of the
Sabbath far into the Christian era.

1.  **A Look into the Future:** Jesus was prophesying the destruction of
    Jerusalem, which occurred in A.D. 70—nearly 40 years after His resurrection.
2.  **The Sabbath Still Exists:** If the Sabbath was to be abolished at the
    cross (as some claim), Jesus would not have told them to pray about it 40
    years later. His command implies that the Sabbath would still be sacred and
    that His disciples would still be keeping it.
3.  **Practical Holiness:** Why pray not to flee on the Sabbath?
    - Because the confusion, haste, and travel involved in fleeing a besieged
      city would disrupt the holy rest and communion with God.
    - It shows God's care for the spiritual well-being of His people even amidst
      physical tribulation.
4.  **Victory through Prayer:** This teaches us to bring our future trials to
    God in prayer, asking that circumstances be arranged so we may keep His law.
    It is an act of faith to pray, "Lord, arrange my life so I do not have to
    break Thy Sabbath."

**[ILL]** If a father tells his son, "When you are grown and build your own
house, make sure you do not build the roof in the rainy season," he implies two
things: 1) The son will indeed build a house years later, and 2) The rainy
season will still exist. Jesus implies the Sabbath will still exist and be
precious to His people long after He has ascended.

### Q7. What title does Inspiration give to the day on which the Jews met in the synagogues?

> “For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in
> the synagogues every Sabbath day.” Acts 15:21.

**Answer:** Years after the establishment of the Christian church, the Holy
Spirit, speaking through the record of Acts, continues to call the seventh day
"the Sabbath."

1.  **No Redefinition:** The New Testament never calls Sunday "the Sabbath." It
    calls Sunday "the first day of the week." It consistently reserves the title
    "Sabbath" for the day the Jews (and Paul) were meeting on.
2.  **Continuity:** This verse is from the Jerusalem Council (c. A.D. 49). The
    leadership of the early church recognized the weekly cycle of reading the
    Scriptures on the Sabbath day.

**Definition:**

- **Inspiration:** The supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on the Bible
  writers, ensuring their words accurately convey God's truth (2 Timothy 3:16).

---

### Q8. To whom was Paul especially commissioned to preach?

> “But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way; for he [Paul] is a chosen vessel unto
> me, to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of
> Israel.” Acts 9:15. (See also Acts 22:21; Romans 1:5).

**Answer:** Paul is known as the "Apostle to the Gentiles."

1.  **The Relevance:** If the Sabbath were only a "Jewish institution" meant to
    end with the old covenant, Paul—the specific messenger to the non-Jewish
    world—would have been the one to announce its abolition.
2.  **The Silence:** Instead, as we shall see in the following questions, Paul
    consistently preached on the Sabbath and led Gentiles to worship on that
    day. He taught the Gentiles that they were "grafted in" to the spiritual
    stock of Israel (Romans 11:17), partaking of the same covenants and promises
    (Ephesians 2:12–13).

**Definition:**

- **Gentiles:** In the Bible, anyone who is not of Jewish descent. In the New
  Testament, this refers to the nations of the world to whom the Gospel was
  sent.

---

### Q9. On what day did he and Barnabas go into the synagogue at Antioch?

> “But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went
> into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.” Acts 13:14.

**Answer:** Paul’s practice was to utilize the Sabbath for worship and
evangelism.

1.  **Opportunity:** The synagogue provided an audience, but the day provided
    the _time_. It was the day people were free from labor and gathered to hear
    the Word.
2.  **Recognition:** By attending the synagogue on the Sabbath, Paul validated
    the day as the appropriate time for the study of Scripture.

---

### Q10. After the sermon had been preached by Paul, and the Jews had all left the synagogue, what did the Gentiles request of the apostles?

> “And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that
> these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.” Acts 13:42.

**Answer:** This is a critical historical point regarding the Sabbath and the
Gentiles.

1.  **The Missing Opportunity:** If Sunday were the new "Christian Sabbath,"
    this was the perfect moment for Paul to say: "No need to wait a whole week!
    Come back tomorrow, on the first day, which is the Lord's Day."
2.  **The Reality:** Paul did not say this. The record shows the Gentiles
    understood that if they wanted to hear the Word of God again, they must wait
    for the "next Sabbath."
3.  **Gentile Hunger:** These were not Jews bound by tradition; these were
    Gentiles hungry for the Gospel. Yet their engagement with the Gospel was
    centered around the Sabbath cycle.

**[ILL]** If a restaurant serves a special meal only on Friday, and a customer
comes on Friday just as the kitchen closes, he asks, "Can I have this meal next
Friday?" If the restaurant actually served that meal every day, the waiter would
say, "Come back tomorrow!" The fact that they waited for the next Sabbath shows
they understood that was the appointed time for assembly.

---

### Q11. What was the result of this request of the Gentiles?”

> “And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word
> of God.” Acts 13:44.

**Answer:**

1.  **Massive Assembly:** The following Sabbath, a mixed multitude—Jews and
    Gentiles—gathered. The Sabbath was the rally point for the preaching of the
    Gospel.
2.  **Word of God:** Note that they gathered to hear "the word of God." The
    Sabbath is the day created for the reception of God's Word. It provides the
    quiet and the focus necessary to digest spiritual truth.
3.  **Universal Scope:** The Sabbath was made for "man" (Mark 2:27), not just
    the Jew. Here we see that fulfilled as the "whole city" gathers.

---

### Q12. On what day did the women at Philippi hold their prayer meetings?

> “And on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was
> wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted
> thither.” Acts 16:13.

**Answer:** This incident proves that Paul kept the Sabbath even when there was
no Jewish synagogue.

1.  **Nature's Sanctuary:** In Philippi, there apparently was no synagogue. Yet,
    Paul and his companions did not treat the Sabbath as a common day. They
    sought a place of prayer by the river.
2.  **Christian Practice:** This was a Christian gathering. Lydia, a worshiper
    of God, was converted here. This establishes that the Sabbath was observed
    by the apostles and converts apart from Jewish liturgy or buildings.
3.  **Sanctuary Truth:** The river side provided a natural place for cleansing
    and quiet, fitting for the Sabbath which is a sign of God's sanctifying
    power (Ezekiel 20:12).

**[ILL]** A man who only attends church to be seen by others will stop going
when he moves to a wilderness. But a man who loves God will build an altar even
in the desert. Paul kept the Sabbath by the river because the Sabbath was in his
heart, not just in the synagogue structure.

---

### Q13. What shows that upon his arrival in the city, the apostle waited for the Sabbath before attempting to hold a meeting?

> “And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of
> Macedonia, and a colony; and we were in that city abiding certain days.” Acts
> 16:12.

**Answer:**

1.  **Intentional Waiting:** Paul arrived and stayed "certain days." He did not
    call a meeting immediately. He waited for the Sabbath.
2.  **Divine Appointment:** Paul understood that the Sabbath carries a special
    blessing—God's presence is in the time itself. He waited for the time God
    had appointed to perform his ministry.

---

### Q14. What was Paul's customary day for holding religious services?

> “They came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: and Paul, as
> his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days reasoned with them
> out of the Scriptures.” Acts 17:1, 2.

**Answer:**

1.  **"As His Manner Was":** Just as Luke 4:16 described Jesus' "custom," Acts
    17:2 describes Paul's "manner." The servant follows the Master.
2.  **Reasoning from Scripture:** True Sabbath keeping involves the intellect as
    well as the heart. It is a time to reason "out of the Scriptures." The
    Sabbath is the day for Bible study.
3.  **Foundation of Faith:** Paul used the Sabbath to establish the
    Thessalonians in the faith. The Sabbath and the Scriptures go together; one
    provides the time for the other.

---

### Q15. How did the apostle spend the working days of the week when at Corinth?

> “After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; and found
> a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his
> wife Priscilla... and because he was of the same craft, he abode with them,
> and wrought; for by their occupation they were tent makers.” Acts 18:1–3.

**Answer:**

1.  **Honest Labor:** The Fourth Commandment has two parts: "Remember the
    Sabbath day to keep it holy" and "Six days shalt thou labor" (Exodus
    20:8–9). Paul obeyed both.
2.  **Working on Sunday:** If Paul worked "six days," this necessarily included
    the first day of the week (Sunday). There is no record of him treating
    Sunday as holy. He was a tentmaker, earning his bread to support his
    ministry (2 Thessalonians 3:8).
3.  **Sanctification of Work:** The Christian life involves faithfulness in
    secular duties (Monday–Friday/Sunday) as well as sacred duties (Sabbath).
    Righteousness by faith makes a man a better worker and a faithful Sabbath
    keeper.

---

### Q16. What did he do on the Sabbath days?

> “And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and
> the Greeks.” Acts 18:4.

**Answer:**

1.  **Every Sabbath:** Not just occasional attendance. There was a regular,
    rhythmic pattern to his ministry.
2.  **Jews and Greeks:** Again, the text emphasizes that Greeks (Gentiles) were
    present and being persuaded on the Sabbath. The distinction that "Sabbath is
    for Jews, Sunday is for Gentiles" is foreign to the book of Acts.

---

### Q17. How long did he continue this work?”

> “And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among
> them.” Acts 18:11.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Math of Evidence:**
    - Paul was in Corinth for 18 months.
    - 18 months × 4 weeks = approximately **72 to 78 Sabbaths**.
    - During this time, he worked at tent-making on the other days (including
      Sundays).
2.  **Overwhelming Proof:** We have a record here of nearly 80 Sabbath services
    held by the Apostle to the Gentiles in one city alone. In contrast, the New
    Testament contains only one instance of a religious meeting held on the
    first day of the week (Acts 20:7), which was actually a Saturday night
    meeting (biblically, the first day begins at sundown) where Paul preached
    until midnight before traveling the next morning.
3.  **Conclusion:** The weight of New Testament history is entirely on the side
    of the seventh-day Sabbath.

---

### Q18. On what day was John in the Spirit?”

> “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and heard behind me a great voice, as
> of a trumpet.” Revelation 1:10.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Vision:** John, the last surviving apostle, exiled on Patmos, receives
    the Revelation. He marks the time of this vision as "the Lord's Day."
2.  **A Specific Day:** The term is possessive. The Lord claims a specific day
    as His own. It is not "a Lord's day" but "_the_ Lord's Day."
3.  **The Question:** Which day is the Lord's? The text of Revelation 1:10
    doesn't identify it, so we must let the rest of the Bible define its own
    terms.

---

### Q19. Who is Lord of the Sabbath?

> “Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” Mark 2:28.

**Answer:**

1.  **Biblical Definition:** If we ask Scripture "What day belongs to the
    Lord?", Jesus answers clearly: "The Son of man is Lord... of the Sabbath."
2.  **Logical Conclusion:**
    - Premise 1: The "Lord's Day" is the day of which Christ is Lord.
    - Premise 2: Christ is Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28).
    - Conclusion: The Sabbath is the Lord's Day.
3.  **Freedom, not Bondage:** Jesus made this statement to refute the legalistic
    burdens the Pharisees had piled on the Sabbath. He reminded them that He
    (the Creator) made the Sabbath for man's benefit (Mark 2:27). To accept Him
    as Lord is to accept the gift of His Sabbath—a day of freedom and communion,
    not legalism.

**[ILL]** If a King declares himself "Lord of the Palace," then the Palace is
the "Lord's House." You cannot point to the barn and say, "That is the Lord's
House," unless the King has specifically claimed it. Jesus claimed the Sabbath.
He never claimed the first day.

---

### Q20. Who else besides Christ claims the Sabbath as His day?

> “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My
> [God's] holy day...” Isaiah 58:13.

**Answer:**

1.  **"My Holy Day":** Jehovah, the Father, calls the Sabbath "My holy day."
2.  **Unity of Father and Son:** There is no contradiction. The Father calls it
    His; the Son calls Himself its Lord. It is the possession of the Godhead.
3.  **True Observance:** This verse in Isaiah also teaches us _how_ to keep
    it—not by doing "thy pleasure" (secular entertainment or business) but by
    calling the Sabbath a "delight." We delight in the Lord, and therefore we
    delight in His day.

---

### Q21. Why does God call it His day?

> “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
> is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day,
> and hallowed it.” Exodus 20:11.

**Answer:**

1.  **Creation Rights:** God claims the Sabbath because He created it. It is the
    memorial of His creative power.
2.  **Sign of Authority:** Every ruler has a seal or sign of authority. The
    Sabbath is God's seal—it contains His Name (the Lord thy God), His Title
    (Creator/Maker), and His Territory (Heaven and Earth).
3.  **Resting in His Work:** God rested not because He was tired (Isaiah 40:28),
    but to set an example. He rested in the completion of His work. In the
    Gospel, we rest in the finished work of Christ (justification). The Sabbath
    is the outward sign of that inward rest of faith (Hebrews 4:9–10).

**Definition:**

- **Hallowed:** To make holy, sanctify, or set apart for sacred use.

---

### Q22. But how did God create the world?

> “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the
> fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son,
> whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds.”
> Hebrews 1:1, 2.

**Answer:**

1.  **Christ the Agent of Creation:** The New Testament reveals that God the
    Father created all things _through_ Jesus Christ (see also John 1:1–3;
    Colossians 1:16).
2.  **The Conclusion:**
    - Since Christ made the worlds, Christ rested on the seventh day of
      Creation.
    - Since Christ rested, He is the Maker of the Sabbath.
    - Therefore, the Sabbath is a Christian institution, made by Christ before
      sin entered the world.
3.  **The Gospel Connection:** The Power that created the world is the Power
    that recreates the sinner (2 Corinthians 5:17). The Sabbath is the link
    between Creation and Redemption. By keeping the Sabbath, we acknowledge
    Christ as our Creator and our Redeemer. We cease from our own works and
    trust in His power to make us holy.

**[ILL]** A celebrated architect designs a magnificent cathedral. Years later,
he returns to restore it after it has been damaged. The same genius that built
it is required to restore it. Christ built the universe and established the
Sabbath. He came to earth to restore the damaged soul of man. The Sabbath stands
as the timeless monument to His power to both build and rebuild, to create and
to redeem.
