# Reading 89: The New Testament Sabbath

## Introduction

One of the most significant questions facing Christians today concerns the weekly day of worship. Did the New Testament church abandon the seventh-day Sabbath in favor of Sunday? Or did Christ and His apostles continue to honor the Sabbath "according to the commandment"? The biblical record speaks clearly—and the evidence may surprise those who have never carefully examined it.

## Core Truths

### The Sabbath's Position in the Week

The New Testament clearly distinguishes between the Sabbath and the first day of the week:

> _"In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher."_ (Matthew 28:1)

Notice the inspired order: **the Sabbath ends, then the first day begins**. These are consecutive but distinct days. The Sabbath comes first in the weekly cycle, followed by the first day—what we now call Saturday and Sunday respectively.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "in the end of the Sabbath" uses the Greek word _opse_, indicating the Sabbath was concluding as dawn approached. The biblical day runs from sunset to sunset (Leviticus 23:32), so this describes the transition from Sabbath to Sunday at daybreak.

### The Women's Sabbath Observance

After Christ's crucifixion on Friday, what did His most devoted followers do?

> _"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment."_ (Luke 23:56)

Consider the profound significance of this verse:

- These women had just witnessed their beloved Master's brutal death
- They desperately wanted to anoint His body with burial spices
- Yet they **rested on the Sabbath day according to the commandment**
- Only after the Sabbath ended did they proceed to the tomb (Luke 24:1)

[Q] **"But wasn't this simply Jewish custom, not binding on Christians?"**

Luke, writing years after the resurrection and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, describes their Sabbath rest as "according to the commandment." He does not say "according to Jewish tradition" or "according to their former custom." The commandment referenced is unmistakable:

> _"But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work."_ (Exodus 20:10)

If the Sabbath had been abolished at the cross, Luke would hardly have commended these women for keeping it "according to the commandment."

### Christ's Personal Practice

What was Jesus' own relationship to the Sabbath?

> _"And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read."_ (Luke 4:16)

The phrase "as His custom was" reveals habitual, lifelong practice—not occasional attendance. Jesus consistently kept the seventh-day Sabbath throughout His earthly ministry.

[ILL] A child learning to walk does not follow a stranger but follows the parent who leads the way. So Christians, learning to walk in holiness, do not follow human traditions but follow Christ—who Himself kept the Sabbath holy. We are told to walk "even as He walked" (1 John 2:6).

### The Sabbath Beyond the Cross

Some teach that the Sabbath ended at the cross. But notice Christ's instruction regarding Jerusalem's destruction, which occurred in A.D. 70—**forty years after the crucifixion**:

> _"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day."_ (Matthew 24:20)

Why would Jesus tell His disciples to pray about the Sabbath in A.D. 70 if it would cease to exist in A.D. 31? This instruction only makes sense if Christ expected His followers to still be keeping the Sabbath nearly four decades after His resurrection.

[DYK🔎] The early Christians heeded Christ's warning. When the Roman armies surrounded Jerusalem in A.D. 66 and then mysteriously withdrew, the Christians fled to Pella across the Jordan River, remembering Jesus' words. Not one Christian perished in Jerusalem's destruction.

## Deeper Truths

### Apostolic Sabbath Practice

The book of Acts provides a remarkable record of apostolic worship patterns. Let us examine the evidence systematically.

**Paul at Antioch in Pisidia (Acts 13:14-44)**

> _"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down."_ (Acts 13:14)

After Paul's sermon, the Jews departed, but notice what happened next:

> _"And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath."_ (Acts 13:42)

[Q] **"Wasn't Paul just meeting on Sabbath to reach Jews, not because he kept it?"**

Consider the circumstances carefully:

- The Jews had already left
- Only Gentiles remained
- Paul was specifically commissioned as the apostle to the Gentiles (Acts 9:15; Romans 1:5)
- If Sunday were the new Christian holy day, this was the perfect opportunity to announce it

Yet Paul made no mention of gathering the next day—Sunday. Instead:

> _"And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God."_ (Acts 13:44)

This was approximately A.D. 45—fourteen years after the resurrection—and the Sabbath remained the day of worship for Jews and Gentiles alike.

**Paul at Philippi (Acts 16:12-13)**

> _"And we were in that city abiding certain days. And on the Sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made."_ (Acts 16:12-13)

Paul arrived in Philippi and waited several days—apparently including at least one Sunday—before holding a religious meeting. He waited specifically for the Sabbath. This indicates that Sunday was not regarded as a day of worship even in this largely Gentile city.

**Paul at Thessalonica (Acts 17:1-2)**

> _"And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures."_ (Acts 17:1-2)

Luke describes Sabbath attendance as Paul's "manner"—his regular custom, his habitual practice.

**Paul at Corinth (Acts 18:1-4, 11)**

Paul's ministry in Corinth provides perhaps the most extensive record:

> _"And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks."_ (Acts 18:4)

> _"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them."_ (Acts 18:11)

[DYK🔎] A year and six months contains approximately **78 Sabbaths**. Combined with the 3 Sabbaths at Thessalonica, 1 at Philippi, and 2 at Antioch, we have a biblical record of at least **84 Sabbaths** on which Paul held religious services. By contrast, Scripture records only one first-day meeting—a night gathering at Troas (Acts 20:7-12), held after the Sabbath had ended.

What did Paul do on the other days of the week?

> _"And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tent makers."_ (Acts 18:3)

Paul worked during the week—including Sundays—and worshiped on the Sabbath. This was his consistent practice.

### The Lord's Day

> _"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet."_ (Revelation 1:10)

[Q] **"Doesn't 'the Lord's day' refer to Sunday, commemorating Christ's resurrection?"**

Scripture never calls Sunday "the Lord's day." But Scripture clearly identifies which day belongs to the Lord:

> _"Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath."_ (Mark 2:28)

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day..."_ (Isaiah 58:13)

The only day God claims as "My holy day" in Scripture is the seventh-day Sabbath. Christ specifically declared Himself "Lord of the Sabbath"—not Lord of the first day.

### Christ's Right to the Sabbath

Why can Christ claim to be Lord of the Sabbath?

> _"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."_ (Exodus 20:11)

But how did God create the world?

> _"God... hath in these last days spoken unto us by His Son, whom He hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds."_ (Hebrews 1:1-2)

When God rested from His creative work, the Son—by whom this work was performed—rested also. Christ is Lord of the Sabbath **by right of creation**. He made it; He rested on it; He blessed it; He hallowed it. It is His day.

[ILL] When an artist signs a masterpiece, that signature declares ownership and authorship. The Sabbath is God's signature on creation—it identifies Him as Creator and distinguishes Him from all false gods. To keep the Sabbath is to honor the Artist; to disregard it is to ignore His signature.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sabbath in God's Plan

The Sabbath holds a unique position in the great controversy between Christ and Satan. It is:

- **A sign of creation**: Identifying the true God as Maker of heaven and earth (Exodus 20:11)
- **A sign of sanctification**: Marking those whom God is making holy (Ezekiel 20:12)
- **A sign of rest in Christ**: Pointing to the spiritual rest believers find in their Savior (Hebrews 4:9-10)
- **A test of loyalty**: Revealing whether we follow God's Word or human tradition

In the heavenly sanctuary, the law of God—including the fourth commandment—rests in the ark of the covenant within the Most Holy Place (Revelation 11:19). What God enshrines in heaven's holiest place, we should not trample underfoot on earth.

### Righteousness by Faith and Sabbath Rest

The Sabbath beautifully illustrates righteousness by faith. Just as we cannot create anything during six days of work that equals what God created, neither can we produce righteousness by our own efforts. The Sabbath teaches us to **cease from our works and rest in His**:

> _"There remaineth therefore a rest [Greek: sabbatismos—a Sabbath-keeping] to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from His."_ (Hebrews 4:9-10)

True Sabbath-keeping is not legalism—it is the outward expression of an inward rest in Christ. We keep it not to be saved, but because we are saved and desire to honor our Creator and Redeemer.

## Practical Application

The New Testament evidence is clear: Christ kept the Sabbath, the apostles kept the Sabbath, and both Jewish and Gentile believers worshiped on the seventh day throughout the apostolic period.

**This truth calls us to:**

1. **Honest examination**: Have we followed Scripture or tradition in our worship practice?
2. **Courageous obedience**: Will we follow Christ even when it differs from popular custom?
3. **Joyful rest**: Will we accept the gift of Sabbath rest as a weekly blessing, not a burden?
4. **Faithful testimony**: Will we share this truth with others who have never examined it?

The Sabbath is not a relic of the Old Testament or a burden imposed on unwilling subjects. It is a gift from Creation, confirmed by Christ, practiced by the apostles, and awaiting all who will enter into God's rest.

## Appeal

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord."_ (Isaiah 58:13-14)

Friend, the evidence of Scripture stands before you. The seventh-day Sabbath was kept by Christ, observed by the apostles, and honored by the early church. No command in Scripture transfers its sacredness to another day.

Jesus invites you today: _"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"_ (Matthew 11:28). Will you accept His invitation? Will you rest in His finished work—both the work of creation and the work of redemption? Will you, like the holy women at the tomb, keep "the Sabbath day according to the commandment"?

The decision is yours. But remember—you follow a Savior who said, _"If ye love Me, keep My commandments"_ (John 14:15). And He Himself declared, _"The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath."_
