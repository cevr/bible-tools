# Reading 171: Evils of City Life

## Introduction

The story of Lot stands as a solemn warning across the ages. A man who began his journey walking with Abraham, the friend of God, ended his days in a mountain cave, having lost nearly everything—his wife, his sons-in-law, his possessions, and the moral integrity of his own daughters. What led to this tragic downfall? A single choice: Lot "pitched his tent toward Sodom." In this study, we trace the spiritual principles that made city life so dangerous then, and why Christ Himself pointed back to Sodom's destruction as a pattern for the end of the world.

## Core Truths

### The Fatal Choice

When Abraham generously offered Lot first choice of the land, Lot made his decision based entirely on outward appearance and material advantage:

> _"And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord. ...Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan."_ (Genesis 13:10, 11)

The plain looked like "the garden of the Lord"—paradise itself. But Lot's eyes deceived him. He saw fertility; he did not see corruption. He calculated profit; he did not calculate the cost to his soul and family.

Notice the progression of his descent:

1. **He "beheld"**—he looked with longing (Genesis 13:10)
2. **He "chose"**—he acted on desire (Genesis 13:11)
3. **He "pitched his tent toward Sodom"**—he moved closer (Genesis 13:12)
4. **He "dwelt in Sodom"**—he settled inside (Genesis 14:12)
5. **He "sat in the gate of Sodom"**—he became part of its civic life (Genesis 19:1)

[DYK🔎] In ancient cities, sitting "in the gate" indicated a position of leadership and judgment. Lot had not only moved to Sodom—he had become one of its respected citizens, deeply entangled in its affairs.

### The Character of Sodom

Scripture gives us a remarkably detailed portrait of Sodom's sins:

> _"Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before Me."_ (Ezekiel 16:49, 50)

The sins of Sodom were not merely the gross immorality recorded in Genesis 19. They began with:

- **Pride**—self-exaltation and independence from God
- **Fullness of bread**—material prosperity without gratitude
- **Abundance of idleness**—leisure without purpose
- **Neglect of the poor**—hardness of heart toward those in need
- **Haughtiness**—contempt for divine and moral authority

These conditions created the soil in which "abomination" flourished. The open wickedness was the fruit; the root was prosperity without God.

[Q] **"Aren't these sins found everywhere, not just in cities?"**

Indeed, sin is present wherever fallen humanity dwells. But cities concentrate these conditions. The anonymity of crowds, the constant stimulation, the pursuit of pleasure and commerce, the removal from nature's rhythms and God's quiet voice—all combine to accelerate spiritual decline. Cities become, as Scripture calls Babylon, "the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit" (Revelation 18:2).

## Deeper Truths

### The Cost of Compromise

Lot did not intend to become a Sodomite. He was a "righteous man" whose soul was "vexed" daily by what he saw and heard:

> _"For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds."_ (2 Peter 2:8)

Yet consider what Lot lost:

- **His testimony**—When he warned his sons-in-law of judgment, "he seemed as one that mocked" (Genesis 19:14). Years of compromise had destroyed his credibility.
- **His wife**—Her heart was still in Sodom; she looked back and perished (Genesis 19:26).
- **His children**—His married daughters perished with their husbands. His surviving daughters, morally corrupted by Sodom, committed incest with their father (Genesis 19:30-38).
- **His influence**—Not one soul was converted through Lot's years in Sodom.

[ILL] A frog placed in boiling water will leap out immediately. But place that same frog in cool water and gradually heat it, and the frog will remain until it is cooked to death. So it is with the soul that dwells in environments of evil. The conscience that once recoiled in horror grows dull through constant exposure. What shocked us yesterday becomes tolerable today and acceptable tomorrow.

### Christ's Solemn Warning

Jesus did not leave Sodom's story as ancient history. He made it a direct prophecy of the last days:

> _"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed."_ (Luke 17:28-30)

Notice what characterized those days: ordinary activities—eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building. The sin was not in these activities themselves, but in the complete absorption in temporal affairs to the exclusion of eternal realities. They had no thought of God, no sense of approaching judgment, no preparation for eternity.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "revealed" in Luke 17:30 is _apokaluptetai_—the same root as "Apocalypse" (Revelation). Christ's second coming will be an unveiling, a sudden disclosure of reality that catches the unprepared in utter surprise.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Typology of Judgment

The destruction of Sodom serves as a divinely appointed "ensample" (pattern) of final judgment:

> _"And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly."_ (2 Peter 2:6)

The seventh plague reveals the ultimate fulfillment:

> _"And the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath."_ (Revelation 16:19)

In the great controversy, cities have often been centers of rebellion against God—from Babel's tower (Genesis 11) to Babylon's golden image (Daniel 3) to Rome's persecution of the saints. The fall of "the cities of the nations" represents the final collapse of human systems built in defiance of heaven.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, fire from God's presence consumed the sacrifice on the altar—representing both the death of Christ for sin and the final destruction of the impenitent. The fire that fell on Sodom was "from the Lord out of heaven" (Genesis 19:24)—a foretaste of that day when God's glory, which is life to the righteous, becomes consuming fire to those who have rejected His mercy.

The investigative judgment now proceeding in heaven's Most Holy Place determines who has truly accepted Christ's sacrifice and who, like Lot's wife, has a heart still turned toward Sodom. When that work is finished, Christ will pronounce: "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still" (Revelation 22:11).

### Righteousness by Faith and the Call Out

God's call to leave Sodom was not merely geographical—it was spiritual. The same call echoes in Revelation:

> _"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."_ (Revelation 18:4)

This "coming out" cannot be accomplished by human effort alone. Lot himself "lingered" (Genesis 19:16), and the angels had to physically seize his hand and pull him from the city. So Christ, by His grace, must take us by the hand and deliver us from the entanglements of this present evil world. We cannot save ourselves; we can only consent to be saved.

## Practical Application

### Examining Our Choices

Every Christian must ask:

1. **What influences my decisions?** Am I, like Lot, choosing based on material advantage and outward appearance? Or am I seeking first the kingdom of God? (Matthew 6:33)

2. **Where is my tent pitched?** Not only physically, but spiritually—where are my affections? What entertainment, associations, and environments am I choosing for myself and my family?

3. **Is my testimony credible?** If I warned others of coming judgment, would they listen? Or have years of compromise made me seem "as one that mocked"?

4. **Is my heart still in Sodom?** Like Lot's wife, we may be physically departing while our affections remain behind. Christ's command is absolute: "Remember Lot's wife" (Luke 17:32).

### Practical Counsel

For those living in cities:

- **Guard your spiritual life** with extraordinary diligence through prayer, Scripture study, and fellowship with believers
- **Limit exposure** to the stimulation, entertainment, and philosophy of the city
- **Maintain connection** with nature, where God's voice is more easily heard
- **Seriously consider** whether God is calling you to relocate, especially for the sake of children

[Q] **"Is it always wrong to live in a city?"**

Not necessarily. God has workers in cities who are called to minister there. But Scripture's counsel is clear: cities are dangerous environments for spiritual growth, especially for families. Those who remain must do so with eyes open, with extraordinary vigilance, and with a clear sense of divine calling—not merely for convenience or financial gain.

## Appeal

> _"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."_ (Genesis 19:17)

The angel's urgent command to Lot speaks to us today. The world is ripening for destruction. The very conditions Christ described are all around us—eating, drinking, buying, selling, marrying, building—all without thought of eternity.

Where is your heart? Where are your affections? Have you, perhaps unconsciously, pitched your tent toward Sodom?

God is calling His people to come out—out of the world's spirit, out of its entanglements, out of its values and priorities. This is not a call to isolation, but to consecration. It is a call to be in the world but not of it (John 17:15-16).

Christ reaches out His hand today, as the angels reached out to Lot. He offers deliverance—not merely from physical danger, but from the love of this present world that destroys the soul. Will you take His hand? Will you look forward, not back?

> _"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."_ (2 Corinthians 6:17, 18)
