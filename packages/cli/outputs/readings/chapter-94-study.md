### Q1. When and by what acts was the Sabbath made?

“And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on
the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh
day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work which
God created and made.” (Genesis 2:2, 3)

**Answer:**

The Sabbath was established at the very foundation of the world, before the
entrance of sin. It is not a Jewish institution but a divine gift to the human
race (Mark 2:27). The text reveals three distinct acts of God that constituted
the making of the Sabbath:

1.  **God Rested:** This was not due to physical fatigue, for the Creator
    "fainteth not, neither is weary" (Isaiah 40:28). It was a "rest" of
    satisfaction and completion. Just as Christ cried "It is finished" upon the
    cross to mark the completion of redemption (John 19:30), God rested at
    Creation to mark the perfection of His creative work.
2.  **God Blessed:** He placed a special spiritual favor upon the seventh day
    that is not placed upon the other six. To "bless" is to endow with the power
    to communicate life and well-being.
3.  **God Sanctified:** To **sanctify** means "to set apart for a holy use." By
    sanctifying the seventh day, God placed a distinction between the holy and
    the common (Ezekiel 22:26).

**Doctrinal Insight: Righteousness by Faith** The Sabbath is the very first
lesson in Righteousness by Faith. Adam and Eve had been created on the sixth
day. Their first full day of life was God's Sabbath. They did not work to earn
the Sabbath; they entered into a rest that God had already prepared.

- **Justification:** We rest in the finished work of Christ, just as Adam rested
  in the finished work of Creation (Hebrews 4:10).
- **Sanctification:** We allow God to make us holy, just as He made the day
  holy. We cannot make ourselves holy any more than we can create a world.

**[ILL] illustration:** Imagine a wealthy father builds a beautiful home for his
child. Before the child moves in, the father finishes every detail—painting,
furnishing, and stocking the pantry. When the child arrives, he does not pick up
a hammer to "finish" the house; he simply enters the home and enjoys what the
father has done. This is the Sabbath experience: resting in what God has done,
rather than striving to save ourselves by our own works.

### Q2. What important division of time is marked off by the Sabbath?

**Answer:**

The Sabbath marks off **the week**.

While other divisions of time are governed by the movements of heavenly bodies,
the week is unique:

- **The Year:** Marked by the earth’s orbit around the sun.
- **The Month:** Marked by the moon’s orbit around the earth.
- **The Day:** Marked by the earth’s rotation on its axis.

The seven-day weekly cycle has no astronomical basis. It stands solely upon the
authority of God's word and the history of Creation (Genesis 1; Exodus 20:11).
It is a standing memorial that God is the Creator and Sovereign of time.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you find a clock keeping perfect time, you know a
clockmaker designed it. But if you find a recurring cycle of seven days that has
continued for millennia without any star or planet to dictate it, you have found
the fingerprint of God on history. The week is a monument to the Creator that no
atheist or skeptic can explain away.

### Q3. Two thousand five hundred years after creation, the Sabbath was proclaimed, with the other moral commands, from Mount Sinai. Why did God say He had put His blessing upon that day?

“For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and
hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:11)

**Answer:**

God pointed backward to Creation as the reason for the Law. This proves that the
Sabbath was not a new invention for the Jews at Sinai, but a codification of an
eternal truth.

1.  **The Reason:** "For in six days the Lord made..." The Sabbath is the seal
    of God's authority. It identifies _who_ is giving the law (the Creator) and
    _what_ is the extent of His dominion (heaven and earth).
2.  **The Command:** "Remember." This implies the institution was already known
    but had been obscured during the long years of Egyptian bondage.
3.  **The Nature of the Law:** The Ten Commandments are a transcript of God's
    character (Psalm 119:172; Romans 7:12). Since God does not change (Malachi
    3:6), His moral law—including the Sabbath—is immutable.

**Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the Ten Commandments were
placed inside the Ark of the Covenant, beneath the Mercy Seat (Exodus 25:16,
21). In the heavenly sanctuary, John saw the "ark of his testament" (Revelation
11:19). The Sabbath lies at the heart of the law in the Most Holy Place,
protected by the very presence of God.

### Q4. What befell the city of Jerusalem when it was captured by the king of Babylon?

“And all the vessels of the house of God... he brought to Babylon. And they
burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the
palaces thereof with fire.” (2 Chronicles 36:18, 19)

**Answer:**

Jerusalem was totally destroyed, the temple burned, and the people taken into
captivity. This was a physical manifestation of a spiritual reality: when God's
people remove themselves from His protection by persistent disobedience, they
are left vulnerable to the destroyer.

**Definitions:**

- **Captivity:** A state of being imprisoned or controlled. Spiritually, sin
  leads to captivity (Romans 7:23).
- **Vessels of the House of God:** Sacred items used in the sanctuary service.
  Their removal signified that the glory of God had departed because the
  covenant had been broken.

---

### Q5. Of what prophecy was this a fulfillment?

“But if ye will not hearken unto Me to hallow the Sabbath day, and not to bear a
burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then I
will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall not be quenched.”
(Jeremiah 17:27)

**Answer:**

Jeremiah had warned that the specific sin of **Sabbath-breaking** would lead to
the destruction of the nation.

1.  **The Thermometer of Faith:** The Sabbath is a test of loyalty. If Israel
    would not trust God enough to cease their business and secular labor one day
    a week, it proved they did not trust Him for their daily bread or their
    national security.
2.  **The Fire:** The "unquenchable fire" does not mean a fire that never stops
    burning, but a fire that cannot be put out until it has completely done its
    work of destruction (Jude 7).

**Doctrinal Insight:** Why is the Sabbath singled out? Because it represents the
relationship between the saved and the Savior. To reject the Sabbath is to
reject the sign of sanctification (Exodus 31:13). It is to say, "I will manage
my own life and time; I do not need God's rest." This is the spirit of
self-righteousness and rebellion.

### Q6. After the restoration of Israel from the Babylonian captivity, what was said to have been the reason of their punishment?

“Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing
is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath day? Did not your fathers thus, and
did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring
more wrath upon Israel by profaning the Sabbath.” (Nehemiah 13:17, 18)

**Answer:**

Nehemiah, the governor, identified Sabbath profanation as the root cause of the
Captivity. He understood that true revival (Righteousness by Faith) results in
obedience.

- **Profane:** To treat something holy as if it were common or ordinary.
- **Reformation:** Nehemiah did not just preach; he closed the gates of
  Jerusalem as the Sabbath approached (Nehemiah 13:19). He understood that grace
  does not invalidate the law (Romans 3:31).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a man crashes his car because he ignored the traffic
lights, and the doctor heals him (grace), does the man then have the right to go
back and ignore the traffic lights again? No. His restoration obligates him to
be even more careful. Nehemiah argued that since God had graciously restored
Israel, they should not return to the sin of Sabbath-breaking that caused the
crash in the first place.

### Q7. How did Christ regard the Sabbath during His earthly ministry?

“And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and, as His custom was,
He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” (Luke
4:16)

**Answer:**

Jesus, our Example, kept the Sabbath.

1.  **"As His custom was":** It was His lifelong habit.
2.  **Magnifying the Law:** Jesus did not abolish the Sabbath; He rescued it
    from the burdensome traditions of the Pharisees. He taught that it is
    "lawful to do well on the Sabbath days" (Matthew 12:12).
3.  **Imputed Righteousness:** Jesus kept the whole law perfectly _for us_. If
    He had broken the Sabbath, He would have been a sinner and could not be our
    Savior (1 John 3:4). His perfect Sabbath-keeping is part of the robe of
    righteousness He offers to us.

### Q8. How did He wish to have it regarded by His disciples at the siege of Jerusalem, nearly forty years after His death?

“But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.”
(Matthew 24:20)

**Answer:**

Jesus was looking forward to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70—nearly 40
years after His resurrection.

1.  **Enduring Validity:** If the Sabbath was to be nailed to the cross and
    abolished, Jesus would not have told His disciples to pray about it 40 years
    in the future.
2.  **Practical Faith:** He wanted them to be free to flee without the hindrance
    of winter weather or the mental and spiritual concern of fleeing on the holy
    Sabbath day. This confirms that in the mind of Christ, the Sabbath would
    still be sacred to His church long after the Cross.

### Q9. What was the first effort of the Roman Church in behalf of the recognition of Sunday?

“In A.D. 196, Victor, Bishop of Rome, attempted to impose on all the churches
the Roman custom of having Easter fall every year on Sunday.” (Bower's History
of the Popes, vol.2, page 18)

**Answer:**

The shift from Sabbath to Sunday began not by divine command, but by
ecclesiastical (church) authority, centered in Rome.

- **The Issue:** The celebration of Easter.
- **The Imposition:** Victor, Bishop of Rome, sought to exert authority over
  other churches to standardize a Sunday celebration.
- **The Seed of Popery:** This was an early manifestation of the "mystery of
  iniquity" (2 Thessalonians 2:7), where human tradition begins to supersede the
  Word of God.

### Q10. What was one of the principal reasons for convoking the Council of Nice?

“The question relating to the observance of Easter... was one of the principal
reasons for convoking the Council of Nice...” (Boyle's Historical View of the
Council of Nice, page 22)

**Answer:**

The Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325) was called to unify the church and the empire.
While the Arian controversy (concerning the divinity of Christ) was primary, the
**Easter question** was the second major issue. The drive was for uniformity and
political stability rather than biblical fidelity.

---

### Q11. How was the matter finally decided?

“Easter day was fixed on the Sunday immediately following the new moon which was
nearest after the vernal equinox.” (Idem. page 23)

**Answer:**

The Council decreed that the resurrection celebration must always fall on a
**Sunday**. This strengthened the prestige of Sunday ("the venerable day of the
sun") and further distanced the church from the biblical calendar used by the
Jews.

---

### Q12. In urging the observance of this decree on the churches, what reason did Constantine assign for it?

“Let us then have nothing in common with the most hostile rabble of the Jews.”
(Idem, page 52)

**Answer:**

Constantine's reasoning was based on **anti-Semitism**, not Scripture.

1.  **Political Motivation:** The Jews were despised and rebellious subjects.
    Constantine wanted a Christianity that was distinct from Judaism.
2.  **Theological Error:** The Sabbath is not "Jewish"; it was made for "man"
    (Mark 2:27). By rejecting the "Jewish" Sabbath, the church rejected a
    Creation ordinance established by God.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a man hates his neighbor and therefore burns down the
fence that the neighbor built, he might feel he has separated himself from his
enemy. But if that fence was actually built by the King of the land, the man has
not hurt the neighbor; he has insulted the King. In rejecting the Sabbath to
spite the Jews, the post-apostolic church insulted the Creator.

---

### Q13. What had Constantine already done, in A.D. 321, to help forward Sunday to a place of prominence?

He issued an edict forcing "the judges and town people and the occupation of all
trades" to rest on the "venerable day of the sun." (See Encyclopedia Britannica,
art. Sunday)

**Answer:**

In A.D. 321, Constantine issued the first civil **Sunday Law**.

- **Pagan-Christian Synthesis:** He did not call it the "Sabbath of the Lord,"
  but the "venerable day of the sun" (_dies solis_). Constantine was a
  sun-worshiper who saw political advantage in uniting the pagan sun cults with
  Christianity.
- **State Power:** This marked the shift where the state began to enforce
  religious observance—a violation of the principles of religious liberty and
  the character of God, who desires free-will service.

---

### Q14. Eusebius was bishop of Caesarea... Who did he say had changed the obligations of the Sabbath to Sunday?

“All things whatsoever that it was duty to do on the Sabbath, these WE have
transferred to the Lord's day.” (Eusebius's Commentary on the Psalms)

**Answer:**

Eusebius, a church historian and flatterer of Constantine, openly admitted:
**"WE have transferred."**

- **The Usurpation:** He does not say "God transferred" or "The Apostles
  transferred." He claims the prerogative for the church and its leadership.
- **The Prophecy:** This fulfills Daniel 7:25, where the Little Horn power
  thinks "to change times and laws."

**Doctrinal Insight: The Authority Crisis** The Great Controversy comes down to
this: Whom will you obey?

- **God says:** "The seventh day is the Sabbath."
- **The Church/State says:** "We have transferred it to the first day."
  Righteousness by Faith means trusting God's word over human tradition, even
  when the majority goes the other way.

### Q15. What did the Council of Laodicea decree in A.D. 364?

"The Council of Laodicea... first settled the observation of the Lord's day, and
prohibited the keeping of the Jewish Sabbath under an anathema." (Dissertation
on the Lord's Day Sabbath, pages 33, 34, 44)

**Answer:**

By A.D. 364, the church moved from merely encouraging Sunday to **prohibiting
the Sabbath**.

- **Anathema:** A curse or excommunication.
- **Persecution:** Faithful believers who wished to keep the Fourth Commandment
  were now declared enemies of the church. This marks the development of the
  "Beast" power of Revelation 13, which causes all to worship in a false way or
  face penalties.

---

### Q16. But did the Christians of the early church keep the Sabbath?

“Down even to the fifth century, the observances of the Jewish Sabbath was
continued in the Christian church.” (Coleman's Ancient Christianity Exemplified,
chap. 26, sec. 2)

**Answer:**

Yes. Despite the rising tide of apostasy in Rome and Alexandria, the broad body
of Christians—especially in the East—continued to rest on the Sabbath for
centuries. God has always reserved a "remnant" who keep the commandments of God
and the faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12).

---

### Q17. What day was observed in the Dark Ages by some of the Waldenses?

"They kept the Sabbath day, observed the ordinance of baptism according to the
primitive church, instructed their children in the articles of the Christian
faith and the commandments of God." (Jones's Church History, vol. 2, chap. 5,
sec. 4)

**Answer:**

During the 1260 years of papal supremacy (the "Dark Ages"), the truth was hidden
in the wilderness (Revelation 12:6). Groups like the Waldenses (Vaudois) in the
Alps maintained the ancient faith. Many among them kept the seventh-day Sabbath,
rejecting the authority of Rome to change God's law.

**Sanctuary Connection:** While the earthly priestcraft obscured the truth,
these believers looked by faith into the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ was
ministering the true blood of the covenant and upholding the true Law.

---

### Q18. What claim is now made by the Roman Church concerning the change of the Sabbath to Sunday?

"Question. - Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to
institute festivals of precept? Answer. - Had she not such power, she could not
have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her, she could not
have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the
observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no
scriptural authority." (Doctrinal Catechism)

**Answer:**

The Roman Catholic Church openly admits that:

1.  There is **no Scriptural authority** for Sunday sacredness.
2.  The change is a mark of her **ecclesiastical power**.
3.  Protestants who keep Sunday are effectively recognizing the authority of the
    Catholic Church rather than the Bible alone (_Sola Scriptura_).

**Doctrinal Insight:** This is the crux of the Third Angel's Message (Revelation
14:9-12). To knowingly keep a day established by human authority in defiance of
God's command is to pay homage to the power that made the change. Righteousness
by Faith leads us to submit solely to Christ, our Creator and Redeemer.

---

### Q19. Among the early Reformers, were there any who observed the seventh day?

“Carlstadt held to the divine authority of the Sabbath from the Old Testament.”
(Life of Luther, page 402)

**Answer:**

Yes. Dr. Andreas Carlstadt, a colleague of Martin Luther, argued that if they
were to reject the Pope and cling to the Bible, they must keep the Sabbath of
the Bible. There were Anabaptists and others during the Reformation who saw this
truth, but the mainstream Reformation failed to advance this far, clinging
instead to the tradition of Sunday.

---

### Q20. What did Luther say of Carlstadt's Sabbath views?

“Indeed, if Carlstadt were to write further about the Sabbath, Sunday would have
to give way, and the Sabbath that is to say, Saturday must be kept holy.”
(Luther, against the Celestial Prophets)

**Answer:**

Luther admitted the logic of the position. He realized that if one accepts the
Bible as the only rule of faith, Sunday ("the child of the papacy") must fall,
and the Sabbath must be restored. However, for various reasons, Luther did not
adopt this truth.

**Summary & Appeal:** The Reformation was not completed in the 16th century. It
is a progressive work. Today, God is calling a people to "repair the breach" in
His law (Isaiah 58:12).

- We are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8).
- That faith leads us to love and obey God (Romans 3:31).
- Keeping the Sabbath is not an attempt to earn heaven, but a joyful acceptance
  of God's sovereignty and a sign that we belong to Him who created the heavens
  and the earth.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a soldier in enemy territory who carries the
flag of his true King. The enemy commands him to drop that flag and carry the
enemy’s banner. To the casual observer, it's "just a piece of cloth." But to the
soldier, it is a question of allegiance. The Sabbath is God's flag—His sign
(Ezekiel 20:12). Sunday is the banner of human tradition. Which flag will you
carry?
