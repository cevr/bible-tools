# Reading 94: The Sabbath in History

## Introduction

The seventh-day Sabbath stands as God's memorial of creation, established at the
very beginning of time and affirmed throughout Scripture. Yet history reveals a
remarkable story of how this divine institution was gradually displaced by a
counterfeit—not through biblical authority, but through the blending of
paganism, politics, and ecclesiastical power. Understanding this history is
essential for those who would worship God "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24)
in these last days.

## Core Truths

### The Sabbath's Divine Origin

The Sabbath did not originate at Sinai. It was established at creation itself,
before sin entered the world, before there was a Jew or Gentile:

> _"And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested
> on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the
> seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His
> work which God created and made."_ (Genesis 2:2, 3)

Three divine acts established the Sabbath:

1. **God rested** on the seventh day—not from weariness, but to set an example
2. **God blessed** the seventh day—imparting special spiritual benefit to it
3. **God sanctified** the seventh day—setting it apart as holy

`[DYK🔎]` The word "sanctified" (Hebrew: _qadash_) means "to set apart for holy
use." This is the same word used for the sanctuary vessels. God made the seventh
day sacred 2,500 years before He gave the law at Sinai—proving the Sabbath is
not merely "Jewish" but belongs to all humanity.

### The Sabbath Proclaimed at Sinai

When God spoke His law from Mount Sinai, He did not introduce the Sabbath as
something new. He called Israel to _remember_ what had existed from the
beginning:

> _"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in
> them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath
> day, and hallowed it."_ (Exodus 20:11)

The fourth commandment points backward to creation as the reason for Sabbath
observance. It is the memorial of God's creative power—the sign distinguishing
the true God from all false gods (Jeremiah 10:10–12; Psalm 96:5).

### The Sabbath and Israel's Destiny

Sabbath faithfulness was so significant that God tied Israel's national destiny
to it. Through the prophet Jeremiah, God warned:

> _"But if ye will not hearken unto Me to hallow the Sabbath day, and not to
> bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day;
> then I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the
> palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched."_ (Jeremiah 17:27)

This prophecy found its fulfillment when Babylon destroyed Jerusalem:

> _"And all the vessels of the house of God... he brought to Babylon. And they
> burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all
> the palaces thereof with fire."_ (2 Chronicles 36:18, 19)

After the return from captivity, Nehemiah reminded the people of this solemn
lesson:

> _"Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us,
> and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the
> Sabbath."_ (Nehemiah 13:17, 18)

`[Q]` **"Wasn't the Sabbath just for the Jews? Didn't it end with the Old
Testament?"**

The Sabbath was made at creation, long before any Jews existed (Genesis 2:2, 3).
Jesus said, "The sabbath was made for man"—for humanity, not for Jews alone
(Mark 2:27). Furthermore, Isaiah prophesied that in the new earth, "from one
sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord"
(Isaiah 66:23). The Sabbath spans from creation to eternity—it is God's eternal
sign of His lordship over creation and His power to sanctify His people (Ezekiel
20:12, 20).

## Deeper Truths

### Christ and the Sabbath

How did Jesus Christ—the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28)—regard this day?

> _"And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and, as His custom
> was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to
> read."_ (Luke 4:16)

The phrase "as His custom was" reveals that Sabbath observance was Jesus'
lifelong practice, not occasional attendance. He kept the Sabbath throughout His
earthly ministry, setting an example for all who would follow Him.

`[DYK🔎]` Jesus never broke the Sabbath. The Pharisees accused Him of
Sabbath-breaking, but their accusations were based on their own man-made
traditions, not on God's law. Jesus kept the Sabbath perfectly, showing us _how_
it should be kept—as a day of mercy, healing, and spiritual blessing (Matthew
12:12; Luke 13:16).

Even after His death, Christ showed continuing regard for the Sabbath. Speaking
of Jerusalem's destruction in AD 70—nearly forty years after His crucifixion—He
said:

> _"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath
> day."_ (Matthew 24:20)

Why would Jesus ask His disciples to pray about the Sabbath if it were to be
abolished at the cross? This instruction reveals that Christ expected His
followers to still regard the Sabbath as sacred decades after Calvary.

### The Early Church and the Sabbath

Historical evidence confirms that the early Christians continued Sabbath
observance for centuries:

> "Down even to the fifth century, the observance of the Jewish Sabbath was
> continued in the Christian church." —Coleman's _Ancient Christianity
> Exemplified_, chap. 26, sec. 2

> "The ancient Sabbath did remain and was observed... by the Christians of the
> Eastern Church above three hundred years after our Saviour's death." —_A
> Learned Treatise of the Sabbath_, p. 77

`[ILL]` Consider a river flowing pure from its mountain source. The further it
travels from its headwaters, the more tributaries of foreign water mix with its
original flow. So it was with Christianity. The closer we examine the church to
its apostolic source, the more clearly we see Sabbath observance. The further we
move into later centuries, the more we find the admixture of pagan customs and
human tradition.

### How Sunday Gained Prominence

The gradual displacement of the Sabbath by Sunday did not come through divine
command but through a convergence of paganism, politics, and ecclesiastical
ambition.

**The Pagan Root:**

Sun worship was one of the oldest and most widespread forms of idolatry (Ezekiel
8:16). Sunday—dies Solis, "day of the sun"—was the weekly festival honoring the
sun god throughout the Roman Empire.

> "Sun worship was the earliest idolatry." —Fausset's _Bible Dictionary_, p. 666

> "Sun worship was 'one of the oldest components of the Roman religion.'"
> —Gaston H. Halsberghe, _The Cult of Sol Invictus_, 1972, p. 26

**The Political Push:**

Emperor Constantine, though claiming conversion to Christianity, remained a
sun-worshipper throughout his life. In AD 321, he issued the first civil law
enforcing Sunday rest:

> "He issued an edict forcing 'the judges and town people and the occupation of
> all trades' to rest on the 'venerable day of the sun.'" —_Encyclopedia
> Britannica_, art. "Sunday"

`[DYK🔎]` Constantine's Sunday law made no reference to Christianity or Christ.
It honored "the venerable day of the sun"—language drawn directly from pagan sun
worship. Constantine sought to unite pagans and Christians into one religion,
using Sunday as common ground.

**The Ecclesiastical Admission:**

Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea and Constantine's close supporter, candidly
admitted the human origin of this change:

> "All things whatsoever that it was duty to do on the Sabbath, these WE have
> transferred to the Lord's day." —Eusebius's _Commentary on the Psalms_

Note carefully: "WE have transferred"—not God, not Christ, not the apostles, but
church leaders themselves.

**The Council of Laodicea (AD 364):**

This church council took the decisive step of forbidding Sabbath-keeping under
penalty of a curse (anathema):

> "The Council of Laodicea... first settled the observation of the Lord's day,
> and prohibited the keeping of the Jewish Sabbath under an anathema."
> —_Dissertation on the Lord's Day Sabbath_, pp. 33, 34, 44

Here we see human authority claiming power to change what God had established at
creation.

### Rome's Own Testimony

The Roman Catholic Church does not hide its role in this change. It openly
claims credit:

> "Question: Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to
> institute festivals of precept?
>
> Answer: Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all
> modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the
> observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of
> Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural
> authority." —_Doctrinal Catechism_

`[Q]` **"But doesn't the New Testament authorize Sunday worship?"**

Even Catholic and Protestant historians acknowledge there is no such authority:

> "It must be confessed that there is no law in the New Testament concerning the
> first day." —McClintock and Strong, _Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological and
> Ecclesiastical Literature_, Vol. 9, p. 196

> "It would be an error to attribute ['the sanctification of Sunday'] to a
> definite decision of the Apostles. There is no such decision mentioned in the
> Apostolic documents [that is, the New Testament]." —Antoine Villien, _A
> History of the Commandments of the Church_, 1915, p. 23

The silence of Scripture speaks loudly. Sunday observance rests not on divine
command but on human tradition and ecclesiastical decree.

### The Sabbath Through the Dark Ages

Even during the long centuries of papal supremacy, faithful believers preserved
Sabbath truth:

> "They kept the Sabbath day, observed the ordinance of baptism according to the
> primitive church, instructed their children in the articles of the Christian
> faith and the commandments of God." —Jones's _Church History_, vol. 2, chap.
> 5, sec. 4 (referring to the Waldenses)

God has never been without witnesses to His truth, even when that truth was
suppressed by the dominant religious powers.

### Reformation Era Voices

Among the early Reformers, some recognized the Bible's testimony regarding the
Sabbath. Carlstadt, Luther's colleague, "held to the divine authority of the
Sabbath from the Old Testament" (_Life of Luther_, p. 402).

Luther himself acknowledged: "Indeed, if Carlstadt were to write further about
the Sabbath, Sunday would have to give way, and the Sabbath—that is to say,
Saturday—must be kept holy."

Yet the Reformation, while recovering many precious truths, did not fully
restore the Sabbath. Sunday was carried from Catholicism into Protestantism—an
inheritance from Rome, not from Scripture.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Real Issue: God's Authority vs. Human Tradition

The Sabbath controversy is not ultimately about days. It is about authority. Who
has the right to determine how we worship—God or man?

Jesus addressed this principle directly:

> _"In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of
> men."_ (Matthew 15:9)

The Sabbath change represents a direct challenge to divine authority. God said,
"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy... the seventh day is the sabbath of
the Lord thy God" (Exodus 20:8, 10). Human institutions said, "We have
transferred" the Sabbath to Sunday. This is the essence of the mystery of
iniquity—man exalting himself to change divine law (2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4;
Daniel 7:25).

### The Sanctuary Connection

The Sabbath is intimately connected with God's sanctuary truth. In the earthly
sanctuary, the ark of the covenant—containing the Ten Commandments with the
Sabbath at their heart—rested in the Most Holy Place (Exodus 25:21, 22;
Deuteronomy 10:1–5).

In Revelation, John sees the heavenly temple opened, revealing "the ark of His
testament" (Revelation 11:19). This vision immediately precedes the three
angels' messages (Revelation 14), which include a call to worship the Creator
using language drawn directly from the fourth commandment:

> _"Worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
> waters."_ (Revelation 14:7; compare Exodus 20:11)

The final message to the world is a call to return to the worship of the
Creator—to honor Him by keeping the day He sanctified at creation.

### The Mark of the Beast and the Seal of God

In the closing conflict, two marks distinguish two classes: the seal of God and
the mark of the beast (Revelation 7:1–3; 14:9–12).

The Sabbath is called God's "sign" or "seal" between Him and His people (Ezekiel
20:12, 20; Exodus 31:13, 17). It identifies Him as Creator and sanctifier—the
only One worthy of worship.

The counterfeit system that changed "times and laws" (Daniel 7:25) offers its
own mark of authority. As Rome herself claims, Sunday observance is the sign of
her ecclesiastical power to command under pain of sin.

Those who keep "the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation
14:12) will stand in contrast to those who receive the mark of human authority
in religious matters.

`[ILL]` A king's seal contains three elements: his name, his title, and his
territory. The fourth commandment alone among the ten contains all three
elements of God's seal: His name (the LORD), His title (Creator—"He made"), and
His territory (heaven and earth). The Sabbath is God's royal seal, authenticating
His law and identifying His people.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for Us Today

1. **The Sabbath is not a burden but a blessing.** God blessed this day. When
   kept in the spirit of Christ, it brings rest, renewal, and intimate
   fellowship with our Creator and Redeemer.

2. **Sabbath-keeping is not legalism but loving obedience.** Jesus said, "If ye
   love Me, keep My commandments" (John 14:15). True Sabbath observance flows
   from a heart transformed by grace, not from fear of punishment.

3. **The Sabbath points us to Christ's completed work.** Just as God rested
   after creation, believers rest in Christ's finished work of redemption
   (Hebrews 4:9, 10). The Sabbath is a weekly celebration of salvation by grace.

4. **Understanding history protects us from deception.** Knowing how Sunday
   observance entered Christianity—through paganism and human decree, not divine
   command—prepares us to stand for truth in the final crisis.

5. **The Sabbath is part of righteousness by faith.** Through faith in Christ,
   we receive not only forgiveness but power to obey. The same Savior who
   justifies the ungodly also writes His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). True
   Sabbath-keeping is the fruit of Christ living within, not human effort.

### Questions for Personal Reflection

- Have I been keeping the day God blessed, or the day man appointed?
- Does my Sabbath observance reflect legalistic duty or loving relationship with
  my Creator?
- Am I willing to follow the Bible alone, even when tradition and popular
  practice differ?
- Is Christ writing His law of love on my heart, making obedience a delight?

## Appeal

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My
> holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable;
> and shalt honour Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
> pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the
> Lord."_ (Isaiah 58:13, 14)

God is calling a people in these last days who will worship Him in spirit and in
truth—who will honor His Sabbath not because tradition commands it, but because
they love their Creator and long to show Him reverence.

The change from Sabbath to Sunday was not God's doing. It came through the
blending of paganism with Christianity, through political expedience, through
ecclesiastical ambition. But God has preserved His truth through every age, and
now the light is shining brighter than ever.

Jesus stands at the door of your heart today. He invites you to enter into His
rest—the rest He established at creation, the rest He modeled in His life, the
rest He desires to share with you through eternity. Will you accept His
invitation? Will you step out in faith to follow the Lamb wherever He leads?

> _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments
> of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:12)

May God grant you grace to be numbered among this faithful company.
