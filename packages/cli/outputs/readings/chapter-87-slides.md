## Slide 1 – Q1: The Command to Keep Holy

- **Question:** How are all commanded to keep the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:8 – “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Source of Holiness

- **Meaning of "Remember"**
  - This implies the institution was already known but in danger of being
    forgotten.
  - To keep it "holy" is to preserve the distinction God placed on it at
    Creation.
- **The Source of Holiness**
  - God alone is holy (Isaiah 6:3 – “And one cried unto another, and said, Holy,
    holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.”).
  - Man cannot _make_ a day holy; he can only _keep_ holy what God has already
    sanctified.
  - **Sanctification:** The act of setting something apart for sacred use
    (Genesis 2:3).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Faith and Sanctuary

- **Righteousness by Faith Connection**
  - Just as we cannot create a holy day, we cannot create a holy character.
  - We "keep" the Sabbath by faith, entering into God’s finished work of
    Creation (Hebrews 4:3-4).
  - We enter His rest just as we rely on His finished work of Redemption.
- **The Sanctuary in Time**
  - The Sabbath is a "sanctuary in time."
  - Just as the tabernacle was a holy _space_ set apart for God (Exodus 25:8),
    the Sabbath is holy _time_ set apart for communion with the Creator.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The King's Cup**
  - Imagine a king sets out a golden cup and says, "This cup is dedicated only
    for my use."
  - If a servant uses it to drink common water or scrubs it with dirty rags, he
    has not "kept it holy."
  - To keep it holy, he must treat it differently than common cups, using it
    only for the King's intended purpose.
- **Application**
  - We keep the Sabbath holy by using it for God's purposes—worship, rest, and
    ministry—rather than our common business.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Defining the Day

- **Question:** What constitutes a day?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:5 – “And God called the light Day, and the darkness he
  called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.”
- **Key Text:** Genesis 1:8 – “And God called the firmament Heaven. And the
  evening and the morning were the second day.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **Biblical Definition**
  - In God's reckoning, the day begins with the dark part (evening) and ends
    with the light part (morning).
  - A biblical day is a twenty-four-hour period beginning at sunset.
- **Countering Tradition**
  - Modern reckoning begins at midnight (a Roman custom).
  - The Bible student follows God’s clock, not man’s.
- **Spiritual Lesson**
  - We often begin in the darkness of sin or trial, but God brings us into the
    light.
  - Psalm 30:5 – “...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
    morning.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Timing of the Evening

- **Question:** When does the evening begin?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 16:6 – “But at the place which the LORD thy God
  shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at
  even, at the going down of the sun.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Objective Standard**
  - Scripture defines "even" as the precise moment of the "going down of the
    sun."
  - God gave the sun to rule the day (Genesis 1:16).
  - The Sabbath boundary is marked by heavenly bodies, not mechanical clocks.
- **Reverence**
  - As the sun nears the horizon on the sixth day, the believer lays aside
    secular cares.
  - It is a call to shift focus from the work of the hands to the work of the
    heart.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The King's Appointment**
  - If a loyal subject has an appointment with the King at a specific signal, he
    watches for that signal intently.
  - He does not delay until he "feels like it."
  - When the sun sets, God’s appointment begins.
  - To continue common labor past this point is to steal time that belongs to
    the King of kings.

## Slide 10 – Q4: New Testament Confirmation

- **Question:** How does the New Testament state this point?
- **Key Text:** Mark 1:32 – “And at even, when the sun did set, they brought
  unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **Consistency of Scripture**
  - The New Testament confirms the Old Testament timing.
  - There is no change in the reckoning of time from the Old Testament to the
    New.
- **Respect for Law**
  - The people waited until "the sun did set" to bring burdens to Jesus.
  - They understood the Sabbath hours ended at sunset.
  - While Jesus taught that doing _good_ is lawful on Sabbath, the people's
    actions show the common understanding of the day's end.

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Day of Atonement

- **Question:** When did the tenth day of the seventh month begin?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 23:32 – “It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and
  ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even
  unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **The "Even-to-Even" Principle**
  - This text establishes that Sabbaths are kept from evening to evening.
  - The Day of Atonement was the most solemn day of the year.
- **Sanctuary Connection**
  - **Atonement:** Reconciliation between God and man.
  - **Type:** Cleansing of the earthly sanctuary.
  - **Antitype:** Christ’s final work of judgment and blotting out sin (Daniel
    8:14).
- **Afflicting the Soul**
  - Refers to deep searching of heart, repentance, and turning from sin.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Application (Sanctuary & Faith)

- **Living in the Antitypical Day**
  - Ancient Israelites rested and afflicted their souls while the High Priest
    worked in the Most Holy Place.
  - Today, we live in the great antitypical Day of Atonement.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - We rest in Christ’s merits (the Sabbath principle).
  - Simultaneously, we cooperate with Him in the removal of sin from our lives
    (Sanctification).

## Slide 15 – Q6: Permitted Labor

- **Question:** What kind of labor is permitted through the week?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:9 – “Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Dignity of Labor**
  - The command to work is as binding as the command to rest.
  - Idleness is not holiness; God Himself is a worker (John 5:17).
- **Stewardship**
  - We are to be diligent in business (Romans 12:11).
  - We must provide for our own house (1 Timothy 5:8).
- **Distinction**
  - Secular labor is called "thy work"—work for our own profit.
  - The Sabbath is reserved for "God's work."

## Slide 17 – Q7: Lawful Sabbath Labor

- **Question:** Is any kind of labor lawful on the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:12 – “How much then is a man better than a sheep?
  Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **"To Do Well"**
  - Deeds of mercy, necessity, and ministry are lawful.
  - Includes saving life, relieving suffering, and gospel work.
- **Legalism vs. Love**
  - Pharisees burdened the Sabbath with man-made rules (Legalism).
  - Jesus restored its true intent: a day of freedom and blessing.
- **Sanctuary Ministry**
  - Priests in the temple worked harder on Sabbath offering double sacrifices
    (Numbers 28:9-10).
  - Spiritual activity and service to God are not "secular labor."

## Slide 19 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Sheep in the Pit**
  - If a sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, the owner pulls it out because
    the creature is suffering.
  - The Sabbath is a day of restoration.
  - If we can help a suffering neighbor or comfort a sorrowing heart, we are
    doing the work of Jesus.
  - This is appropriate for the Lord's Day.

## Slide 20 – Q8: Christ's Example of Power

- **Question:** What example did the Saviour give to show the meaning of His
  words?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:13 – “Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine
  hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the
  other.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points (Faith & Restoration)

- **Power to Obey**
  - The man could not stretch out his hand by his own power.
  - When Christ commanded, the man believed and willed to obey, and power was
    given.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - God commands the impossible (perfect obedience).
  - In our own strength ("withered hand"), we cannot do it.
  - When we claim His promise and choose to obey, He supplies the power.
- **Restoration**
  - Healing restores the body to its created intent.
  - Therefore, healing honors the Creator of the Sabbath.

## Slide 22 – Q9: The Preparation Day

- **Question:** What is the day before the Sabbath called?
- **Key Text:** Luke 23:54 – “And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath
  drew on.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points

- **Preparation for Holiness**
  - We cannot enter Sabbath rest abruptly from the rush of business.
  - The heart and home must be prepared on the sixth day (Friday).
- **Sanctuary Type**
  - Priests washed at the laver before entering the sanctuary (Exodus 30:19-21).
  - We "wash" away secular cares before entering the holy time of Sabbath.
- **Practical Godliness**
  - Includes cooking, cleaning, and bathing.
  - Ensures Sabbath hours are not consumed by common chores.

## Slide 24 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Bride and Groom**
  - If a bride expects her groom at sunset, she does not wait until sunset to
    start dressing or cleaning.
  - She prepares all day so she is free to enjoy his company when he arrives.
  - Friday is the day we prepare to meet the Lord in His holy time.

## Slide 25 – Q10: Manna and the Sixth Day

- **Question:** On which day did the Israelites receive their Sabbath supply of
  manna?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:22 – “And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they
  gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the
  congregation came and told Moses.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points

- **Weekly Miracle**
  - God provided a double portion of manna on Friday.
- **Providence**
  - God takes responsibility for the needs of those who obey Him.
  - If we stop working to keep the Sabbath, He ensures our needs are met.
- **The Test of Faith**
  - It required faith to gather double.
  - A skeptic might fear it would rot, but faith trusts God's word.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Instructions for Preparation

- **Question:** What instruction did they receive regarding this double supply
  of food?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:23 – “And he said unto them, This is that which the
  LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
  that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which
  remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points

- **Cooking and Baking**
  - Heavy cooking was to be done on the preparation day.
- **Relieving Burdens**
  - This was an act of mercy to those who prepared food.
  - God wanted _everyone_ to rest.
- **Sanctuary Order**
  - God is a God of order.
  - The "Showbread" in the sanctuary was replaced every Sabbath (Leviticus
    24:8), having been prepared beforehand.

## Slide 29 – Q12: The Sabbath Miracle

- **Question:** Was there any day in which the manna did not fall?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 16:26 – “Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh
  day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points

- **The Miracle of the Sabbath**
  - God reinforced the cycle with a threefold miracle every week for forty
    years:
    1. Double manna on Friday.
    2. Friday manna did not spoil overnight.
    3. No manna fell on Sabbath.
- **The Lesson**
  - We cannot expect God's blessing if we seek for "manna" (secular gain) on His
    holy day.
  - We must trust that His provision in six days is sufficient.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Holy Convocation

- **Question:** What were God's ancient people to do on the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 23:3 – “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh
  day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein:
  it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points

- **"Holy Convocation"**
  - A _convocation_ is a calling together or an assembly.
- **Corporate Worship**
  - While private rest is essential, the Sabbath is designed for public worship.
  - Hebrews 10:25 – “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...”
- **Foretaste of Heaven**
  - Gathering to study God's Word is a rehearsal for the great gathering in the
    heavenly Canaan.

## Slide 33 – Q14: The Saviour's Custom

- **Question:** What example did the Saviour set in this matter?
- **Key Text:** Luke 4:16 – “And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought
  up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and
  stood up for to read.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points

- **Jesus' Example**
  - It was His "custom" (habit) to attend public worship.
- **Christ Our Righteousness**
  - Jesus lived a perfect life to weave a robe of righteousness for us.
  - Part of that righteousness includes faithful Sabbath observance.
- **The Living Law**
  - If the "Spirit of Christ" dwells in us, He will do what He did on earth.
  - He will lead us to the house of God on the Sabbath.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Conductor**
  - If a musician wants to play a symphony, they follow the conductor.
  - Jesus is the Conductor of our faith.
  - If He went to the synagogue on Sabbath, His followers who are "in tune" with
    Him will do the same.

## Slide 36 – Q15: True Sabbath Observance

- **Question:** How sacredly should the Sabbath be observed?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:13 – “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath,
  from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the
  holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways,
  nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:”

## Slide 37 – Q15: Key Points

- **"Turn away thy foot"**
  - We are stepping onto holy ground; we tread reverently.
- **"Not doing thine own pleasure"**
  - We set aside hobbies and business to seek _God's_ pleasure.
- **"A Delight"**
  - To the carnal mind, Sabbath is a burden; to the renewed heart, it is a joy.
  - **RBF Key:** We do not keep Sabbath to _earn_ salvation, but because we
    delight in the Savior.
- **"Nor speaking thine own words"**
  - Our conversation changes from politics and finance to the works of God and
    the blessed hope.

## Slide 38 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Child and the Father**
  - Imagine a child who loves their father but rarely sees him due to travel.
  - When the father returns, the child drops their toys and ignores the TV.
  - The child wants only to walk and talk with the father.
  - This is the "delight" of the Sabbath—dropping the toys of the world to walk
    with our Heavenly Father.
