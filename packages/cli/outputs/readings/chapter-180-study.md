# Bible Study: The Conflict Ended

## Introduction

From the first "It is finished" of Creation to the final "It is done" of the new earth, Scripture traces the arc of God's great purpose for humanity. What sin interrupted, Christ restores—completely, eternally, gloriously. This study follows the four great divine announcements that mark the beginning, redemption, judgment, and ultimate restoration of all things, revealing a God whose love will not rest until every tear is wiped away and His children see Him face to face.

## Core Truths

### The Four Divine Declarations

Scripture records four momentous occasions when God announces the completion of His work. Together, they form the framework of the plan of salvation:

1. **Creation Finished** — _"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made."_ (Genesis 2:1, 2)

2. **Redemption Accomplished** — _"It is finished."_ (John 19:30)

3. **Probation Closed** — _"It is done."_ (Revelation 16:17)

4. **Restoration Complete** — _"It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end."_ (Revelation 21:5, 6)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "it is finished" in John 19:30 is a single Greek word: _tetelestai_. In the ancient world, this word was stamped on receipts to mean "paid in full." When Jesus cried _tetelestai_, He declared humanity's sin-debt completely settled.

### From "Very Good" to "All Things New"

God's original creation was pronounced "very good" (Genesis 1:31). Had sin never entered, no further work would have been required. But when humanity fell, God set in motion a plan to restore what was lost—and more:

> _"Behold, I make all things new."_ (Revelation 21:5)

The God who began with perfection will end with perfection restored. The first Eden is answered by a greater Eden, the earthly paradise by the heavenly city descended to earth.

## Deeper Truths

### The Cross: Center of God's Work

[Q] **"Why does Scripture emphasize 'It is finished' at the cross rather than at the resurrection?"**

The cross was the moment of complete payment. Christ's resurrection confirmed His victory, but Calvary was where the price was paid. Every drop of the bitter cup was drained; every sin of humanity was borne. The resurrection declares that the Father accepted the sacrifice, but the cross is where the Lamb "finished" the work of atonement (Hebrews 9:26; 10:12).

[ILL] Consider a prisoner awaiting execution. The governor signs a full pardon, and the document is delivered to the prison. The moment the pardon is signed, the prisoner's legal standing is changed—though he may not yet walk free. So it was at Calvary: Christ signed our pardon in His own blood. The resurrection opened the prison door, but the pardon was "finished" at the cross.

### The Seventh Plague: Probation's End

When the seventh angel pours out his vial and the voice from the throne cries, _"It is done"_ (Revelation 16:17), human probation has forever closed. Christ leaves the Most Holy Place, and mercy no longer pleads for the impenitent. This solemn "It is done" announces that all decisions are final—the righteous sealed, the wicked confirmed in rebellion.

This is not arbitrary judgment but the inevitable result of choices made. God waits long, but there comes a moment when every heart is fixed.

> _"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... and he that is holy, let him be holy still."_ (Revelation 22:11)

### The New Earth: Conflict Eternally Ended

The final "It is done" (Revelation 21:6) announces what the redeemed have longed for: sin is no more, death is no more, the curse is no more. God Himself will dwell with His people:

> _"He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God."_ (Revelation 21:3)

[DYK🔎] The New Jerusalem is described as a perfect cube (Revelation 21:16), the same shape as the Most Holy Place in the earthly sanctuary (1 Kings 6:20). In the new earth, God's people live forever in His immediate presence—the veil is gone, and we see Him face to face.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary's Final Lesson

The sanctuary services pointed forward to these four great declarations:

- **Outer Court (Altar of Sacrifice)**: "It is finished" at the cross—the Lamb is slain.
- **Holy Place (Daily Ministry)**: Christ intercedes for His people, applying His blood.
- **Most Holy Place (Day of Atonement)**: "It is done"—sins blotted out, the sanctuary cleansed, probation closed.
- **Tabernacle of God with Men**: God dwells with His redeemed; the sanctuary is no longer needed, for "the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it" (Revelation 21:22).

The entire plan of salvation—justification, sanctification, glorification—finds its expression in the sanctuary, and its completion in the new earth.

### The Character of God Vindicated

The great controversy has ever been about God's character. Satan charged Him with injustice, selfishness, arbitrary rule. But when the conflict is ended:

- The redeemed will know God fully: _"Then shall I know even as also I am known"_ (1 Corinthians 13:12).
- They will be like Him: _"We shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is"_ (1 John 3:2).
- Every question will be answered; every doubt dissolved.

God's government of love will stand vindicated before the universe forever.

## Practical Application

### Living in Light of the End

The certainty of the conflict's end should shape our lives today:

1. **Trust in the Finished Work of Christ**
   We do not work _for_ salvation, but _from_ it. The cross says, "Paid in full." Rest in that assurance, and let gratitude fuel obedience (Romans 6:14; Titus 2:11–14).

2. **Prepare for Probation's Close**
   The time to make our calling and election sure is now. "Today, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts" (Hebrews 3:15). Every day is an opportunity to surrender more fully to Christ.

3. **Long for the New Earth**
   Let the promise of a world without tears, death, or pain lift your eyes above present trials. The best is yet to come—and it lasts forever.

4. **Reflect God's Character Now**
   If we shall be like Him then, let us by His grace grow like Him now. The work of sanctification is Christ living His life in us, preparing us to see His face.

## Appeal

_"And they shall see His face."_ (Revelation 22:4)

This is the summit of redemption: to behold the One who loved us and gave Himself for us. No higher privilege exists. No greater joy can be imagined. Face to face with Jesus—forever.

The conflict that began in heaven will one day be ended. Sin will be no more. Death will be swallowed up in victory. The curse will be lifted from creation. And the redeemed—washed, transformed, glorified—will reign with Christ for ever and ever.

Friend, the same God who said "It is finished" at Calvary invites you today to rest in His completed work. The same Christ who will cry "It is done" at the close of probation pleads with you now to surrender your heart. And the same Lord who will make all things new promises you a place in His eternal kingdom.

Will you accept His invitation? Will you live in the light of the conflict's glorious end?

> _"Even so, come, Lord Jesus."_ (Revelation 22:20)
