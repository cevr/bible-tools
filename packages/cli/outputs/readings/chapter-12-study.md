# Reading 12: Prophecies Relating to Christ

## Introduction

The Bible presents one of the most compelling evidences for its divine inspiration through Messianic prophecy—hundreds of specific predictions about the coming Savior, written centuries before His birth, and fulfilled with remarkable precision in the life of Jesus of Nazareth. These prophecies form an unbroken chain of testimony from Genesis to Malachi, all pointing forward to "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 13:8). To study these prophecies is to see God's unchanging purpose and to strengthen our faith in both the Scriptures and the Savior they reveal.

## Core Truths

### The Prophet Like Moses

The foundation of Messianic expectation begins with Moses himself, who declared:

> _"The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto Him ye shall hearken."_ (Deuteronomy 18:15)

This was no ordinary prophet. Moses was unique in Israel's history—he delivered God's people from bondage, mediated the covenant, and spoke with God "face to face" (Deuteronomy 34:10). The Prophet to come would be "like unto Moses," yet greater still.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "like unto me" carried enormous weight for Jewish readers. Moses was the lawgiver, deliverer, and mediator between God and Israel. No prophet in the Old Testament period fully matched this description—the Jews understood this prophecy pointed to the Messiah Himself.

The apostle Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, declared this prophecy fulfilled in Jesus:

> _"For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me... Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days."_ (Acts 3:22, 24)

Notice Peter's sweeping claim: not just Moses, but _all_ the prophets testified of Christ. The entire prophetic witness of Scripture converges on this one Person.

### Born of a Virgin in Bethlehem

Seven hundred years before Christ's birth, Isaiah prophesied:

> _"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel."_ (Isaiah 7:14)

Matthew records the fulfillment:

> _"Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us."_ (Matthew 1:22-23)

[DYK🔎] "Immanuel" means "God with us"—not merely a prophet sent from God, but God Himself dwelling among humanity. This name reveals the mystery of the incarnation: the eternal Son took human nature to redeem us from within.

The prophet Micah specified the exact location:

> _"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel."_ (Micah 5:2)

And so it was: _"Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king"_ (Matthew 2:1).

[Q] **"Couldn't Jesus or His followers have simply arranged events to 'fulfill' these prophecies?"**

Many of the Messianic prophecies were entirely beyond human control. No one chooses where they will be born, who their parents will be, or how enemies will treat them at death. The birthplace was determined by a Roman census decree. The manner of death—crucifixion—was a Roman invention unknown in David's time when Psalm 22 described it. The disposal of His garments by casting lots was the soldiers' decision, not Christ's. These details could not be manufactured; they required divine orchestration across centuries.

### The Voice in the Wilderness

Isaiah foretold a herald who would prepare the way:

> _"The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God."_ (Isaiah 40:3)

When questioned about his identity, John the Baptist pointed directly to this prophecy:

> _"He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias."_ (John 1:23)

[ILL] In ancient times, when a king planned to visit a distant province, heralds were sent ahead to announce his coming. Workers would fill in low places, level hills, and straighten crooked paths so the royal procession could travel smoothly. John's mission was spiritual: to prepare hearts for the King of kings by calling people to repentance and removing the obstacles of sin and pride.

### The Star Out of Jacob

Even the pagan prophet Balaam, compelled by God's Spirit, declared:

> _"There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel."_ (Numbers 24:17)

Jesus Himself claims this title:

> _"I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star."_ (Revelation 22:16)

[DYK🔎] It is remarkable that God guided wise men from the East to Bethlehem by an actual star (Matthew 2:1-2, 9). The literal star led them to the prophetic Star—heaven itself bore witness to the King's arrival.

## Deeper Truths

### The Shadow of Sorrow: Rachel's Weeping

One of the most poignant prophecies concerns innocent suffering connected with Christ's birth. Jeremiah wrote:

> _"A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not."_ (Jeremiah 31:15)

This found terrible fulfillment when Herod, threatened by news of a newborn King, "sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under" (Matthew 2:16-18).

[Q] **"How could a loving God allow innocent children to die?"**

This question touches the heart of the great controversy. The slaughter of the innocents reveals not God's character but Satan's. The enemy of souls, working through wicked Herod, sought to destroy the Savior before His mission could begin. Yet God preserved His Son and will one day raise those little ones in the resurrection. Every tear will be wiped away, and justice will be complete (Revelation 21:4). The very Savior whom Satan sought to destroy will restore what Satan took.

### Despised and Rejected

Isaiah 53 contains perhaps the most detailed prophetic portrait of the Messiah:

> _"He is despised and rejected of men; a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not."_ (Isaiah 53:3)

John records the tragic fulfillment:

> _"He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own received Him not."_ (John 1:10-11)

The Creator came to His creation, and they did not recognize Him. The King came to His people, and they would not receive Him. Here is the mystery of human blindness and the tragedy of sin's deception.

[ILL] Imagine an artist who creates a masterpiece painting. Years later, the painting—having somehow gained consciousness—refuses to acknowledge its creator, even mocking him when he appears. The absurdity is obvious. Yet this is precisely what humanity did: the very hands that formed us from dust were stretched out in love, and we nailed them to a cross.

### The Anointed Preacher

Isaiah prophesied the nature of Messiah's ministry:

> _"The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound."_ (Isaiah 61:1)

In one of the most dramatic moments of His ministry, Jesus stood in the synagogue at Nazareth, read this very passage, closed the scroll, and declared:

> _"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."_ (Luke 4:21)

[DYK🔎] The word "Christ" (Greek: _Christos_) and "Messiah" (Hebrew: _Mashiach_) both mean "Anointed One." Jesus was anointed by the Holy Spirit at His baptism (Matthew 3:16-17) for His threefold work as Prophet, Priest, and King—the only One ever anointed to all three offices.

### Silent Before His Accusers

> _"He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth."_ (Isaiah 53:7)

Before Pilate, Jesus maintained this prophetic silence:

> _"And He answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marveled greatly."_ (Matthew 27:14)

The silence of Christ speaks volumes. He who could have called twelve legions of angels (Matthew 26:53) chose to bear false accusation without defense. His silence was not weakness but strength—the strength of perfect submission to the Father's will.

### Garments Divided, Lots Cast

A thousand years before Calvary, David wrote:

> _"They part My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture."_ (Psalm 22:18)

Roman soldiers, with no knowledge of this prophecy, fulfilled it precisely:

> _"And they crucified Him, and parted His garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet."_ (Matthew 27:35)

[DYK🔎] Psalm 22 describes crucifixion in remarkable detail—bones out of joint, hands and feet pierced, intense thirst—yet crucifixion was not invented until centuries after David's time. The Romans adopted it from the Persians and Carthaginians. David could only have described this by divine revelation.

### Gall and Vinegar

> _"They gave Me also gall for My meat; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink."_ (Psalm 69:21)

At Calvary: _"They gave Him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when He had tasted thereof, He would not drink"_ (Matthew 27:34).

Christ refused the numbing potion. He would bear the full weight of humanity's sin with unclouded consciousness—no relief, no escape. Every pang of suffering He endured willingly for our salvation.

### A Grave With the Rich

Isaiah prophesied a seeming contradiction:

> _"And He made His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death."_ (Isaiah 53:9)

How could one grave be with both the wicked and the rich? The answer came at Calvary. Jesus was crucified between two thieves—"with the wicked." Yet Joseph of Arimathea, a rich man, "went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus... and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock" (Matthew 27:57-60)—"with the rich in His death."

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Testimony of Scripture

The Messianic prophecies demonstrate a principle foundational to faith: God declares the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10). The Bible is not merely human literature but the word of the living God, authenticated by predictive prophecy that only omniscience could produce.

These prophecies also reveal the great controversy in action. Satan knew the prophecies and worked desperately to prevent their fulfillment—through Pharaoh's decree against Hebrew infants, through Herod's slaughter, through repeated attempts on Christ's life. Yet every satanic effort only served to fulfill the very predictions Satan sought to thwart. God's purposes cannot be defeated.

### Christ the Center of Scripture

Jesus Himself declared: _"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me"_ (John 5:39). After His resurrection, He taught the disciples: _"Beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself"_ (Luke 24:27).

The entire Old Testament points forward to Christ. The New Testament points back to Christ. He is the center and circumference of biblical revelation. To miss Christ in Scripture is to miss everything.

### The Sanctuary and Messianic Prophecy

The earthly sanctuary was itself a prophecy of Christ. Every sacrifice pointed to "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). The high priest's ministry foreshadowed Christ's intercession. The Day of Atonement prefigured the final cleansing of sin from the universe.

Isaiah 53 describes Christ as both sacrifice ("He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter") and priest who intercedes for transgressors (Isaiah 53:12). The Messianic prophecies converge on Christ's dual work: His sacrifice at the cross (outer court) and His ongoing ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1-2).

### Faith That Overcomes

The precision of fulfilled prophecy gives us confidence for prophecies yet unfulfilled. The same God who orchestrated Christ's first coming is orchestrating the events of earth's final days. We can trust His word completely.

> _"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place."_ (2 Peter 1:19)

Prophecy is given not merely to satisfy curiosity but to produce faith—faith that transforms the character and prepares a people to meet their Lord.

## Practical Application

### Study the Word

If all the prophets testified of Christ (Acts 3:24), then every portion of Scripture holds treasures pointing to our Savior. Make it your practice to look for Christ in every passage. Ask, "What does this reveal about Jesus?" The Bible becomes inexhaustibly rich when read with Christ as the key.

### Share the Evidence

The Messianic prophecies provide powerful evidence for skeptics and seekers. Be prepared to share these proofs with those who question the Bible's reliability. The mathematical probability of one person fulfilling even a fraction of these prophecies by chance is astronomically small—pointing unmistakably to divine design.

### Trust the Prophetic Word

If God fulfilled every prophecy concerning Christ's first coming, we can have absolute confidence in prophecies concerning His second coming. Live in readiness. The same faithfulness that brought the Babe to Bethlehem will bring the King in glory.

### Embrace the Rejected One

The world despised and rejected Christ. Will you? The prophecies reveal who He is—God with us, the suffering Servant, the anointed King. To know these things and not surrender to Him is to repeat the tragedy of those who "received Him not."

## Appeal

> _"To Him give all the prophets witness, that through His name whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins."_ (Acts 10:43)

All the prophets—Moses and Samuel, David and Isaiah, Micah and Jeremiah—point with united voice to Jesus Christ. They saw Him from afar and testified of His coming. We have the privilege of knowing the fulfillment, of seeing what prophets longed to see (Matthew 13:17).

The prophecies are not merely historical curiosities. They are God's invitation to trust, believe, and surrender. The One who fulfilled every prediction concerning His humiliation will just as certainly fulfill every promise concerning His glory. He who came as Savior will return as King.

Will you receive the One whom prophets foretold? Will you trust the word that has proven so remarkably true? Heaven invites you today: _"Unto Him ye shall hearken"_ (Deuteronomy 18:15).
