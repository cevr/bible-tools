## Slide 1 – Title Slide

- **Topic:** Origin, History, and Destiny of Satan
- **Theme:** The Great Controversy, The Sanctuary, and Victory in Christ
- **Scripture Focus:** Tracing the history of the adversary to highlight the
  victory available in Christ.

## Slide 2 – Introduction: The Mystery of Iniquity

- **The Problem of Suffering:** To understand suffering, we must understand the
  origin of evil.
- **The Nature of Sin:**
  - Sin is an intruder with no legitimate reason for existence.
  - It did not originate with God.
  - It began with a created being who chose rebellion.
- **Purpose of Study:** We trace the history of the adversary not to glorify
  him, but to expose his devices and understand the plan of salvation.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Origin of Sin

- **Question:** Have any others than the human family sinned?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 2:4 – “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but
  cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be
  reserved unto judgment.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Key Points (Reality of Sin)

- **A Cosmic Rebellion:**
  - Sin existed before Adam and Eve.
  - It is not merely a human flaw but a rebellion against God’s government (1
    John 3:4).
- **God’s Justice:**
  - God "spared not" the angels.
  - High position does not grant immunity from the law.
  - If God did not overlook sin in angels, He cannot overlook it in us.
- **Judgment:** Fallen beings are reserved for a final day of accounting.

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Royal Ship Mutiny:**
  - Imagine a mutiny on a royal ship.
  - The rebellion begins not with the passengers, but with the high-ranking
    officers.
  - The captain must suppress the mutiny to save the ship.
  - Even trusted officers must be imprisoned to ensure the safety of the vessel.

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Leader of Rebellion

- **Question:** What is the name of him who led them to sin?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 25:41 – “Then shall he say also unto them on the left
  hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
  and his angels.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points

- **A Personal Being:**
  - Satan is not an abstract influence or the "dark side" of human nature.
  - Jesus identifies him as a specific entity with followers ("his angels").
- **The Purpose of Hellfire:**
  - "Everlasting fire" was _prepared_ for the Devil and his angels, not for
    humanity.
  - God’s original plan for man was life and happiness.
  - Humans only share this fate if they choose to ally with the rebel leader.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Titles of the Adversary

- **Question:** Is he known by any other name?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:9 – “And the great dragon was cast out, that old
  serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was
  cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points & Definition

- **Titles and Character:**
  - **The Dragon:** Represents power to persecute and destroy.
  - **The Serpent:** Represents cunning and deception (Genesis 3).
  - **The Devil:** Means "The Slanderer" (slanders God to man, and man to God).
  - **Satan:** Means "The Adversary" (opposes all that is holy).
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - The cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan regarding God's character, His
    law, and His sovereignty.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Former Abode

- **Question:** Where was his abode before he fell?
- **Key Text:** Luke 10:18 – “And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning
  fall from heaven.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **Origin in Heaven:**
  - Evil did not originate in a dark corner of the universe.
  - It arose in the very presence of God.
- **Mystery of Iniquity:**
  - Sin arose in a perfect environment, showing that environment alone does not
    guarantee righteousness.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Position in Heaven

- **Question:** What was his position in heaven?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 28:14 – “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and
  I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked
  up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Anointed Cherub that Covereth:**
  - Sanctuary language: The "covering cherubim" stood over the Ark of the
    Covenant (Exodus 25:20).

- **Guardian of the Law:**
  - He was the guardian of God's law.
  - He knew God's law was holy, just, and good.
  - His rebellion was fully conscious and inexcusable.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Prime Minister:**
  - Consider a Prime Minister who stands next to the King.
  - He knows the King's heart and policies better than anyone.
  - If he turns traitor, his betrayal is far worse than that of a common citizen
    who does not know the King personally.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Condition at Creation

- **Question:** What was his condition when created?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 28:15 – “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that
  thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points

- **Created Perfect:**
  - God did not create a devil; He created a holy, beautiful angel.
  - God is the author of perfection (Deuteronomy 32:4).
- **Free Will:**
  - "Till iniquity was found in thee" implies the change came from within.
  - God created beings with free will because only free beings can love.
  - A robot cannot love; Lucifer used his freedom to choose self over God.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Cause of the Fall

- **Question:** Why was he cast from his high position?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 28:16 – “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have
  filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will
  cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O
  covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points & Application

- **Roots of Apostasy:**
  - **Merchandise:** Spreading dissatisfaction and "trading" lies about God’s
    government among the angels.
  - **Violence:** Rebellion against the law eventually leads to the spirit of
    murder.
  - **Sin defined:** "Thou hast sinned." Sin is the transgression of the law (1
    John 3:4).
- **Application: Righteousness by Faith:**

    Covenant.
- **Guardians of the Law:**

  nearest to God's throne.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Pattern

- **Question:** Of what was this sanctuary a pattern?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:23 – “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of
  things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
  themselves with better sacrifices than these.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points

- **Type and Antitype:**
  - The earthly sanctuary (type) was a shadow pointing to the true tabernacle in
    heaven (antitype).
  - Christ now ministers in the true sanctuary.
- **Sanctuary Definition:**
  - The dwelling place of God.
  - The earthly model teaches how God deals with sin.
  - The heavenly reality is the command center where Christ mediates for us.

  - Christ was manifested to destroy sin and build righteousness.

## Slide 33 – Q15: Abandoning Truth

- **Question:** Was he ever in the truth?
- **Key Text:** John 8:44 – “Ye are of your father the devil... he was a
  murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no
  truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a
  liar, and the father of it.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Key Points
