# Bible Study: Saving Faith

## Introduction

Faith is the very foundation of the Christian experience—the channel through which every blessing of salvation flows. Without it, we cannot please God; with it, we access the peace, joy, and transforming power that heaven offers. This study explores what true faith is, how it operates, and how we may grow into the fullness of faith that brings constant victory.

## Core Truths

### What Faith Actually Is

The Bible gives us a precise definition of faith:

> _"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."_ (Hebrews 11:1)

**Substance**: The Greek word here (_hupostasis_) means "foundation," "assurance," or "confidence." Faith is not merely hoping something might happen—it is the solid ground beneath our feet when we cannot yet see the fulfillment.

**Evidence**: Faith provides inner conviction of realities beyond our senses. It is not blind credulity, but a settled trust based on God's character and promises.

[DYK🔎] The word "substance" in Hebrews 11:1 is the same Greek term used in Hebrews 1:3, where Christ is called the "express image" of God's _hupostasis_ (person/being). Faith, then, is as real and substantial as God Himself!

### The Essential Beliefs

When approaching God, two things must be believed:

> _"But without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him."_ (Hebrews 11:6)

1. **That God exists** ("He is")
2. **That God rewards those who seek Him** ("a rewarder")

Faith is not merely intellectual assent to God's existence—even devils believe that (James 2:19). It is confident trust that God responds to those who earnestly seek Him.

### How Faith Comes

Faith is not manufactured by human willpower. Scripture reveals its source:

> _"So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."_ (Romans 10:17)

God's Word is the seedbed of faith. As we read, hear, and meditate upon Scripture, the Holy Spirit plants and cultivates faith within our hearts.

[ILL] Consider a child who has never seen his father, yet has received many letters from him. As the child reads and rereads those letters—learning of his father's love, his promises, his character—trust grows. The father becomes real, though unseen. So it is with us and God's Word: the more we read His letters, the more real He becomes, and the more naturally we trust Him.

## Deeper Truths

### Faith and the Evidence of Creation

While faith looks beyond the visible, God has not left us without external evidence of His existence:

> _"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork."_ (Psalm 19:1)

> _"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse."_ (Romans 1:20)

Creation witnesses to the Creator. The order, beauty, and design of nature point to an intelligent, powerful, and loving God. This evidence supports faith, though faith itself reaches beyond what nature alone can reveal.

### The Object of Saving Faith

Not all faith saves. Biblical faith must have the right object—Jesus Christ:

> _"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_ (John 3:16)

Faith in any other object—whether self, works, religious systems, or human teachers—cannot save. Only faith in Christ, God's Son, connects us to eternal life.

[Q] **"But what does it actually mean to 'believe in Him'? Isn't that too simple?"**

To believe in Christ is more than acknowledging His historical existence or admiring His teachings. The Greek word _pisteuō_ carries the idea of trusting, committing, relying upon. To believe in Christ is to stake your eternal destiny on His merits alone, to rest your soul's weight entirely upon Him. It is simple—simple enough for a child—yet profound enough to occupy eternity.

### The Inner Witness

When we truly believe, God provides inward confirmation:

> _"He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son."_ (1 John 5:10)

What is this witness?

> _"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God."_ (Romans 8:16)

The Holy Spirit confirms to the believing heart that we belong to God. This is not emotional excitement (though emotions may follow), but a deep, settled assurance that we are accepted in Christ.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "witness in himself" uses the Greek _marturion_—from which we get "martyr." The Spirit's witness is so certain that early Christians died rather than deny it. This inner testimony is not self-generated; it comes from God alone.

### The Fruit of Faith: Peace with God

This witness produces a practical result:

> _"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (Romans 5:1)

**Justification**: God's legal declaration that the repentant sinner, though guilty, is counted righteous because of Christ's perfect righteousness credited to their account.

This peace is not merely the absence of conflict, but positive reconciliation with our Creator. Where once we were enemies (Romans 5:10), we are now children. Where once we feared judgment, we now rest in acceptance.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Faith and Obedience: Inseparable Partners

A critical question arises: What is the relationship between faith and works?

> _"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."_ (James 2:26)

True faith always produces obedience. This is not because works earn salvation, but because living faith naturally bears fruit. A tree does not strain to produce apples—it simply grows, and fruit follows. So the soul connected to Christ by faith naturally brings forth the fruit of righteousness (John 15:5).

> _"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight."_ (1 John 3:21-22)

[Q] **"Doesn't this make our confidence dependent on our obedience rather than on Christ?"**

The text is not teaching that obedience earns God's favor. Rather, it reveals that known, cherished sin interrupts our communion with God and destroys the confidence that faith brings. When we are walking in willful disobedience, our conscience condemns us, and we cannot approach God with the assurance that He hears. But when faith is working through love (Galatians 5:6), producing obedience from the heart, nothing hinders our access to the throne of grace.

This is righteousness by faith in action: Christ's life working within, producing the obedience we could never manufacture ourselves.

### Faith, the Sanctuary, and the Conditions of Forgiveness

God's forgiveness is freely offered, but it is received on certain conditions:

> _"But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin."_ (1 John 1:7)

> _"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."_ (1 John 1:9)

Two conditions appear:

1. **Walking in the light** (living according to what we know to be right)
2. **Confessing our sins** (agreeing with God about our wrongdoing)

When we meet these conditions through faith, the blood of Jesus—applied through His priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary—cleanses us from all sin. The sanctuary truth reveals that Christ's atoning work continues now. His blood, once shed, is ever available through His intercession (Hebrews 7:25; 9:24).

[ILL] In the ancient sanctuary, the priest would take blood from the altar of sacrifice (representing Christ's death) and minister it in the holy place for the sinner who confessed. The sinner brought nothing but confession and faith; the priest brought the efficacious blood. So it is today: we bring our confession, and Christ our High Priest applies His own blood on our behalf. Faith is the hand that receives what Christ freely gives.

### Faith Before Feeling

A vital principle emerges from Christ's own words:

> _"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them."_ (Mark 11:24)

Notice the order: **believe that you receive**—then you shall have. Faith grasps the promise before the evidence appears. We do not wait to feel forgiven before believing; we believe God's promise, and then peace follows.

This is the order of heaven: promise → faith → fulfillment → feeling. Many reverse this, waiting for feeling before they will believe. But God calls us to take Him at His word, resting on His faithfulness rather than our emotions.

### Faith Tried and Strengthened

Faith is not weakened by trial—it is strengthened:

> _"My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience."_ (James 1:2-3)

And in affliction, faith rests on this promise:

> _"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose."_ (Romans 8:28)

The great controversy teaches us that God permits trials not to destroy faith, but to develop it. Each trial overcome strengthens our trust in God's character and promises.

[DYK🔎] The word "trying" in James 1:3 (_dokimion_) refers to the testing of metals by fire. As fire removes impurities from gold, so trials remove the dross from our faith, leaving it purer and more valuable (1 Peter 1:7).

## Practical Application

### The Danger of Doubt

Scripture warns plainly against a wavering mind:

> _"Let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord."_ (James 1:7)

Peter provides a vivid example. Invited by Christ to walk on the stormy sea, he stepped out in faith and actually walked on water—until he shifted his gaze from Jesus to the waves:

> _"And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"_ (Matthew 14:31)

Peter did not sink because the storm was too strong. He sank because he doubted. The moment he turned his eyes from Christ, faith failed.

**Practical lesson**: Keep your eyes on Jesus. When circumstances rage, when emotions fluctuate, when others doubt—look to Christ. He is the "author and finisher of our faith" (Hebrews 12:2).

### Growing Into the Fullness of Faith

Faith is not static; it grows:

> _"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost."_ (Romans 15:13)

As we exercise faith, it grows. As we study God's Word, faith deepens. As we experience answered prayer and divine deliverance, faith strengthens. The result is "all joy and peace"—not occasional happiness, but abounding hope and settled confidence.

This fullness of faith is:

- **Supplied by God** ("the God of hope fill you")
- **Experienced in believing** ("in believing")
- **Empowered by the Spirit** ("through the power of the Holy Ghost")

We cannot manufacture this faith. But we can open our hearts to receive it through the Word, prayer, and surrender.

### Faith and the Character of God

Ultimately, faith is about trusting a Person, not merely accepting propositions. The more we understand God's character—His infinite love, His perfect justice, His tender mercy, His unwavering faithfulness—the more naturally we trust Him.

The great controversy is, at its heart, a battle over God's character. Satan accuses Him of being arbitrary, severe, and untrustworthy. Faith sees through the lie. Faith grasps that "God is love" (1 John 4:8) and rests upon that truth even when circumstances seem to contradict it.

## Appeal

> _"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_ (John 3:16)

Dear reader, God invites you—whoever you are, whatever your past—to believe in His Son. This faith is not a leap into the dark, but a step into the light of heaven's love.

If your faith feels weak, bring it to God. He does not despise "little faith," but reaches out to lift the sinking soul. Cry with the father of old, "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief!" (Mark 9:24).

Study the Word, for faith comes by hearing. Pray continually, for faith grows in communion with God. Obey what you know, for faith flourishes in obedience. And look ever to Jesus—the Author and Finisher—who will complete the work He has begun in you.

Will you trust Him today?
