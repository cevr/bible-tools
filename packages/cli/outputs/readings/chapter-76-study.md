# Reading 76: The Two Covenants

## Introduction

One of the most misunderstood topics in Scripture concerns the two covenants—the "old" and the "new." Many believe these represent entirely different systems of salvation: law versus grace, works versus faith. Yet careful study reveals that God has always had only one way of saving sinners—through faith in Christ. The covenant at Sinai was never designed to save anyone; rather, it was given to show Israel their desperate need of a Savior already promised. Understanding this truth unlocks the entire plan of salvation and shows the beautiful harmony of Scripture from Genesis to Revelation.

## Core Truths

### God's Gracious Initiative

Before proposing any covenant with Israel, God reminded them of what He had already done for them:

> _"Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself."_ (Exodus 19:4)

[DYK🔎] The eagle metaphor is deeply significant. Eagles don't carry their young in their talons like other birds but bear them upon their wings—placing themselves between the eaglet and any danger below. So God placed Himself between Israel and their enemies, bearing them to safety.

This establishes a crucial principle: **God's grace always precedes His requirements.** He did not say, "Obey and I will deliver you." He delivered first, then called them to faithfulness.

### The Covenant Proposed at Sinai

> _"Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all the earth is Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation."_ (Exodus 19:5–6)

**Covenant** means a mutual agreement between parties—a contract with terms and conditions. In this covenant:

- **God's part**: Make Israel His peculiar treasure, a kingdom of priests
- **Israel's part**: Obey God's voice and keep His covenant (the Ten Commandments)

> _"And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone."_ (Deuteronomy 4:13)

The Ten Commandments were called "His covenant"—not because they were a bargain to be negotiated, but because they expressed God's unchanging standard of righteousness, which became the **basis** of the covenant agreement made with Israel.

### Israel's Promise

> _"And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do."_ (Exodus 19:8)

The people promised perfect obedience. Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord, built an altar with twelve pillars representing the twelve tribes, and ratified the covenant with blood:

> _"And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words."_ (Exodus 24:8)

[Q] **"What's wrong with promising to obey God? Isn't that what we should do?"**

Indeed, obedience is essential. But notice carefully: **God made no promise to help them obey.** The people essentially promised to make themselves righteous by their own efforts. This was the fatal flaw—not in the law, but in the promises upon which the covenant rested.

## Deeper Truths

### Why the First Covenant Failed

> _"But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also He is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second."_ (Hebrews 8:6–7)

The fault was not in God's law—"the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Romans 7:12). The fault lay in the **promises**—specifically, Israel's promise to keep the law by their own strength.

Christ Himself declared: _"Without Me ye can do nothing."_ (John 15:5)

And the prophet Isaiah confessed: _"All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags."_ (Isaiah 64:6)

[ILL] Imagine a child promising his father, "I will build you a beautiful house!" The father knows the child lacks skill, strength, and resources. The promise is sincere but utterly impossible to fulfill. This was Israel's promise at Sinai—sincere, but made in ignorance of their own inability. The law reveals sin; it cannot provide power to overcome it.

### The Better Promises of the New Covenant

> _"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put My laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a people... For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more."_ (Hebrews 8:10, 12)

Notice the dramatic difference. In the new covenant:

- **God promises to write His law in their hearts** (not merely on tables of stone)
- **God promises to forgive their sins**
- **God promises to be their God**

Every promise is **God's promise**, not man's. This is why it is "established upon better promises."

| First Covenant               | Second Covenant                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Israel promises to obey      | God promises to enable obedience   |
| Law written on stone         | Law written in the heart           |
| No provision for forgiveness | Full forgiveness promised          |
| Based on human works         | Based on God's grace through faith |

[DYK🔎] The order of promises in Jeremiah 31:33–34 is not chronological. Forgiveness must come first, then the writing of the law in the heart, then the final knowledge of God when all shall see Him face to face. God presents His promises as a complete package, not a step-by-step program.

### The Critical Question: How Were Ancient Believers Saved?

If the first covenant provided no forgiveness, how could anyone before Christ be saved?

> _"And for this cause He is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance."_ (Hebrews 9:15)

Christ's death was retroactive! His sacrifice covered all who had exercised faith in the promised Redeemer throughout all ages. Abel, Abraham, Moses, David—all were saved by faith in Christ, though they looked forward to His sacrifice while we look back to it.

> _"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."_ (Galatians 3:29)

[Q] **"Doesn't this make the first covenant pointless?"**

Not at all. The first covenant served a vital purpose—it brought Israel face to face with their sinfulness and utter inability to save themselves. When they promised, "All that the LORD hath spoken we will do," and then immediately broke that promise with the golden calf, they were driven to realize their need of a Savior. The covenant at Sinai was designed to point them to the provisions already available in God's covenant with Abraham.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law as Schoolmaster

> _"Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith."_ (Galatians 3:24)

The law's purpose was never to save but to **convict**—to show the sinner their desperate condition and drive them to Christ.

[ILL] A mirror reveals dirt on your face but cannot wash it off. You must go to water for cleansing. So the law reveals sin but cannot cleanse; you must go to Christ's blood for pardon and His Spirit for power.

### Sanctuary Connection

This truth is magnificently illustrated in the sanctuary service:

**Outer Court (Altar of Burnt Offering)**
The animal sacrifices connected with the first covenant did not themselves provide forgiveness—"for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins" (Hebrews 10:4). These were expressions of faith in the coming Sacrifice, pointing forward to Christ.

**Holy Place (Daily Ministry)**
The ongoing ministry of the priests represented Christ's continuous intercession for us—the means by which the benefits of His sacrifice are applied to believing sinners.

**Most Holy Place (Day of Atonement)**
Here the high priest entered once yearly to make final atonement—pointing forward to Christ's work of blotting out sins in the heavenly sanctuary and preparing a people for His return.

The sanctuary ordinances were "connected with" the first covenant but not truly "part of" it. They were the means by which the people acknowledged their guilt under the law and expressed faith in the Mediator of the better covenant.

### Righteousness by Faith: The Heart of Both Covenants

The fundamental issue between the two covenants is righteousness—how sinful humans become acceptable before a holy God.

**The first covenant approach**: Human promise to achieve righteousness by law-keeping (self-righteousness)

**The new covenant approach**: God's promise to impute and impart righteousness through faith in Christ

> _"And be found in Him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith."_ (Philippians 3:9)

The keeping of the commandments remains essential: _"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."_ (Matthew 19:17)

But **how** we keep them makes all the difference:

> _"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me."_ (Galatians 2:20)

**Justification** (imputed righteousness) and **sanctification** (imparted righteousness) are both gifts received by faith—Christ's work in us and for us—never our achievement.

[Q] **"So we don't have to obey the law under the new covenant?"**

The exact opposite is true! Under the new covenant, God writes His law in our hearts so that obedience becomes our delight rather than our burden. The law is not abolished—it is fulfilled in us by the indwelling Christ:

> _"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:4)

## Practical Application

### For Those Struggling with Sin

Are you trying to overcome sin in your own strength, making promises to God that you continually break? You are living under the old covenant experience. Instead:

1. **Acknowledge your complete inability** to produce righteousness (John 15:5)
2. **Accept Christ's forgiveness** for past failures (1 John 1:9)
3. **Yield yourself entirely to God** as an instrument of righteousness (Romans 6:13)
4. **Trust Christ to live His life in you** (Galatians 2:20)

> _"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."_ (James 4:7)

### For Those Confused About Law and Grace

The new covenant does not abolish the law—it establishes it in the heart. When you receive Christ by faith:

- Your sins are forgiven (justification)
- The law is written in your heart (sanctification)
- You desire to obey from love, not fear

This is the victory Christ offers: not merely forgiveness of sin, but power over sin—living the righteous life the law requires, not by human effort, but by Christ living in you.

### For Those Wondering Which Covenant They're Under

The question is not about time periods but about experience. Even today, many professed Christians are living under the old covenant—making promises to God, trying to be good enough, and constantly failing. The new covenant experience is available to all who will:

1. Stop trusting in self
2. Start trusting wholly in Christ
3. Allow God to work in them "both to will and to do of His good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13)

## Appeal

_"Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."_ (Hebrews 13:20–21)

Friend, God does not ask you to make yourself righteous. He asks only that you yield—surrender your self-sufficiency, your promises, your efforts—and let Christ be your righteousness. The same Christ who died for your sins now lives to write His law in your heart, transforming you into His image.

Will you today stop struggling in your own strength? Will you accept the better promises of the new covenant—God's promise to forgive, to transform, to empower? The law that once condemned you can become your delight when Christ writes it in your heart.

This is the everlasting gospel. This is righteousness by faith. This is the new covenant experience God offers you today.
