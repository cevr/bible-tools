# Reading 44: A Remarkable Symbol

## Introduction

The sanctuary service stands as one of Scripture's most profound teaching tools—a divinely designed object lesson revealing the complete plan of salvation. Through its structure, furniture, and services, God unveiled truths about Christ's sacrifice, His ongoing ministry, and the final restoration of His people. This "remarkable symbol" bridges heaven and earth, showing how God would dwell among His people and ultimately remove sin from the universe.

## Core Truths

### God's Dwelling Place Among His People

When God delivered Israel from Egypt, He immediately gave Moses detailed instructions for the sanctuary with this purpose: _"Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them"_ (Exodus 25:8).

This was no arbitrary design. God showed Moses the exact pattern: _"According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it"_ (Exodus 25:9).

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "pattern" (tabnith) indicates a precise architectural blueprint. Moses saw the heavenly sanctuary itself and was commanded to reproduce it exactly on earth—suggesting that heaven's sanctuary is the original, and earth's was the copy.

### The Structure's Significance

The sanctuary consisted of three distinct areas:

- **The Outer Court**: Where sacrifices were offered and the laver stood for cleansing
- **The Holy Place**: Containing the candlestick, table of showbread, and altar of incense
- **The Most Holy Place**: Housing the ark of the covenant with the mercy seat and God's visible presence

Each area represented a progressive experience in approaching God—and a progressive work in the plan of redemption.

### The Sacrificial System

The daily round of sacrifices taught one central truth: _"Without shedding of blood is no remission"_ (Hebrews 9:22).

When a sinner brought his lamb, he placed his hands upon its head, confessing his sins. The innocent victim then died in his place. This vivid ceremony burned into the worshiper's conscience that sin brings death—and that only a substitute could save him.

_"For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls"_ (Leviticus 17:11).

[Q] **"Wasn't this just primitive ritual, similar to pagan religions?"**

While pagans sacrificed to appease angry gods, Israel's sacrifices pointed forward to God's own provision. The system was prophetic, not placating. God was not demanding blood to satisfy His wrath, but teaching that He Himself would provide the Lamb. Every bleeding victim declared: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son" (John 3:16). The entire system was a gospel sermon in symbolic form.

## Deeper Truths

### Christ in Every Detail

The New Testament reveals that every element of the sanctuary pointed to Jesus:

**The Sacrifice**: _"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"_ (John 1:29).

**The Priest**: _"We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man"_ (Hebrews 8:1-2).

**The Way**: _"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"_ (John 14:6).

[DYK🔎] The sanctuary furniture formed a cross pattern when viewed from above. The brazen altar, laver, altar of incense, and ark of the covenant aligned vertically, while the candlestick and table of showbread extended horizontally—silently pointing to the cross of Calvary at the center of God's plan.

### Two Apartments, Two Phases of Ministry

The priests ministered daily in the holy place, but entered the most holy place only once yearly—on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). This distinction reveals two phases of Christ's heavenly ministry:

**Daily Ministry (Holy Place)**: Christ's continual intercession for repentant sinners, applying the merits of His sacrifice. _"He ever liveth to make intercession for them"_ (Hebrews 7:25).

**Final Ministry (Most Holy Place)**: The cleansing of the sanctuary, the blotting out of sins, and the final resolution of the sin problem. _"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed"_ (Daniel 8:14).

[ILL] Consider a hospital with two departments: the emergency room and the surgical theater. In the emergency room, patients receive immediate, life-saving care—stabilization, medicine, bandaging. But some conditions require the operating room, where the surgeon performs definitive work to remove the disease completely. Christ's ministry in the holy place is like the emergency room—continual care for wounded sinners. His ministry in the most holy place is the operating room—the complete eradication of sin from both the records of heaven and the hearts of His people.

### The Ark and the Law

At the very heart of the sanctuary, in the most holy place, rested the ark of the covenant. Inside were the tables of stone containing the Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 10:1-5).

Above the law stood the mercy seat, where blood was sprinkled on the Day of Atonement. This arrangement taught profound truth:

- God's law is the foundation of His government—unchangeable and eternal
- Mercy and justice meet at the cross—blood covers the broken law
- The sinner is saved, not by abolishing the law, but by the blood that satisfies its claims

_"Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other"_ (Psalm 85:10).

[Q] **"If Christ fulfilled the law, why does it remain central in the heavenly sanctuary?"**

Christ fulfilled the law by keeping it perfectly in His life and by bearing its penalty in His death—but He never abolished it. The law reveals God's character of love; to destroy it would be to deny who God is. Rather, the plan of salvation demonstrates that God's law is so sacred, so right, that heaven's highest gift was given rather than change one precept. The blood on the mercy seat shows that God maintains His law while saving the transgressor through grace.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Central Issue

The sanctuary reveals the great controversy's central question: Can God be both just and merciful? Can He uphold His law while forgiving lawbreakers?

Satan charged that God's law was arbitrary and impossible to keep. The sanctuary answers both charges:

1. **The law is right**: So sacred that only infinite sacrifice could meet its claims
2. **The law can be kept**: Christ kept it perfectly as a man, and offers His righteousness to all who believe

_"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law"_ (Romans 3:31).

### Righteousness by Faith in the Sanctuary

The sanctuary perfectly illustrates how righteousness by faith operates:

**Outer Court (Justification)**: The sinner comes with nothing but his sin. He places his hand on the lamb—transferring his guilt to the innocent substitute. The lamb dies; the sinner goes free. This is imputed righteousness—Christ's perfect record credited to the believer. _"He hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him"_ (2 Corinthians 5:21).

**Holy Place (Sanctification)**: The priest ministers daily, maintaining the sinner's connection with God through:

- The **candlestick**: Christ the Light, illuminating the mind through Scripture
- The **showbread**: Christ the Bread of Life, nourishing the soul
- The **altar of incense**: Christ's intercession making our prayers acceptable

This is imparted righteousness—Christ living His life in the believer, transforming character day by day. _"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me"_ (Galatians 2:20).

**Most Holy Place (Glorification/Sealing)**: The final work of cleansing, where Christ's people are brought into complete harmony with God's law—not by their own effort, but by His perfecting work in them. _"Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy"_ (Jude 24).

[DYK🔎] The Day of Atonement was called "Yom Kippur," from the Hebrew root meaning "to cover" or "to wipe away." On this day, sins were not merely covered temporarily but removed entirely from the camp of Israel—symbolizing the complete eradication of sin from God's people and God's universe.

### The Heavenly Reality

The earthly sanctuary was always meant to teach about heavenly realities:

_"It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us"_ (Hebrews 9:23-24).

Christ's ministry did not end at the cross. He ascended to heaven to minister as our High Priest in the true sanctuary. Understanding this truth opens vast vistas of comfort and assurance—we have a living Savior actively working for our salvation right now.

## Practical Application

### Present Access to God

Because Christ ministers in the heavenly sanctuary, we have bold access to God's throne:

_"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and having an high priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith"_ (Hebrews 10:19-22).

This means:

- **In temptation**: We can find grace to help in time of need (Hebrews 4:16)
- **In failure**: We have an Advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1)
- **In weakness**: Our High Priest sympathizes with our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15)
- **In growth**: Christ is working to perfect that which concerns us (Philippians 1:6)

### Living in Light of Christ's Ministry

Understanding the sanctuary calls us to:

1. **Confidence in Christ alone**: Not in our works, but in His perfect sacrifice and continual intercession
2. **Cooperation with His work**: Allowing Him to write His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10)
3. **Serious self-examination**: Especially as we near the close of His ministry in the most holy place
4. **Joyful obedience**: Not as a means of salvation, but as the fruit of a saving relationship

[ILL] A patient under a skilled surgeon's care need not fear the operation. Though the procedure may be deep and searching, the surgeon's purpose is healing, not harm. Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary—examining records, cleansing hearts, removing sin—need not terrify the believer who trusts in Him. His purpose is not to condemn but to complete our salvation. "He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ" (Philippians 1:6).

## Appeal

_"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need"_ (Hebrews 4:14-16).

The remarkable symbol of the sanctuary was designed by Infinite Wisdom to reveal the heart of God and the depths of His saving plan. Every bleeding lamb, every ascending incense, every priestly garment cried out: "God loves you! God will save you! God will dwell with you forever!"

Today, this Savior lives and ministers for you. He bore your sins at the cross. He presents His blood before the Father. He intercedes for your failures. He works to perfect your character. He will come again to take you home.

Will you not trust Him fully? Will you not surrender every sin to His cleansing blood? Will you not cooperate with His transforming work in your heart? The sanctuary doors stand open. Your High Priest waits. Come boldly, and find grace.
