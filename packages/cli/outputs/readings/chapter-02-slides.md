## Slide 1 – Q1: Search the Scriptures

- Question: What did Christ say to the people of His day concerning the
  Scriptures?
- Key Text: John 5:39 – “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have
  eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Object of the Search**
  - The Pharisees studied intellectually, thinking possession of the law gave
    eternal life.
  - Jesus taught that the Bible is not an end in itself; it is a map leading to
    a Person.
- **Christ Centered**
  - The entire Old Testament—history, laws, prophecies, temple services—shadows
    forth the work of Jesus.
  - To read the Bible without finding the Savior is to miss the source of life.
- **Life through Faith**
  - Eternal life is found only in the Son.
  - 1 John 5:11–12 – “And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
    life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he
    that hath not the Son of God hath not life.”
  - We search Scriptures to find the One who justifies and sanctifies.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Map and the Water**
  - Imagine a man dying of thirst who has a map to a fresh spring.
  - He studies the map, memorizes the topography, and argues about the scale.
  - Yet, he never goes to the spring to drink.
  - Does the map save him? No. It is valuable only because it leads to the
    water.
  - **Lesson:** The Bible is the map; Christ is the Living Water. We must not
    mistake the map for the Water.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Gospel in the Patriarchal Age

- Question: Do the Scriptures furnish positive evidence that the gospel was
  known in the patriarchal age?
- Key Text: Galatians 3:8 – “And the scripture, foreseeing that God would
  justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **One Gospel**
  - There is only one plan of salvation for all ages.
  - Salvation has always been by grace through faith, not by works.
- **Justification by Faith**
  - God justifies the heathen (nations) through faith.
  - Genesis 15:6 – “And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
    righteousness.”
  - Abraham is the father of all who believe.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application & Definition

- **The Lamb of God**
  - The patriarchs confessed their faith through the sacrificial system.
  - John 1:29 – “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
    Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”
- **Definition: Justification**
  - The legal act of God declaring a repentant sinner righteous.
  - This is not because of their own works, but because of the merits of Christ
    imputed (credited) to them.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Gospel to the Hebrews

- Question: Does Holy Writ contain unmistakable evidence that the Hebrews were
  taught the gospel under the former dispensation?
- Key Text: Hebrews 4:2 – “For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto
  them; but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in
  them that heard it.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Sanctuary as Gospel

- **The Sanctuary was an Object Lesson**
  - **The Altar:** Pointed to the Cross and Justification.
  - **The Laver:** Pointed to cleansing and regeneration.
    - Titus 3:5 – “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
      according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and
      renewing of the Holy Ghost.”
  - **The Most Holy Place:** Pointed to judgment and the blotting out of sin.
    - Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred
      days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Faith and Obedience

- **The Necessity of Faith**
  - The gospel did not profit some because it was not “mixed with faith.”
  - Rituals without faith in the coming Messiah could not cleanse the heart.
- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - Knowledge alone does not save; the Word must be received into the heart.
  - 1 Thessalonians 2:13 – “For this cause also thank we God without ceasing,
    because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received
    it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which
    effectually worketh also in you that believe.”
  - Faith acts as the hand that grasps God's power to obey.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Moses’ Choice

- Question: Why did Moses give up the riches of Egypt?
- Key Text: Hebrews 11:26 – “Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches
  than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the
  reward.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Reproach of Christ**
  - Christ was present with His people in the Old Testament.
  - Moses chose to share in the sufferings of the Messiah rather than enjoy the
    “pleasures of sin for a season” (Hebrews 11:25).
- **Sanctification and Self-Denial**
  - Practical sanctification is the deliberate choice to separate from the
    world.
  - It is valuing spiritual wealth over temporal gold.
- **The Reward**
  - Faith sees the invisible and values God’s approval more than human applause.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **Beads vs. Diamond**
  - If a man holds a handful of colored glass beads but is offered a diamond of
    immense value, he must drop the beads to grasp the diamond.
  - He cannot hold both.
  - **Lesson:** Moses saw the throne of Egypt as mere glass beads compared to
    the diamond of Christ’s righteousness and the eternal inheritance.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Spiritual Meat and Drink

- Question: Whence came the spiritual meat and drink of the Israelites while in
  the wilderness?
- Key Text: 1 Corinthians 10:2–4 – “And were all baptized unto Moses in the
  cloud and in the sea; And did all eat the same spiritual meat; And did all
  drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that
  followed them: and that Rock was Christ.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Rock was Christ**
  - The physical provision was a type of spiritual reality.
  - Christ was “smitten” for us, like the rock struck by Moses.
  - Isaiah 53:4–5 – “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows:
    yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was
    wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities...”
- **Daily Dependence**
  - Israel needed daily manna and water to survive.
  - Christians must feed daily on Christ through His Word.
- **Christ’s Presence**
  - Isaiah 63:9 – “In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of
    his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them...”

## Slide 15 – Q6: The Chief Corner Stone

- Question: What was the chief corner-stone of the faith of both apostles and
  prophets?
- Key Text: Ephesians 2:20 – “And are built upon the foundation of the apostles
  and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points

- **Unity of the Bible**
  - The church is built on one foundation: The Apostles (NT) and Prophets (OT).
  - Both testify of the same truth: The OT predicts Christ; the NT reveals Him.
- **The Corner Stone**
  - In ancient building, the cornerstone set the alignment for the whole
    structure.
  - Every doctrine and believer must align with the character and teaching of
    Jesus.
- **Our Spiritual House**
  - 1 Peter 2:5 – “Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
    holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by
    Jesus Christ.”
  - We must build on the Rock of Ages, not human philosophy or feelings.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Philip and the Eunuch

- Question: What part of the Scriptures did Philip hear a certain eunuch
  reading?
- Key Text: Acts 8:30 – “And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the
  prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Text**
  - The eunuch was reading Isaiah (specifically chapter 53).
  - This shows the Old Testament was the Bible of the early church and the
    primary tool for evangelism.
- **Seeking Truth**
  - The eunuch traveled a great distance to worship, showing hunger for God.
  - Jeremiah 29:13 – “And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search
    for me with all your heart.”
- **Importance of Prophecy**
  - Studying prophetic scripture is essential for understanding the mission of
    Jesus.

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Need for Guidance

- Question: When asked if he understood what he was reading, what reply did the
  eunuch make?
- Key Text: Acts 8:31 – “And he said, How can I, except some man should guide
  me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

- **The Need for Teachers**
  - God often uses human instruments to explain His Word.
  - Romans 10:14 – “How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
    believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and
    how shall they hear without a preacher?”
- **Spiritual Discernment**
  - The Bible is a spiritual book; the natural mind cannot fully grasp it (1
    Corinthians 2:14).
  - We should pray for insight.
  - Psalm 119:18 – “Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out
    of thy law.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Preaching Jesus

- Question: What did Philip then do?
- Key Text: Acts 8:35 – “Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same
  scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points

- **Christ in Isaiah**
  - Philip showed how the prophecy of the suffering servant was fulfilled in the
    crucifixion.
- **The Central Theme**
  - No matter where we begin in the Bible, the destination is the Cross.
  - The Law shows our need; Prophets predict Him; Gospels record His work;
    Epistles explain His power.
- **Personal Application**
  - Preaching Jesus means teaching His power to save from specific sins.
  - Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
    power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first,
    and also to the Greek.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: The Power of Scripture

- Question: What are the Scriptures able to do?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 3:15 – “And that from a child thou hast known the holy
  scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
  which is in Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points

- **Power to Convert**
  - Hebrews 4:12 – “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
    any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
    spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
    intents of the heart.”
- **Through Faith**
  - The Bible is not a magic charm; it works “through faith which is in Christ
    Jesus.”
  - We must believe and claim the promises.

## Slide 25 – Q10: Sanctification

- **The Cleansing Effect**
  - John 17:17 – “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”
- **Definition: Sanctification**
  - The ongoing process by which the Holy Spirit separates a believer from sin.
  - It imparts the character of Christ to the believer.
  - It is the work of a lifetime.

## Slide 26 – Q11: The Noble Bereans

- Question: What was said of the Bereans because they searched the Scriptures
  daily?
- Key Text: Acts 17:11 – “These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in
  that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
  scriptures daily, whether those things were so.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points

- **Daily Search**
  - They did not rely on the preacher alone; they verified truth at the source.
  - God desires us to be thinkers, not just reflectors.
- **The Standard of Truth**
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
    to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”
- **Individual Responsibility**
  - We cannot plead ignorance or blame traditions in the judgment.
  - We are responsible for what the Bible says.

## Slide 28 – Q12: Living by the Word

- Question: By what is man to live?
- Key Text: Matthew 4:4 – “But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall
  not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
  God.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points

- **Spiritual Food**
  - As bread sustains the body, the Word sustains the spirit.
  - Neglecting the Bible leads to spiritual weakness.
- **Victory Over Sin**
  - We live the victorious life by relying on “every word.”
  - Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
    present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
    joy...”
- **The Creative Word**
  - God's Word has power to enable obedience.
  - Psalm 33:6 – “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
    host of them by the breath of his mouth.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Diver and the Air Line**
  - A diver in the ocean relies entirely on the air line connected to the
    surface.
  - If the line is cut, he dies.
  - **Lesson:** The Christian is in the depths of a sinful world. The Word of
    God is our air line to heaven. We must live by every breath from God's
    mouth.

## Slide 31 – Q13: God Magnifies His Word

- Question: How greatly has God magnified His word?
- Key Text: Psalm 138:2 – “I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy
  name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy
  word above all thy name.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points

- **Above His Name**
  - God’s name represents His character and authority.
  - He places His Word high because His name is only as good as His Word.
- **God Cannot Lie**
  - We can have absolute confidence in His promises.
  - 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
    our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my
    laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”
- **The Basis of Judgment**
  - The Word is the standard by which all will be judged.
