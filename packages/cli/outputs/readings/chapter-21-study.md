# Bible Study: Reconciled to God

## Introduction

The human heart in its natural state stands at war with its Creator. This is not merely a passive distance but an active enmity—a mind that cannot and will not submit to God's holy law. Yet the gospel declares that God Himself has made a way for enemies to become children, for rebels to become reconciled. This study explores the profound transformation from carnal enmity to spiritual peace—a change so complete that the apostle calls it a new creation.

## Core Truths

### The Condition of the Carnal Mind

Scripture speaks plainly about humanity's natural spiritual state:

> _"The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God."_ (Romans 8:7–8)

Notice the strength of Paul's language. He does not say the carnal mind _has_ enmity, as if hostility were merely an occasional attitude. The carnal mind **is** enmity—hostility is its very nature and essence.

**Carnal mind**: The natural, unregenerate human heart; the mind governed by fleshly desires and self-will rather than by God's Spirit (Romans 8:5–8).

This enmity reveals itself in one specific way: _"it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."_ The unconverted heart refuses submission to God's commandments. It may outwardly conform for selfish reasons, but genuine, heartfelt obedience is impossible apart from divine transformation.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "enmity" (_echthra_) is the same word used in Ephesians 2:15–16 where Christ abolishes the "enmity" between Jew and Gentile, and between man and God. Paul presents the cross as the solution to humanity's deepest hostility.

### The Wages of Carnality

> _"For to be carnally minded is death."_ (Romans 8:6)

Since _"the wages of sin is death"_ (Romans 6:23) and _"sin is the transgression of the law"_ (1 John 3:4), we see a direct connection: the carnal mind, which refuses subjection to God's law, is inherently sinful. Its end is not merely physical death but eternal separation from the Source of life.

[Q] **"Isn't this too harsh? Many unconverted people seem kind and moral."**

Scripture acknowledges that the unregenerate may perform outwardly good deeds (Matthew 7:11). However, God looks upon the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). Actions done from self-interest, pride, or fear—rather than from love to God—cannot meet heaven's standard. _"Whatsoever is not of faith is sin"_ (Romans 14:23). The issue is not merely behavior but the governing principle of the heart. A tree may bear fair-looking fruit, but if the root is corrupt, the fruit cannot satisfy the Owner of the vineyard.

## Deeper Truths

### The Divine Initiative in Reconciliation

Though humanity stands as God's enemy, heaven moves first:

> _"We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."_ (2 Corinthians 5:20)

> _"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."_ (Romans 5:10)

**Reconciliation**: The restoration of friendship and harmony between two estranged parties; in the gospel, it refers to God bringing sinners back into right relationship with Himself through Christ (2 Corinthians 5:18–19).

[ILL] Consider a father whose son has run away in rebellion, squandering his inheritance and disgracing the family name. The son deserves nothing but rejection. Yet the father watches the road daily, longing for his return. When the son finally turns homeward in shame, the father runs to meet him—not with condemnation but with embrace. So God, though the offended party, initiates reconciliation and provides everything necessary for our return (Luke 15:20).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "reconciled" (_katallassō_) implies a complete change in relationship—from hostility to harmony. In classical Greek, it was used of warring nations making peace. Paul uses this powerful term to describe what Christ accomplished at Calvary.

### The Sinner's Response: Repentance and Confession

While God provides reconciliation, the sinner must respond:

> _"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out."_ (Acts 3:19)

> _"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."_ (1 John 1:9)

The example of Nineveh illustrates this beautifully. When Jonah proclaimed judgment, the king commanded:

> _"Let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands."_ (Jonah 3:8)

The result? _"God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that He had said that He would do unto them"_ (Jonah 3:10).

**Repentance**: A genuine sorrow for sin that produces a turning away from evil and toward God; not merely regret for consequences but grief over having offended a holy and loving God (2 Corinthians 7:10).

[Q] **"If God does everything, why must I repent and confess?"**

The provision for reconciliation is wholly God's work—we contribute nothing to what Christ accomplished at Calvary. But the _reception_ of that provision requires our response. God will not force salvation upon unwilling hearts. _"Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish"_ (John 3:16)—the invitation is universal, but faith is personal. Repentance and confession are not meritorious works; they are the opening of the heart to receive what God freely offers.

### The Crucifixion of the Old Man

How is the carnal mind actually destroyed?

> _"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin."_ (Romans 6:6)

This is not reformation but execution. The old nature cannot be improved—it must die. When we surrender to Christ, we are united with Him in His death. What died on Calvary was not merely Christ's physical body but our "old man"—the carnal nature that wars against God.

[ILL] A caterpillar does not become a butterfly by taking flying lessons. It must enter the cocoon and undergo a complete transformation—a death to its crawling existence and a resurrection to winged beauty. So the sinner cannot improve his way into heaven. He must die to the old life and be raised to newness of life in Christ (Romans 6:4).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law Reveals, Christ Heals

The great controversy between Christ and Satan centers on God's law. Satan claims the law is arbitrary and impossible to keep. He accuses God of demanding what creatures cannot perform.

The carnal mind proves Satan's point—_apart from Christ_. Left to ourselves, we cannot obey. The law condemns us (Romans 3:19–20).

But the gospel demonstrates that what the law could not do "in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son... condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Romans 8:3–4).

**This is righteousness by faith**: not lowering the standard but providing the power. Christ's righteousness is:

- **Imputed** (credited to our account)—justification, the basis of our standing before God
- **Imparted** (worked into our character)—sanctification, the reality of our transformed life

### Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the sinner brought a sacrifice to the outer court altar, confessing sins over the innocent victim (Leviticus 4:29). The animal died; the sinner went free. This typified what Paul describes: _"our old man is crucified with Him"_ (Romans 6:6).

But the work did not end at the altar. The priest ministered the blood in the holy place, representing Christ's ongoing intercession. The cleansing from "all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9) corresponds to this daily ministry—the continual application of Christ's sacrifice to the believer's life.

Reconciliation is not merely a legal transaction at the cross; it is a living relationship maintained by Christ's present ministry. _"Being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life"_ (Romans 5:10)—His resurrection life, His intercessory life, His life imparted to us.

[DYK🔎] The Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16) was literally "Yom Kippur"—the "Day of Covering" or "Day of Reconciliation." On this day, Israel was to afflict their souls and be completely reconciled to God, foreshadowing the final work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary before His return.

## The Evidence of Transformation

### A New Creation

> _"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."_ (2 Corinthians 5:17)

The reconciled person is not the old person with new ideas but a new person entirely. Desires change. Affections change. What once attracted now repels; what once seemed boring now delights.

### Fruit as Evidence

> _"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."_ (Matthew 7:20)

> _"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance."_ (Galatians 5:22–23)

Notice these are called _fruit_—the natural product of a healthy tree. The reconciled person does not strain to manufacture these qualities through willpower. They grow naturally from the indwelling Spirit.

[Q] **"What if I don't see this fruit in my life?"**

If the fruit is absent, examine the root. Are you genuinely connected to Christ? Have you fully surrendered the will? Partial surrender produces partial fruit. _"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me"_ (John 15:4). The solution is not trying harder but trusting more deeply—maintaining unbroken communion with Christ.

### Peace with God

> _"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (Romans 5:1)

The first result of justification is peace—not the absence of trouble but the presence of harmony with God. The war is over. The enmity is slain. The reconciled soul no longer trembles before the Judge but rests in the Father's love.

### Complete Cleansing

> _"But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin."_ (1 John 1:7)

> _"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:1)

"All sin"—not merely some sins, not merely past sins, but _all_ sin. "No condemnation"—not reduced condemnation, not postponed condemnation, but _no_ condemnation. This is the completeness of gospel reconciliation.

## Practical Application

This truth calls us to:

1. **Honest self-examination**: Is my mind carnal or spiritual? Do I find God's law a delight or a burden? The answer reveals my true condition.

2. **Complete surrender**: The old man cannot be reformed—he must be crucified. This requires the yielding of the will, the abandonment of self-rule, the enthronement of Christ as Lord of every area of life.

3. **Daily dependence**: Reconciliation is not merely a past event but a present relationship. Each day we must come to Christ, confess our failures, receive fresh cleansing, and draw upon His life for victory.

4. **Fruit-bearing witness**: The reconciled life naturally produces spiritual fruit. Rather than focusing on behavior modification, we focus on abiding in Christ—and the fruit follows.

5. **Living in peace**: The justified believer need not live in fear and uncertainty. _"We have peace with God."_ This peace is not presumption—it rests on Christ's finished work and faithful promises.

## Appeal

> _"We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."_ (2 Corinthians 5:20)

This is the apostle's earnest plea—and it is Christ's own appeal through him. Heaven is calling you today. The enmity of the carnal mind need not be your permanent condition. The old man can be crucified. A new creation can emerge.

Will you respond to heaven's initiative? Will you bring your rebellious heart to Calvary and let it die with Christ? Will you receive the peace that passes understanding—the peace of a soul at rest in God's love?

The way is open. The blood avails. The High Priest intercedes.

> _"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus."_ (Romans 8:1)

Come, be reconciled. Come, and live.
