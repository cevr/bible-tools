# Bible Study: The Law Given at Sinai

## Introduction

At Mount Sinai, God gave His people something extraordinary—not a burdensome set of rules, but a revelation of His own righteous character written in stone. This momentous event, where the Creator spoke directly to His creatures, reveals the eternal nature of God's law, its existence before Sinai, and its continuing authority for all who would be His people today. Understanding the giving of the law at Sinai unlocks profound truths about God's government, His covenant relationship with humanity, and the only way of escape from sin's penalty.

## Core Truths

### The Majesty of Sinai's Revelation

Nehemiah provides a beautiful summary of what occurred at Sinai:

> _"Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: and madest known unto them Thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses."_ (Nehemiah 9:13, 14)

Notice the characteristics of what God gave:

- **Right judgments**—perfectly fair and just
- **True laws**—accurate reflections of eternal reality
- **Good statutes and commandments**—beneficial for human flourishing
- **His holy Sabbath**—"made known" to them, indicating it was not new, but being formally revealed

[DYK🔎] When God "came down" upon Sinai, the mountain itself became a living illustration of the sanctuary. The base of the mountain (where the people stood) represented the outer court; the clouded slopes where the elders ascended represented the holy place; and the summit where Moses met God alone represented the most holy place—where God's presence dwelt above His law.

### God Spoke Directly—Then Wrote with His Own Finger

The Ten Commandments hold a unique position among all Scripture:

> _"God spake all these words, saying, Thou shalt have no other gods before Me."_ (Exodus 20:1-3)

> _"He gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God."_ (Exodus 31:18)

No other portion of Scripture was both **audibly spoken** by God's voice to an entire nation and **written by God's own finger**. This double authentication emphasizes the supreme importance of these ten words.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew phrase translated "ten commandments" is literally "ten words" (_aseret ha-devarim_). These are not merely commands but living words that express God's very character—what He is like and what His children will become when His law is written on their hearts.

### Two Distinct Laws Given at Sinai

Scripture distinguishes between two different laws given through Moses:

**The Ten Commandments (Moral Law):**

- Written by God's finger on stone (Exodus 31:18)
- Placed **inside** the ark of the covenant (Deuteronomy 10:5)
- Eternal principles of righteousness

**The Law of Moses (Ceremonial/Civil Law):**

- Written by Moses in a book (Deuteronomy 31:24)
- Placed **beside** the ark (Deuteronomy 31:26)
- Temporary regulations pointing to Christ

> _"When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished."_ (Deuteronomy 31:24)

This distinction is crucial for understanding which laws remain binding and which found their fulfillment in Christ.

## Deeper Truths

### The Law Existed Before Sinai

[Q] **"Wasn't the Ten Commandments first given at Mount Sinai? Why should we follow laws that were given specifically to the Jews?"**

Scripture reveals that God's moral law existed long before Sinai. Consider the evidence:

**Before the Exodus:**

> _"When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and His laws."_ (Exodus 18:16)

Moses was already teaching "the statutes of God, and His laws" before reaching Sinai!

**The Sabbath Before Sinai:**

> _"Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord... Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none."_ (Exodus 16:23-26)

When some went out to gather manna on the Sabbath, God responded:

> _"How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws?"_ (Exodus 16:28)

The Sabbath was already "My commandment"—God's existing law—not something being newly invented.

**From the Beginning:**

> _"By one man's disobedience many were made sinners."_ (Romans 5:19)
> _"Sin is the transgression of the law."_ (1 John 3:4)

Adam's disobedience was sin. Sin is law-breaking. Therefore, God's law existed in Eden—and was transgressed there. The law was not created at Sinai; it was **formally proclaimed and written** there.

[ILL] Imagine a family whose values of honesty, kindness, and respect have been passed down for generations through word and example. Then the patriarch decides to write these family values in a formal document for all to see. The writing doesn't create the values—it records what already existed. So it was at Sinai: God wrote in stone the eternal principles that had governed His universe from the beginning.

### The Broken Tablets—A Profound Symbol

When Moses descended from the mountain and saw Israel worshipping the golden calf:

> _"Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount."_ (Exodus 32:19)

This act symbolized more than Moses' anger. The broken tablets represented Israel's broken covenant—their violation of the very laws God had just given them. The first commandment ("Thou shalt have no other gods") and the second ("Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image") lay shattered while Israel danced before an idol.

Yet God, in His mercy, wrote the law again:

> _"He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments."_ (Deuteronomy 10:4)

[DYK🔎] The ark that contained these restored tablets became the centerpiece of the sanctuary—and sat directly beneath the mercy seat. This positioning reveals profound gospel truth: God's law (His righteous requirements) and His mercy (His gracious provision) meet together. Justice and mercy kiss at the cross (Psalm 85:10).

### The Law as Israel's "Peculiar Treasure"

What was Israel's greatest advantage?

> _"What advantage then hath the Jew?... chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God."_ (Romans 3:1, 2)

The "oracles of God"—His revealed truth, centered in His law—were not a burden but a **privilege**. No other nation had such direct access to divine wisdom.

God's promise was conditional:

> _"Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all the earth is Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation."_ (Exodus 19:5, 6)

The purpose of their calling was not exclusivity but **mission**—to be priests to all nations, mediating God's truth to the world.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law Reveals God's Character and Government

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the central issue is God's law. Satan claimed God's law was arbitrary, burdensome, and impossible to keep. At Sinai, God publicly proclaimed His law to demonstrate:

1. **His law is "right," "true," and "good"** (Nehemiah 9:13)—not arbitrary but reflecting eternal reality
2. **His law defines sin** (1 John 3:4)—establishing the standard of righteousness
3. **His law is eternal**—written in stone, signifying permanence

The Ten Commandments are not merely rules but a **transcript of God's character**. When we read "Thou shalt not steal," we learn that God is honest. When we read "Remember the Sabbath," we learn that God is Creator and desires relationship with His creatures.

### The Law for All God's People—Jew and Gentile

[Q] **"But wasn't this covenant only for the Jews? What does Sinai have to do with Christians today?"**

God's covenant promise actually began with Abraham:

> _"In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."_ (Genesis 12:3)

The promise was never intended for Jews alone but for all who would believe:

> _"If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."_ (Galatians 3:29)

James confirms the Ten Commandments as "the law of liberty" by which Christians will be judged:

> _"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill... So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."_ (James 2:10-12)

By quoting two commandments from the Decalogue, James identifies exactly which law remains the Christian's standard—the same Ten Commandments given at Sinai.

### The Sanctuary Connection

The two tables of stone were placed inside the ark of the covenant:

> _"I... put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded me."_ (Deuteronomy 10:5)

The ark with its mercy seat formed the very center of Israel's worship—the place where God's presence dwelt. This arrangement reveals:

- **The law is foundational to God's government** (beneath His throne)
- **The law is covered by mercy** (the mercy seat)
- **The law is accessed through blood** (sprinkled on the Day of Atonement)

In the heavenly sanctuary, John saw "the ark of his testament" (Revelation 11:19)—God's law remains at the center of heavenly worship. What was given at Sinai reflects what has always existed in heaven.

## Practical Application

### Teaching the Law to Our Children

God gave specific instruction about transmitting His law:

> _"Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."_ (Deuteronomy 6:7)

This describes not formal instruction alone but **life-integrated teaching**—making God's principles part of everyday conversation and experience.

### Understanding Sin's Severity

The law reveals what sin truly is and its terrible consequences:

> _"The wages of sin is death."_ (Romans 6:23)
> _"The soul that sinneth, it shall die."_ (Ezekiel 18:4)

God is merciful, yet His mercy does not negate His justice:

> _"The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty."_ (Numbers 14:18)

This creates a profound dilemma: How can God be both merciful **and** just? How can He forgive the guilty without "clearing" them—declaring them innocent when they are not?

### The Danger of Presumption

Many presume upon God's patience:

> _"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."_ (Ecclesiastes 8:11)

[ILL] A man walks on thin ice over a frozen lake. Because he does not immediately fall through, he assumes he is safe. He walks further, ignoring the warning cracks beneath his feet. His safety is an illusion—and his presumption will be his destruction. So it is with those who continue in sin because judgment has not yet fallen.

The warning for those who sin willfully is severe:

> _"If we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment."_ (Hebrews 10:26, 27)

### The Only Escape

Here is the gospel's glorious answer to sin's dilemma:

> _"The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)

Jesus satisfied the law's demands on our behalf. His perfect life provides the righteousness the law requires. His sacrificial death pays the penalty the law demands. His present ministry in the heavenly sanctuary applies His merits to all who believe.

The law cannot be lowered, abolished, or ignored—but its requirements can be met in Christ:

- **Justification**: Christ's righteousness credited to our account (imputed)
- **Sanctification**: Christ's righteousness worked into our character (imparted)

## Appeal

The law given at Sinai reveals the character of the God who spoke it. It is not a cold legal code but the loving boundary of a Father who knows what brings life and what brings death. The same finger that wrote "Thou shalt not" also wrote "I am the LORD thy God"—establishing relationship before requirement.

[Q] **"But I have broken this law. What hope is there for me?"**

There is wonderful hope! The very law that condemns you points to the Savior who redeems you. The ceremonial law given alongside the Ten Commandments taught Israel to look for a Lamb who would take away sin. That Lamb has come.

> _"The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)

God's messengers today carry the same message:

> _"Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him... Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him."_ (Isaiah 3:10, 11)

Which will you choose? The law stands unchanging—written in stone, kept in the ark, judging all humanity. But mercy pleads from the mercy seat above it.

Will you come to Christ today—not to earn salvation by law-keeping, but to receive by faith the gift of His perfect obedience? Will you allow Him to write His law, not on tables of stone, but on the living tablet of your heart (Hebrews 8:10)?

Come to the One who kept the law perfectly for you, died under its condemnation for you, and now lives to intercede for you. In Him alone is escape from sin's penalty and power.

> _"The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)
