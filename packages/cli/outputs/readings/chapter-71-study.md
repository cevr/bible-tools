### Q1. How does Nehemiah describe the giving of the law at Sinai?

“Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and
gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: and
madest known unto them Thy holy Sabbath, and commandedst them precepts,
statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses.” Nehemiah 9:13, 14.

**Answer:** Nehemiah presents the giving of the law not as a burden, but as a
divine gift of revelation. The passage highlights several critical aspects of
God’s law:

- **Divine Origin:** God "came down" and "spake... from heaven." The law is a
  transcript of His own character and will; it is not of human invention.
- **Moral Quality:** The laws are described as "right," "true," and "good."
  Because God is love (1 John 4:8), His law is the law of love. Paul confirms
  this in the New Testament, calling the law "holy, and just, and good" (Romans
  7:12).
- **The Sabbath:** Nehemiah singles out the Sabbath specifically. He notes that
  God "madest known unto them Thy holy Sabbath." This implies the Sabbath
  existed before, but the knowledge of it had been obscured during their slavery
  in Egypt. At Sinai, God restored this institution to its rightful place.

**[ILL]** Imagine a traveler lost in a dense forest at night. If a rescue pilot
drops a map and a flashlight down to him, the traveler does not complain that
the map restricts his freedom to walk into a swamp. He rejoices because the map
is "good" and "true"—it shows the safe way home. God’s law is that map, given to
guide us safely through a sinful world.

### Q2. What was the primary advantage possessed by the Hebrews?

“What advantage then hath the Jew?... chiefly, because that unto them were
committed the oracles of God.” Romans 3:1, 2.

**Answer:** The great privilege of the Hebrew nation was that they were chosen
to be the "depository" of God’s truth for the world.

- **The Oracles of God:** This term refers to the direct utterances or
  revelations of Jehovah. To possess the written law and the prophecies was a
  distinct advantage because it gave them a clear knowledge of God’s will,
  whereas the surrounding nations were groping in the darkness of paganism.
- **Stewardship:** This advantage was not for their salvation alone, but that
  they might be lights to the world (Isaiah 49:6). Privilege always implies
  responsibility.
- **Relevance to Us:** Today, spiritual Israel (the church) possesses the
  completed Scriptures. We have the "advantage" of the full light of the gospel
  and the law.

**Definition:**

- **Oracles:** Divine communications or authoritative revelations delivered by
  God to His people.

### Q3. Before the law was given at Sinai, how did Moses render judgment to the people?

“When they have a matter, they come unto me and I judge between one and another,
and I do make them know the statutes of God, and His laws.” Exodus 18:16.

**Answer:** This text provides powerful evidence that the Law of God existed
_before_ the tables of stone were given at Sinai.

- **Pre-Sinai Knowledge:** This conversation between Moses and Jethro occurred
  in Exodus 18, while the giving of the law on Sinai occurs in Exodus 20. Yet,
  Moses already knew the "statutes of God and His laws."
- **Eternal Nature of Law:** The moral law is the foundation of God's
  government. Just as God is eternal, the principles of His government are
  eternal. They did not spring into existence at Sinai; they were merely
  codified (written down) there because sin had dulled man's memory and
  conscience.
- **Universal Standard:** If the law had not existed, Moses could not have
  judged between the people. Judgment requires a standard of right and wrong.

**[ILL]** Gravity existed long before Sir Isaac Newton formulated the
mathematical laws to describe it. Newton did not "invent" gravity; he defined it
so people could understand it clearly. Similarly, God’s moral law existed from
eternity, but at Sinai, God "defined" it in written form for clarity.

---

### Q4. In the wilderness, before reaching Sinai, how did Moses explain the absence of the manna on the seventh day?

“He said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, Tomorrow is the rest
of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord... Six days ye shall gather it; but on the
seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none.” Exodus 16:23-26.

**Answer:** Here we see the Sabbath obligation in full force weeks before the
Ten Commandments were spoken from the mountain.

- **The Miracle of Manna:** God used the manna to teach a weekly lesson on the
  sanctity of the Sabbath.
  1.  Manna fell for six days.
  2.  On the sixth day, a double portion fell.
  3.  On the seventh day, no manna fell.
  4.  Manna kept over from Friday to Sabbath remained fresh, whereas on other
      days it bred worms (Exodus 16:20, 24).
- **Restoring the Rhythm:** God was re-educating His people on the weekly cycle
  of creation (Genesis 2:1–3), which they had likely lost sight of during their
  bondage in Egypt.

---

### Q5. When some of the people went out to gather manna on the seventh day, what did the Lord say to Moses?

“And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My
laws?” Verse 28.

**Answer:** God viewed the violation of the Sabbath—even in the matter of
gathering food—as a direct refusal to keep His "commandments and laws."

- **Obedience is a Test of Faith:** The people had to trust that the double
  portion gathered on Friday would be enough. Going out on Saturday showed a
  lack of faith in God's provision.
- **Sin is Serious:** God did not say, "It's just a small mistake." He called it
  a refusal to keep His law. The essence of sin is rebellion against the will of
  God.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** True obedience comes from trusting God's word.
  When we believe God cares for us, we can rest (Sabbath) in His finished work
  and His provision, rather than working in our own anxiety.

---

### Q6. What additional evidence do we have that the moral law of Ten Commandments existed before it was proclaimed at Mount Sinai?

“By one's disobedience many were made sinners.” Romans 5:19. "Whosoever
committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the
law." 1 John 3:4.

**Answer:** The logic of Scripture proves the pre-existence of the Law:

1.  **Definition of Sin:** The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of the
    law" (1 John 3:4).
2.  **Historical Fact:** The Bible declares that Adam, Cain, the antediluvians,
    and the Sodomites were "sinners" (Genesis 13:13; Romans 5:12).
3.  **Conclusion:** If there was _sin_ before Sinai, there must have been a
    _law_ to define that sin. As Paul argues, "where no law is, there is no
    transgression" (Romans 4:15).

- **Cain and Abel:** God told Cain, "sin lieth at the door" (Genesis 4:7). Cain
  knew that murder was wrong long before the Sixth Commandment was written on
  stone.
- **Joseph:** In Egypt, Joseph refused to commit adultery, saying, "How then can
  I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9). He knew the
  Seventh Commandment principle by heart.

**Definition:**

- **Sin:** Lawlessness; stepping across the boundary line drawn by God’s moral
  law.

---

### Q7. How were the Ten Commandments first presented to the people at Sinai?

“God spake all these words, saying,... Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.”
Exodus 20:1-3.

**Answer:** The Ten Commandments are unique among all regulations in the Bible
because they were spoken directly by the voice of God to the entire assembly.

- **Audible Revelation:** God did not whisper these to Moses in private
  initially; He thundered them from the mountaintop so that every man, woman,
  and child heard His voice (Deuteronomy 4:12–13).
- **Authority:** This public proclamation established the Decalogue (Ten Words)
  as the supreme constitution of the universe, distinct from the ceremonial laws
  given later through Moses.

**[ILL]** If a king sends a messenger with a letter, it is authoritative. But if
the king himself stands on a balcony and speaks to the crowd, the weight of
authority is undeniable and personal. God spoke the Law personally to show its
unchangeable nature.

---

### Q8. How was it then written down as a permanent record?

“He gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount
Sinai two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.”
Ex. 31:18.

**Answer:**

- **Written by God:** Unlike other parts of the Bible written by inspired men,
  the Ten Commandments were written directly by God.
- **Finger of God:** This indicates the direct power and Spirit of God (Luke
  11:20).
- **Tables of Stone:** Stone represents durability and permanence. Laws written
  on parchment or paper can fade or tear; laws engraved in rock are meant to
  endure.
- **New Covenant Application:** Under the New Covenant, the same "finger of God"
  (the Holy Spirit) writes this same law not on stone, but on the "fleshy tables
  of the heart" (2 Corinthians 3:3; Hebrews 8:10).

---

### Q9. How did Moses show that the children of Israel had broken their part of the covenant between them and God?

“It came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the
[golden] calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the
tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.” Exodus 32:19.

**Answer:** Moses’ action was a visible enactment of what Israel had already
done spiritually.

- **The Broken Covenant:** The people had promised, "All that the Lord hath
  spoken we will do" (Exodus 19:8). This was the Old Covenant—a promise of
  obedience based on human strength.
- **Instant Failure:** By worshipping the golden calf, they broke the first and
  second commandments immediately. They demonstrated that the carnal mind is not
  subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be (Romans 8:7).
- **The Lesson:** Breaking the stone tablets showed that man cannot keep God's
  law without a Mediator and a new heart. The Old Covenant failed because of the
  people's faulty promises (Hebrews 8:6–8).

---

### Q10. With what exactness did the Lord write the law the second time?

“He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments,
which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the
day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them unto me.” Deuteronomy 10:4.

**Answer:**

- **No Changes:** God did not amend the law to make it easier after the people
  failed. He wrote "according to the first writing." The standard of God’s
  righteousness is unchangeable (Psalm 89:34).
- **Mercy and Law:** The fact that God wrote them a _second_ time shows His
  mercy. He gave them another chance. But the law itself remained the perfect
  standard of holiness.
- **Sanctuary Truth:** The law must be perfect because it acts as the standard
  of judgment in the sanctuary service.

**[ILL]** If a student fails a math test because they didn't study, the teacher
does not change the laws of mathematics to help them pass the next time. The
rules of math remain true. Instead, the teacher helps the student learn the
material so they can meet the standard. God does not change His Law; He changes
_us_ through Christ to meet its claims.

---

### Q11. Where did Moses place these two tables of stone?

“I... put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord
commanded me.” Verse 5.

**Answer:**

- **The Ark of the Covenant:** The tables were placed inside the Ark, the most
  sacred object in the Hebrew religion, located in the Most Holy Place.
- **The Foundation:** The Mercy Seat (representing God’s throne of grace)
  covered the Ark. This illustrates that God’s government is founded upon
  justice (the Law inside the Ark) and mercy (the Atonement cover above it).
  "Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne" (Psalm 89:14).
- **Christ's Heart:** As the Ark typified Christ, this prophecy points to the
  Messiah saying, "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
  heart" (Psalm 40:8).

---

### Q12. What other law was also given at this time?

“When Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until
they were finished.” Deut. 31:24.

**Answer:** We must distinguish between the "Moral Law" (Ten Commandments) and
the "Ceremonial/Civil Law" (Law of Moses).

- **Method of Writing:** The Ten Commandments were written by God on stone. The
  ceremonial laws were written by Moses in a book (Deuteronomy 31:24).
- **Placement:** The stone tablets went _inside_ the Ark. The book of the law
  was placed in a pocket _by the side_ of the Ark (Deuteronomy 31:26).
- **Purpose:** The ceremonial law dealt with sacrifices, feast days, and the
  priesthood. These were "shadows" pointing forward to Christ (Colossians
  2:14–17). When Christ died, the veil was torn, and these ceremonial laws met
  their fulfillment. The Moral Law, however, defines sin and remains the
  standard for all mankind.

**Definition:**

- **Ceremonial Law:** The system of types, symbols, and sacrifices that pointed
  to the coming Savior. It was temporary, lasting only until the cross.

---

### Q13. Why did the Lord call His people out of the land of Egypt?

“He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen with gladness:... that
they might observe His statutes, and keep His laws.” Psalm 105:43-45.

**Answer:**

- **Saved to Serve:** God did not save Israel so they could live however they
  pleased. He saved them so they would be free to obey Him. In Egypt, they were
  forced to serve idols and work on the Sabbath. Redemption gave them the
  liberty to do right.
- **The Order of Salvation:** Note the sequence: First, He "brought forth His
  people" (Salvation/Justification), and _then_ the purpose is "that they might
  observe His statutes" (Sanctification/Obedience). We do not keep the law _to
  get_ saved; we keep it because we _are_ saved.

**[ILL]** A doctor cures a patient of a deadly heart condition. The doctor then
gives the patient a set of health rules to maintain their new life. The patient
follows the rules not to _become_ healed (that's already done), but out of
gratitude and to maintain the life they've been given.

---

### Q14. How were they to teach the law to their children?

“Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when
thou sit test in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou
liest down, and when thou risest up.” Deuteronomy 6:7.

**Answer:**

- **Diligence:** Teaching the character of God requires constant, intentional
  effort.
- **Lifestyle Evangelism:** It was not just for the Sabbath synagogue service.
  The law of love was to be the topic of conversation in daily life—at dinner,
  on a walk, at bedtime.
- **Character Formation:** By constantly beholding the principles of God, the
  children would become "changed into the same image" (2 Corinthians 3:18).

---

### Q15. What promise to Israel hinged on their keeping the instructions that He had given them?

“Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye
shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is
Mine: and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.” Exodus
19:5, 6.

**Answer:**

- **The Condition:** "If ye will obey." God’s covenant blessings are always
  connected to a cooperative relationship of faith and obedience.
- **The Promise:** They would be a "peculiar treasure" (special property) and a
  "kingdom of priests." Their mission was to mediate the knowledge of God to the
  nations.
- **Holiness:** A "holy nation" means a people set apart, whose distinct
  lifestyle (health, worship, ethics) demonstrates the superiority of serving
  Jehovah.

**Definition:**

- **Peculiar:** In Old English (and KJV), this means "belonging exclusively to
  one person; special." It does not mean "strange" or "weird," but rather
  "distinctive and precious."

---

### Q16. Was this promise made to the Jews alone?

“Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country... and I will
bless thee... and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” Genesis
12:1-3. “If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to
the promise.” Galatians 3:29 [Note: Reference corrected from 3:19 in source to
3:29 based on context].

**Answer:**

- **Universal Intent:** God’s plan was never restricted to one ethnicity.
  Through Abraham, "all families of the earth" were to be blessed.
- **Spiritual Israel:** The New Testament clarifies that the true "seed" of
  Abraham is Christ. Therefore, anyone who is "in Christ"—regardless of their
  genealogy—inherits the promises made to Abraham (Galatians 3:29).
- **The "Israel of God":** The church today is called to be that "chosen
  generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation" (1 Peter 2:9). The call to
  keep God's law and shine as lights applies to Christians now.

---

### Q17. What reveals that the Ten Commandment law, given at Sinai, is the law for the Christian?

“Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty
of all, For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if
thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the
law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of
liberty.” James 2:10-12.

**Answer:**

- **New Testament Confirmation:** James, writing to Christians long after the
  cross, quotes the Ten Commandments (Do not kill, Do not commit adultery) as a
  binding standard.
- **Unity of the Law:** You cannot pick and choose. Breaking one commandment is
  breaking the whole law because the Law represents the will of the Lawgiver.
- **Law of Liberty:** James calls it the "law of liberty." To the sinner, the
  law is a bondage and condemnation. But to the believer, who has the law
  written on the heart by the Holy Spirit, obedience is freedom. "I will walk at
  liberty: for I seek thy precepts" (Psalm 119:45).

**RBF Connection:** Real liberty is not freedom _to_ sin, but freedom _from_ the
power of sin. The Spirit of Christ empowers the believer to live the law of love
freely.

---

### Q18. What is the wages of sin?

“The wages of sin is death.” Romans 6:23. “In the day that thou eatest thereof
thou shalt surely die.” Genesis 2: 17. “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.”
Ezekiel 18:4.

**Answer:**

- **The Penalty:** God’s law has a penalty attached to it. That penalty is not
  just physical death, but the "second death"—eternal separation from God, the
  Source of life.
- **Justice:** A law without a penalty is merely good advice. The stability of
  the universe requires that rebellion (sin) be checked.
- **No Eternal Torment:** The text says the wages is "death," not "eternal life
  in misery." The sinner ceases to exist; they "shall be as though they had not
  been" (Obadiah 1:16).

---

### Q19. How did death enter this world?

“Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,' and so
death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” Rom. 5:12.

**Answer:**

- **The Great Controversy:** Death is an intruder. It was not part of God's
  original creation. It entered through the "one man," Adam, when he chose to
  believe Satan's lies over God's command.
- **Universal Condition:** Because of that fall, humanity inherited a fallen
  nature. "All have sinned." We are not sinners just because we sin; we sin
  because we are born separated from God, with a bent toward self.

---

### Q20. God is merciful, but will His mercy clear the guilty?

“The Lord is long suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and
transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty.” Numbers 14:18. (See Exodus
34:5-7.)

**Answer:**

- **The Dilemma:** This is the central problem of the universe. God is "great in
  mercy" and wants to forgive. However, He is also just and can "by no means
  clear the guilty." He cannot simply pretend sin didn't happen, or His law
  would be void.
- **The Solution:** This points us to the Atonement. God cannot clear the guilty
  _without a substitute_. In Christ, the penalty was paid. God remains just (the
  law is upheld) and the justifier (the sinner is forgiven) of him which
  believeth in Jesus (Romans 3:26).
- **Sanctuary Imagery:** The blood sprinkled on the Mercy Seat covered the
  broken law beneath it. Mercy and Truth met together (Psalm 85:10).

---

### Q21. What is the result of willfully sinning against God?

“If we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth,
there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of
judgment and fiery indignation... He that despised Moses' law died without
mercy... Of how much sorer punishment... shall he be thought worthy, who hath
trodden under foot the Son of God... and hath done despite unto the Spirit of
grace?” Hebrews 10:26-29.

**Answer:**

- **Willful Sin:** This refers not to a slip or a struggle, but to a persistent,
  obstinate rejection of God's authority after knowing the truth. It is a
  "treading under foot the Son of God."
- **No More Sacrifice:** Christ's sacrifice is infinite, but it applies only to
  the repentant. If a man rejects Christ and clings to sin, there is no other
  way to be saved.
- **The Spirit of Grace:** To continue in known sin is to insult the Holy Spirit
  who brings grace. It hardens the heart until repentance becomes impossible.

**Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The process of being made holy. The text says the blood
  "sanctified" us; to treat that blood as common or unholy by returning to a
  life of sin is the height of ingratitude.

---

### Q22. To whom is the execution of judgment given?

“Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.” Romans 12:19. “The Father
hath... given to the Son... authority to execute judgement also.” John 5:26, 27.
(See Jude 14-15.)

**Answer:**

- **God's Prerogative:** Humans are not to take vengeance. Judgment belongs to
  God alone, who knows the motives of the heart.
- **Christ the Judge:** The Father has committed all judgment to the Son. Why?
  Because Jesus is the "Son of Man." He has lived our life, fought our battles,
  and can judge with perfect equity and sympathy (Hebrews 4:15).
- **Investigative Judgment:** Before the execution of judgment (vengeance),
  there is a work of investigation to determine who has accepted the robe of
  Christ's righteousness.

---

### Q23. What presumptuous way of life do many pursue?

“Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the
heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.” Ecclesiastes 8:11.

**Answer:**

- **Abusing Patience:** Because God is longsuffering and does not strike the
  sinner dead immediately, men mistake His patience for indifference. They
  think, "I sinned and nothing happened, so I am safe."
- **Hardening of the Heart:** This presumption leads the heart to be "fully set"
  to do evil. It is a dangerous state of spiritual numbness.

**[ILL]** A driver who speeds constantly without getting a ticket eventually
believes the laws don't apply to him. But his lack of a ticket doesn't mean the
police aren't watching; it just means the day of reckoning is delayed. When the
crash comes, it is sudden and often fatal.

---

### Q24. What message has God sent to men by His appointed messengers?

“Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the
fruit of their doings. Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him. for the
reward of his hands shall be given him.” Isaiah 3:10, 11. “We are ambassadors
for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.” 2 Corinthians 5:20. (See 2
Timothy 2:24-26.)

**Answer:**

- **The Two Ways:** The message is binary. For the righteous (those justified by
  faith and walking in obedience), it "shall be well." For the wicked (those
  clinging to sin), there is "woe."
- **The Ambassador's Plea:** God's messengers are not just announcing doom; they
  are "beseeching" (begging) men to be reconciled to God. The heart of the
  gospel is God trying to win back the trust of His children.
- **Reaping and Sowing:** Both the righteous and the wicked eventually "eat the
  fruit of their doings." Character determines destiny.

---

### Q25. How can man escape the penalty of sin?

“The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus
Christ our Lord.” Romans 6:23.

**Answer:**

- **The Gift:** We earn death (wages), but we cannot earn life. Eternal life is
  a "gift."
- **Through Jesus Christ:** The only escape from the broken law's penalty is
  faith in Jesus.
  1.  **Justification:** He died our death, paying the wages we owed.
  2.  **Sanctification:** He lives out His life in us, enabling us to walk in
      obedience to the law.
- **The Invitation:** The Law at Sinai reveals our need; the Cross at Calvary
  provides the remedy. The Law drives us to Christ to be cleansed, and Christ
  points us back to the Law to live a life of love and gratitude.

**[ILL]** A man is drowning in a stormy sea (the penalty of sin). He cannot swim
to shore (human works). A lifeboat (Christ) comes and pulls him out. He is saved
entirely by the strength of the rescuer. But once in the boat, he does not jump
back into the water; he stays in the boat and follows the captain's orders,
grateful for his life.
