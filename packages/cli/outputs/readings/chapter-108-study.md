# Reading 108: The Intermediate State

## Introduction

What happens when a person dies? This question has captivated human minds since the fall of Adam. Many today believe the soul immediately goes to heaven or hell at death, yet Scripture presents a remarkably different picture—one of peaceful, unconscious rest until the resurrection. Understanding this truth not only corrects popular error but reveals the character of a merciful God and the glorious hope of the resurrection morning.

## Core Truths

### Death as Sleep

The Bible consistently uses one primary figure to describe death: **sleep**.

> _"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:13)

This is no accidental metaphor. Jesus Himself used this language when speaking of His friend Lazarus:

> _"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep... Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead."_ (John 11:11, 14)

**Sleep**: In Scripture, death is likened to sleep because both involve unconsciousness—a temporary cessation of thought, perception, and activity (Psalm 13:3; Daniel 12:2).

[DYK🔎] The phrase "fallen asleep" appears over fifty times in the New Testament when referring to death. This consistent language was not poetic embellishment but inspired teaching about the nature of death itself.

### Where Do the Dead Sleep?

> _"And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake."_ (Daniel 12:2)

The dead rest in the grave—in "the dust of the earth"—not in some intermediate realm of consciousness. Job understood this clearly:

> _"If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness."_ (Job 17:13)

### How Long Will They Sleep?

> _"So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep."_ (Job 14:12)

The dead remain in this unconscious state until the heavens pass away—until the resurrection at Christ's return. Job himself expressed this waiting hope:

> _"If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come."_ (Job 14:14)

## Deeper Truths

### The Complete Unconsciousness of Death

Scripture is remarkably clear about the condition of the dead:

**They know nothing of earthly events:**

> _"His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them."_ (Job 14:21)

**Their thoughts cease entirely:**

> _"His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish."_ (Psalm 146:4)

**They have no knowledge whatsoever:**

> _"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."_ (Ecclesiastes 9:5)

**All mental and emotional faculties cease:**

> _"Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun."_ (Ecclesiastes 9:6)

[Q] **"But doesn't the soul live on after the body dies?"**

This common belief comes not from Scripture but from Greek philosophy, which taught the inherent immortality of the soul. The Bible teaches that God _"only hath immortality"_ (1 Timothy 6:16), and that immortality is something believers _"seek for"_ (Romans 2:7) and will _"put on"_ at the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:53–54). Man is not naturally immortal; he became a "living soul" only when God's breath combined with the dust (Genesis 2:7). At death, this process reverses: the breath returns to God, the body returns to dust, and the living soul—the conscious being—ceases to exist until God recreates it at the resurrection.

### The Dead Cannot Praise God

> _"The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence."_ (Psalm 115:17)

> _"For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?"_ (Psalm 6:5)

If the righteous dead were consciously in heaven, would they not be praising God continually? Yet Scripture declares they are in "silence" with no remembrance of God. This testimony alone overthrows the popular doctrine of immediate heavenly reward at death.

### Even Righteous David Has Not Ascended

[DYK🔎] On the Day of Pentecost, filled with the Holy Spirit, Peter made a remarkable statement about King David—a man after God's own heart:

> _"For David is not ascended into the heavens."_ (Acts 2:34)

This was spoken roughly a thousand years after David's death. If any Old Testament saint deserved immediate entrance into heaven, surely it was David. Yet Peter, under divine inspiration, declared that David had not ascended to heaven but was still sleeping in his grave (Acts 2:29).

[Q] **"If the righteous dead are not in heaven, and the wicked dead are not in hell, what is the purpose of the final judgment?"**

Precisely! If souls went immediately to their eternal destination at death, the judgment would be meaningless—a mere formality confirming what had already been decided for perhaps thousands of years. Some would have been in bliss or torment for ages before their cases were even examined. But Scripture teaches that judgment precedes reward: _"Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be"_ (Revelation 22:12). Christ brings the reward _with Him_ at His coming—the dead do not receive it before.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Origin of the Immortal Soul Doctrine

The teaching that humans possess an immortal soul that survives death originated not with Scripture but with the serpent in Eden:

> _"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die."_ (Genesis 3:4)

This was Satan's first lie, and it has echoed through human history. Greek philosophers like Plato taught the soul's natural immortality, and this pagan concept entered Christianity through compromise with surrounding culture. The biblical teaching of death as unconscious sleep directly contradicts this foundational deception.

[ILL] Consider a man who falls into a deep, dreamless sleep at night. He knows nothing of the hours that pass, feels no pain, experiences no passage of time. When morning comes and he awakens, it seems but a moment since he closed his eyes. So it is with those who sleep in Jesus. Whether they rest for one year or one thousand years, the resurrection morning will seem to follow immediately upon their closing their eyes in death. A millennium will pass as a single night's sleep.

### The Sanctuary and the State of the Dead

In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement to complete the work of judgment and cleansing. So Christ, our High Priest, entered the heavenly Most Holy Place in 1844 to begin the investigative judgment—the examination of every case before the resurrection occurs (Daniel 7:9–10; Revelation 14:7).

This judgment would be unnecessary if the dead were already in heaven or hell. The very existence of the pre-advent judgment confirms that the dead are unconscious, awaiting the verdict that will be executed at Christ's return.

### God's Mercy in Death's Unconsciousness

The unconscious state of death reveals God's compassion. Consider: if the righteous dead could look down from heaven and see their loved ones suffering persecution, poverty, or spiritual decline, would their joy be complete? If parents could watch their children reject God and walk toward eternal destruction, could heaven be a place of perfect peace?

God, in His wisdom, has ordered it so that the dead _"knoweth it not"_ and _"perceiveth it not"_ (Job 14:21). This is mercy. The sleeping saints are spared the anguish of witnessing earthly sorrows until all things are made new.

## Practical Application

### This Truth Protects Us from Deception

If we believe the dead are conscious and can communicate, we become vulnerable to one of Satan's masterpieces of deception—spiritualism. Apparitions of deceased loved ones, "messages from beyond," and supposed communications with the dead are not what they claim to be. They are demonic impersonations designed to lead souls away from truth (1 Timothy 4:1; Revelation 16:14).

Understanding that the dead _"know not any thing"_ and have _"no more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun"_ (Ecclesiastes 9:5–6) provides complete protection against this dangerous delusion.

### This Truth Gives Us Certain Hope

> _"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead."_ (Isaiah 26:19)

The resurrection is not merely a distant doctrine but a living hope! Paul declares that if there is no resurrection, _"then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished"_ (1 Corinthians 15:18). Our hope is not in some ethereal existence immediately after death but in the glorious resurrection when Christ returns:

> _"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

David expressed this same certain hope:

> _"As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness."_ (Psalm 17:15)

Not at death, but _"when I awake"_—at the resurrection—David expected to behold God's face and be satisfied.

## Appeal

Dear friend, does this truth bring you comfort or concern? For those who sleep in Jesus, death holds no terror—it is but a moment's rest before eternal glory. The grave cannot hold God's children, for Christ has conquered death and holds the keys (Revelation 1:18).

If you have lost loved ones who died trusting in Christ, take heart: they are not suffering, not watching your struggles, not waiting anxiously. They rest peacefully, and the next moment of their consciousness will be the glorious appearing of Jesus and the trumpet call of God.

But if you have not yet given your life to Christ, consider: there is no second chance after death, no purgatory, no opportunity to change one's destiny. _"Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation"_ (2 Corinthians 6:2).

> _"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."_ (John 5:28–29)

Will you be among those who awake to everlasting life? The choice is made now, in this present life. May we each, by God's grace, live so that we may say with Job: _"I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God"_ (Job 19:25–26).
