### Q1. Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth?

"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Genesis 1:1.

**Answer:**

The Bible opens with the most foundational truth of existence: God is the source
of all life and matter. Before there was a universe, there was God. This
singular verse refutes atheism (which claims no God), polytheism (which claims
many gods), and pantheism (which claims God is the universe itself).

This truth establishes God’s absolute sovereignty. Because He is the Creator, He
is also the Owner and Ruler of all things. In the message of the **Three
Angels** (Revelation 14:6–12), which prepares the world for the Second Coming,
the call to worship is grounded specifically in God’s identity as Creator:
"Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea" (Revelation 14:7).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a master artist painting a masterpiece. The
painting does not own itself; it belongs to the artist who conceived it and
brought it into being. In the same way, we are not our own; we are God's
property by creation, and double His property by redemption (1 Corinthians
6:20).

### Q2. What were the means that God used to bring the heavens and the earth into existence?

"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the
breath of His mouth. For He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood
fast." Psalm 33:6-9.

**Answer:**

God did not need tools, pre-existing matter, or long evolutionary ages to
create. He used His **Word**. This is often called _fiat creation_—creation by
command. The same power that spoke light into existence (Genesis 1:3) is the
power that speaks spiritual life into the dead soul of a sinner.

This highlights a vital principle of **Righteousness by Faith**:

1.  **In Creation:** God speaks, and matter obeys instantly.
2.  **In Redemption:** God speaks His promises (the Gospel), and when we receive
    that Word by faith, it creates righteousness in the heart (Romans 10:17).

We cannot create a clean heart in ourselves any more than we could create a
star. But we can receive the Word of God, which possesses the creative energy to
transform us (1 Peter 1:23).

**Definition:**

- **Fiat Creation:** The act of creating something out of nothing simply by a
  command or decree.

### Q3. Through whom did God create all things?

"For by Him [the Son] were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are
in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him."
Colossians 1: 16. "All things were made by Him [literally, "through Him"] ; and
without Him was not any thing made that was made." John 1:3. (See also Hebrews
1:1,2.)

**Answer:**

The active Agent in creation was none other than Jesus Christ (the Word). This
is a powerful proof of His divinity. He is not a created being; He is the
Creator Himself.

This connects the work of **Creation** with **Redemption**:

- The One who formed man from the dust is the same One who wept at Lazarus’
  grave.
- The One who hung the stars in space is the same One who hung upon the cross to
  save us.

Because Jesus is the Creator, He alone has the power to recreate the human soul.
He knows exactly how the human machinery—physical, mental, and spiritual—is
supposed to work, and He is able to restore it (Hebrews 7:25).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a complex watch breaks, you do not take it to a
carpenter; you take it to the watchmaker. The maker understands the mechanism.
Since Christ made us, He is the only one qualified to fix the brokenness caused
by sin.

### Q4. What was God's purpose in creating the earth?

"For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the
earth and made it; He hath established it, He created it not in vain, He formed
it to be inhabited. " Isaiah 45:18.

**Answer:**

God is Love (1 John 4:8), and true love desires to share life and joy. He did
not create the earth to be a chaotic wasteland, but to be a perfect home for
holy, happy beings.

Although sin has temporarily marred this purpose, God’s plan has not been
abandoned. The **Great Controversy** between Christ and Satan is playing out on
this earth, but the final outcome is assured. Through the plan of salvation, God
will restore the earth to its original purpose—to be the eternal home of the
redeemed (Matthew 5:5; Revelation 21:1–3).

### Q5. How does the Bible describe the creation of man?

"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life; and man be- came a living soul." "And the Lord God
caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and He took one of his
ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib, which the Lord God
had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man." Genesis
2:7,21-22.

**Answer:**

This verse provides the biblical formula for the nature of man. It is crucial
for understanding the state of the dead and the need for resurrection.

**The Biblical Equation:** $$ \text{Dust of the Ground} + \text{Breath of Life
(Spirit)} = \text{Living Soul} $$

- **Dust:** The physical elements of the earth.
- **Breath of Life:** The life-giving spark/energy from God.
- **Living Soul:** The result of the union. The "soul" is not a separate,
  ghostly entity that lives inside the body; the soul _is_ the whole person (the
  combination of body and breath).

Just as a wooden box is made of wood and nails, a man is made of dust and
breath. If you pull the nails out of the wood, the box ceases to exist.
Likewise, when the breath of life returns to God, the "living soul" ceases to
exist until the resurrection (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Psalm 146:4).

**Definition:**

- **Soul (Hebrew _Nephesh_):** A living being; a person; a life. It refers to
  the whole individual, not a disembodied spirit.

### Q6. In whose image was man created?

"So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male
and female created He them." Genesis 1:27.

**Answer:**

Mankind was the crowning act of creation. While animals were made after their
"kind," man was made after the "God-kind." This "image" includes:

1.  **Physical resemblance:** Though God is Spirit, man was formed to reflect
    the outward glory and dignity of his Maker.
2.  **Mental and Spiritual faculties:** The ability to reason, to choose, to
    love, and to have moral character.

Sin marred and almost obliterated this image. The work of **Sanctification** is
the process of restoring the image of God in the soul. Through the Holy Spirit,
God writes His law in our hearts and minds, restoring us to the moral likeness
of Jesus (Hebrews 8:10; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A mirror covered in mud cannot reflect the face of the
one looking into it. Sin is the mud. As we submit to the cleansing blood of
Christ (Justification) and the washing of the Word (Sanctification), the mud is
removed, and we begin to reflect Jesus clearly to the world.

### Q7. What authority did God originally give to him?

"Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over the cattle, and over all the earth." the fowl of the air, and over the
cattle, and over all the earth." Verse 26. "What is man, that Thou art mindful
of him? and the son of man, that Thou visitest him? For Thou hast made him a
little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou
madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all
things under his feet." Psalm 8:4-6.

**Answer:**

God appointed Adam as the vice-gerent (representative ruler) of the earth. He
was to rule with love, just as God rules the universe. This **dominion** implies
stewardship—responsibility for the welfare of the creation.

When Adam listened to Satan and obeyed him, he surrendered this dominion to the
enemy. Satan became the "god of this world" (2 Corinthians 4:4). However,
Christ, the "Second Adam," came to win back what the first Adam lost (Micah
4:8). Through Christ’s victory, the dominion will eventually be restored to the
redeemed.

**Definition:**

- **Dominion:** Sovereign authority or rule. In a biblical sense, it is a
  delegated authority to care for and govern God's creation.

---

### Q8. God gave man an ideal home. What was it?

"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man
whom He had formed." "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden
of Eden to dress it and to keep it." Genesis 2:8,15.

**Answer:**

God placed man in a garden, not a palace or a city. This indicates that contact
with nature is God’s ideal for humanity. Even in paradise, man was given work to
do ("to dress it and to keep it").

- **Useful Occupation:** Work is not a curse; it was part of the blessing before
  sin entered. Useful labor promotes health of body and mind.
- **The School of Nature:** The garden was Adam’s schoolroom, and God was his
  instructor.

### Q9. What was the food that God gave to perpetuate immortality?

"And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to
the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden,
and the tree of knowledge of good and evil." Verse 9.

**Answer:**

There were two specific trees in the midst of the garden.

1.  **The Tree of Life:** This tree had the power to perpetuate life
    indefinitely. This teaches us that man is not _innately_ immortal (like God
    is). Man has "conditional immortality." We live only as long as we have
    access to the source of life. When man sinned, he was barred from this tree
    so he would not become an immortal sinner (Genesis 3:22–24).
2.  **Diet:** God's original diet for man consisted of fruits, grains, and nuts
    (Genesis 1:29). Vegetables were added after the fall (Genesis 3:18). This
    original diet points us toward the principles of **Health Reform**—caring
    for the "temple of the Holy Ghost" (1 Corinthians 6:19) with the best
    possible fuel.

---

### Q10. What simple plan was used by God to test the loyalty and obedience of Adam and Eve?

"And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou
mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."
Verses 16-17.

**Answer:**

God operates a government of law and love. He desires willing obedience, not
forced servitude. To be a moral being, man had to have the power of choice.

- **The Test:** The tree of knowledge was not poisonous; the danger lay in
  **disobedience** to God’s Word. It was a simple test to see if they would
  trust God’s definition of right and wrong or seek to define it for themselves.
- **The Penalty:** "Thou shalt surely die." The wages of sin is death (Romans
  6:23). This is not an arbitrary punishment from an angry God, but the natural
  result of cutting oneself off from the Source of Life.

This highlights the nature of the **Law of God**. It is a wall of protection.
Adam and Eve were free to eat from _every_ other tree. Satan always tries to
make God's law look restrictive, when in fact it provides the greatest liberty
(James 1:25).

---

### Q11. What is the power that upholds all the universe?

"Upholding all things by the word of His power." Hebrews 1:3.

**Answer:**

Creation was not a one-time event after which God walked away (as Deism
suggests). The same "Word of His power" that created the universe is actively
sustaining it moment by moment. Every breath we take, every beat of the heart,
is a gift of God's sustaining power.

**Practical Application:** If God upholds the sun and stars by His Word, can He
not uphold you? When we feel weak in our fight against sin, we must remember
that the Sustainer of the universe is our Saviour. He is "able to keep you from
falling" (Jude 24).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Think of a light bulb. It doesn't just need electricity
once to turn on; it needs a constant flow of current to stay lit. If the flow
stops, the light goes out. Similarly, we are dependent on a constant flow of
power from Christ to exist physically and to live victoriously spiritually.

---

### Q12. As we gaze upon the heavens, what do they declare unto us?

"The heavens declare the glory of God... Day unto day uttereth speech." Psalm
19:1-2.

**Answer:**

Nature is God’s "second book." While the Bible is His written revelation, nature
is His visual revelation. The vastness, order, and beauty of the cosmos speak to
us of God’s infinite power, wisdom, and love.

Though nature is now marred by the curse of sin (thorns, decay, storms), it
still retains enough of the Creator's handwriting to lead our minds to Him.

---

### Q13. What is it that the visible Creation reveals to us?

"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and
Godhead; so that they are without excuse." Romans 1:20.

**Answer:**

The visible world reveals the invisible God. Paul argues that the evidence for a
Designer is so overwhelming in nature that humanity is "without excuse" for
denying Him.

- **Eternal Power:** Seen in the energy of the storms, the sun, and the sea.
- **Godhead (Divinity):** Seen in the intelligent design, the balance of
  ecosystems, and the complexity of life.

This knowledge lays a responsibility on every human being to seek the Creator
and glorify Him.

### Q14. An obedient Christian is whose workmanship?

"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
hath before ordained that we Should walk in them." Ephesians 2:10.

**Answer:**

Here we see the beautiful parallel between physical creation and spiritual
**re-creation**.

1.  **The New Creation:** When a sinner comes to Christ, a miracle takes place
    that is just as supernatural as the creation of the world. "If any man be in
    Christ, he is a new creature" (2 Corinthians 5:17).
2.  **The Purpose:** We are created _unto_ good works. We are not saved _by_
    good works, but we are created _for_ them.
3.  **Imparted Righteousness:** God does not just forgive the past
    (Justification); He orchestrates a new life of obedience (Sanctification).
    He prepares the "good works" for us to walk in by the power of the
    indwelling Christ.

This creates a true Righteousness by Faith experience: We do not boast in our
works, for we are simply His "workmanship." He is the Potter; we are the clay.

### Q15. Looking beyond the present sin-cursed earth, to what promise may we fix our gaze?

"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be
remembered, nor come into mind." Isaiah 65:17. (See Revelation 21:1.)

**Answer:**

The story of the Bible ends where it began: with a perfect Creation. The plan of
salvation is not merely to save souls for a ghostly heaven, but to restore the
physical creation.

- **Restoration:** Paradise lost will be Paradise restored.
- **No more curse:** There will be no more sin, sickness, death, or sorrow
  (Revelation 21:4).
- **The Meek shall inherit:** The promise of Jesus in Matthew 5:5 will be
  fulfilled.

This hope anchors the Christian in times of trouble. We look for a "city which
hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10).

---

### Q16. There is an important difference between the true God and all false gods. What is it?

"Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the
earth, even they shall perish from the earth. and from under these heavens."
Jeremiah 10:11.

**Answer:**

The distinguishing characteristic of the true God is His power to **create**.
False gods (idols, money, self, philosophical concepts) cannot create life or
matter.

Because Creation is the seal of God’s authority, He gave a memorial of Creation
to distinguish Himself from all false deities. That memorial is the
**Seventh-day Sabbath**.

- "For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day"
  (Exodus 20:11).
- By keeping the Sabbath, we acknowledge the true God who created us,
  distinguishing Him from the gods that "shall perish."

---

### Q17. To whom alone are we to give our worship?

"O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker."
Psalm 95:6.

**Answer:**

Worship belongs exclusively to the Maker. To worship a created being (angel,
saint, or human) or a created object (idol, nature) is idolatry.

In the final conflict of the Great Controversy, the issue will be: **Who do you
worship?**

- The Beast power demands worship (Revelation 13:15).
- God calls us to worship Him because He is the **Maker** (Revelation 14:7).

True worship involves the surrender of the will to our Creator, acknowledging
that since He made us, He has the right to direct our lives.

---

### Q18. What is the great truth that makes all men on earth brothers?

"Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal
treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our
fathers?" Malachi 2:10.

**Answer:**

The doctrine of Creation is the only solid foundation for human brotherhood and
equality.

- We are all descendants of the same first parents (Adam and Eve).
- We are all hand-crafted by the same God.
- "He hath made of one blood all nations of men" (Acts 17:26).

Racism, caste systems, and hatred are a denial of the Creation account. If we
truly believe God created every human being, we must treat every person with
dignity and love. To mistreat a fellow human is to insult the Maker who formed
him (Proverbs 14:31).
