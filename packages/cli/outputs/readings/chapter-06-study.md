# Bible Study: Creation and the Creator

## Introduction

The doctrine of Creation stands as the foundational truth of Scripture, revealing not only _how_ we came to exist but _why_ we exist and _for whom_ we exist. In an age when the biblical account of origins faces unprecedented challenge, understanding Creation becomes essential—not merely as historical fact, but as the basis for worship, identity, purpose, and hope. The Creator who spoke worlds into existence is the same God who speaks life into the spiritually dead heart and who will one day create all things new.

## Core Truths

### The Identity of the Creator

Scripture opens with a declaration that answers humanity's deepest questions about origins:

> _"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."_ (Genesis 1:1)

This verse stands as a great divide. It separates those who acknowledge a personal, all-powerful Creator from those who look to chance, matter, or impersonal forces to explain existence. The Hebrew word for "God" here is _Elohim_—a plural noun suggesting the fullness and majesty of the Godhead.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word _bara_ ("created") is used exclusively in Scripture for divine creative activity. While humans can _make_ or _form_ things from existing materials, only God can _bara_—bring into existence what did not exist before.

The means of Creation reveals God's infinite power:

> _"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth... For He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast."_ (Psalm 33:6, 9)

No struggle, no effort, no process of trial and error—simply the spoken word of Omnipotence, and worlds leaped into existence.

### Christ the Active Agent of Creation

A truth often overlooked is that the Son of God was the active Agent through whom the Father created all things:

> _"For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him."_ (Colossians 1:16)

> _"All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made."_ (John 1:3)

This truth carries profound implications. The hands that flung stars into space are the same hands that were pierced on Calvary. The voice that called light into being is the same voice that whispers peace to the troubled conscience. Christ is not merely our Redeemer—He is our Maker.

[DYK🔎] The phrase in John 1:3, "without Him was not any thing made," uses a double negative in Greek (_oude hen_) for absolute emphasis. Not a single thing—from the greatest galaxy to the smallest particle—came into existence apart from Christ.

### The Purpose of Creation

God did not create the earth as an afterthought or experiment:

> _"He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited."_ (Isaiah 45:18)

The Hebrew word translated "in vain" is _tohu_—the same word used in Genesis 1:2 ("without form"). God did not leave the earth formless and empty; He had a purpose—to fill it with life, with beings created in His own image, with whom He could share the joy of existence and the fellowship of love.

## Deeper Truths

### The Creation of Mankind

The creation of man stands apart from all other creative acts:

> _"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."_ (Genesis 2:7)

While other creatures were spoken into existence, God _formed_ man with His own hands, like a potter carefully shaping clay. Then came the most intimate act—God breathed into Adam's nostrils. This was not merely the impartation of oxygen but the gift of life from the very breath of the Almighty.

[ILL] Consider a master sculptor who has crafted countless beautiful statues. Yet one day he creates something different—a figure into which he breathes his own life, his own image, his own capacity for thought and love. This figure alone can look back at the sculptor, know him, and love him in return. So it was when God created man. Of all visible creation, humanity alone bears the divine image and can enter into conscious, loving fellowship with the Creator.

The creation of woman reveals God's design for human relationship:

> _"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam... and the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man."_ (Genesis 2:21-22)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "rib" (_tsela_) is elsewhere translated "side" or "chamber." Eve was not merely made from a bone but from Adam's very side—not from his head to rule over him, nor from his feet to be beneath him, but from his side to be his equal companion, near his heart to be loved.

### The Image of God

> _"So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them."_ (Genesis 1:27)

Notice that _bara_ appears three times in this single verse—the only place in Genesis 1 where this word is repeated. This triple emphasis signals the unique significance of humanity's creation.

[Q] **"What does it mean to be made in God's image? Does God have a physical form like ours?"**

The "image of God" (_imago Dei_) refers primarily to:

- **Moral likeness**: The capacity for righteousness, holiness, and love
- **Rational capacity**: The ability to think, reason, and make moral choices
- **Creative ability**: The power to create, appreciate beauty, and exercise dominion
- **Relational nature**: The capacity for fellowship with God and with one another
- **Dominion**: Authority to represent God as stewards over creation (Genesis 1:26)

When sin entered, this image was marred but not destroyed. The plan of salvation aims at nothing less than the complete restoration of God's image in humanity (Colossians 3:10; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

### Man's Original Dominion and Home

God crowned humanity with authority and responsibility:

> _"Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet."_ (Psalm 8:6)

This dominion was not despotic exploitation but loving stewardship—caring for creation as God's representatives. Adam was placed in Eden "to dress it and to keep it" (Genesis 2:15)—words implying both cultivation and protection.

[DYK🔎] The word "Eden" in Hebrew means "delight" or "pleasure." God's first gift to humanity was a home designed for joy—every tree "pleasant to the sight, and good for food" (Genesis 2:9). God delights in the happiness of His creatures.

### The Test of Loyalty

In Eden stood two special trees—the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil:

> _"Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."_ (Genesis 2:16-17)

[Q] **"Why would a loving God place a forbidden tree in the garden? Wasn't He setting Adam up to fail?"**

The tree was not a trap but a gift—the gift of freedom. Love cannot exist without choice. God did not create robots programmed for obedience but beings capable of genuine love, which requires the genuine possibility of rejection. The tree represented:

- **The principle of free will**: Without the possibility of disobedience, obedience has no moral value
- **The boundary of creaturely dependence**: There are realms of knowledge that belong to God alone
- **The opportunity for faith**: Trusting God's word even when the reason is not fully understood

Notice the generosity of God's command: "Of _every_ tree of the garden thou mayest _freely_ eat"—only one was withheld. God gave everything; He asked for trust in one small matter.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Word That Creates and Sustains

The same word that created the universe continues to uphold it:

> _"Upholding all things by the word of His power."_ (Hebrews 1:3)

Every atom holds together, every planet maintains its orbit, every heartbeat continues—because Christ's word sustains it all. Creation was not a one-time event after which God stepped back; it is a continuous relationship of dependence.

This truth connects directly to the sanctuary message. In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ ministers as both Creator and Redeemer. The One who made us is the One who intercedes for us. His creative power is the same power available for our re-creation—the transformation of character that righteousness by faith produces.

[ILL] When a skilled physician treats a patient, his knowledge of how the body was designed enables him to restore it to health. So Christ, who designed the human heart, knows exactly what is needed to heal it from sin. He who made us knows how to remake us.

### Creation Reveals the Creator

> _"The heavens declare the glory of God... Day unto day uttereth speech."_ (Psalm 19:1-2)

> _"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse."_ (Romans 1:20)

Creation is God's first Bible—a revelation of His character written in the language of nature. The stars speak of His infinity, the flowers of His beauty, the mountains of His stability, the seasons of His faithfulness. Those who reject the Creator are "without excuse" because the evidence surrounds them daily.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "the things that are made" in Romans 1:20 translates the Greek word _poiēmasin_, from which we derive "poem." Creation is God's poetry—His artistic expression of truth, beauty, and love.

### The Mark of the True God

In a world filled with competing claims to deity, Scripture identifies the true God by one distinguishing mark:

> _"The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens."_ (Jeremiah 10:11)

The true God is the Creator God. Every false god, every idol, every philosophy that denies Creation—all will ultimately perish. Only the Creator remains eternally.

This is why the Sabbath, the memorial of Creation, becomes so significant in the last days. The first angel's message calls the world to "worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters" (Revelation 14:7)—language drawn directly from the fourth commandment. The final conflict centers on worship, and true worship recognizes God as Creator.

### One Creator, One Human Family

> _"Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?"_ (Malachi 2:10)

The doctrine of Creation establishes the unity and equality of the human race. All distinctions of race, nationality, and social status fade before this truth: we all have one Maker. We are brothers and sisters by creation, and Christ died to make us brothers and sisters by redemption.

## Practical Application

### We Are His Workmanship

> _"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."_ (Ephesians 2:10)

The word "workmanship" (_poiēma_) echoes Romans 1:20—we are God's poem, His masterpiece. Just as God created Adam and Eve for fellowship and service, so He re-creates the believer for "good works." This is righteousness by faith in action: not works to earn salvation, but works flowing from a new creation.

This truth calls us to:

1. **Identity**: Know that you are not an accident of nature but a deliberate creation of infinite Love. Your existence has meaning and purpose.

2. **Worship**: Give wholehearted worship to the Creator alone. Let the Sabbath become not merely a day of rest but a celebration of relationship with your Maker.

3. **Stewardship**: Care for your body, mind, and the natural world as sacred trusts from the Creator.

4. **Transformation**: Surrender daily to the re-creative power of Christ. The same word that spoke worlds into existence can speak peace, purity, and power into your life.

5. **Brotherhood**: Treat every human being as a fellow creature made in God's image, regardless of external differences.

### Hope in the New Creation

> _"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind."_ (Isaiah 65:17)

The God who created Eden will create Eden restored. The power that brought light out of darkness at the beginning will banish all darkness forever in the end. Creation points backward to our origin and forward to our destiny.

[Q] **"If God could create a perfect world that fell into sin, how do we know the new earth won't fall too?"**

The new creation will be populated by beings who have learned through the great controversy the terrible nature of sin and the infinite love of God. Having seen the results of rebellion, having experienced redemption, the universe will be eternally secure—not because free will is removed, but because love has been fully revealed and eternally chosen.

## Appeal

> _"O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker."_ (Psalm 95:6)

The Creator calls you today—not as a distant Deity demanding homage, but as a loving Father who formed you with His own hands and breathed into you the breath of life. He who made you knows you intimately. He who designed your heart knows its deepest needs.

Perhaps you have wandered far from your Maker. Perhaps the image of God in you has been marred by sin and sorrow. The good news is this: the Creator is also the Re-Creator. The same word that called light into existence can call new life into your soul.

Will you kneel before your Maker today? Will you acknowledge Him as the source of your life, the center of your worship, and the hope of your future? He who created you longs to re-create you—to restore in you the image of God, to prepare you for an eternity of fellowship with Him in the new heavens and new earth.

The Creator awaits your response.
