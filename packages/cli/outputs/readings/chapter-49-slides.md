## Slide 1 – Title Slide

- **Topic:** The Judgment
- **Based on:** Ecclesiastes 3:17, Daniel 7, and Revelation 14
- **Theme:** God’s Justice, Christ’s Mediation, and the Vindication of the
  Saints

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Scope of the Judgment

- **Question:** How many must meet the test of the judgment?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 3:17 – “I said in mine heart, God shall judge the
  righteous and the wicked.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **Universal Scope:**
  - The judgment includes every moral agent who has ever lived.
  - No one is exempt, from kings to servants (2 Corinthians 5:10 – “For we must
    all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive
    the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be
    good or bad.”).
- **The Reason:**
  - God acts to vindicate His law and His character.
  - It proves His ways are just and that He has done everything possible to save
    humanity.
- **Two Classes:**
  - Humanity is ultimately divided into only two groups: the righteous (in
    Christ) and the wicked (rejected grace).

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The University Exam:**
  - Imagine a great university entrance exam where every student must submit
    their paper.
  - The professor grades based on what is written on the page, not on wealth,
    popularity, or appearance.
  - God is no respecter of persons; He reviews the life record (Acts 10:34 –
    “Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no
    respecter of persons:”).

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Judgment of Angels

- **Question:** Will any besides the human family be judged?
- **Key Text:** Jude 6 – “And the angels which kept not their first estate, but
  left their own habitation, He hath reserved in everlasting chains under
  darkness unto the judgment of the great day.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **The Origin of Sin:**
  - Rebellion began with Lucifer and his angels (Revelation 12:7–9 – “And there
    was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the
    dragon fought and his angels... And the great dragon was cast out...”).
- **Accountability:**
  - High position does not excuse rebellion.
  - They are "reserved" in darkness, awaiting the execution of their sentence.
- **Cosmic Scale:**
  - The judgment settles the dispute between Christ and Satan before the
    watching universe.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Court-Martial:**
  - If a high-ranking general commits treason, his rank does not grant him
    immunity.
  - In fact, his betrayal is more serious because of his position.
  - Fallen angels, who stood in God's presence, are held accountable for leaving
    their "first estate."

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Where Judgment Begins

- **Question:** With which class will the judgment begin?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 4:17 – “For the time is come that judgment must begin at
  the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them
  that obey not the gospel of God?”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Sanctuary & Faith)

- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - Like the Day of Atonement in the earthly sanctuary (Leviticus 16), this
    judgment investigates God's own people ("house of God").
  - It reviews those written in the Book of Life to see if their faith is
    genuine.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - This is not a judgment to earn salvation by works.
  - It checks if the believer is wearing the "wedding garment"—Christ’s imputed
    and imparted righteousness (Matthew 22:11 – “And when the king came in to
    see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:”).
- **Definition:**
  - **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of judgment occurring in heaven
    _before_ Christ returns to determine fitness for the kingdom.

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Corporate Audit:**
  - When auditors visit a company, they check the company's own books first, not
    the competitor's.
  - God begins His audit with His own "family"—those who profess to be His
    children—to ensure their profession matches their character.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Standard of Judgment

- **Question:** Out of what will they be judged?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:10 – “A fiery stream issued and came forth from before
  Him; thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten
  thousand stood before Him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Evidence:**
  - God uses "books" (plural).
  - This includes the Book of Life and records of works (Revelation 20:12 – “And
    I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were
    opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life...”).
- **The Standard:**
  - We are judged by works, not as merit, but as _evidence_ of faith.
  - Obedience is the fruit of a renewed heart (James 2:17 – “Even so faith, if
    it hath not works, is dead, being alone.”).
- **Transparency:**
  - The books are opened before thousands of witnesses (angels) to prove God is
    just.

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Court Transcript:**
  - In a trial, a stenographer keeps a precise transcript of every word spoken.
  - If a defendant claims innocence, the record is read back.
  - The books of heaven are God’s transcript of every thought, word, and deed.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: The Resurrection

- **Question:** Will there be a resurrection of all the dead?
- **Key Text:** John 5:28 – “For the hour is coming in the which all that are in
  the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done
  good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
  resurrection of damnation.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points

- **Two Resurrections:**
  - Jesus distinguishes between the "resurrection of life" and the "resurrection
    of damnation."
- **Pre-Determination:**
  - When the dead rise, their destiny is already fixed.
  - This proves an investigation must have happened _while they were sleeping_
    to decide which resurrection they qualify for.

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Harvest:**
  - A farmer separates wheat from tares (weeds) at the harvest.
  - Both grew in the same field, but they are treated differently based on what
    they _are_.
  - The resurrection reveals what the soul became during probation.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: The First Event

- **Question:** What first occurs when the voice of Christ is heard?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord Himself shall descend from
  heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of
  God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **Priority of the Saints:**
  - The righteous dead rise _first_, before the living are caught up.
- **The Voice:**
  - The voice of the Son of God (the Archangel) breaks the bonds of death.
- **Verdict Executed:**
  - Rising "first" confirms they passed the Investigative Judgment and were
    accounted worthy of life.

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Dignitary's Reception:**
  - When a King visits a city, loyal citizens are invited to meet him first.
  - Christ calls His sleeping saints from the "dusty beds" of earth to meet Him
    before He deals with the rebellious world.

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: Condition of the Risen

- **Question:** In what condition are the saints when raised from the dead?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:52 – “For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead
  shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **Glorification:**
  - This is the final step of salvation: freedom from the _presence_ of sin.
  - The body sown in weakness is raised in power (1 Corinthians 15:43 – “It is
    sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is
    raised in power:”).
- **Victory:**
  - The "sting of death" is removed; mortality puts on immortality.

---

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Butterfly:**
  - A caterpillar spins a cocoon and appears to die.
  - It emerges as a butterfly—beautiful and free from crawling on the earth.
  - The resurrection changes our decaying bodies into glorious bodies like
    Christ's.

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Separation of Classes

- **Question:** Are the righteous and the wicked raised together?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:5 – “But the rest of the dead lived not again
  until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.” (See
  also v. 4).

---

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points

- **The Interval:**
  - There is a 1,000-year gap (the Millennium) between the two resurrections.
- **First Resurrection:**
  - Occurs at the Second Coming.
  - For the "blessed and holy" (Revelation 20:6 – “Blessed and holy is he that
    hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no
    power...”).
- **Second Resurrection:**
  - Occurs after the 1,000 years.
  - For "the rest of the dead" (the wicked).

---

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **Two Trains:**
  - The "Life Express" leaves in the morning, taking people to a holiday
    destination.
  - The "Judgment Train" leaves much later, taking prisoners to sentencing.
  - They are distinct events for distinct groups.

---

## Slide 26 – Q9: Accounted Worthy

- **Question:** Why have these been separated from the others before the voice
  of Christ is heard?
- **Key Text:** Luke 20:35 – “But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain
  that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given
  in marriage.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points (Faith & Sanctuary)

- **Accounted Worthy:**
  - We are not worthy by merit; we are "accounted" (reckoned) worthy through
    faith in Jesus.
  - Christ’s life stands in place of the sinner’s life.
- **The Examination:**
  - Before the Second Advent, the books were opened.
  - Sins were confessed and forsaken, and the believers were "clean" (Leviticus
    16:30 – “For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
    cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.”).

---

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Visa:**
  - To enter a country, you need a visa granted _before_ you board the plane.
  - When the plane arrives, those with visas enter; those without are turned
    away.
  - The pre-advent judgment grants the "visa" for heaven before Jesus arrives.

---

## Slide 29 – Q10: The Living Righteous

- **Question:** What takes place with the living righteous at the second advent?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:51 – “Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall
  not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,” (See also 1 Thess 4:17).

---

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points

- **Translation:**
  - They are taken to heaven without seeing death.
  - Instant change from mortality to immortality in the "twinkling of an eye."
- **Sealed Character:**
  - They receive the "seal of God" before the trumpet sounds (Revelation 7:3 –
    “Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have
    sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.”).
  - They have proven that God’s grace can keep them from falling (Jude 24).

---

## Slide 31 – Q10: Illustration

- **Enoch and Elijah:**
  - These Old Testament prophets were taken to heaven without dying.
  - They serve as "types" (examples) of the final generation who will be
    translated when Jesus comes.

---

## Slide 32 – Q11: Watch and Pray

- **Question:** Why are these separated from among the living wicked, and thus
  changed?
- **Key Text:** Luke 21:36 – “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may
  be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to
  stand before the Son of man.”

---

## Slide 33 – Q11: Key Points

- **Vigilance:**
  - "Watch and pray" implies active dependence on God, refusing spiritual sleep.
- **Standing in Judgment:**
  - To "stand" means to be acquitted.
  - Psalm 1:5 – “Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
    sinners in the congregation of the righteous.”
- **Source of Worthiness:**
  - They escape corruption through the power of the Holy Spirit, allowing Christ
    to live in them.

---

## Slide 34 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Flood Rescue:**
  - During a flood, boats rescue those waiting on rooftops signaling for help.
  - Those who ignored warnings and stayed inside are left behind.

---

## Slide 35 – Q12: Depth of the Investigation

- **Question:** How far will this investigation of cases extend?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 12:14 – “For God shall bring every work into
  judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”

---

## Slide 36 – Q12: Key Points

- **Hidden Sins:**
  - God judges motives and the "secret things," not just outward appearance.
- **Idle Words:**
  - Words reveal the heart condition (Matthew 12:36 – “But I say unto you, That
    every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the
    day of judgment.”).
- **Deep Cleansing:**
  - Because judgment is deep, cleansing must be deep ("law written in the heart"
    – Hebrews 8:10).
  - Good news: Secret prayers and unseen tears are also recorded.

---

## Slide 37 – Q12: Illustration

- **The House Inspector:**
  - A house may look freshly painted outside, but an inspector checks the
    foundation and basement for rot.
  - God is the inspector of the soul; He checks the foundation of our character.

---

## Slide 38 – Q13: The Book of Remembrance

- **Question:** When and where are the open and the secret things recorded?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:16 – “Then they that feared the Lord spake often one
  to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance
  was written before Him for them that feared the lord, and that thought upon
  His name.”

---

## Slide 39 – Q13: Key Points

- **Real-Time Recording:**
  - God "hearkens and hears" our conversations and conduct.
- **Book for the Righteous:**
  - This book records faithfulness, struggles, and victories.

## Slide 40 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Parent's Scrapbook:**
  - A loving parent keeps a scrapbook of their child’s life—every award, photo,
    and milestone.

---

## Slide 41 – Q14: The Recording Angels

- **Question:** By whom is this record made?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 5:6 – “Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to
  sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should
  God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?”

---

## Slide 42 – Q14: Key Points

- **Guardian Angels:**
  - Every person has an attending angel (Matthew 18:10 – “Take heed that ye
    despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven
    their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.”).
- **Accuracy:**
  - We cannot plead "it was an error" if the angel recorded it as willful sin.
- **Solemnity:**
  - Knowing a holy watcher records our words should lead us to "keep the door of
    our lips" (Psalm 141:3).

---

## Slide 43 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Court Reporter:**
  - In a deposition, a court reporter types every word.
  - Later, you cannot deny what you said because the record stands.
