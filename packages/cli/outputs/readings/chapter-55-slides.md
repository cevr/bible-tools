## Slide 1 – Q1: The First Seal (The White Horse)

- **Question:** What was shown upon the opening of the first seal?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:1, 2 – “And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the
  seals,... a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was
  given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Apostolic Church

- **Purity of Doctrine:**
  - The white horse represents the church in the first century (Apostolic Age).
    White symbolizes purity and righteousness.
  - Isaiah 1:18 – “Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though
    your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red
    like crimson, they shall be as wool.”
  - Revelation 19:8 – “And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
    linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.”
- **The Gospel Commission:**
  - This era carried the unadulterated gospel of the kingdom.
  - Matthew 24:14 – “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
    world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Christ Our Righteousness:**
  - The early church did not rely on ceremonial laws or philosophy, but on
    Christ alone.
  - Jeremiah 23:6 – “In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell
    safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR
    RIGHTEOUSNESS.”
  - Romans 3:24, 25 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the
    redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a
    propitiation through faith in his blood...”
- **Conquering Power:**
  - The bow signifies spiritual warfare empowered by the Holy Spirit.
  - Colossians 1:23 – “If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be
    not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which
    was preached to every creature which is under heaven...”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Clear Mountain Spring:**
  - Imagine a clear spring bursting from a rock high on a mountain.
  - The water is crystal clear, life-giving, and powerful.
  - This represents the first-century church: pure water of life flowing from
    the Rock of Ages.
  - Pollutants (errors) enter the stream later in history, but the source is
    pure.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Second Seal (The Red Horse)

- **Question:** What went out upon the opening of the second seal?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:3, 4 – “And when he had opened the second seal,...
  there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat
  thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another:
  and there was given unto him a great sword.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Corruption and Compromise

- **Loss of Purity (A.D. 100–313):**
  - The color changes from white to red. Red is the color of sin and bloodshed.
  - The mystery of iniquity began to work as the church compromised to gain
    popularity.
  - 2 Thessalonians 2:7 – “For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only
    he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.”
- **Internal Strife:**
  - Peace was taken from the earth. When the church loses the peace of Christ,
    it often turns to political power and internal fighting.
- **The Great Sword:**
  - Represents severe persecution by Rome, but also the church beginning to
    desire the sword of the state to enforce its decrees.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Application (Sanctification)

- **A Warning on Righteousness:**
  - Sanctification is the process of being made holy by the Spirit, not by
    worldly power.
  - 1 Peter 1:2 – “Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
    through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the
    blood of Jesus Christ...”
  - We cannot conquer sin while compromising with the world.
  - James 4:4 – “...know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with
    God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Red Dye:**
  - If you mix red dye into a glass of pure water, the water is no longer clear.
  - It may still look like liquid, but its nature has changed.
  - The "Red Horse" era represents the church allowing the "dye" of worldly
    ambition and pagan philosophy to tint the pure water of the gospel.

## Slide 9 – Q3: The Third Seal (The Black Horse)

- **Question:** What was the color of the symbol under the third seal?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:5 – “And when he had opened the third seal, I heard
  the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo, a black horse; and he
  that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Spiritual Darkness (A.D. 313–538)

- **Truth Obscured:**
  - Black represents the absence of light. The Bible was moved to the
    background; human tradition took the lead.
  - This fulfills the predicted "falling away."
  - 2 Thessalonians 2:3 – “Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day
    shall not come, except there come a falling away first...”
- **Absorption of Paganism:**
  - The church adopted pagan festivals and image worship to make Christianity
    palatable to the heathen.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Legalism vs. Grace

- **The Pair of Balances:**
  - Represents commercialism in religion. Salvation became a transaction
    (penance, works) rather than a gift.
  - This is the antithesis of Righteousness by Faith.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- **Filthy Rags:**
  - We cannot weigh our merits against our sins.
  - Isaiah 64:6 – “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
    righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our
    iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.”

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Marketplace:**
  - Imagine a merchant using scales to weigh money against goods.
  - During this era, the church turned the House of God into a marketplace.
  - They tried to "sell" the grace of God in exchange for penance and money,
    rather than pointing sinners to the free gift at the Cross.

## Slide 13 – Q4: The Fourth Seal (The Pale Horse)

- **Question:** What change was seen in the symbol of the fourth seal?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:7, 8 – “And when he had opened the fourth seal,...
  behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed
  with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to
  kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the
  earth.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: The Dark Ages (A.D. 538–Reformation)

- **Spiritual Death:**
  - "Pale" is the color of a corpse. The spiritual life of the church was nearly
    extinguished.
  - The Bible was chained; people starved for the "bread of life."
  - John 6:35 – “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
    cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never
    thirst.”
- **Persecution:**
  - "Hell" (Hades) means the grave. The apostate church persecuted those who
    refused to bow to dogma.
  - John 16:2 – “They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
    that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.”

## Slide 15 – Q4: Key Points (Mediation)

- **The "Daily" Taken Away:**
  - Men were taught to look to earthly priests for forgiveness rather than to
    Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - 1 Timothy 2:5 – “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
    the man Christ Jesus.”
- **Life in the Son:**
  - A system of works and persecution brings spiritual death. Life comes only
    from Christ.
  - 1 John 5:12 – “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
    of God hath not life.”

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Plant in the Cellar:**
  - A plant shut in a dark cellar turns pale and yellowish.
  - It lacks chlorophyll and life-vigor because it has no sunlight.
  - During the Dark Ages, the "Sun of Righteousness" was shut out by human
    tradition, and the church became a pale, dying plant.

## Slide 17 – Q5: The Fifth Seal (Souls Under the Altar)

- **Question:** On the opening of the fifth seal, what was seen under the altar?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:9 – “And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw
  under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for
  the testimony which they held.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: The Reformation Era

- **Under the Altar:**
  - Sanctuary imagery: The blood of sacrifices was poured at the base of the
    altar.
  - Leviticus 4:7 – “...and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the
    bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the
    tabernacle of the congregation.”
  - This symbolizes lives poured out as an offering for the truth.
- **Symbolic Language:**
  - This is not literal consciousness in death.
  - Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead
    know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of
    them is forgotten.”
  - Like Abel’s blood, the martyrs’ blood cries out metaphorically (Genesis
    4:10).

## Slide 19 – Q5: Illustration

- **Evidence in Court:**
  - In a court of law, we say the evidence "speaks" or "facts cry out for
    justice."
  - The blood of the martyrs is the evidence of the cruelty of the apostate
    power.
  - In the Fifth Seal, this evidence is brought before God as the Bible is
    reopened during the Reformation.

## Slide 20 – Q6: The Cry for Justice

- **Question:** What were these martyrs represented as doing?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:10 – “And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How
  long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them
  that dwell on the earth?”

## Slide 21 – Q6: Key Points

- **Vindication:**
  - The martyrs were killed as "heretics." They ask God to vindicate their names
    and prove they were true believers.
  - This marks the prelude to the Investigative Judgment.
- **The "Earth Dwellers":**
  - Refers to those who have set their affections on this world and oppose God's
    truth.
  - The cry is for God to end the reign of sin and establish His kingdom.

## Slide 22 – Q7: The Response (White Robes)

- **Question:** What was done for these martyrs because they thus cried?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:11 – “And white robes were given unto everyone of
  them; and it was said unto them, That they Should rest yet for a little
  season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be
  killed as they were, should be fulfilled.”

## Slide 23 – Q7: Justification and Rest

- **White Robes (Justification):**
  - The white robe represents the imputed righteousness of Christ. God declares
    them righteous despite the world's condemnation.
  - Zechariah 3:4 – “...Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee,
    and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.”
- **Resting for a Season:**
  - They continue to "rest" (sleep in the grave) until the resurrection.
  - Hebrews 11:39, 40 – “And these all, having obtained a good report through
    faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for
    us, that they without us should not be made perfect.”

## Slide 24 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Dishonored Soldier:**
  - A soldier is dishonorably discharged for disobeying an unjust order.
  - Years later, the King reviews the case, declares him a hero, and awards a
    medal of honor.
  - The soldier died in disgrace, but the King’s record (the white robe) clears
    his name for all history.

## Slide 25 – Q8: The Sixth Seal (The Earthquake)

- **Question:** What was first seen on the opening of the sixth seal?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:12 – “And I beheld when He had opened the sixth
  seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake.”

## Slide 26 – Q8: The Lisbon Earthquake (1755)

- **Historical Fulfillment:**
  - November 1, 1755: The Great Lisbon Earthquake felt over 4 million square
    miles (Europe, Africa, America).
- **Prophetic Significance:**
  - Jesus predicted earthquakes as the "beginning of sorrows."
  - Matthew 24:7, 8 – “For nation shall rise against nation... and there shall
    be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these
    are the beginning of sorrows.”
- **God's Alarm Clock:**
  - Designed to wake the world to the reality of the end times.
  - Amos 4:12 – “...prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Signs in the Heavens

- **Question:** What was to follow the great earthquake?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:12 – “And the sun became black as sackcloth of
  hair, and the moon became as blood.”

## Slide 28 – Q9: The Dark Day (1780)

- **Historical Fulfillment:**
  - May 19, 1780: An inexplicable darkness covered New England. The moon
    appeared as blood the following night.
  - Occurred exactly after the persecution of the 1260 years (ended 1798) had
    been "shortened."
- **Biblical Confirmation:**
  - Joel 2:31 – “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
    before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.”
  - Matthew 24:29 – “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
    sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light...”

## Slide 29 – Q9: Illustration

- **Dimming the Lights:**
  - When a theater play is about to end, the house lights often flicker or dim
    to warn the audience that the finale is approaching.
  - The Dark Day was nature's "dimming of the lights," warning the world that
    the drama of human history is nearing its close.

## Slide 30 – Q10: Falling Stars

- **Question:** What was the next event under this seal?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:13 – “And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth,
  even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
  wind.”

## Slide 31 – Q10: The Meteoric Shower (1833)

- **Historical Fulfillment:**
  - November 13, 1833: The most extensive meteoric shower ever recorded, seen
    across North America.
  - Occurred during the Great Advent Awakening, giving impetus to the preaching
    of the judgment hour.
  - Revelation 14:7 – “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to
    him; for the hour of his judgment is come...”
- **The Fig Tree Analogy:**
  - Matthew 24:32, 33 – “Now learn a parable of the fig tree... So likewise ye,
    when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the
    doors.”

## Slide 32 – Q11: The Second Coming

- **Question:** What was to follow the sign of falling stars?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 6:14 – “And the heaven departed as a scroll when it
  is rolled together: and every mountain and island were moved out of their
  places.”

## Slide 33 – Q11: The Great Displacement

- **The Receding Heavens:**
  - The atmosphere parts to reveal the King of Kings.
  - Hebrews 12:26 – “Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
    saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.”
- **The Reaction of the Lost:**
  - They cry to the rocks, "Fall on us." They ask the great question: "Who shall
    be able to stand?"

## Slide 34 – Q11: Application (Who Shall Stand?)

- **Righteousness by Faith Answer:**
  - Only those clothed in white raiment (Revelation 3:5).
  - Those who have the law of God written in the heart.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my
    laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”
- **Victory Over Sin:**
  - We must have the "faith of Jesus" to stand before a Holy God.
  - Hebrews 12:29 – “For our God is a consuming fire.”

## Slide 35 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Scroll:**
  - A scroll rolls up quickly and snaps shut.
  - The sky, acting as a curtain hiding the spiritual realm, will suddenly roll
    back.
  - For those who know the Shepherd, seeing Him is joy.
  - For those clinging to sin, His purity is terrifying.

## Slide 36 – Q12: The Seventh Seal

- **Question:** After the sealing work brought to view in Rev. 7, which takes
  place under the sixth seal, how is the seventh seal introduced?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 8:1 – “And when He had opened the seventh seal, there
  was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.”

## Slide 37 – Q12: Silence in Heaven

- **The Departure of the Hosts:**
  - Heaven is usually filled with praise (Revelation 4:8), but now it is silent
    because the King and angels have come to earth.
  - Matthew 25:31 – “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the
    holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory.”
- **Prophetic Time:**
  - In prophecy, a day equals a year (Ezekiel 4:6).
  - "Half an hour" is approximately one week (7 days)—the time for Christ to
    descend and gather His people.

## Slide 38 – Q12: Key Points & Application

- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The High Priest has left the Most Holy Place. Atonement is completed.
  - The time for salvation is past; the focus is on the rescue of the Bride.
- **Practical Application:**
  - If heaven is silent watching this event, how should we live?
  - 2 Peter 3:11 – “Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what
    manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness.”

## Slide 39 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Silent City:**
  - Imagine a bustling city that suddenly goes quiet because everyone has rushed
    to the gates to welcome a returning hero.
  - The silence of the city speaks louder than the noise.
  - Heaven's silence shouts the importance of the Second Coming.
  - Romans 8:22 – “For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth
    in pain together until now.”
