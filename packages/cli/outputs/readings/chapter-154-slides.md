## Slide 1 – Q1: The Ninth Commandment

- **Question:** What does the ninth commandment forbid?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:16 – “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
  neighbor.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Nature of False Witness

- **God’s Character:** The law is a transcript of God’s character. Because He is
  a God of truth, His law forbids all deception.
  - Deuteronomy 32:4 – “He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways
    are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.”
- **Beyond Perjury:** The commandment extends beyond courtrooms to any speech
  conveying a false impression.
- **The Roots of Lying:**
  - It prohibits lying, exaggeration, and spreading unverified reports (Exodus
    23:1 – “Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the
    wicked to be an unrighteous witness.”).
  - It originates with Satan, the father of lies (John 8:44 – “...When he
    speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of
    it.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Reputation and Spirit of the Law

- **Sanctity of Reputation:** Robbing a person of their good name is a form of
  theft.
  - Proverbs 22:1 – “A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and
    loving favour rather than silver and gold.”
- **Love Fulfills the Law:** True obedience is rooted in love, which “rejoiceth
  in the truth” (1 Corinthians 13:6).
- **Spirit of the Law:** While the letter forbids lying, the spirit requires
  speaking truth in love.
  - Ephesians 4:15 – “But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in
    all things, which is the head, even Christ.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Feathers in the Wind:**
  - Imagine a man cutting open a feather pillow on a bell tower on a windy day.
  - The wind carries the feathers over the entire town.
  - Can he ever gather every feather back? It is impossible.
- **The Lesson:**
  - So it is with gossip and false witness.
  - Once spoken, words travel on the winds of rumor.
  - No amount of apology can fully undo the damage done to a neighbor’s
    reputation.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Perfect Man

- **Question:** How is such a man regarded?
- **Key Text:** James 3:2 – “If any man offend not in word, the same is a
  perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Perfection and Sanctification

- **The Test of Perfection:**
  - Christian perfection here means spiritual maturity where the Spirit has full
    control.
  - Matthew 5:48 – “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
    heaven is perfect.”
- **Bridling the Body:**
  - Just as a bit controls a horse (James 3:3), a sanctified tongue indicates a
    sanctified person.
- **Sanctification Defined:**
  - It is the ongoing work of grace, cleansing the believer and restoring
    Christ’s image.
  - 1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I
    pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
    coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Double Use of the Tongue

- **Question:** To what double use is the tongue put?
- **Key Text:** James 3:10 – “Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and
  cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Hypocrisy and Strange Fire

- **The Fountain and the Tree:**
  - A fountain cannot yield both salt water and fresh. Bitter speech proves the
    heart is not fully cleansed.
  - James 3:11 – “Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
    bitter?”
- **The Image of God:**
  - We are made in God’s similitude (James 3:9). To tear down a human is to
    attack God’s image.
- **Sanctuary Application – Strange Fire:**
  - Ancient priests were forbidden to offer “strange fire” (Leviticus 10:1).
  - Our bodies are temples (1 Corinthians 6:19). Using the tongue for cursing
    brings strange fire into God’s temple.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Medicine Dropper:**
  - Consider a medicine dropper used to dispense deadly poison.
  - If you try to use it to dispense healing medicine to a child without washing
    it, the medicine becomes tainted.
- **The Lesson:**
  - We cannot expect our prayers and praises (the medicine) to be acceptable if
    the tongue (the dropper) is coated with the poison of gossip.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Can Man Tame the Tongue?

- **Question:** Can man, un-renewed by grace, control his tongue?
- **Key Text:** James 3:7, 8 – “For every kind of beasts... is tamed... but the
  tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil; full of deadly poison.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Limit of Human Effort:**
  - Man can tame lions, but he cannot tame his own nature.
  - Legalism (keeping the law by own strength) fails here; the poison remains
    within.
- **The Pivotal Point of Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The text says “no man” can tame it. We must come to the end of our
    resources.
  - We require the indwelling life of Christ.
- **The Power of Grace:**
  - Grace is not just forgiveness, but enabling power.
  - 2 Corinthians 12:9 – “And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee:
    for my strength is made perfect in weakness...”

## Slide 12 – Q5: One’s Duty

- **Question:** What is one's duty, under the circumstances?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:13 – “Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
  unrighteousness unto sin; but yield yourselves unto God.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Yielding and Consecration

- **The Act of Yielding:**
  - “Yield” implies surrender. We stop lending our tongue to the enemy as a
    weapon.
- **Daily Consecration:**
  - Every morning, dedicate speech to God: “Lord, take my tongue; let it speak
    only Thy words.”
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - This is presenting our bodies as a “living sacrifice.”
  - Romans 12:1 – “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
    that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
    which is your reasonable service.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Deliverer

- **Question:** Through whom may we find deliverance from this law of sin in our
  members?
- **Key Text:** Romans 7:24-25 – “O wretched man that I am I who shall deliver
  me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Victory in Christ

- **The Conflict (Romans 7):**
  - The “law of sin” pulls us toward evil. The struggle proves our need of a
    Saviour.
- **Victory is a Person:**
  - We do not achieve victory to get to Christ; we receive Christ, and He wins
    the victory in us.
  - Colossians 1:27 – “To whom God would make known what is the riches of the
    glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope
    of glory.”
- **No Condemnation:**
  - Romans 8:1 – “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in
    Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Captain and the Sails:**
  - A ship captain cannot control the wind or stop the waves.
  - If he pushes the ship with his hands, he fails.
  - But if he hoists the sails to catch the wind, the ship moves with power.
- **The Lesson:**
  - We cannot suppress the waves of our nature.
  - We must hoist the sails of our will to the Holy Spirit.
  - “Through Jesus Christ,” power is provided to move in the right direction.

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Index of the Heart

- **Question:** Of what are one's words the index?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:34 – “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
  speaketh.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: The Root Problem

- **Internal State:**
  - Words are the index (indicator) of the heart.
  - Gossip or impurity exists on the tongue because it is nurtured in the heart.
- **New Covenant Promise:**
  - We need the New Birth. God must write His law in the heart.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my
    laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...”
- **Diagnostic Tool:**
  - Monitor words to diagnose the spiritual condition. Angry words indicate an
    unsurrendered will.

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Judgment

- **Question:** What will our words have to do with our standing in the
  judgment?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:37 – “For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and
  by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Investigative Judgment

- **Words as Evidence:**
  - In the judgment, words testify whether faith was genuine.
  - James 2:26 – “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
    works is dead also.”
- **The Books of Record:**
  - The judgment involves opening books containing records of deeds and words.
  - Daniel 7:10 – “...the judgment was set, and the books were opened.”
  - Matthew 12:36 – “But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall
    speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”
- **Justification:**
  - A character transformed by Christ allows the record to show the influence of
    His Spirit.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Talebearer

- **Question:** What special sin is covered by the ninth commandment?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 19:16 – “Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer
  among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor:
  I am the Lord.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Talebearing Defined

- **The Peddler of Secrets:**
  - A talebearer goes from person to person carrying private matters that stir
    strife.
  - 1 Timothy 5:13 – “And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from
    house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies,
    speaking things which they ought not.”
- **Standing Against the Blood:**
  - Gossip endangers the life and safety of the neighbor.
  - Spiritually, it murders reputation and character. In God's eyes, killing a
    reputation is akin to shedding blood.

## Slide 23 – Q10: Words as Wounds

- **Question:** What are the words of a talebearer like?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 26:22 – “The words of a talebearer are as wounds [or
  dainty morsels], and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Wounds and Morsels

- **As Wounds:**
  - Gossip inflicts deep emotional injuries.
  - Unlike physical cuts, the wound of betrayed confidence can fester for a
    lifetime.
- **As Dainty Morsels:**
  - The carnal heart has a morbid appetite for scandal; it tastes "good" to the
    natural man.
  - But once swallowed, it poisons the soul of the listener.
  - The listener is as guilty as the speaker, for providing the ear that allows
    the sin to exist.

## Slide 25 – Q11: The Effect of Gossip

- **Question:** What is their effect?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 17:9 – “He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
  but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Separation vs. Covering

- **Destroying Unity:**
  - Relationships built over years can be destroyed in a moment by repeating a
    matter.
  - Gossip acts as a "diabolos" (slanderer/divider).
- **The Gospel Alternative: Covering:**
  - 1 Peter 4:8 – “And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
    for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.”
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - Just as the Mercy Seat covered the Law, Christ’s blood covers our sins.
  - If we have received mercy, we must extend mercy by not unnecessarily
    exposing the faults of others.

## Slide 27 – Q12: The Remedy

- **Question:** What would follow if each attended to his own affairs only?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 26:20 – “Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so
  where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Starving the Fire

- **Remove the Fuel:**
  - Gossip requires a willing listener. If we refuse to listen, the fire dies.
  - We should ask: "Is this true? Is it necessary?"
- **Minding One's Own Business:**
  - Busybodies are usually neglecting their own soul's work.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:11 – “And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own
    business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you.”
  - If we were examining our hearts in the light of the Sanctuary, we would have
    no time to critique others.

## Slide 29 – Q13: Fitly Spoken Words

- **Question:** What is the word like which is fitly spoken?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 25:11 – “A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in
  pictures of silver.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Beauty and Grace

- **Value of Good Words:**
  - Encouragement, truth, and comfort are precious, like gold in silver
    settings.
- **Ministering Grace:**
  - Timing and tone matter. The tongue should be used to build up.
  - Ephesians 4:29 – “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,
    but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace
    unto the hearers.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Artist:**
  - A skilled artist knows exactly where to place a highlight on a painting to
    make it shine.
  - A clumsy hand smears the canvas with mud.
- **The Lesson:**
  - A Christian walking in the Spirit knows how to place a word of hope into a
    dark situation, making the picture beautiful.
  - The gossip smears the canvas.

## Slide 32 – Q14: God Knows All

- **Question:** To whom are our words all known?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 139:4 – “For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O
  Lord, thou knowest it altogether.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Omniscience and Appeal

- **Audience of One:**
  - God hears the whisper as clearly as the shout. Nothing is hidden.
  - Hebrews 4:13 – “Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
    sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we
    have to do.”
- **Final Prayer:**
  - Our prayer should be for a heart and mouth acceptable to our Redeemer.
  - Psalm 19:14 – “Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
    acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.”
