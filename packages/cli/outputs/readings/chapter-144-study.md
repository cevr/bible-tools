# Reading 144: The Ordinance of Humility

## Introduction

On the night of His betrayal, Jesus instituted a sacred ordinance that strikes at the very root of human pride and self-exaltation. The foot-washing service, often called the ordinance of humility, was not merely a cultural courtesy but a divinely appointed ceremony carrying profound spiritual lessons for every believer until Christ returns. In this act, the King of Glory knelt as a servant, forever defining the character of His kingdom.

## Core Truths

### Christ's Longing for Fellowship

Jesus approached His final Passover with intense anticipation: _"With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer"_ (Luke 22:15). The original Greek conveys a superlative longing—literally, "with desiring I have desired." Our Saviour earnestly sought this final time of intimate fellowship with His disciples before Calvary.

[DYK🔎] This was the fourth and final Passover of Christ's public ministry. Jewish tradition held that four cups of wine were drunk during the Passover meal, each representing a different aspect of God's deliverance. Jesus transformed this ancient feast, pointing forward to its ultimate fulfillment in the kingdom of God.

### The Spirit of the World vs. The Spirit of Christ

While Jesus contemplated the cross, the disciples were consumed with self-advancement:

> _"The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve."_ (Luke 22:25, 26)

The contrast could not be more stark:

- **Worldly greatness**: Exercising authority, seeking titles, demanding service
- **Kingdom greatness**: Serving others, taking the lowest place, seeking no recognition

Christ declared His own position plainly: _"I am among you as he that serveth"_ (Luke 22:27). The Creator of the universe defined His mission not in terms of power received but service rendered.

### The Master Becomes the Servant

With full knowledge of His divine identity—that He came from God and was going to God—Jesus performed the most menial task:

> _"He riseth from supper, and laid aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded Himself. After that He poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded."_ (John 13:4, 5)

[ILL] Consider a head of state arriving at a formal banquet. Instead of taking the seat of honor, he removes his official robes, wraps an apron around his waist, and begins cleaning the shoes of every guest—including those who will betray him and deny him before morning. This is precisely what Jesus did. The hands that flung stars into space now washed the dusty feet of fishermen.

## Deeper Truths

### Peter's Objection and Its Lesson

Peter's response reveals the natural heart's resistance to grace:

**Stage 1—Pride refuses:** _"Lord, dost thou wash my feet?"_ (John 13:6). Peter was horrified that his Master should stoop so low.

**Stage 2—Self-will resists:** _"Thou shalt never wash my feet"_ (John 13:8). Peter's emphatic refusal seemed humble, but it was actually pride in disguise—he would dictate terms to Christ.

**Stage 3—Christ's solemn warning:** _"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me"_ (John 13:8). Salvation depends on submission to Christ's methods, not our preferences.

**Stage 4—Impulsive overcorrection:** _"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head"_ (John 13:9). Peter swung to the opposite extreme, still trying to manage his own cleansing.

**Stage 5—Christ's gentle correction:** _"He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit"_ (John 13:10).

[Q] **"What does Jesus mean by saying one who is washed needs only to have his feet washed?"**

Jesus distinguishes between two types of cleansing:

- **The bath** (Greek: _louō_)—complete washing, representing justification and conversion, when the whole person is cleansed by faith in Christ
- **The foot washing** (Greek: _niptō_)—partial washing, representing the daily cleansing from defilement contracted while walking through a sinful world

A person who has been converted (bathed) needs not repeat conversion, but does need daily cleansing from the dust of worldly contact—the unkind word, the selfish thought, the momentary lapse. The ordinance of humility addresses this ongoing need for heart-searching and mutual reconciliation.

### A Perpetual Ordinance

Christ's instruction was explicit and binding:

> _"If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you."_ (John 13:14, 15)

The word "ought" (Greek: _opheilō_) indicates moral obligation—a debt we owe. This was not a suggestion but a command from our Lord and Master.

[DYK🔎] The early church clearly practiced foot washing as a religious ordinance. Writing around A.D. 65, Paul listed it among the qualifications for widows to be supported by the church: _"If she have washed the saints' feet"_ (1 Timothy 5:10). This phrase appears alongside "bringing up children" and "relieving the afflicted"—all practical acts of Christian service, confirming that foot washing continued as regular practice among believers.

### The Blessing Promised

Christ attached a specific promise to this ordinance: _"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them"_ (John 13:17).

**Happiness** (Greek: _makarios_—the same word used in the Beatitudes) is conditional upon:

1. **Knowing** these things—understanding the spiritual significance
2. **Doing** them—actually practicing the ordinance

Knowledge without obedience brings no blessing. The happiness comes in the doing.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Issue of Authority and Service

The great controversy between Christ and Satan is fundamentally about the character of God's government. Satan claimed God was arbitrary and self-serving. Jesus came to reveal that divine authority is exercised through humble service, not domination.

When Christ knelt to wash feet, He demonstrated the principle that governs heaven itself: _"Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant"_ (Matthew 20:26, 27).

This principle will characterize God's redeemed people throughout eternity. The ordinance of humility trains us now for the spirit we will carry forever.

### Sanctuary Connections

The foot-washing ordinance beautifully illustrates the believer's ongoing relationship with Christ's mediatorial ministry:

- **Outer court (justification)**: The initial "bath"—complete cleansing through acceptance of Christ's sacrifice
- **Holy place (sanctification)**: The ongoing "foot washing"—daily cleansing as we walk in a defiling world, maintained through Christ's continual intercession
- **Preparation for the Most Holy Place**: The self-examination and reconciliation that prepares God's people for the final work of judgment and sealing

Just as the priests washed at the laver before ministering in the sanctuary, believers today are to come to the Lord's Supper with hearts examined and cleansed—feet washed, as it were—ready to commune with their Lord.

[ILL] When a surgeon prepares for an operation, he scrubs his hands thoroughly before entering the operating room. But if he touches an unsterile surface, he does not need to shower completely again—only to re-wash his hands. Similarly, the converted Christian who has been "bathed" in Christ's righteousness needs daily re-cleansing from contact with sin's contamination. The ordinance of humility provides this spiritual preparation.

### Service to "the Least"

Christ links this ordinance to a broader principle of kingdom service:

> _"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me."_ (Matthew 25:40)

Every act of humble service rendered to the lowliest believer is received by Christ as service to Himself. The foot-washing ceremony teaches us to see Christ in every brother and sister, regardless of their social standing, education, or apparent importance.

## Practical Application

### What This Ordinance Requires of Us

**Before participating:**

- Examine your heart for cherished grudges or unconfessed wrongs
- Seek reconciliation with any you have offended or who have offended you
- Approach with willingness both to serve and to be served

**During the ordinance:**

- Allow the physical act to prompt spiritual reflection
- Pray for the one whose feet you wash
- Receive the service of another with humility, not proud reluctance like Peter

**After participating:**

- Carry the spirit of humble service into daily life
- Look for opportunities to serve "the least" of Christ's brethren
- Remember that happiness is promised to those who _do_ these things, not merely understand them

### Breaking Down Pride

The ordinance of humility strikes at the root of:

- **Pride of position**: We kneel before those we might consider "beneath" us
- **Pride of independence**: We allow others to serve us, acknowledging our need
- **Pride of self-righteousness**: We confess that we need continual cleansing
- **Pride of appearance**: We handle the dusty, common feet of our fellow believers

[Q] **"Isn't foot washing merely a cultural practice that doesn't apply today?"**

While foot washing served a practical purpose in sandal-wearing cultures, Christ elevated it to a spiritual ordinance with permanent significance. The practical need may have diminished in modern settings, but the spiritual lessons remain vital:

- We still need humility
- We still need reconciliation with one another
- We still need preparation for communion with Christ
- We still need reminders that greatness in God's kingdom is measured by service

If anything, in our age of self-promotion and status-seeking, we need this ordinance more than ever.

## Appeal

_"If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."_ (John 13:17)

Christ has given us both the example and the command. He who was equal with God knelt as a servant. He who could command legions of angels washed the feet of His betrayer. He who sustains the universe by the word of His power girded Himself with a towel.

Will you follow His example? Will you lay aside your garments of pride and self-importance? Will you allow Christ to wash away not only the guilt of sin but also the daily defilement of walking in a sinful world?

The promise is sure: happiness awaits those who know these things and do them. Not happiness as the world gives—dependent on circumstances—but the deep, settled blessedness of those who walk in the footsteps of Jesus.

May we each come to the ordinance of humility with hearts prepared to serve and to be served, knowing that in this sacred act, we have communion with our Lord and preparation for eternal fellowship in His kingdom.
