# Reading 74: The End of the Law

## Introduction

Romans 10:4 declares that "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth." This verse has been tragically misunderstood by many to mean that Christ abolished the law. Yet when we allow Scripture to interpret Scripture, we discover a profound truth: Christ is not the termination of God's law, but its fulfillment, its goal, and its glorious realization in the life of every believer. Through faith in Christ, what the law could never accomplish in weak, sinful humanity becomes possible—true righteousness of heart and life.

## Core Truths

### The Meaning of "End" (Telos)

The Greek word translated "end" in Romans 10:4 is _telos_, which carries rich meaning beyond mere termination.

> "Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy." (James 5:11)

Here "end" clearly means _purpose, intention, or goal_—not cessation. We do not say that the Lord ceased to exist! Rather, we see His ultimate design and objective revealed through Job's experience.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word _telos_ is used throughout the New Testament to mean "goal" or "purpose." It appears in 1 Timothy 1:5: "Now the end [*telos*] of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart." If _telos_ meant "abolition," this verse would absurdly suggest that love abolishes the commandment—the opposite of Paul's teaching!

Similarly, Romans 10:4 teaches that Christ is the _goal_ toward which the law has always pointed—the One in whom the law's righteous requirements find their complete fulfillment.

### The Original Design of God's Law

What was the law's purpose from the beginning?

> "And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death." (Romans 7:10)

The law was "ordained to life"—designed to lead humanity into abundant, eternal life. God never intended His law as a burden, but as a pathway to blessing. The Ten Commandments describe the character of love itself—the very nature of God expressed in principles of relationship with Him and our fellow beings.

[Q] **"If the law was ordained to life, why did Paul find it 'unto death'?"**

This is the tragedy of sin. The law reveals God's perfect standard, but fallen humanity cannot keep it in their own strength. Like a mirror that shows our dirty face but cannot wash it, the law exposes sin but cannot remove it. Thus what was designed for life becomes, for the unrepentant sinner, a ministration of death—not because the law is evil, but because we are (Romans 7:12–14).

### The True End of the Commandment

> "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned." (1 Timothy 1:5)

The law's ultimate goal is _love_—genuine, self-sacrificing love flowing from a transformed heart. This is not cold compliance but warm devotion.

> "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law." (Romans 13:10)

> "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous." (1 John 5:3)

[ILL] Consider a young man deeply in love with his bride. He does not view his marriage vows as burdensome restrictions. "I must not look at other women. I must not abandon her. I must provide for her needs." No! His heart so overflows with love that faithfulness becomes his delight. He keeps the "law" of marriage not from cold duty, but from a heart captivated by love. So it is when Christ captures our hearts—obedience becomes joy, not bondage.

## Deeper Truths

### What the Law Could Not Do

> "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Romans 8:3–4)

The law possessed no inherent weakness. Its limitation was "through the flesh"—through our fallen, sinful nature. The law could command righteousness but could not create it. It could demand love but could not produce it. It could threaten death for disobedience but could not empower obedience.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "condemned sin in the flesh" reveals Christ's complete victory over sin in human nature. Jesus took upon Himself our fallen, weakened humanity—"the likeness of sinful flesh"—and in that very flesh where sin had reigned for millennia, He lived a life of perfect obedience, condemning sin's claim that human beings cannot keep God's law.

### Righteousness Fulfilled in Us

Notice carefully: the purpose of Christ's coming was "that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us" (Romans 8:4). Not merely imputed to our account, though that is blessedly true in justification—but _fulfilled in us_, worked into the very fabric of our character through sanctification.

The marginal reading of the Revised Version makes this even clearer: "That the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us."

This is the heart of righteousness by faith: not that Christ kept the law so we don't have to, but that Christ's indwelling life enables us to keep the law from the heart!

[Q] **"Doesn't this teaching lead to legalism—trying to earn salvation by works?"**

Never! The text is clear: this righteousness is "fulfilled _in us_"—not _by us_ through human effort. It comes to those "who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Romans 8:4). This is Christ living His obedient life through surrendered believers (Galatians 2:20). We do not work our way up to Christ; He comes down to live within us. The keeping of the law is the _fruit_ of salvation, not its _root_.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the law of God resided in the ark of the covenant within the Most Holy Place—the very heart of the sanctuary system. The mercy seat rested upon the law, and the Shekinah glory of God's presence dwelt between the cherubim above it. This arrangement reveals profound truth:

- God's mercy does not abolish His law but rests upon it
- The blood of atonement was sprinkled toward the mercy seat, satisfying the law's claims while extending grace to the repentant sinner
- God's presence dwells where His law is honored

Christ, our High Priest, now ministers in the heavenly sanctuary where the original law resides. His work is not to diminish the law's claims but to write it upon the hearts of His people (Hebrews 8:10; 10:16).

### The Great Controversy Issue

At the heart of the cosmic conflict stands this question: Is God's law arbitrary and oppressive, or is it the perfect expression of His loving character? Satan claims God's requirements are unreasonable—that no one can keep His law. Christ's life and His work in believers answers this charge, demonstrating that through divine grace, human beings can indeed reflect God's character of love.

[ILL] Imagine a pianist who claims a certain complex piece cannot be played. Then a master musician sits at the instrument and performs it flawlessly. The claim is answered—not by changing the music, but by demonstrating what skilled hands can accomplish. Christ has played the symphony of perfect obedience on the instrument of human nature. Now, through His Spirit dwelling within, He teaches our unskilled fingers to play the same beautiful melody.

## Practical Application

This truth transforms how we approach the Christian life:

**Understanding**: Christ did not come to lower God's standard but to lift us up to meet it. He is both our perfect Example and our empowering Presence.

**Response**: We must cease all self-effort to manufacture righteousness and instead surrender daily to Christ's indwelling life. "Lord, live Your life through me today."

**Growth**: Victory over sin is progressive but real. Every temptation resisted by faith in Christ, every habitual sin overcome by His power, demonstrates that "the righteousness of the law" is being "fulfilled in us."

Consider specific areas of your life where you struggle to obey God's will:

- Do you battle with truthfulness? Christ is the Truth—let Him speak through you.
- Do you wrestle with Sabbath observance? Christ is Lord of the Sabbath—let Him sanctify your time.
- Do you struggle with covetousness? Christ is your all-sufficient portion—let His contentment fill your heart.

In each case, the answer is not more human determination but deeper surrender to Christ's transforming presence.

## Appeal

> "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me." (Philippians 4:13)

Dear friend, Christ is the end—the glorious goal—of the law for everyone who believes. In Him, the law's righteous requirements can be fulfilled in your experience today. Not through your striving, but through His abiding. Not by your power, but by His Spirit.

Will you cease trying to be good enough for God and instead receive Christ as your righteousness? He offers not only pardon for past failures but power for present victory. He stands ready to write His law of love upon your heart, transforming cold duty into warm devotion.

Come to Him today—the One who is both the Author and Finisher of your faith, the Beginning and the End of your salvation, the fulfillment of the law in your life.
