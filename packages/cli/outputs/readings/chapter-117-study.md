# Bible Study: Spiritualism—The Ancient Deception Unmasked

## Introduction

Spiritualism—the belief that the living can communicate with the spirits of the
dead—is not a modern phenomenon but an ancient deception stretching back to the
earliest ages of human history. God has repeatedly warned His people against this
practice, calling it an abomination. Understanding the true state of the dead is
essential for discerning this masterpiece of satanic delusion, which Scripture
tells us will play a prominent role in the final crisis before Christ's return.

## Core Truths

### God's Consistent Prohibition

From the earliest times, God strictly forbade His people from seeking contact
with the dead or with spirits:

> _"Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to
> be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God."_ (Leviticus 19:31)

**Familiar spirit**: A spirit that a medium claims to contact regularly—one that
is "familiar" or known to them. Scripture reveals these are not the spirits of
the dead but deceiving entities.

The penalty under ancient Israel's law was severe:

> _"A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall
> surely be put to death."_ (Leviticus 20:27)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "wizard" (_yidde'oni_) comes from a root meaning "to
know"—these practitioners claimed special hidden knowledge from the spirit
world. God's severity against them reveals how dangerous He considers this
deception.

### Witchcraft Classed with Works of the Flesh

The apostle Paul places witchcraft among the most serious sins:

> _"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
> seditions, heresies... they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom
> of God."_ (Galatians 5:20, 21)

Notice the company witchcraft keeps—it is listed alongside idolatry. This is no
coincidence: seeking spirits other than God is a form of worship directed away
from the Creator.

### God's Swift Judgment Against Sorcery

> _"And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness
> against the sorcerers."_ (Malachi 3:5)

> _"Therefore hearken not ye to... your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers; ...for
> they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land."_ (Jeremiah
> 27:9, 10)

God calls the messages of sorcerers **lies**. Whatever spirits may communicate
through mediums, their purpose is deception—to lead souls away from God and His
truth.

## Deeper Truths

### The Biblical Test for Every Spirit

Scripture provides a clear method for testing spiritual claims:

> _"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of
> God."_ (1 John 4:1)

> _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,
> it is because there is no light in them."_ (Isaiah 8:20)

**The Law and the Testimony**: God's commandments (including the fourth
commandment Sabbath) and the witness of Scripture and true prophecy. Any spirit
or teaching that contradicts these has "no light"—no truth from God.

[Q] **"But what if a spirit performs genuine miracles? Doesn't that prove it is
from God?"**

Scripture warns us not to be deceived by signs and wonders:

> _"And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying,
> Let us go after other gods... thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that
> prophet, or that dreamer of dreams; for the Lord your God proveth you, to know
> whether ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your
> soul."_ (Deuteronomy 13:2, 3)

God permits these tests to reveal what is truly in our hearts. Do we love Him
supremely, or are we easily led astray by the spectacular?

### The State of the Dead Exposes the Deception

When we apply the test of Scripture—"the law and the testimony"—to spiritualism,
we find its fundamental claim exposed as false. The Bible clearly teaches:

> _"His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low,
> but he perceiveth it not of them."_ (Job 14:21)

> _"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing,
> neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten."_
> (Ecclesiastes 9:5)

> _"Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither
> have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the
> sun."_ (Ecclesiastes 9:6)

**The dead know nothing. They have no memory. They have no part in earthly
affairs.** Therefore, any spirit claiming to be a deceased loved one is lying.

[ILL] Imagine a man who has been in a deep, dreamless sleep. He has no awareness
of the passing hours, no knowledge of what happens around him, no participation
in household events. When morning comes, he awakens as if no time has passed.
Scripture describes death as such a sleep (John 11:11–14; Psalm 13:3). The dead
await the resurrection morning, unconscious of all that transpires "under the
sun." Any "spirit" that claims to be your departed loved one cannot be who it
claims, for the dead are asleep in their graves until Jesus calls them forth.

### The True Identity of These Spirits

If these spirits are not the dead, who are they?

> _"For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto
> the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of
> that great day of God Almighty."_ (Revelation 16:14)

These are **fallen angels**—demons—masquerading as the dead. Their miracles are
real manifestations of supernatural power, but their source is satanic, and
their purpose is deception.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "devils" in Revelation 16:14 is _daimonion_, from
which we get "demon." These are not fictional beings but real spiritual
intelligences in rebellion against God, skilled in deception after thousands of
years of practice.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Satan's Original Lie Continued

Spiritualism is built upon the serpent's first lie in Eden:

> _"Ye shall not surely die."_ (Genesis 3:4)

The doctrine of the immortal soul—that humans possess a conscious spirit that
survives death—provides the foundation for spiritualism. If the dead are
conscious and able to communicate, then spiritualism seems reasonable. But
Scripture teaches that only God has immortality (1 Timothy 6:16), and man is
mortal until resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:53–54).

**Immortality of the soul**: The unbiblical belief that humans have an
inherently immortal spirit that continues conscious existence after death.
Scripture teaches that immortality is a gift given to the righteous at the
resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:51–54).

### The Last Days Intensification

Scripture prophesies that this deception will intensify before Christ's return:

> _"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall
> depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of
> devils."_ (1 Timothy 4:1)

> _"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
> Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the
> ministers of righteousness."_ (2 Corinthians 11:14, 15)

Satan will not appear as a monster but as an angel of light—beautiful, appealing,
even apparently religious. His agents will speak of love, peace, and
righteousness while leading souls away from God's truth.

### The Ultimate Deception: Counterfeiting Christ

> _"Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it
> not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew
> great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall
> deceive the very elect."_ (Matthew 24:23, 24)

Satan's crowning deception will be to impersonate Christ Himself. He will appear
in glory, work miracles, speak words of grace, and claim to be the returned
Saviour. Only those grounded in Scripture—who know that Christ's return will be
visible to all the world simultaneously (Revelation 1:7), that His feet will not
touch the earth at the second coming (1 Thessalonians 4:16–17), and who test
every message by "the law and the testimony"—will be safe.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the Most Holy Place ministry, Christ as our High Priest is preparing a people
to stand in the final crisis. The investigative judgment reveals who has truly
surrendered to God and who has merely professed His name. Those whose sins have
been confessed and forsaken, who have Christ's righteousness both imputed and
imparted, will not be moved by Satan's delusions. They are sealed by the truth
(Revelation 7:1–3).

The deceptions of spiritualism are designed to divert attention from Christ's
work in the heavenly sanctuary and to prepare the world to receive Satan's false
appearing. Those who understand the sanctuary message have a powerful safeguard
against this deception.

## Practical Application

### How to Stand Firm

**1. Ground yourself in Scripture.** Know what the Bible teaches about the state
of the dead. The dead know nothing; they sleep until the resurrection. Any
spirit claiming to be a deceased person is a deceiving spirit.

**2. Test everything by "the law and the testimony."** Does the teaching uphold
all of God's commandments, including the Sabbath? Does it harmonize with the
whole counsel of Scripture? If not, reject it, no matter how impressive the
accompanying signs.

**3. Do not be moved by miracles.** Supernatural power is not proof of divine
origin. Satan can work miracles. Our standard is God's Word, not the
spectacular.

**4. Know how Christ will return.** His coming will be:

- Visible to all: _"Every eye shall see him"_ (Revelation 1:7)
- Audible: With a shout, the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet of God (1 Thessalonians 4:16)
- Glorious: _"As the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west"_ (Matthew 24:27)
- Preceded by the resurrection of the righteous dead (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

Any "Christ" who appears locally, walks among people, or whose coming does not
match this description is an impostor.

**5. Walk daily with God.** Those who live in fellowship with Christ, who study
His Word and commune with Him in prayer, will recognize the voice of the
Stranger. Jesus said, _"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow
me"_ (John 10:27).

[Q] **"What if spiritualism is presented in a Christian context, with talk of
Jesus and heaven?"**

Satan is a master of disguise. He will use Christian language and appeal to
religious sentiment. But his teachings will always, somewhere, contradict
Scripture. He may speak of love while undermining God's law. He may promise
peace while denying Christ's true work in the sanctuary. Test every spirit. If
it contradicts one clear teaching of Scripture, it is not from God.

## Appeal

The hour is late. Satan is marshalling his forces for the final conflict, and
spiritualism—in many forms—is advancing rapidly in our world. But God has not
left His people without protection. He has given us His Word, the ministry of
Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, and the promise of His Spirit to guide us into
all truth.

> _"Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his
> commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto
> him."_ (Deuteronomy 13:4)

Will you determine today to study God's Word as never before? Will you test
every spirit, every teaching, every miracle by the standard of Scripture? Will
you cling to Christ and His truth, no matter what delusions arise around you?

The faithful will not be ashamed. When Christ appears in glory, destroying every
deception with the brightness of His coming (2 Thessalonians 2:8), those who
have loved truth will lift up their voices:

> _"And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for
> him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be
> glad and rejoice in his salvation."_ (Isaiah 25:9)

May that day find us among those who have waited, watched, and overcome by the
word of their testimony and the blood of the Lamb.
