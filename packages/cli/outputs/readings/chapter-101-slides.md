Here is the slide deck for the Bible study on Righteousness and Persecution,
formatted in Markdown.

## Slide 1 – Q1: Tradition vs. God’s Law

- Question: Because Jesus had not followed their unbiblical traditions about the
  Sabbath, what did the Jews do?
- Key Text: John 5:16 – “Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to
  slay Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath day.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Law & Grace)

- **Conflict of Authority:** The conflict was not over the validity of God's
  Law, but over the method of observance and the source of righteousness.
- **Tradition vs. Commandment:**
  - The leaders added hundreds of man-made rules to the Sabbath (Exodus
    20:8–11).
  - Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath, ignored human additions to show the true
    purpose: mercy and restoration (Mark 2:28).
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - False religion relies on outward forms and human authority.
  - True religion relies on the Spirit and the Word of God.
  - False religion inevitably persecutes the true.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Two Ways of Righteousness:**
  - The leaders sought righteousness by works (rigorous rules).
  - Jesus demonstrated righteousness as a living principle of love from the
    Father.
- **The Danger of Legalism:**
  - When the heart is not softened by grace, the law becomes a yoke of bondage.
  - Those who impose rules often become intolerant of those walking in the
    liberty of the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:17 – “Now the Lord is that Spirit:
    and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”).

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Fence and the Garden:**
  - Imagine a man who builds a fence to protect a beautiful garden.
  - Over time, he builds so many fences that the garden can no longer be seen.
  - When the Gardener (Jesus) arrives and opens the gate for people to enter,
    the fence-builder becomes angry because his fences are ignored.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The Jewish leaders loved their "fences" (traditions) more than the Garden
    (God’s presence) or the Gardener (Christ).

## Slide 5 – Q2: True Fasting

- Question: What kind of fast is most acceptable to God?
- Key Text: Isaiah 58:6 – “Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the
  bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go
  free, and that ye break every yoke?”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Justification & Sanctification)

- **God’s Definition of Religion:** Not merely abstaining from food, but
  abstaining from sin and selfishness.
- **Loosing the Bands of Wickedness (Justification):**
  - Before we can help others, we must be set free from the guilt of sin by the
    Gospel.
- **Letting the Oppressed Go Free (Sanctification):**
  - The Gospel breaks the power of reigning sin (appetite, pride, anger).
  - A man enslaved by sin is not free to serve.
- **Practical Ministry:**
  - Receiving Christ’s righteousness results in loving what God loves.
  - Believers minister to physical and spiritual needs (Matthew 25:40).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Definition

- **Sanctification:**
  - The continuous process by which the Holy Spirit imparts Christ's character
    to the believer, enabling them to overcome sin and live a life of obedience.
  - Key Text: 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: The First Persecution

- Question: Why did Cain kill Able?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:11, 12 – “For this is the message that ye heard from the
  beginning, that we should love one another. Not as Cain, who was of that
  wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own
  works were evil, and his brother's righteous.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Two Offerings)

- **Cain (Salvation by Works):**
  - Offered "fruit of the ground" (Genesis 4:3).
  - Relied on self-sufficiency and human labor without a substitute.
  - Bypassed the altar of sacrifice (the cross).
- **Abel (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - Offered a "firstling of his flock" (Genesis 4:4).
  - Recognized he was a sinner needing a Substitute (the Lamb of God).
  - Relied on the blood for remission of sin (Hebrews 9:22).

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Two Patients:**
  - Patient A admits he is helpless, takes the doctor’s bitter medicine, and is
    cured.
  - Patient B insists he can cure himself with vitamins, but gets worse.
  - Patient B hates Patient A because the cure proves Patient B was foolish.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Cain hated Abel because Abel’s faith exposed Cain’s failure and pride.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Flesh vs. Spirit

- Question: Commenting on Ishmael's treatment of Isaac, what principle does Paul
  give us?
- Key Text: Galatians 4:29 – “But as then he that was born after the flesh
  persecuted him that was born after the flesh Spirit, even so it is now.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Two Covenants)

- **Ishmael (The Old Covenant):**
  - Born of human devising (Abraham's effort).
  - Represents the legalist trying to earn heaven by strength.
  - The "flesh" opposes God (Romans 8:7).
- **Isaac (The New Covenant):**
  - Born of promise and miracle when human strength was dead.
  - Represents the Christian "born again" by the Spirit (John 3:3–6).
- **The Conflict:**
  - The legalistic spirit is critical and persecuting.
  - The Spirit-filled life is one of freedom and love.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Definition

- **The Flesh:**
  - In Scripture, this refers to the unrenewed, selfish nature of man that
    opposes God.
  - Key Text: Galatians 5:17 – “For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and
    the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other:
    so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: The Necessity of Persecution

- Question: Who does Paul tell us will suffer persecution?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 3:12 – “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus
  shall suffer persecution.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Condition:**
  - Not just "professing" religion, but living **godly in Christ Jesus**.
  - Requires a vital, abiding connection with Him (John 15:4).
- **The Reaction:**
  - The world hates Christ because His light exposes darkness (John 3:19).
  - If Christ dwells in us, the world will react to us as it did to Him.
- **The Promise:**
  - God provides the grace to endure through the indwelling power of the
    Saviour.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **Rowing Upstream:**
  - If you row with the current, the water carries you effortlessly.
  - If you turn the boat around to row upstream, you immediately feel
    resistance.
- **The Lesson:**
  - A Christian rows against the current of the world.
  - The resistance felt is persecution.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Church and State

- Question: What is essential to religious persecution?
- Key Text: Matthew 22:21 – “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are
  Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **Ecclesiastical Control of Civil Power:**
  - Persecution arises when the church controls the state.
- **Separation of Realms:**
  - **Civil Government:** Deals with relations between men (justice, order).
    Uses the sword (force).
  - **The Church:** Deals with relations between man and God (worship,
    conscience). Uses the Word (sword of the Spirit).
- **The Danger:**
  - When the church fails to convert by love, she tempts the state to use force.
  - This creates the "beast" power (Revelation 13) that enforces worship.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Government Limits

- Question: Since persecution is invariably wrong, what must be true of
  persecuting governments?
- Key Text: Acts 5:29 – “Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We
  ought to obey God rather than men.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **They Are in the Wrong:**
  - Any government dictating religious belief steps outside God-ordained
    jurisdiction.
- **God’s Character:**
  - God grants freedom of choice (Joshua 24:15).
  - He desires obedience motivated by love, not fear of punishment.
- **Universal Principle:**
  - Any system using force to mandate worship is operating contrary to the
    principles of heaven.

## Slide 21 – Q8: Religious Deception

- Question: What terrible deception would it require for religious people to
  persecute Christians?
- Key Text: John 16:2 – “They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time
  cometh; that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points

- **Conscience Deceived:**
  - Zeal for God without knowledge is dangerous (Romans 10:2).
  - Example: Saul of Tarsus (Paul) thought he served God by imprisoning
    believers.
- **Satan’s Strategy:**
  - Distorts God’s character to look like a tyrant.
  - If men believe God burns heretics eternally, they feel justified in burning
    them temporarily.
- **The Need for Truth:**
  - We must know Scripture for ourselves and be guided by the Spirit of Truth.

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Definition (Investigative Judgment)

- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - The work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary to review lives, separating
    true faith from false profession.
  - Key Text: Daniel 7:9-10 – “...the Ancient of days did sit... the judgment
    was set, and the books were opened.”
  - Key Text: 2 Corinthians 5:10 – “For we must all appear before the judgment
    seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body...”

## Slide 24 – Q9: The Spirit of Murder

- Question: Who is the original murderer?
- Key Text: John 8:44 – “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your
  father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning.”

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points

- **The Root is Hate:**
  - “Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer” (1 John 3:15).
  - Persecution begins with anger and intolerance in the heart.
- **Two Families:**
  - We are children of God (love) or children of the devil (hate).
- **The Remedy (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - We need a "new heart" (Ezekiel 36:26).
  - God must replace our stony, selfish nature with the loving nature of Jesus.

## Slide 26 – Q10: The Spirit of Christ

- Question: When James and John wished to call down fire from heaven to consume
  the unbelieving Samaritans, what did Christ say in reply?
- Key Text: Luke 9:55, 56 – “He turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not
  what manner of spirit ye are of: For the Son of man is not come to destroy
  men's lives but to save them.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: Key Points

- **Defending Jesus?**
  - The disciples thought they were defending His honor, but His honor is
    defended by mercy.
- **The Mission:**
  - Christ came to save, not destroy.
  - The Gospel uses the power of the cross (self-sacrifice), never the sword
    (force).
- **A Different Spirit:**
  - The spirit that seeks to destroy opponents is not the Holy Spirit.

## Slide 28 – Q10: Illustration

- **Sun vs. Hammer:**
  - A hammer shatters ice, leaving it broken and hard.
  - The sun melts ice, transforming it.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Force shatters men but leaves them hard.
  - Only the warmth of Christ’s love can melt the heart and change the nature.

## Slide 29 – Q11: The Papacy and Persecution

- Question: Has the Papacy claimed the authority to persecute?
- Key Points:
  - **History:** Both history and internal documents confirm this claim (as
    noted in the study).
  - **Theological Basis:** Based on the claim of Infallibility and exclusive
    "keys" to salvation.
  - **Prophetic Identity:** Fulfills the "Little Horn" prophecy (Daniel 7:21)
    which "made war with the saints."
- **The Protestant Principle:**
  - "Every one of us shall give account of himself to God" (Romans 14:12). No
    church can police the conscience.

## Slide 30 – Q12: The Law of Love

- Question: What divine command, if obeyed, would do away with all oppression
  and persecution?
- Key Text 1: Matthew 22:39 – “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”
- Key Text 2: Matthew 7:12 – “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do
  to you, do ye even so to them.”

## Slide 31 – Q12: Key Points (New Covenant Application)

- **The Remedy:** The Golden Rule requires according others the same freedom we
  desire.
- **The Impossible Command:**
  - To the selfish heart, loving a neighbor as oneself is impossible.
  - We must ask Christ to dwell in us and love through us.
- **Promise of the Covenant:**
  - “I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts”
    (Hebrews 8:10).
  - When selfishness dies, persecution ends.

## Slide 32 – Q13: Love and Law

- Question: What does love not do?
- Key Text: Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love
  is the fulfilling of the law.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points

- **Love is Active:**
  - Love is keeping the commandments in spirit and truth.
  - Persecution works "ill" (harm), therefore it violates God's Law.
- **Fulfilling the Law:**
  - If I love my neighbor, I will not kill, steal, or lie (Commandments 6, 8,
    9).
- **Fruit of the Spirit:**
  - Righteousness is the love of God shed abroad in the heart (Galatians
    5:22-23).

## Slide 34 – Q14: The Blessing

- Question: What blessing does Christ impart to those who are persecuted?
- Key Text: Matthew 5:10 – “Blessed are they which are persecuted for
  righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: Key Points

- **Fellowship of Suffering:**
  - Persecution identifies the believer with Christ and the prophets (John
    15:19).
- **Character Development:**
  - Trials purge the dross and teach total dependence on God.
- **Final Reward:**
  - Suffering is temporary; the Kingdom is eternal.
  - The faithful receive the "crown of life" (Revelation 2:10).

## Slide 36 – Q14: Illustration & Conclusion

- **Coal to Diamond:**
  - A diamond is coal that has endured intense pressure and heat.
  - God uses the pressure of persecution to transform His people into jewels
    that reflect His light (Malachi 3:17).
- **Our Response:**
  - We cannot avoid persecution, but we can choose our response.
  - Through the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4), we respond to hatred with love and
    prayer.
