## Slide 1 – Q1: The Scriptures

- Question: In the days of Jesus, what was the name for the Bible?
- Key Text: Matthew 21:42 – “Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the
  scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head
  of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Name:** Known simply as “the Scriptures” (meaning “writings”), yet
  recognized as the authoritative voice of God.
- **The Standard of Truth:**
  - Jesus used the written Word as the final court of appeal.
  - In the wilderness, He defeated Satan by saying: “It is written, Man shall
    not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
    of God.” (Matthew 4:4)
- **The Foundation:**
  - The “stone” in the text is Christ.
  - We cannot separate the written Word (Scripture) from the Living Word
    (Christ).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Constitution:**
  - Imagine a country with a supreme constitution.
  - No matter what a judge or politician thinks, the final question is: “What
    does the constitution say?”
- **The Spiritual Application:**
  - In the Kingdom of Heaven, the Bible acts as that constitution.
  - All human traditions and opinions must bow before the authority of what is
    written.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Word of God

- Question: What other Biblical name is given to this important book?
- Key Text: Luke 8:21 – “And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my
  brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Origin & Power)

- **Divine Origin:**
  - It is God communicating through men.
  - 1 Thessalonians 2:13 – “For this cause also thank we God without ceasing,
    because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received
    it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which
    effectually worketh also in you that believe.”
- **Creative Power:**
  - The Word that created the worlds creates a new heart.
  - Psalm 33:6 – “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
    host of them by the breath of his mouth.”
  - Psalm 33:9 – “For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
    fast.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (Hearing & Doing)

- **Hearing and Doing:**
  - True relationship with Christ involves obedience.
  - Hebrews 4:2 – “For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them:
    but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in
    them that heard it.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - “Doing” is the natural fruit of believing.
  - When faith receives the Word, it works internally to produce obedience.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Seed:**
  - A seed on a shelf does nothing, yet it contains life.
  - 1 Peter 1:23 – “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
    incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”
  - When planted in the “soil” of a believing heart, the life bursts forth into
    righteousness naturally.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Inspiration

- Question: How were the Scriptures given to mankind?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 3:16 – “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and
  is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
  righteousness.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **God-Breathed:**
  - _Theopneustos_ implies the breath of God.
  - Human hands held the pen, but the Spirit provided the thought.
- **The Breath of Life:**
  - Just as God breathed life into Adam (Genesis 2:7), He breathes into the Word
    to make it living.
  - Hebrews 4:12 – “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
    any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
    spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and
    intents of the heart.”
- **Plenary Inspiration:**
  - “All” scripture is inspired—history, prophecy, law, and gospel.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Flute Player:**
  - A flute (the human writer) has its own shape and tone.
  - However, the music is produced entirely by the breath of the musician (God).
  - The melody comes from the Player, not the instrument, though the instrument
    gives it form.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Agents of Inspiration

- Question: By whom were the prophets of old guided as they thus spake for God?
- Key Text: 2 Peter 1:21 – “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of
  man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **Moved by the Spirit:**
  - The prophets were “borne along” by the Holy Ghost, like a ship driven by the
    wind.
  - It was not human will, but Divine impulse.
- **Human Instrumentality:**
  - God used “holy men” set apart for His use.
  - He utilized their distinct personalities (shepherds, statesmen, fishermen)
    to convey His message.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Sanctuary Connection

- **The Light of the Spirit:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the seven-branched candlestick gave light to the
    Holy Place.
  - Exodus 25:37 – “And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall
    light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.”
- **Spiritual Illumination:**
  - Without the Spirit, the Bible is a sealed book.
  - 1 Corinthians 2:14 – “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the
    Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
    because they are spiritually discerned.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Example of Inspiration

- Question: What specific example of this is mentioned by Peter?
- Key Text: Acts 1:16 – “Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been
  fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning
  Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points

- **Predictive Prophecy:**
  - David wrote 1,000 years before Christ.
  - Psalm 41:9 – “Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did
    eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.”
  - This proves the Author sees the end from the beginning.
- **Divine Sovereignty:**
  - Isaiah 46:9-10 – “Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there
    is none else... Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
    the things that are not yet done...”
  - We can trust prophecy because the Spirit knows the future.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Telescope:**
  - A telescope allows you to see distant objects as if they were near.
  - The Holy Spirit acted as a “telescope” for David.
  - It allowed him to see and describe the Messiah’s betrayal across the vast
    distance of time.

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Ultimate Speaker

- Question: Who was it, then, who spoke through these men?
- Key Text: Hebrews 1:1 – “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake
  in time past unto the fathers by the prophets.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **God Himself Speaks:**
  - Through visions, dreams, voices, or angels, it is God communicating.
- **Progressive Revelation:**
  - “Sundry times” means God revealed truth gradually as men could bear it.
  - The culmination of this revelation is Jesus Christ.
  - Hebrews 1:2 – “Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
    hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.”
- **God’s Love:**
  - God is not silent; He is a Father longing to bridge the gap of sin with His
    Word.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Purpose of Scripture

- Question: For what purpose were the Holy Scriptures written?
- Key Text: Romans 15:4 – “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were
  written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
  scriptures might have hope.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **Practical Benefit:**
  - Written for learning, patience, and comfort.
  - The lives of Joseph, Daniel, and Paul are object lessons of God’s sustaining
    power.
- **The “Blessed Hope”:**
  - The goal is hope—a confident expectation of salvation.
  - Titus 2:13 – “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
    the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Application (Hope & Righteousness)

- **Hope in Christ:**
  - Our hope is anchored in His work, not our own.
  - Reading of God’s faithfulness to past sinners gives us hope that His
    righteousness is sufficient for us today.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Fourfold Helpfulness

- Question: What are the four ways in which Scripture can help us?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 3:16 – “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and
  is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
  righteousness.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Doctrine & Reproof)

- **1. Doctrine (Teaching):**
  - Establishes the foundation of truth about God and man.
- **2. Reproof (Conviction):**
  - Like a mirror, the law reveals our defects.
  - Romans 3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
    justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points (Correction & Instruction)

- **3. Correction (Restoration):**
  - Points to the remedy: Jesus Christ who justifies.
- **4. Instruction in Righteousness (Sanctification):**
  - Guides the believer in holy living.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”
  - John 17:17 – “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: God’s Plan for the Believer

- Question: What was God's plan in thus giving the Bible to us?
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 3:17 – “That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly
  furnished unto all good works.”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points

- **Maturity:**
  - “Perfect” means mature, complete, and fit for service.
- **Thoroughly Furnished:**
  - The Bible contains everything necessary for the Christian life; we need no
    human additions.
- **Unto Good Works (RBF Connection):**
  - We are not saved _by_ works, but created _unto_ them.
  - Ephesians 2:10 – “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto
    good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.”
  - Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
    thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”

- Question: How does God intend that His Word shall help us in this dark world
  of sin and death?
- Key Text: Psalm 119:105 – “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto
  my path.”

## Slide 29 – Q10: Key Points

- **A Dark World:**
  - Sin has darkened human understanding.
  - Ephesians 4:18 – “Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from
    the life of God through the ignorance that is in them...”
- **Prophetic Light:**
  - 2 Peter 1:19 – “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
    well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place...”
- **Personal Guidance:**

- **Solid Foundation:**
  - Jesus grounded their faith in the Word, not just miracles.

## Slide 35 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Puzzle:**
