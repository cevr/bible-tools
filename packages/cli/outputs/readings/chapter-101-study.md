# Reading 101: Who Persecute and Why

## Introduction

Persecution of God's faithful people has marked every age of human history, from
Abel's murder by Cain to the martyrs described in Revelation. Understanding
_why_ persecution occurs—and who is truly behind it—reveals the Great
Controversy between Christ and Satan in vivid detail. This study examines the
spiritual roots of persecution, exposes the spirit that drives it, and offers
hope and blessing to those who suffer for righteousness' sake.

## Core Truths

### The Pattern of Persecution Throughout Scripture

From the very beginning, those who walk in truth have faced opposition from
those who do not. Scripture reveals a consistent pattern:

> _"Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay Him, because He
> had done these things on the Sabbath day."_ (John 5:16)

Notice that Christ's "crime" was not Sabbath-breaking—it was failing to follow
_human traditions_ about the Sabbath. The religious leaders had surrounded God's
holy day with burdensome rules, and when Jesus demonstrated the true spirit of
Sabbath-keeping—doing good, healing, and liberating the oppressed—they sought
His life.

[DYK🔎] The Jews had developed 39 categories of forbidden "work" on the Sabbath,
with hundreds of specific regulations. Jesus violated none of God's commands but
repeatedly crossed these man-made traditions, demonstrating that the Sabbath was
made for man's blessing, not his bondage.

This same pattern appears throughout history: those who follow God's Word rather
than human tradition become targets of those who elevate tradition above
Scripture.

### The First Persecution: Cain and Abel

The Bible's first murder reveals the deepest root of all persecution:

> _"Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore
> slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."_
> (1 John 3:11, 12)

**Why did Cain kill Abel?** Not because Abel had wronged him, but because Abel's
righteousness exposed Cain's wickedness. When God accepted Abel's sacrifice and
rejected Cain's, the contrast became unbearable. Rather than repent, Cain
destroyed the one whose obedience condemned his disobedience.

[ILL] Consider two students in a classroom. One studies diligently and receives
excellent marks; the other neglects his work and fails. If the failing student,
rather than changing his ways, grows angry at the successful one for making his
failure obvious, we see the spirit of Cain. This spirit says, "If I cannot rise
to your level, I will drag you down to mine—or destroy you entirely."

### Flesh Against Spirit: A Perpetual Conflict

Paul identifies an ongoing principle in the persecution of Isaac by Ishmael:

> _"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born
> after the Spirit, even so it is now."_ (Galatians 4:29)

**Ishmael** represents those born according to human effort and planning—the
children of the flesh. **Isaac** represents those born according to God's
promise and power—the children of the Spirit. These two cannot peacefully
coexist, for they represent opposing kingdoms.

This principle explains why worldly religion always persecutes true
spirituality. Those who trust in ceremonies, human merit, and religious
machinery will inevitably oppose those who trust solely in Christ's
righteousness received by faith.

[Q] **"But weren't both Ishmael and Isaac children of Abraham? Why the
conflict?"**

Both were physical descendants, but only Isaac was the child of promise.
Ishmael's birth came through human scheming (Sarah giving Hagar to Abraham);
Isaac's birth came through divine intervention when both parents were past the
age of childbearing. This distinction—human effort versus divine grace—marks the
fundamental divide between false and true religion in every age.

## Deeper Truths

### The Guarantee of Persecution for the Godly

Paul makes a sweeping declaration that should sober every believer:

> _"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
> persecution."_ (2 Timothy 3:12)

Notice the certainty: **all** who determine to live godly **shall** suffer
persecution. This is not a possibility but a promise. The world that hated
Christ will hate His followers (John 15:18-20).

The form of persecution varies—social ostracism, economic pressure, legal
penalty, physical harm—but the reality remains constant. If we face no
opposition from the world, we must examine whether we are truly living "godly in
Christ Jesus."

[DYK🔎] The word "persecution" in Greek (_diōkō_) means "to pursue" or "to
chase." It carries the image of a hunter pursuing prey. Satan, as a "roaring
lion," actively pursues those who belong to Christ (1 Peter 5:8).

### The Unholy Alliance: Church and State

Religious persecution requires a specific mechanism to operate:

**The union of ecclesiastical power with civil authority.**

When the church controls or manipulates the state—or when the state enforces
religious observances—persecution inevitably follows. This is because faith, by
its very nature, cannot be compelled. When external force attempts to produce
internal belief, the result is hypocrisy at best and martyrdom at worst.

[Q] **"But shouldn't godly laws reflect biblical principles?"**

There is a crucial distinction between laws that protect civil order (against
theft, murder, fraud) and laws that compel religious observance. The first
table of God's law—duties toward God—can never be enforced by human government
without creating persecution. Only the second table—duties toward fellow
man—falls within civil jurisdiction.

When this boundary is crossed, "whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth
God service" (John 16:2). The persecutor believes he honors God while doing
Satan's work.

### The True Source of Persecution

Behind every act of religious persecution stands the original murderer:

> _"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.
> He was a murderer from the beginning."_ (John 8:44)

Satan was a "murderer from the beginning"—not merely in inspiring Cain to kill
Abel, but in seeking to destroy the human race through sin's entrance. Every
persecution represents Satan's continued war against Christ through His people.

When James and John wished to call fire upon the Samaritans, Jesus revealed the
spirit behind such desires:

> _"Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of: For the Son of man is not come
> to destroy men's lives but to save them."_ (Luke 9:55, 56)

The spirit that destroys is never Christ's Spirit. Wherever persecution arises
under the banner of Christianity, we must recognize it as Satan masquerading as
an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14).

### Historical Testimony

The historical record confirms these biblical principles with sobering clarity.
The Papacy, during its centuries of temporal power, demonstrated what happens
when church and state unite:

[DYK🔎] Historians estimate that millions died during the various inquisitions,
crusades, and religious wars conducted under papal authority. The exact number
will never be known, but Protestant historian W.E.H. Lecky wrote that "the
Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any other institution that has
ever existed among mankind."

The Roman Catholic Church has openly claimed the right to suppress "error" by
force. In 1948, the Jesuit journal _La Civiltà Cattolica_ declared that "the
Catholic Church would betray her trust if she were to proclaim... that error can
have the same rights as truth."

This is not ancient history. This principle—that "error" has no rights—remains
official doctrine. When circumstances permit, this principle will again be
applied. Revelation 13 and 17 indicate that the beast power will once more
"make war with the saints" (Revelation 13:7).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law of Love as the Antidote

What would eliminate all persecution from the earth?

> _"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."_ (Matthew 22:39)
>
> _"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
> them."_ (Matthew 7:12)

**Love worketh no ill to his neighbor** (Romans 13:10). No one who truly loves
could torture, imprison, or kill another for conscience's sake. Therefore,
every act of persecution reveals a heart devoid of God's love, regardless of
religious profession.

[ILL] A father who truly loves his child may discipline, instruct, and even
allow painful consequences—but he would never torture, maim, or kill to force
obedience. How much less would our heavenly Father endorse such treatment of His
other children! "If any man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
liar" (1 John 4:20).

### The Sanctuary and the Character of God

The sanctuary reveals God's method of dealing with sin—not by force, but by
sacrifice. In the outer court, the lamb died willingly. In the holy place, the
priests interceded continually. In the Most Holy Place, God provided complete
cleansing from sin.

**God never forces.** He invites, pleads, warns, and offers grace—but He respects
the freedom He gave. Satan, by contrast, uses deception and force. When
religion employs coercion, it reveals whose spirit it follows, regardless of
the name it bears.

The investigative judgment now proceeding in heaven's Most Holy Place examines
hearts—not to find whom to condemn by force, but to vindicate those who have
chosen Christ by faith. God's government is a government of love, not of
compulsion.

### Righteousness by Faith and Persecution

True righteousness comes only through faith in Christ—His righteousness imputed
and imparted. This truth strikes at the heart of all false religion, which
depends on human effort, ceremonies, and works.

When Luther proclaimed "the just shall live by faith," Rome's entire system of
merit and penance was threatened. When the Sabbath is restored as God's sign of
sanctification (Ezekiel 20:12)—a memorial that God makes us holy, not we
ourselves—all human-centered religion is exposed.

This is why persecution intensifies around the Sabbath truth. It represents
pure dependence on God versus human achievement. Those who trust in their own
righteousness cannot tolerate those who trust in Christ alone.

## Practical Application

### For Those Who May Face Persecution

1. **Expect it**: "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
   persecution" (2 Timothy 3:12). Do not be surprised when it comes.

2. **Examine your response**: When facing opposition, ask whether your reaction
   reflects Christ's spirit or Cain's. Do you return blessing for cursing?
   (Romans 12:14)

3. **Remember the promise**: "Blessed are they which are persecuted for
   righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (Matthew 5:10).
   Heaven awaits.

4. **Rejoice**: "Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
   heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you" (Matthew
   5:12).

### For All Believers

1. **Guard against the spirit of persecution in yourself**: It is possible to
   hold right doctrine while cherishing the wrong spirit. Are you willing to
   force others to believe as you do?

2. **Support religious liberty**: Oppose every union of church and state, even
   when the church is your own. Freedom of conscience is a gift from God that
   no earthly power may rightfully revoke.

3. **Pray for the persecuted**: Believers around the world today suffer for
   their faith. "Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them" (Hebrews
   13:3).

4. **Prepare your heart**: The prophecies indicate that persecution will
   intensify before Christ's return. Now is the time to establish such a
   connection with Christ that you can stand when tested.

## Appeal

> _"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."_
> (Revelation 2:10)

The same Jesus who endured the cross now ministers in heaven's sanctuary on our
behalf. He who faced the fury of men and demons—and conquered—offers to live
His victorious life in us.

When persecution comes, will you be found among those who overcome "by the blood
of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony"? (Revelation 12:11)

The world hates righteousness because it loves sin. But Christ has overcome the
world (John 16:33). Through faith in Him—trusting His merits, receiving His
indwelling presence, depending wholly upon His strength—we too may overcome.

Fellowship with God brings enmity with the world, but it also brings peace that
passes understanding, joy unspeakable, and the assurance of eternal life.
Choose this day whom you will serve. The One who saves you from sin can also
sustain you through trial—and bring you safely to the kingdom that persecution
can never touch.
