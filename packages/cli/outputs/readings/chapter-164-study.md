# Reading 164: True Shepherds and False—A Test for the Last Days

## Introduction

In the final scenes of earth's history, few questions matter more than this: _Who is leading God's flock?_ Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, gave His life for the sheep. But Scripture warns that many claiming to speak for God are hirelings—blind guides who lead souls to destruction. This study examines the biblical marks of true and false shepherds, revealing a vital test by which every believer may discern truth from error.

## Core Truths

### The Good Shepherd Defined

> _"I am the good Shepherd: the good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep."_ (John 10:11)

Christ alone is the **true Shepherd** of souls. Every human minister is but an under-shepherd, accountable to Him. The distinguishing mark of the Good Shepherd is **self-sacrifice**—He did not count His own life dear, but laid it down freely for those He came to save.

**Hireling**: A hired worker with no personal investment in the flock; one who serves for wages rather than love (John 10:12–13).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "hireling" (_misthōtos_) implies one motivated by _misthos_—wages or reward. Jesus draws a sharp contrast: the hireling flees when danger comes because his interest is in payment, not in the sheep themselves.

### The Work of a True Shepherd

Scripture outlines clear duties for those who lead God's people:

1. **Feed the flock with God's Word**

   > _"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He hath purchased with His own blood."_ (Acts 20:28)

   > _"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season."_ (2 Timothy 4:2)

2. **Set a godly example**

   > _"In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works."_ (Titus 2:7)

3. **Warn of coming danger**
   > _"O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at My mouth, and warn them from Me."_ (Ezekiel 33:7)

The faithful minister is a **watchman on the walls of Zion**—alert, vigilant, and bold to sound the alarm when peril approaches.

## Deeper Truths

### The Marks of False Shepherds

Scripture provides a detailed portrait of unfaithful leaders. These warning signs transcend any single age or denomination—they describe a recurring pattern throughout history:

#### 1. Self-Interest Over Service

> _"They are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter."_ (Isaiah 56:11)

> _"Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?"_ (Ezekiel 34:2)

False shepherds use the flock for personal advantage—wealth, prestige, comfort—rather than serving the sheep's spiritual needs.

[Q] **"But doesn't every minister need financial support?"**

Indeed, "the labourer is worthy of his reward" (1 Timothy 5:18). Scripture affirms that those who preach the gospel should live by the gospel (1 Corinthians 9:14). The distinction lies in **motive**: the true shepherd labors for love of souls; the hireling labors for love of gain. One remains when danger threatens; the other flees.

#### 2. Failure to Warn

> _"His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber."_ (Isaiah 56:10)

> _"They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace."_ (Jeremiah 6:14)

**Dumb dogs that cannot bark**—what a solemn picture! A watchdog's purpose is to sound the alarm. A shepherd who fails to warn the flock of spiritual danger—who cries "Peace!" when judgment is near—betrays his sacred trust.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word translated "slightly" in Jeremiah 6:14 (_qalal_) means superficially or carelessly. False shepherds offer quick, shallow remedies for sin—a bandage on a mortal wound—rather than the deep work of repentance and faith.

#### 3. Blindness to Prophetic Truth

> _"And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed."_ (Isaiah 29:11)

The prophecies of Daniel and Revelation were given to prepare God's people for the last days. Yet many religious teachers declare these books "too mysterious" or "sealed"—when God Himself has said they would be understood in the time of the end (Daniel 12:4, 9–10).

[Q] **"Isn't prophecy meant to be mysterious?"**

Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for not understanding the signs of their time (Matthew 16:3). The angel told Daniel that "the wise shall understand" (Daniel 12:10). Prophecy is not given to confuse but to illuminate—to prepare the faithful for what lies ahead. Those who dismiss prophetic study leave their flocks vulnerable to deception.

#### 4. Departure from God's Law

> _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."_ (Isaiah 8:20)

> _"For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth... But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law."_ (Malachi 2:7–8)

Here is **the decisive test**: Does the shepherd uphold God's holy law, or has he caused the people to stumble at it? Any teaching that diminishes, sets aside, or contradicts the commandments of God bears the mark of spiritual darkness.

[ILL] Imagine a lighthouse keeper who, weary of his duties, allows the lamp to grow dim. Ships relying on that light are dashed upon the rocks. So it is with ministers who obscure the light of God's law—souls trusting their guidance are shipwrecked upon the rocks of disobedience.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and the Shepherd's Work

The earthly sanctuary reveals the ministry of Christ, our Great High Priest—and the pattern for all who serve under Him:

- **Outer Court** (Altar of Sacrifice): Christ gave His life for the sheep. True shepherds point to this sacrifice alone as the basis of salvation.

- **Holy Place** (Candlestick, Table of Shewbread, Altar of Incense): Christ ministers through His Word (bread), the Holy Spirit (light), and intercession (incense). True shepherds feed the flock with Scripture, walk in the Spirit's power, and pray earnestly for their people.

- **Most Holy Place** (Ark of the Covenant): The law of God—the standard of judgment—rests beneath the mercy seat. True shepherds uphold this law and prepare their people for the investigative judgment now in progress.

False shepherds neglect one or all of these elements. They either point away from Christ's sacrifice, substitute human traditions for God's Word, or set aside the law that defines sin and righteousness.

### The Great Controversy and Leadership

Satan's strategy from Eden has been to corrupt those who lead. If he can turn the shepherd, the whole flock may be scattered. Throughout history:

- **Apostate priests** led Israel into idolatry (Jeremiah 2:8; 23:1–2)
- **Pharisees** added human tradition, rejected the Messiah (Matthew 15:3–9)
- **Medieval clergy** obscured Scripture and persecuted the faithful
- **Modern teachers** deny prophecy, minimize the law, and preach comfortable fables

> _"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."_ (2 Timothy 4:3–4)

This is not a future prediction—it is present reality. Many today demand "smooth things" and "deceits" (Isaiah 30:10), rejecting the plain testimony of Scripture because it disturbs their comfort.

### God's Promise to His Scattered Flock

Despite the failure of human shepherds, God Himself will not abandon His sheep:

> _"Behold, I, even I, will both search My sheep, and seek them out. As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out My sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day."_ (Ezekiel 34:11–12)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "cloudy and dark day" echoes prophetic imagery of end-time distress (Joel 2:2; Zephaniah 1:15). Even in the darkest hour, God promises to gather His faithful ones from every place of spiritual exile.

## Practical Application

### How to Test a Shepherd

Every believer has both the right and responsibility to examine religious teaching:

1. **Does he exalt Christ as the only way of salvation?** (John 14:6; Acts 4:12)

2. **Does he feed the flock with Scripture, not human philosophy?** (2 Timothy 4:2; Isaiah 8:20)

3. **Does he uphold God's law as the standard of Christian living?** (Malachi 2:7; Matthew 5:17–19)

4. **Does he warn of coming judgment and the nearness of Christ's return?** (Ezekiel 33:7; Acts 20:26–27)

5. **Does he open the prophetic word rather than declaring it "sealed"?** (Revelation 1:3; Daniel 12:4, 10)

6. **Does his life exemplify the truth he preaches?** (Titus 2:7; 1 Timothy 4:12)

> _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."_ (Isaiah 8:20)

This is the infallible test. No eloquence, no popularity, no miracle can substitute for agreement with God's Word.

### What If You Discover a Shepherd Is False?

- **Do not follow error out of loyalty or tradition.** Jesus said, "Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch" (Matthew 15:14).

- **Seek out those who faithfully teach God's Word.** There are still shepherds who have not bowed the knee to Baal.

- **Study Scripture for yourself.** The Bereans were "more noble" because they searched the Scriptures daily to prove what they heard (Acts 17:11).

- **Pray for discernment.** "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God" (James 1:5).

## The Solemn Accountability of Shepherds

God's warning to unfaithful leaders is severe:

> _"If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand."_ (Ezekiel 33:8)

> _"If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life."_ (Revelation 22:18–19)

> _"Howl, ye shepherds, and cry... for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished... for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture."_ (Jeremiah 25:34–37)

[Q] **"Isn't this harsh language?"**

It is the language of divine justice. Those entrusted with the care of immortal souls bear the weightiest responsibility on earth. To lead astray those for whom Christ died—to feed them poison instead of bread—is a crime that heaven will not overlook.

Yet there is also **glorious promise** for those who serve faithfully:

> _"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."_ (1 Peter 5:4)

---

## Appeal

Dear friend, in these last days the Good Shepherd is calling His sheep by name. He knows those who are His. He is searching for the scattered, the confused, the weary—those misled by blind guides and false teachers.

Will you hear His voice?

> _"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me: and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand."_ (John 10:27–28)

Do not place your eternal destiny in the hands of any human teacher without testing his words by the law and the testimony. Search the Scriptures. Prove all things. Hold fast to that which is good.

And if you have been called to lead others—whether as pastor, teacher, parent, or friend—hear the solemn charge of the Chief Shepherd: _Feed My sheep._ Warn them of danger. Uphold God's holy law. Point them to Jesus, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Be faithful unto death, and He will give you a crown of life.

_"And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."_ (1 Peter 5:4)
