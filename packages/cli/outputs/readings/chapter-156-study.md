### Q1. By what are men justified?

"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord
Jesus Christ." Romans 5:1.

**Answer:**

The foundation of the Christian life is the restoration of a right relationship
with God. The Bible teaches that this restoration happens not through our own
merits, but through faith in Christ.

1.  **The Definition of Justification:**
    - **Justification** is the legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner
      is righteous. It is an act of free grace where God pardons our sins and
      accounts us as righteous because of the merits of Jesus (Romans 3:24;
      Titus 3:7).
    - It is not merely "overlooking" sin, but a judicial act where the penalty
      was paid by Christ at the cross (the Altar of Sacrifice), and His perfect
      life is credited to the believer.

2.  **The Role of Faith:**
    - Faith is the hand that grasps the gift. We are not justified _because_ of
      our faith (as if faith were a meritorious work), but _by_ faith. Faith
      connects our weakness to God’s strength and our sinfulness to Christ’s
      righteousness (Philippians 3:9).
    - **Righteousness by Faith** means that we look entirely away from self and
      entirely to Jesus. When the Father looks at the believing sinner, He sees
      the perfect obedience of His Son.

3.  **The Result: Peace:**
    - Sin creates enmity (hostility) between man and God (Romans 8:7).
      Justification removes the guilt that separates us, resulting in "peace
      with God." This is the peace of a conscience cleansed by the blood of
      Christ (Hebrews 9:14).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a man who owes a debt of millions of dollars
that he can never repay. He is dragged into court and faces imprisonment.
Suddenly, a wealthy friend steps in, pays the entire debt, and gives the receipt
to the judge. The judge then declares the debtor "free and clear." The man did
not earn his freedom; he simply accepted the payment made by another. This is
justification: Christ paid our debt, and by faith, we accept His payment and go
free.

### Q2. Then how are the just to live?

"Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul shall have
no pleasure in him." Hebrews 10:38.

**Answer:**

Faith is not merely for the beginning of the Christian journey; it is the
sustaining power of the entire Christian life.

1.  **From Justification to Sanctification:**
    - We are justified by faith (Romans 5:1), and we must also **live** by faith
      (Galatians 2:20). This ongoing life of faith is called
      **Sanctification**—the process of being made holy and obedient through the
      indwelling power of the Holy Spirit.
    - As the branch draws sap from the vine to bear fruit, the believer draws
      life from Christ to bear the fruit of obedience (John 15:4–5).

2.  **No Drawing Back:**
    - To "draw back" implies returning to a life of unbelief and reliance on
      self or the world. In the context of the **Sanctuary**, having entered the
      courtyard (justification at the cross), we must not turn back to Egypt. We
      must press forward into the Holy Place of daily communion and service.
    - Perseverance is essential. The "faith of Jesus" is a faith that endures
      until the end (Revelation 14:12).

3.  **Pleasing God:**
    - God has "no pleasure" in those who draw back because they are rejecting
      the only Source of life. To turn away from faith is to turn toward
      spiritual death.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A deep-sea diver relies on an air hose connected to a
compressor on the surface for life. As long as he remains connected, he can live
and work in the depths. If he decides he can survive on his own and disconnects
the hose, he perishes. Faith is that connecting hose. We must breathe through it
every moment to live the life of Christ.

### Q3. Why did not Israel of old attain to the law of righteousness?

"Because they sought it not by faith." Romans 9:32.

**Answer:**

This is a vital warning against legalism—the attempt to be righteous by human
effort.

1.  **The Failure of Human Effort:**
    - Israel desired righteousness (conformity to God's law), but they tried to
      achieve it by their own strength. This is the "Old Covenant" experience:
      promising to obey while having a carnal, unrenewed heart (Exodus 19:8;
      Hebrews 8:7–9).
    - God requires perfect obedience to His law (James 2:10), but a sinner
      cannot produce this obedience from a selfish heart (Romans 8:7–8).

2.  **The Way of Faith:**
    - True obedience is the _fruit_ of faith, not the _root_ of salvation. When
      we seek righteousness by faith, God writes His law in our hearts (Hebrews
      8:10).
    - **Righteousness by Faith** teaches that Christ lives His life of perfect
      obedience _in_ us. We do not abolish the law by faith; rather, we
      establish it (Romans 3:31) because Christ keeps it through us.

3.  **The Stumbling Stone:**
    - Israel stumbled because the simplicity of trusting a crucified Savior (or
      the sacrificial system that pointed to Him) seemed too easy or too
      humbling compared to the pride of their own rigorous rule-keeping.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a man trying to reach the roof of a building by
pulling on his own shoelaces. No matter how hard he strains, he remains on the
ground. This is like trying to keep the law by human effort. Faith is like
stepping into an elevator; the power of the elevator lifts the man to the top.
The man still "ascends," but the power comes from outside himself.

### Q4. When one told Christ of the disciples' failure to heal his afflicted son, what did He say of that generation?

"He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with
you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto Me." Mark 9:19.

**Answer:**

Jesus reveals here that powerlessness in the spiritual life is directly linked
to a lack of faith.

1.  **The Sin of Faithlessness:**
    - Jesus calls the generation "faithless." He does not rebuke them for lack
      of education or talent, but for lack of trust in God’s power.
    - Unbelief acts as a barrier that insulates us from the omnipotence of God
      (Matthew 13:58).

2.  **The Grief of Christ:**
    - "How long shall I suffer you?" This language shows that our unbelief is a
      burden to the heart of Christ. It pains Him when His people live as
      orphans, powerless against the enemy, when He has provided ample power for
      victory.

3.  **The Remedy: "Bring him unto Me":**
    - When human effort fails, the solution is always to bring the problem
      directly to Jesus. He is the High Priest who can be touched with the
      feeling of our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15).

### Q5. What did the Saviour say to Thomas when He met him, because he did not believe the testimony of his brethren that had seen Christ alive after His crucifixion?

"Reach hither thy finger, and behold My hands; and reach hither thy hand, and
thrust it into My side; and be not faithless, but believing." John 20:27.

**Answer:**

1.  **Demanding Proof vs. Believing the Word:**
    - Thomas refused to believe the testimony of credible witnesses (the other
      disciples). He demanded empirical, sensory proof. While God is patient, He
      calls us to a higher level of faith: "Blessed are they that have not seen,
      and yet have believed" (John 20:29).

2.  **The Call to "Be Not Faithless":**
    - Unbelief is not a harmless intellectual state; Jesus commands Thomas to
      stop being faithless. This implies that faith is a choice of the will. We
      can choose to trust God’s Word, or we can choose to doubt.
    - God has given sufficient evidence for faith to rest upon, though He rarely
      removes all possibility of doubt.

3.  **Relevance to the Last Days:**
    - We live in the time of the **investigative judgment**. We cannot see
      Christ physically in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary, but we
      must believe He is there doing a work of cleansing for us, based on the
      testimony of Scripture (Daniel 8:14; Hebrews 8:1–2).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A patient goes to a surgeon for a life-saving operation.
The patient has never seen the surgeon operate, but he trusts the doctor's
reputation and the testimony of recovered patients. If the patient refused
anesthesia until he could "see" the surgery happening to himself, he would die.
We must trust the Great Physician based on His Word and the testimony of the
"cloud of witnesses."

---

### Q6. In view of the great cloud of witnesses of faith presented by the apostle in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, what does Paul exhort all to do?

"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of
witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset
us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us." Hebrews 12:1.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Besetting Sin:**
    - While we all have different weaknesses, the context suggests that "the sin
      which doth so easily beset us" is **unbelief**. It is the root sin that
      led Israel to fail in the wilderness and prevents us from running the
      race.
    - **Unbelief** is the sin that cuts the nerve of spiritual power. When we
      doubt God's love or His power to give us victory, we inevitably fall into
      other sins.

2.  **Laying Aside Weights:**
    - Weights may not be sins in themselves, but they are hindrances—worldly
      cares, bad habits, unnecessary associations, or anything that slows our
      spiritual progress.
    - In the **antitypical Day of Atonement**, we are called to "afflict our
      souls" (Leviticus 23:27), which involves deep heart-searching and putting
      away everything that separates us from God.

3.  **Running with Patience:**
    - The Christian life is a marathon, not a sprint. It requires endurance. We
      must keep our eyes fixed on Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith
      (Hebrews 12:2).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A runner competing in the Olympics wears the lightest
clothing possible. He would never run with a heavy winter coat or a backpack
(weights). Furthermore, if he had a rope tangled around his feet (the besetting
sin), he would surely fall. To win, he must cast off the heavy coat and untangle
the rope.

### Q7. Why were most of the children of Israel prohibited from entering the promised land?

"And to whom sware He that they should not enter into His rest, but to them that
believed not? So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."
Hebrews 3:18, 19.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Tragedy of Kadesh-Barnea:**
    - The Israelites stood on the border of Canaan. God said, "Go up and possess
      it." But they looked at the giants and the walled cities and said, "We are
      not able."
    - This was not just fear; it was a rejection of God's promise. They trusted
      their own eyes more than God's Word.

2.  **The Consequence: Barred from Rest:**
    - Because they did not believe God could give them the victory, they were
      sent back into the wilderness.
    - **Typological Application:** As Adventists, we are on the borders of the
      Heavenly Canaan. If we doubt God's power to bring us into the "rest" of
      victory over sin and final salvation, we may repeat their history.

3.  **Unbelief is the Locking Mechanism:**
    - Heaven is a place of perfect trust. Those who cherish unbelief cannot
      enter because they are out of harmony with the atmosphere of heaven.

---

### Q8. How was their unbelief regarded, and how did it affect God?

"But with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned,
whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?" Hebrews 3:17.

**Answer:**

1.  **Grieving the Spirit:**
    - God is a personal Being with feelings. Unbelief "grieves" Him (Psalm
      78:40; Ephesians 4:30).
    - Why? Because unbelief accuses God of being a liar. It treats His promises
      as worthless. After all He had done for them (the Red Sea, the Manna),
      their continued doubt was a deep insult to His love.

2.  **The Connection Between Unbelief and Sin:**
    - Notice the text equates "them that believed not" (v. 18) with "them that
      had sinned" (v. 17).
    - Unbelief is the mother of all other sins. When Eve doubted God’s word in
      Eden, disobedience followed. When we stop trusting God to satisfy and
      protect us, we turn to sin to satisfy and protect ourselves.

---

### Q9. What lesson does the apostle exhort us to draw from the course of the Israelites?

"Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into His rest,
any of you should seem to come short of it." Hebrews 4:1.

**Answer:**

1.  **A Holy Fear:**
    - This is not a fear of God's anger, but a cautious fear of our own
      deceitful hearts. "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
      fall" (1 Corinthians 10:12).
    - We should fear the possibility of drifting into a state of spiritual
      slumber or doubt where the promise of salvation slips through our fingers.

2.  **The Promise Remains:**
    - The "rest" offered to Israel was not just physical land, but spiritual
      peace and trust in God (Sabbath rest). They failed, but the promise
      remains open for us today.
    - We enter this rest by ceasing from our own works (legalism/self-reliance)
      and trusting fully in the finished work of Christ (Hebrews 4:10).

---

### Q10. What should we all labor to do?

"Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the
same example of unbelief." Hebrews 4:11.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Paradox: Laboring to Rest:**
    - It seems contradictory to "labor" to enter "rest." However, the labor
      required is not the labor of earning salvation (works-righteousness), but
      the labor of maintaining faith.
    - It requires earnest effort to:
      - Surrender the will to God.
      - Resist the devil.
      - Study the Word and pray.
      - Choose to believe despite feelings to the contrary.

2.  **The Fight of Faith:**
    - "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life" (1 Timothy
      6:12). Our battle is to hold on to Christ. The "labor" is to deny self and
      let Jesus reign.

3.  **Avoiding the Pattern of Failure:**
    - We are warned not to fall "after the same example of unbelief." History
      repeats itself. The same doubts that assailed Israel assail the Remnant
      Church today.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A man in a raging river must strive and labor to grab
hold of the lifeline thrown to him. His effort doesn't save him—the rope and the
rescuer do—but he must use all his energy to hold on against the current. This
is the "labor" of faith.

### Q11. Should one lose heart when trying to be a Christian, even though he feels that God is chastising him?

"My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art
rebuked of Him." Hebrews 12:5.

**Answer:**

1.  **Understanding Chastisement:**
    - **Chastisement** refers to discipline, correction, or training. It is not
      punishment for the sake of inflicting pain, but corrective measures to
      refine character.
    - God often allows trials to show us defects in our character that we cannot
      see in times of ease.

2.  **Two Wrong Reactions:**
    - **Despising it:** Ignoring God's lesson, becoming hard-hearted, or
      resenting the trial.
    - **Fainting:** Giving up in despair, thinking God has rejected us.
    - The correct reaction is submission and learning: "Lord, what wouldst Thou
      have me learn from this?"

3.  **Encouragement:**
    - Correction is evidence that God is still working on us. He has not cast us
      aside.

---

### Q12. Who are they that seem to have the greatest amount of affliction?

"For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He
receiveth." Hebrews 12:6.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Badge of Sonship:**
    - Affliction and discipline are not signs of God's hatred, but of His love.
      Just as a responsible father disciplines his child to save him from ruin,
      God disciplines us to save us from sin.
    - "Scourging" (a severe word) implies that sometimes deep, painful trials
      are necessary to break our pride or separate us from cherished sins.

2.  **Preparation for Heaven:**
    - God is preparing a people to stand in the presence of a holy God. The
      "refiner's fire" (Malachi 3:2–3) is hot, but its purpose is to remove the
      dross so that the image of Christ is perfectly reflected in the gold.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A sculptor chisels a block of marble. He strikes hard
blows with a hammer. If the marble could speak, it might cry out, "Why are you
hurting me?" But the sculptor replies, "I am not hurting you; I am releasing the
beautiful statue hidden inside." God is the sculptor; we are the marble.

---

### Q13. If one has no chastisement to bear, how may he regard himself?

"But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye
bastards, and not sons." Hebrews 12:8.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Danger of Ease:**
    - If a professed Christian can sin without conscience, or live a worldly
      life without any corrective intervention from God, it is a terrifying
      sign. It suggests they are "bastards" (illegitimate children)—not truly
      born of God.
    - To be left alone in sin is the worst condition possible (Hosea 4:17).

2.  **Embracing the Discipline:**
    - When we face trials, instead of complaining, we should rejoice that God
      considers us His children and is investing in our eternal future.

---

### Q14. When the disciples became almost discouraged at one of Christ's sayings, and asked, "Who then can be saved?" What answer did Christ make?

"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but
with God all things are possible." Matthew 19:26.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Impossibility of Self-Salvation:**
    - The context here is the rich young ruler. The disciples realized that if a
      moral, wealthy man couldn't enter the kingdom, no one could.
    - Jesus confirms: Humanly speaking, salvation is impossible. We cannot
      change our own hearts. "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard
      his spots?" (Jeremiah 13:23). We cannot produce righteousness or overcome
      sin by mere willpower.

2.  **The Divine Possibility:**
    - "But with God all things are possible." This is the essence of
      **Righteousness by Faith**.
    - God can take a selfish heart and make it loving.
    - God can take a defiled life and make it holy.
    - God can give victory over the strongest addiction or temper.

3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:**
    - In the cleansing of the sanctuary, God proposes to blot out not just the
      record of sin, but the very presence of sin from His people's hearts. He
      does the impossible work of making sinners into saints.

---

### Q15. When God made a promise to Abraham that it seemed almost impossible to fulfill, how did the patriarch receive it?

"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in
faith, giving glory to God." Romans 4:20.

**Answer:**

1.  **Faith Against Circumstances:**
    - Abraham was about 100 years old; Sarah was 90. Biologically ("as
      concerning the flesh"), having a son was impossible.
    - To "stagger" implies hesitation or doubting. Abraham did not look at his
      own dead body; he looked at the promise of the Creator.

2.  **Giving Glory to God:**
    - Faith gives glory to God because it acknowledges that God is able to do
      what He says. Unbelief robs God of His glory.
    - This is the experience of the **144,000** (Revelation 14:12). They will
      face a time when all earthly support is cut off, yet they will not
      stagger.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you hold a glass of water with a trembling hand, the
water spills. That is "staggering." Abraham held the cup of God's promise with a
steady hand, even though everything around him said the cup should be empty.

---

### Q16. For what was Abraham's faith under these circumstances counted?

"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him
for righteousness." Romans 4:3.

**Answer:**

1.  **Imputed Righteousness:**
    - This is the classic definition of **Justification by Faith**. Abraham had
      no righteousness of his own to offer in this situation. He simply believed
      God.
    - God took that faith and "counted" (credited/imputed) it as righteousness.

2.  **Not Faith as a Work:**
    - We must be careful not to view faith as a "good work" that earns a reward.
      Rather, faith is the _reception_ of God's work. Because Abraham trusted
      God, God could work in him and for him.

3.  **The Exchange:**
    - Christ takes our sin; we take His righteousness. This transaction happens
      solely through the medium of faith.

---

### Q17. What should be the burden of one's prayer, who is troubled with unbelief?

"Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief." Mark 9:24.

**Answer:**

1.  **Honesty in Prayer:**
    - The father of the demon-possessed boy was honest. He had _some_ faith (he
      came to Jesus), but he also had doubts ("If thou canst do anything...").
    - He did not hide his doubt. He confessed it as a sin and asked for help.

2.  **Faith is a Gift:**
    - We cannot manufacture faith. If we lack faith, we must ask God for it.
      "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" (Romans 10:17).
    - When we feel weak, this should be our constant cry: "Help thou mine
      unbelief." Jesus instantly answered this prayer and healed the son.

---

### Q18. What do the Scriptures say of him who believes that he receives the things for which he asks?

"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe
that ye receive them, and ye shall have them." Mark 11:24.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Prayer of Faith:**
    - This is the secret of prevailing prayer. It is not enough to ask; we must
      expect.
    - Note the tense: Believe that ye _receive_ (present tense) them, and ye
      _shall have_ (future realization) them. We believe we have the answer by
      faith before we see the answer in fact.

2.  **Conditions:**
    - This promise assumes we are praying according to God's will (1 John 5:14).
    - It assumes we are not cherishing known sin (Psalm 66:18).

3.  **Practical Application:**
    - Do you pray for victory over a specific sin? Believe that Christ _is_
      giving you the victory now. Rise from your knees believing His power is
      yours.
    - Do you pray for forgiveness? Believe you _are_ forgiven, not because you
      feel it, but because He promised (1 John 1:9). This is how the just live
      by faith.
