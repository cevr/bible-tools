## Slide 1 – Q1: Christ the Ensign

- Question: What did an Old Testament prophet predict of Christ?
- Key Text: Isaiah 11:10 – “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse,
  which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles
  trust.”
- Key Text: Romans 15:12 – “And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of
  Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the
  Gentiles trust.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Root of Jesse:**
  - This points to Christ's humanity and lineage as the "Son of David."
  - Romans 1:3 – “Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of
    the seed of David according to the flesh.”
  - He is a real Brother who understands our frame (Hebrews 2:17).
- **An Ensign of the People:**
  - An "ensign" is a banner or flag raised on a battlefield as a rallying point.
  - Christ, lifted up on the cross and ministering in the sanctuary, is the
    center of safety (John 12:32).
- **The Object of Trust:**
  - Salvation is not based on genealogy, but on faith.
  - Ephesians 2:12 – “That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens
    from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of
    promise, having no hope, and without God in the world.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Battlefield Banner:**
  - Imagine a chaotic battlefield where soldiers are scattered and confused.
  - Suddenly, the commander raises the regiment's flag high on a hill.
  - To survive, every soldier must run to that flag.
  - **Application:** Christ is that flag. In the confusion of sin, we rally to
    Him for safety under His banner of love.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Purpose of Trust

- Question: What were the apostles, who first trusted in Christ, to become?
- Key Text: Ephesians 1:12 – “That we should be to the praise of His glory, who
  first trusted in Christ.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **The Praise of His Glory:**
  - God's "glory" is His character (Exodus 34:6–7).
  - To be to the "praise of His glory" means believers should reflect God's
    character (love, justice, and purity) to the universe.
- **Witnesses of His Power:**
  - A transformed life proves the Gospel can turn sinners into saints.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We trust Christ so He can live His life through us.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
    live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Master Artist:**
  - A master artist paints a portrait.
  - The glory belongs not to the canvas, but to the artist's skill.
  - **Application:** We are the canvas; Christ is the Artist.
  - When we trust Him, we become a masterpiece that displays the Master's skill
    and grace to the universe.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Hearing and Trusting

- Question: What did the Ephesians do upon hearing the message of truth?
- Key Text: Ephesians 1:13 – “In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the
  word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye
  believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Order of Conversion:**
  - 1. Hearing: Faith is an intelligent response to God's Word.
  - Romans 10:17 – “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
    God.”
  - 2. The Gospel: The "Good News" that Jesus conquered sin and death.
  - 3. Trusting: Active reliance on the merits of Jesus.
- **Definition of Gospel:**
  - The power of God to save from the penalty and power of sin through Christ's
    life, death, and ministry.

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Seal of the Spirit

- Question: What returns did they receive from their proposed trust?
- Key Text: Ephesians 1:13 – “In whom also after that ye believed, ye were
  sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Seal of Ownership:**
  - God gives the Spirit to mark us as His property.
  - 2 Timothy 2:19 – “Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having
    this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that
    nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.”
- **The Seal of Likeness:**
  - A seal leaves an impression in wax.
  - The Spirit works to impress the character image of Christ upon the human
    heart.
- **The Earnest of Inheritance:**
  - The Spirit is the down-payment or foretaste of the life to come.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Sanctuary Application

- **The Oil and the Light:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, oil (symbolizing the Spirit) was kept in the lamps
    of the Holy Place to give light.
  - **Christ our High Priest:** He pours His Spirit into us so we may shine in a
    dark world.
  - Matthew 5:14 – “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
    cannot be hid.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Signet Ring:**
  - A king pours hot wax onto a document and presses his signet ring into it.
  - The wax takes the exact shape of the ring.
  - **Application:** The Holy Spirit softens our hearts (the wax) so the
    character of Christ (the King's image) can be perfectly impressed upon us.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Power of the Gospel

- Question: To whom does the gospel become the power of God?
- Key Text: Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it
  is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew
  first and also to the Greek.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **Power (Dunamis):**
  - The Gospel is explosive power (dynamite) to break the chains of habit.
  - It gives the power to _become_ good, not just the command to be good.
- **Unto Salvation:**
  - Saves from the penalty (Justification) and power (Sanctification) of sin.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
    that is in Christ Jesus.”
- **Conditioned on Faith:**
  - The power is available to everyone, but effective only for "everyone that
    believeth."

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Rope in the Pit:**
  - A man is stuck in a deep, slippery pit; he cannot climb out.
  - A strong rope (the Gospel) is lowered by an engine (God's power).
  - The power to lift lies entirely in the engine, not the man.
  - **Application:** The man must choose to grab the rope and hold on (faith) to
    be saved.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Living by Faith

- Question: But suppose one halts in his faith or trust; how is he regarded by
  the Lord?
- Key Text: Hebrews 10:38 – “Now the just shall live by faith; but if any man
  draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **Continuous Life:**
  - We must _live_ by faith daily, not just begin by it.
  - It requires hourly dependence on Christ for righteousness.
- **The Danger of Drawing Back:**
  - To "draw back" is to return to reliance on self.
  - Luke 9:62 – “And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the
    plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.”
- **Sanctification:**
  - The daily dying to self and living to Christ.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Victory Over the World

- Question: By what does one gain the victory over the world?
- Key Text: 1 John 5:4 – “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world;
  and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points

- **Born of God:**
  - The "new birth" gives a new nature that loves God and His law (John 3:3–5).
- **Overcoming the World:**
  - We are not slaves to the lust of the flesh or the pride of life.
- **The Method of Victory:**
  - We do not overcome by struggling alone.
  - **Faith:** We lay hold of Christ's victory and claim His power.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Victory is a Gift:**
  - We do not say, "I will overcome sin, then I will be holy."
  - We look to Jesus, and in looking, we are changed.
  - The victory belongs to Christ; we accept it by faith.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Child and the Father:**
  - A small child is bullied by a large enemy and cannot win the fight.
  - If the child holds the hand of his strong father, the enemy flees.
  - **Application:** The child's "victory" is simply the trust in holding the
    father's hand.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Evidence of Trust

- Question: In the struggles with temptations, if one trusts in Jesus, how will
  he show it?
- Key Text: John 16:33 – “These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye
  might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good
  cheer; I have overcome the world.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **Peace in Me:**
  - Amidst stress and persecution, we have peace because our High Priest is in
    control.
  - Philippians 4:7 – “And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,
    shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.”
- **Be of Good Cheer:**
  - A trusting Christian is not fearful; the Captain has already won the war.
- **Christ's Victory:**
  - Jesus overcame the world as a human (Hebrews 4:15).
  - He shares His victory with us.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Sanctuary Connection

- **The Peace Offering:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the peace offering represented reconciliation with
    God.
  - **Christ is our Peace Offering.**
  - Through Him, we have peace with God and the power to walk in newness of
    life.

## Slide 25 – Q9: How to Overcome

- Question: But is there not some other help in the work of overcoming, besides
  a silent trust in Christ?
- Key Text: Revelation 12:11 – “And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb,
  and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the
  death.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points (The Merit & The Confession)

- **1. The Blood of the Lamb (The Merit):**
  - This is the foundation. Jesus died for us.
  - His blood cleanses the conscience and gives us the legal right to be God's
    children.
- **2. The Word of Their Testimony (The Confession):**
  - Faith must be spoken and acted upon.
  - We use the "Sword of the Spirit" (the Word) against Satan, just as Jesus did
    ("It is written").

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points (The Surrender)

- **3. Loved Not Their Lives (The Surrender):**
  - Victory comes when we are dead to self-preservation.
  - When we are willing to sacrifice everything for the truth, Satan loses his
    power.
- **Atonement:**
  - The work of reconciliation (at-one-ment) involving Christ's sacrifice and
    His High Priestly ministry to blot out sin.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Courtroom:**
  - An accused person is set free because:
    1. The fine was paid by a benefactor (**The Blood**).
    2. The accused admits the truth and claims the benefactor's help (**The
       Testimony**).
    3. The accused commits to a new life, abandoning old criminal ways
       (**Surrender**).

## Slide 29 – Q10: Temporal Benefits

- Question: But besides receiving power to overcome our foes, are there not
  temporal benefits to be derived from trusting in Jesus?
- Key Text: Matthew 9:22 – “But Jesus turned Him about, and when He saw her, He
  said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the
  woman was made whole from that hour.”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points

- **The Touch of Faith:**
  - Many pressed around Jesus, but only one woman _touched_ Him with faith.
- **Temporal Blessings:**
  - Jesus cares for our bodies and daily needs.
  - 1 Peter 5:7 – “Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.”
- **Wholeness:**
  - The Greek word implies both physical healing and spiritual salvation.
  - Physical healing illustrates the cleansing of the soul from sin.

## Slide 31 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Power Line:**
  - Thousands of wires may hang near a power line, but only the one that touches
    it conducts electricity.
  - Many people "crowd" Jesus by simply knowing about Him.
  - **Application:** It is the specific touch of personal faith that draws the
    power of blessing into the life.
