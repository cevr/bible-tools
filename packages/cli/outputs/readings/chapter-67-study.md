# Reading 67: Elijah the Prophet

## Introduction

The prophecy of Malachi 4:5—"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord"—stands as one of Scripture's most significant promises concerning the preparation of God's people before Christ's return. This study traces the Elijah message from its partial fulfillment in John the Baptist to its complete fulfillment in the remnant church, revealing God's consistent method of calling His people to decisive commitment before pivotal moments in salvation history.

## Core Truths

### The Promise of Elijah's Coming

God declared through Malachi that before "the great and dreadful day of the Lord," He would send Elijah the prophet (Malachi 4:5). This prophecy carried profound significance for Israel, as Elijah had never died but was translated to heaven (2 Kings 2:11).

> _"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse."_ (Malachi 4:5–6)

**Elijah**: A ninth-century BC prophet whose name means "My God is Yahweh"—a fitting declaration for one who called Israel to choose between the true God and false worship (1 Kings 18:21).

[DYK🔎] Elijah is one of only two men recorded in Scripture who never experienced death—the other being Enoch (Genesis 5:24). Both appeared with Christ at the transfiguration (Matthew 17:3), representing those who will be translated at Christ's second coming and those who will be raised from the dead.

### John the Baptist: A Partial Fulfillment

Jesus Himself identified John the Baptist as the Elijah promised in Malachi's prophecy:

> _"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come."_ (Matthew 11:13–14)

Yet when John was directly asked, "Art thou Elias?" he answered plainly, "I am not" (John 1:21).

[Q] **"How can Jesus say John was Elijah when John himself denied it?"**

This apparent contradiction dissolves when we understand the nature of prophetic fulfillment. John was not the literal, resurrected Elijah—he rightly denied being that person. Rather, as the angel Gabriel explained to Zacharias, John would go before Christ "in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord" (Luke 1:17).

The "Elijah message" is not about a single individual but about a specific work: calling God's people to decisive commitment and preparing them for a divine visitation.

## Deeper Truths

### The Elijah Spirit and Work

What characterized Elijah's ministry? At Mount Carmel, facing a backslidden nation, Elijah delivered a piercing challenge:

> _"How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him."_ (1 Kings 18:21)

**The Elijah message** is always:

- A call to decision—no more halting between opinions
- A return to the worship of the true God
- A rejection of false religious systems
- A preparation for divine intervention

[ILL] Consider a compass needle that wavers between north and south, never settling on true direction. Such a compass is useless to the traveler. Israel had become like that wavering needle—professing allegiance to Jehovah while practicing the customs of Baal. Elijah's message demanded they fix their direction once for all. So today, God calls His people to settle the great questions of truth and allegiance before the final crisis.

### The Cost of the Elijah Message

Those who bear the Elijah message face opposition. Ahab accused Elijah of troubling Israel (1 Kings 18:17), when in reality it was Ahab's apostasy that brought divine judgments upon the land. Jezebel threatened Elijah's life, forcing him to flee (1 Kings 19:2–3).

Even the great prophet experienced profound discouragement:

> _"It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers."_ (1 Kings 19:4)

[DYK🔎] God's response to Elijah's despair was remarkably tender—not rebuke, but rest, food, and the gentle revelation of His presence in the "still small voice" (1 Kings 19:12). God also revealed that Elijah was not alone: seven thousand in Israel had not bowed to Baal (1 Kings 19:18). Those who bear the unpopular truths of God's word may feel isolated, but they are never alone.

### The Day of the Lord Still Future

The "great and dreadful day of the Lord" prophesied by Malachi was still future in Peter's time:

> _"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise."_ (2 Peter 3:10)

Joel's prophecy adds further detail—cosmic signs would precede that terrible day:

> _"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come."_ (Joel 2:31)

Since John the Baptist's work preceded only Christ's first advent, and the "great and dreadful day" refers to Christ's second coming in glory, the Elijah prophecy must have a **final, complete fulfillment** in the last days.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Final Elijah Message: The Three Angels

The complete fulfillment of the Elijah prophecy is found in the three angels' messages of Revelation 14:6–12. Like Elijah on Mount Carmel, these messages call the world to decisive choice:

> _"If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:9–12)

The Elijah message and the third angel's message share identical characteristics:

| Elijah's Message                       | Third Angel's Message                               |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Called Israel from Baal worship        | Calls world from beast worship                      |
| Demanded allegiance to the true God    | Proclaims "fear God, and give glory to him"         |
| Preceded divine judgment on Carmel     | Precedes "the great and dreadful day"               |
| Resulted in persecution from Jezebel   | Results in persecution from the beast power         |
| Identified God's loyal remnant (7,000) | Identifies those who "keep the commandments of God" |

[Q] **"Isn't it presumptuous to claim that any modern movement fulfills ancient prophecy?"**

The question is not whether a movement claims to fulfill prophecy, but whether its message and mission align with Scripture's clear description. The final Elijah message must: (1) come before Christ's second advent, (2) call people to worship the Creator, (3) warn against false worship systems, and (4) prepare a people who keep God's commandments and have the faith of Jesus. Any movement meeting these criteria is doing the Elijah work, regardless of what it claims about itself.

### Opposition and Victory

Those who bear this final message will face the same hostility Elijah experienced:

> _"And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."_ (Revelation 12:17)

The persecution will intensify to life-and-death severity:

> _"And cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed."_ (Revelation 13:15)

Yet God's promise of deliverance shines through:

> _"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God."_ (Revelation 15:2)

[DYK🔎] The "sea of glass mingled with fire" represents both the trials through which the overcomers passed (fire) and their purified, transparent character (glass)—reflecting perfectly the glory of God. These are those who, like Elijah, stood firm in a time of universal apostasy.

### Sanctuary Connection

Elijah's ministry on Mount Carmel powerfully illustrates the sanctuary truth. He rebuilt the broken altar of the Lord (1 Kings 18:30–32)—representing the restoration of true worship. He offered sacrifice—pointing to Christ's atoning death. Fire fell from heaven consuming the sacrifice—symbolizing God's acceptance of the repentant sinner through Christ.

In the final days, the Elijah message calls attention to the heavenly sanctuary where Christ ministers as High Priest. The third angel's message proclaims that "the hour of his judgment is come" (Revelation 14:7)—a direct reference to the investigative judgment proceeding in the Most Holy Place since 1844.

Just as Elijah called Israel back to the true altar, the final Elijah message calls the world back to worship "him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters" (Revelation 14:7)—language drawn directly from the fourth commandment concerning the Sabbath (Exodus 20:11).

## Practical Application

### What the Elijah Message Demands of Us Today

**1. No More Halting Between Opinions**

The spirit of Carmel demands decision. We cannot serve God and mammon (Matthew 6:24). Every compromise with worldliness, every divided loyalty, every postponed commitment weakens the soul for the final crisis. Now is the time to settle, by God's grace, that we will follow the Lord wholly.

**2. Willingness to Stand Alone**

Elijah felt utterly alone—yet he stood. The remnant will often feel like a despised minority. We must draw our courage not from numbers but from God's presence and His promises.

**3. Keeping the Commandments Through Faith**

The identifying mark of those who bear the Elijah message is that they "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12). This is not legalism—it is the fruit of genuine faith. Through the indwelling Christ, believers may have power to obey God's law from the heart.

[ILL] A young tree bends easily with every wind, but a mature oak stands firm through the storm—not by rigid self-effort but because its roots go deep into the soil. So the Christian who has sunk deep roots into Christ through daily communion with His word and Spirit will stand when others fall. The commandment-keeping of the remnant is not white-knuckled self-control; it is the natural outgrowth of a life rooted in Jesus.

**4. Courage in Persecution**

When accused of troubling Israel, Elijah unflinchingly redirected the charge to where it belonged—upon those who had forsaken God's commandments (1 Kings 18:18). We must not be intimidated by false accusations. The charge that commandment-keepers are divisive or extreme will intensify. Our response must be, with Elijah, to point to the true cause of trouble: departure from God's word.

**5. Trust in God's Deliverance**

Elijah was taken to heaven without seeing death. Those who live through the final crisis, faithfully bearing the Elijah message, will likewise be translated at Christ's return:

> _"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."_ (Matthew 24:31)

## Appeal

> _"How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him."_ (1 Kings 18:21)

The prophecy of Elijah's coming is meeting its final fulfillment in our day. The three angels' messages are sounding. The hour of God's judgment has come. Soon the "great and dreadful day of the Lord" will break upon a sleeping world.

Will you be among those who bear the spirit and power of Elijah in this final hour? Will you take your stand—however unpopular, however costly—with those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus?

The same God who sustained Elijah through persecution, who sent fire from heaven to vindicate His truth, who translated His faithful servant to glory without seeing death, promises to be with His remnant people unto the end.

Choose today. Fix your compass on eternal truth. Let the wavering cease. The Lord is God—follow Him.
