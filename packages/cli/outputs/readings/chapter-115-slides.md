## Slide 1 – Q1: The Family of God

- **Question:** Of what family does Paul speak in Ephesians 3:14, 15?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 3:14, 15 – “For this cause I bow my knees unto the
  Father of our lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth
  is named.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Unity and Breach)

- **A United Family:** Paul describes a single family that includes both
  unfallen beings in heaven and believers on earth.
- **The Breach:** Originally, all creation was united in obedience to the
  Creator. Sin caused a separation between the earthly family and the heavenly
  family.
- **The Atonement:** Through Jesus Christ, this breach is healed.
- **The Bond:** The family is held together by the character of God—His law of
  love.
- **Reunion:** The work of redemption is specifically to bring earthly children
  back into harmony with the heavenly family (Colossians 1:20 – “And, having
  made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto
  himself...”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Family Across the Ocean:**
  - Imagine a large family separated by a vast ocean.
  - Those on one side (heaven) have never rebelled.
  - Those on the other side (earth) ran away and fell into trouble.
  - **Christ as the Elder Brother:** He builds the bridge (the Cross) to bring
    the runaways back home.
  - **Result:** The "whole family" is restored to one household.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Called Sons of God

- **Question:** By what name are the members of this family called?
- **Key Text:** Job 1:6 – “Now there was a day when the sons of God came to
  present themselves before the Lord.”
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:1 – “Behold what manner of love the Father hath
  bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Adoption and Status

- **Shared Title:** Both unfallen angels and redeemed humans share the dignified
  title "sons of God."
- **Angels:** They are sons by creation; they have never lost their standing or
  holiness.
- **Believers:** We are sons by **adoption** and re-creation.
  - **Adoption Defined:** The legal act where God receives a repentant sinner as
    His own child, granting full rights to the inheritance of Christ (Galatians
    4:4–7 – “...God sent forth his Son... To redeem them that were under the
    law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.”).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **A Gift Bestowed:** We do not earn the right to be called children of God; it
  is "bestowed" upon us by grace.
- **Imputed Righteousness:** When we accept Christ, His righteousness is
  credited to our account, giving us the _title_ to heaven.
- **Imparted Righteousness:** As we walk with Him, His righteousness is worked
  into our character (Romans 8:14 – “For as many as are led by the Spirit of
  God, they are the sons of God.”).
- This fits us for the "family likeness."

## Slide 7 – Q3: Known as Angels

- **Question:** By what name are they known to us?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 5:11 – “And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many
  angels round about the throne.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Nature and Office)

- **Meaning of the Name:** The word "angel" (Greek _angelos_) means "messenger."
- **Office vs. Nature:** The name describes their work (ministry) rather than
  their biological nature.
- **Their Work:** They act as God's ministers, carrying His light, warnings, and
  protection to the universe.
- **Their Nature:** They are spiritual beings with higher power and intelligence
  than humanity in its current state (2 Peter 2:11 – “Whereas angels, which are
  greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before
  the Lord.”).

## Slide 9 – Q4: Pre-existence of Angels

- **Question:** Did angels exist before the death of any of the human family?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 3:24 – “So He drove out the man: and He placed at the
  east of the garden of Eden cherubim.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points (Theology of Death)

- **Pre-existence:** Angels were active before the first human (Abel) died.
- **Not Spirits of the Dead:** Since they existed before human death, angels
  cannot be the "spirits of the deceased" as popular culture suggests.
- **Guardians of Holiness:** The Cherubim guarded the Tree of Life to ensure sin
  would not be immortalized.
- **State of the Dead:** The Bible teaches that the dead sleep until
  resurrection (Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die: but
  the dead know not any thing...”), while angels are a distinct order of
  creation.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Witnesses of Creation

- **Question:** Who witnessed the laying of the foundations of the earth?
- **Key Text:** Job 38:6, 7 – “Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?
  or who laid the corner stone thereof; when the morning stars sang together,
  and all the sons of God shouted for joy?”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points (Creation Joy)

- **Morning Stars:** These represent the angels who witnessed the creation of
  our world.
- **Active Participation:** They did not just watch; they "shouted for joy" at
  the manifestation of God's wisdom.
- **Harmony:** Before sin, the universe was in perfect harmony.
- **Future Hope:** The song of creation will be echoed by the song of the
  redeemed when the earth is made new.

## Slide 13 – Q6: Number of Angels

- **Question:** How many of these beings did John see around the throne?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 5:11 – “And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many
  angels round about the throne, and the beasts and the elders; and the number
  of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points (The Heavenly Sanctuary)

- **Sanctuary Setting:** This scene occurs in the heavenly sanctuary, the center
  of God's government.
- **Incalculable Number:** The Greek term for "ten thousand" is a _myriad_. The
  text essentially says "myriads of myriads"—a number beyond easy comprehension.
- **United Praise:** The entire host is gathered to praise the Lamb (Christ),
  showing their deep interest in His work of redemption.

## Slide 15 – Q7: The Innumerable Company

- **Question:** What does Paul say of their number?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 12:22 – “But ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the
  city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company
  of angels.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points (Comfort)

- **An Innumerable Army:** We are allied with an uncountable force of holy
  beings.
- **Practical Comfort:** Believers should never feel outnumbered by evil. "They
  that be with us are more than they that be with them" (2 Kings 6:16).
- **Spiritual Communion:** Through faith, we are currently connected to this
  vast assembly in the heavenly Jerusalem.

## Slide 17 – Q8: Reality of Angels

- **Question:** What shows that those angels sent to Abraham were real beings?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 18:8 – “And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which
  he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree,
  and they did eat.”

## Slide 18 – Q8: Key Points (Material Reality)

- **Tangible Beings:** They ate food prepared by Abraham, proving they are not
  ghosts, ideas, or disembodied spirits.
- **Substance:** Though usually invisible to us, they have bodies suited to
  their sphere (1 Corinthians 15:40 – “There are also celestial bodies, and
  bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of
  the terrestrial is another.”).
- **Humility:** Their willingness to eat with humanity foreshadows the communion
  we will have in the kingdom of God.

## Slide 19 – Q9: Work of Angels

- **Question:** What seems to be the principle employment of the angels?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 1:14 – “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth
  to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?”

## Slide 20 – Q9: Key Points (Ministry and Faith)

- **Servants of Mercy:** Though powerful, angels serve us. They do not accept
  worship (Revelation 19:10) but help us worship God.
- **Heirs of Salvation:** Their specific focus is on those who have accepted
  Christ by faith.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - We cannot see the spiritual battles fought for us.
  - Angels strengthen our faith and push back darkness.
  - They cooperate with the Holy Spirit to help us overcome sin.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Royal Guard:**
  - Imagine a wealthy king assigning his strongest elite guards to watch over
    his toddler child.
  - The child is weak and helpless; the guards are strong and skilled.
  - **Application:** Angels are God's "royal guard," assigned to watch over the
    "little ones" of Christ's family as they grow in grace.

## Slide 22 – Q10: Protection

- **Question:** How do they minister to God's people?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 34:7 – “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them
  that fear Him, and delivereth them.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points (Encamping)

- **Spiritual Perimeter:** Angels "encamp" around believers, setting up a
  defensive line.
- **Condition:** The promise is for those who "fear Him" (respect God, reverence
  His law, and trust His mercy).
- **Deliverance:**
  - Physical protection (preserving life).
  - Spiritual protection (shielding the mind from Satan’s overwhelming power so
    we have freedom to choose Christ).

## Slide 24 – Q11: Examples of Ministry

- **Question:** Give examples of their ministrations.
- **Key Text:** Daniel 6:22 – “My God hath sent His angel, and hath shut the
  lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before Him innocency
  was found in me.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points (Concrete Examples)

- **Daniel:** An angel physically shut the mouths of hungry lions.
- **Elisha:** An invisible army of fiery chariots protected him from the Syrians
  (2 Kings 6:17).
- **Peter:** An angel broke his chains and led him out of prison (Acts 12:7-10).
- **Innocency and Sanctification:** Daniel noted that "innocency was found in
  me." His faith led to a life of obedience, and God honored that trust with
  deliverance.

## Slide 26 – Q12: The Fiery Furnace

- **Question:** When Nebuchadnezzar commanded all his subjects to worship the
  golden image... how were they protected from the ravages of the fire?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 3:25 – “I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the
  fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the son of
  God.”
- **Key Text:** Daniel 3:28 – “Blessed be the God... who hath sent His angel,
  and delivered His servants that trusted in Him...”

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points (Presence and Victory)

- **Presence of Christ:** They were protected by the pre-incarnate "Son of God"
  walking with them.
- **Loyalty to Law:** They refused to break the Second Commandment (idolatry),
  trusting God completely.
- **End-Time Parallel:** When false worship is enforced in the last days
  (Revelation 13), God’s presence will preserve His people through persecution.

## Slide 28 – Q12: Illustration

- **Gold in the Fire:**
  - Gold is put into the fire not to be destroyed, but to be purified.
  - The fire only consumed the ropes that bound the Hebrews; their bodies and
    clothes were untouched.
  - **Lesson:** God allows trials to burn away our "bonds" of selfishness and
    sin, while His presence keeps us safe.

## Slide 29 – Q13: Strengthening Elijah

- **Question:** When Elijah was to take his forty days' journey... how was he
  strengthened for the task?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 19:7, 8 – “And the angel of the Lord came again the
  second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is
  too great for thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the
  strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of
  God.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points (Sustaining Grace)

- **Tender Care:** Elijah was discouraged. The angel ministered to his physical
  needs before addressing his spiritual needs.
- **Miraculous Strength:** One meal sustained him for forty days.
- **Spiritual Application:** We have a journey "too great" for human
  strength—the path to heaven. We must feed on the "bread of life" (Jesus) to
  find strength to walk.

## Slide 31 – Q14: Interest in Salvation

- **Question:** What interest do angels have in the plan of salvation?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:12 – “Which things the angels desire to look into.”

## Slide 32 – Q14: Key Points (The Mystery of Love)

- **Studious Interest:** Angels, who never sinned, marvel at the cost God paid
  to save rebels.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the golden cherubim on the Ark looked down
    reverently at the mercy seat (Exodus 25:20).
  - This symbolizes the angelic host studying the atonement—how God can be just
    (law) and the justifier (grace) of the believer (Romans 3:26).

## Slide 33 – Q15: Individual Joy

- **Question:** Are they interested in individual cases?
- **Key Text:** Luke 15:10 – “Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the
  presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Key Points (Repentance)

- **Heaven's Emotion:** God and angels are emotionally invested in our
  salvation; a single conversion creates a celebration.
- **Repentance Defined:** It is not just saying "sorry." It is a genuine change
  of mind and heart, turning away from sin toward God (Acts 3:19).
- **Reformation:** True repentance leads to a reformed life.

## Slide 35 – Q16: Witnessing Vows

- **Question:** Before whom are we said to speak when excusing ourselves from a
  vow?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 5:5, 6 – “Better is it that thou shouldest not vow,
  than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy
  flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error...”

## Slide 36 – Q16: Key Points (The Recording Angel)

- **The Angel as Witness:** Angels are present, listening to our words and
  witnessing our promises to God.
- **Records:** Scripture indicates our words and actions are recorded in heaven.
- **Practical Holiness:** Knowing a holy watcher is present should lead us to be
  careful with our speech and faithful to our commitments.

## Slide 37 – Q17: Accountability

- **Question:** For what must men give account in the judgment?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 12:36 – “But I say unto you, That every idle word that
  men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”

## Slide 38 – Q17: Key Points (Standard of Judgment)

- **High Standard:** God's judgment reaches beyond actions to words and
  thoughts.
- **The Heart Condition:** "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
  speaketh" (Matthew 12:34).
- **Need for Sanctification:** We cannot merely control the tongue; we need a
  new heart created by the Holy Spirit.
- **Cleansing:** Only Christ's blood can wash the record, and only His Spirit
  can sanctify our speech.

## Slide 39 – Q18: The Books

- **Question:** From what will they be judged?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:12 – “And I saw the dead, small and great, stand
  before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is
  the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were
  written in the books, according to their works.”

## Slide 40 – Q18: Key Points (Investigative Judgment)

- **The Books:**
  - **Book of Life:** Contains names of those who accepted God's service.
  - **Books of Deeds:** Contain the record of life (good and evil).
- **Judgment by Works:** We are saved by grace (faith), but judged by works.
- **Why Works?** Works are the visible evidence of whether faith was genuine
  (James 2:17). A profession without a transformed life is of no value.
- **Investigative Judgment:** God reviews the records to determine who has
  retained faith in Christ.

## Slide 41 – Q19: Recorded Actions

- **Question:** Are the actions of men recorded?
- **Key Text:** Malachi 3:16 – “And the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book
  of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that
  thought upon His name.”

## Slide 42 – Q19: Key Points (Remembrance)

- **Book of Remembrance:** God records the faithfulness, tears, and struggles of
  His people. He does not forget our labor of love.
- **Record of Sins:** Iniquity is also marked (Jeremiah 2:22).
- **The Solution:** The dark record of sin must be "blotted out" through the
  blood of Jesus in the judgment (Acts 3:19).

## Slide 43 – Q20: Angels in Court

- **Question:** When the judgment books are opened, will the angels be present
  to minister before God?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:10 – “A fiery stream issued and came forth from before
  Him; thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten
  thousand stood before Him; the judgment was set, and the books were opened.”

## Slide 44 – Q20: Key Points (The Courtroom)

- **The Scene:** The Ancient of Days (the Father) takes His seat as Judge.
- **Angelic Ministers:** Millions of angels attend this event.
- **Witnesses:** The universe watches God's justice. Angels act as witnesses to
  the fairness of God's decisions regarding every soul.

## Slide 45 – Q21: The Overcomer's Reward

- **Question:** What will be done for those whose record shows them to have been
  overcomers?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 3:5 – “He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed
  in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life,
  but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.”

## Slide 46 – Q21: Key Points (Victory and Righteousness)

- **Clothed in White:** Represents the righteousness of Christ—perfect purity.
  This is the "wedding garment."
- **Name Retained:** Their name remains in the Book of Life; their sins are
  blotted out.
- **Confessed by Jesus:** Our High Priest claims us as His own before the
  Father.
- **The Overcomer:** One who, through the power of Christ, gains victory over
  the world, the flesh, and sin. "This is the victory... even our faith" (1 John
  5:4).

## Slide 47 – Q22: The Second Coming

- **Question:** When that work is done, and the Saviour comes to gather those
  who have been accounted His, who will come with Him?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 16:27 – “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of
  His Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every man according to
  his works.”

## Slide 48 – Q22: Key Points (Glory)

- **The Return:** Christ returns not in humility, but in the combined glory of
  the Father, Himself, and the holy angels (Luke 9:26).
- **The Escort:** The sky will be filled with the shining hosts, making the
  Second Coming the most visible event in history.

## Slide 49 – Q23: Gathering the Elect

- **Question:** What part will they act at this time?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:31 – “And He shall send His angels with a great sound
  of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds,
  from one end of heaven to the other.”

## Slide 50 – Q23: Key Points (Reapers)

- **The Harvest:** The angels act as the reapers.
- **Gathering the Family:**
  - The angels who watched over us and recorded our lives now personally escort
    us to Jesus.
  - The "ministering spirits" finish their work by bringing the "heirs of
    salvation" home.

## Slide 51 – Q24: Going Home

- **Question:** Where will the saints go?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:17 – “Then we which are alive and remain shall
  be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air;
  and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”

## Slide 52 – Q24: Key Points (Reunion)

- **Ascension:** We are "caught up" to the Father's house (John 14:1–3).
- **Reunion:**
  - The family of earth is reunited (living and resurrected saints).
  - The earthly family is united with the heavenly family.

## Slide 53 – Q25: The Shout of Triumph

- **Question:** What shout of triumph will they raise as they come out of their
  graves?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:55 – “O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
  where is thy victory?”

## Slide 54 – Q25: Key Points (Victory)

- **Challenge to Death:** The resurrected saints mock death, which once held
  them.
- **Victory over Sin:** Death is the result of sin. By conquering sin through
  Christ, the sting is removed. The grave cannot hold God's people.

## Slide 55 – Q26: The Final Song

- **Question:** What will be the final song of victory?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 15:3 – “And they sing the song of Moses the servant
  of God, and the song of the Lamb, Saying, Great and marvelous are Thy works,
  Lord God Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints.”

## Slide 56 – Q26: Key Points (Moses and the Lamb)

- **Song of Moses:** Represents deliverance and obedience (Exodus 15).
- **Song of the Lamb:** Represents redemption through the blood of Jesus.
- **Harmony of Law and Gospel:** The final song combines the experience of
  obedience with the glory of grace.
- **A Unique Song:** It is a song of experience that angels cannot sing—the song
  of those washed from sin.

## Slide 57 – Q26: Illustration

- **The Great Orchestra:**
  - In an orchestra, many instruments play the harmony.
  - In the final victory song, the angels provide the harmony.
  - **The Melody:** The redeemed of earth sing the melody—a song of grace that
    tells the universe, "I was lost, but Jesus found me; I was dead, but now I
    live."
