# Bible Study: The Two Families

## Introduction

Scripture reveals a profound truth: every human being belongs to one of two spiritual families. While earthly homes reflect God's ideal of love, mutual honor, and godly instruction, these visible families are shadows of a deeper reality—the family of God and the family of the adversary. Understanding which family we belong to, and how membership is determined, is essential knowledge for every soul seeking eternal life.

## Core Truths

### The Earthly Home as Divine Pattern

God designed the human family to reflect heavenly principles. The wise mother speaks with kindness, binding hearts together through gracious words (Proverbs 31:26). Children and husbands respond with praise and honor (Proverbs 31:28, 31). This mutual appreciation creates an atmosphere where love flourishes.

> _"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."_ (Ephesians 6:1–4)

Notice the beautiful reciprocity: children honor parents, while parents nurture rather than provoke. This mutual obligation mirrors the relationship God desires with His children—obedience flowing from love, guidance given in tenderness.

[DYK🔎] The command to honor parents is the only one of the Ten Commandments that includes a specific promise of blessing. Paul calls it "the first commandment with promise"—suggesting that right relationships in the home are foundational to all other spiritual blessings.

### Two Spiritual Families Revealed

Beyond earthly households, Scripture identifies two universal families divided not by bloodline, but by spiritual allegiance:

> _"The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one."_ (Matthew 13:38)

> _"In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil."_ (1 John 3:10)

Every soul born into this world becomes, through the great controversy, a participant in one of these two families. There is no neutral ground.

### How Each Family Is Identified

**The children of God are known by:**

- Not committing sin: _"Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin"_ (1 John 3:9)
- Keeping God's commandments from love: _"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me"_ (John 14:21)

**The children of the wicked one are known by:**

- Practicing sin: _"He that committeth sin is of the devil"_ (1 John 3:8)
- Fulfilling Satan's desires: _"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do"_ (John 8:44)

[Q] **"But doesn't everyone sin? How can anyone be called a child of God if sinlessness is the standard?"**

The Greek text of 1 John 3:9 describes habitual, continuous action—"does not practice sin" or "does not go on sinning." The child of God has experienced a new birth that fundamentally changes their relationship to sin. Though they may stumble, sin is no longer their chosen master or habitual practice. They hate what they once loved, and love what they once hated. When they fall, they do not remain fallen but turn immediately to their Advocate (1 John 2:1). The direction of their life is toward God, not toward sin.

## Deeper Truths

### The Danger of Counterfeit Christianity

Scripture warns of those who appear to belong to God's family but are imposters:

> _"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof."_ (2 Timothy 3:5)

> _"They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."_ (Titus 1:16)

A "form of godliness" suggests religious activity without transforming power—church attendance without heart conversion, doctrinal knowledge without experiential obedience, profession without possession.

**The infallible test:** _"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them"_ (Matthew 7:20).

Not words, but works. Not profession, but production. Not claims, but character. The tree is known by its fruit.

[ILL] A farmer once planted two apple trees side by side. Both grew tall, both produced abundant leaves, both appeared healthy. But when autumn came, one bore sweet fruit while the other produced only bitter, worthless apples. No amount of labeling or wishful thinking could change the nature of the fruit. So it is with professed Christians—the harvest of their lives reveals their true parentage.

### Our Natural Condition

Apart from Christ, humanity's condition is sobering:

> _"And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; ...and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."_ (Ephesians 2:1–3)

Notice: "by nature." We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners. We were born into the wrong family through Adam's fall. We need more than reformation—we need regeneration. We need adoption into a new family.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "children of wrath" in Ephesians 2:3 uses the Greek idiom for "deserving of wrath" or "characterized by wrath." It does not mean God is angry at infants, but that humanity as a fallen race stands under the just consequences of sin. Only through the new birth can we become "children of God" instead.

### The Way of Escape

For those who recognize their bondage to the wrong family, Scripture provides clear direction:

> _"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you."_ (James 4:7–8)

Notice the order: **submit** first, **then** resist. Many try to resist the devil in their own strength without first submitting to God—and they fail. Victory comes through surrender. When we submit to God's authority and draw near to Him, He draws near to us with power to overcome.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Family Membership

The sanctuary service illuminates how sinners are transferred from one family to another:

- **At the altar of sacrifice** (the cross), Christ paid the price to redeem us from Satan's family. _"Ye are bought with a price"_ (1 Corinthians 6:20). Justification—we are declared righteous through Christ's blood.

- **In the holy place**, Christ's ongoing ministry sustains our new identity. Through the bread (His Word), the candlestick (His Spirit), and the incense (His intercession), He keeps us in the Father's family. Sanctification—we are being made holy through daily communion.

- **In the most holy place**, the investigative judgment confirms who truly belongs to God's family. Those whose sins are blotted out through Christ's final atonement will stand as loyal members of the heavenly household forever.

### Righteousness by Faith and Family Identity

How does one become a child of God? Not by works, but by faith that works:

> _"But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him."_ (1 John 2:5)

> _"And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us."_ (1 John 3:24)

Notice: keeping His word and commandments is not the **means** of becoming God's child, but the **evidence** of it. The Spirit within produces obedience. Christ's righteousness, received by faith, manifests in faithful living. We do not obey to be saved; we obey because we are saved—and because Christ lives in us.

[Q] **"Isn't this just legalism dressed up in spiritual language?"**

Far from it. Legalism trusts in human effort to earn God's favor. Righteousness by faith trusts wholly in Christ—both for acceptance with God (justification) and for power to live obediently (sanctification). The child of God keeps the commandments not from fear of punishment or hope of reward, but because the law is written on their heart. They obey because they love, and they love because they have been loved (1 John 4:19). The keeping of God's word is the natural fruit of the indwelling Spirit, not human striving.

## Practical Application

### Examining Our Family Membership

This study calls for honest self-examination:

1. **Which family do I belong to?** Not "Which family do I claim?" but "What does my life reveal?" Fruit does not lie.

2. **Do I have the form without the power?** Religious activity means nothing if Christ does not dwell within. Am I merely performing Christianity, or experiencing it?

3. **Am I drawing near to God daily?** Proximity determines influence. The closer we draw to God, the more His character is reproduced in us.

4. **Is my home a reflection of heaven?** Do kindness, honor, and mutual respect characterize my relationships? The earthly family prepares us for the heavenly.

### Steps to Assurance

If you desire certainty of belonging to God's family:

- **Submit fully to God**—hold nothing back from His lordship
- **Resist the devil through Christ's power**—he must flee
- **Draw near through prayer, Scripture, and obedience**—God will draw near to you
- **Look for the fruit of the Spirit**—love, joy, peace, patience (Galatians 5:22–23) confirm your adoption

### The Father's Incredible Love

> _"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God."_ (1 John 3:1)

The word "behold" invites us to stop and marvel. "What manner of love"—what kind, what quality, what origin! That the infinite God should adopt rebels into His own family is a mystery angels desire to understand. We who were "children of wrath" may become children of God—not servants merely, but sons and daughters with full inheritance rights.

## The Final Destiny of Both Families

Scripture reveals the ultimate separation:

> _"For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be."_ (Psalm 37:10)

The children of the wicked one will cease to exist—not tortured eternally, but utterly destroyed. Their place will not be.

But the family of God remains forever:

> _"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever."_ (Revelation 5:13)

One universal family, united in praise, forever secure in the Father's house.

## Appeal

> _"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."_ (Revelation 22:17)

The invitation stands open. The Father longs for you to come home. Whatever family you were born into by nature, you may be born again into the family of God by grace. The Spirit calls, the church calls, and every soul who has heard the good news is commissioned to call others.

Will you come? Will you submit to God today, resist the enemy, and draw near to your heavenly Father? He will draw near to you. He will adopt you as His own. He will write His law upon your heart and place His Spirit within you.

The choice is yours: child of the kingdom, or child of the wicked one. There are only two families, and every soul must belong to one.

_"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."_
