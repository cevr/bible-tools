# Reading 145: Praise and Thanksgiving

## Introduction

God created all things for His pleasure and glory, yet sin has separated humanity from fulfilling this divine purpose. Through Christ, we are restored not only to fellowship with God but to our original calling—to glorify and praise our Creator. This study explores how thanksgiving transforms the Christian experience, connects us to God's power, and prepares us for final victory in the great controversy between good and evil.

## Core Truths

### The Purpose of Creation

All creation exists for one supreme reason: the glory of God.

> _"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."_ (Revelation 4:11)

Every living creature, every star, every blade of grass was designed to reflect the character of the Creator and bring Him joy. Man, made in God's image, was given the highest privilege—to consciously, intelligently, and lovingly return praise to the One who gave him breath.

**Sin's Devastating Effect**: Yet humanity has fallen from this exalted calling.

> _"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."_ (Romans 3:23)

To "come short of the glory of God" means more than breaking rules—it means failing to reflect His character, failing to fulfill the very purpose for which we were made. Sin has bent the soul inward, making self the center rather than God.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "glory" (_doxa_) in Romans 3:23 originally meant "opinion" or "reputation." To fall short of God's glory is to misrepresent His character—to give the universe a false opinion of what God is like. Every act of selfishness, every word of ingratitude, distorts the image of our loving Creator.

### God's Remedy Through Christ

While we were yet enemies, God moved toward us in love:

> _"But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."_ (Romans 5:8)

This is the foundation of all true praise. We do not earn God's favor by our thanksgiving—His love came first, unsolicited, undeserved. It is the _goodness of God_ that leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4), not our own resolve or moral effort.

When we receive Christ, something remarkable happens:

> _"Christ in you, the hope of glory."_ (Colossians 1:27)

The very One who deserves all glory comes to _dwell within_ the believing heart. Now the purpose of creation can be fulfilled—not by human striving, but by Christ living His life through us.

## Deeper Truths

### Grace That Produces Rejoicing

True grace never leaves the soul unchanged. When we access God's grace by faith, the natural response is joy:

> _"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."_ (Romans 5:2)

Notice the progression: **access** → **standing** → **rejoicing**. We do not merely visit grace occasionally; we _stand_ in it as our permanent position. And from that secure standing, praise flows naturally.

[Q] **"But what if I don't feel like praising God? What if my circumstances are difficult?"**

Scripture addresses this directly. We are called to give thanks "always for all things" (Ephesians 5:20) and "in everything" (1 Thessalonians 5:18). This includes trials and disappointments.

Why? Because:

> _"We know that all things work together for good to them that love God."_ (Romans 8:28)

This is not blind optimism or denial of pain. It is faith that sees beyond present circumstances to a God who wastes nothing—who can transform even our darkest moments into instruments of blessing.

### The Power of Praise in Affliction

Consider Paul and Silas, beaten and imprisoned in Philippi:

> _"And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them."_ (Acts 16:25)

At midnight—the darkest hour—with bleeding backs and feet fastened in stocks, they chose to praise. What happened?

> _"And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bands were loosed."_ (Acts 16:26)

God responded to their praise with power. The prison shook, doors flew open, chains fell off—not only from Paul and Silas, but from every prisoner.

[ILL] Imagine a small bird caught in a thunderstorm. It cannot stop the lightning or calm the wind. But it finds a cleft in the rock and there, sheltered, it begins to sing. The storm rages on, but the bird sings because it is safe. So the Christian, though trials press on every side, sings because he is hidden in Christ—the Rock of Ages. And something mysterious happens: the very act of singing strengthens faith and often moves the hand of God.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "sang praises" in Acts 16:25 is _hymneo_—from which we get "hymn." Paul and Silas were literally singing hymns to God in the dungeon. Ancient tradition suggests they may have sung from the Psalms, which Jewish believers knew by heart.

### A Weapon in Spiritual Warfare

One of the most remarkable accounts of praise as spiritual warfare is found in 2 Chronicles 20:1-30. When a vast army came against Judah, King Jehoshaphat called the nation to fasting and prayer. God's response through the prophet was stunning: "The battle is not yours, but God's" (verse 15).

What did Judah do? They appointed singers to go _before_ the army, praising God:

> _"And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, which were come against Judah: and they were smitten."_ (2 Chronicles 20:22)

The enemy destroyed themselves. Judah did not swing a single sword. Their weapon was praise.

[Q] **"How can singing defeat an army? Isn't this just coincidence?"**

From a Great Controversy perspective, praise does something profound in the spiritual realm. Satan cannot endure the atmosphere of genuine worship. When God's people lift their voices in faith-filled praise, they align themselves with heaven's hosts and the power of God is released on their behalf. The battle truly is the Lord's—but praise positions us to receive His deliverance.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Praise Reflects the Character of God

In the great controversy, Satan has charged God with being selfish, arbitrary, and unworthy of worship. Every time a redeemed sinner lifts a grateful heart to God—especially in trial—that lie is refuted before the universe.

> _"Whoso offereth praise glorifieth Me."_ (Psalm 50:23)

Our praise is not merely personal therapy; it is cosmic testimony. We declare before angels and worlds unfallen that God is worthy, His ways are right, and His love is genuine.

### Thanksgiving as Sanctuary Experience

Consider how praise connects to the sanctuary:

- **Outer Court**: We enter through the sacrifice of Christ—recognizing what He has done for us awakens gratitude.
- **Holy Place**: The altar of incense represents the prayers and praises of God's people ascending before Him (Revelation 8:3-4). Our thanksgiving mingles with Christ's intercession.
- **Most Holy Place**: The angels around God's throne cry "Holy, holy, holy" without ceasing (Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 4:8). Those being prepared for translation are learning the anthem of heaven now.

The psalmist understood this progression:

> _"Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise: be thankful unto Him, and bless His name."_ (Psalm 100:4)

Thanksgiving is the gate—the entrance into God's presence. We cannot truly worship without it.

### The Condition of Abiding

Scripture reveals an important condition for remaining in God's household:

> _"But Christ as a son over His own house: whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end."_ (Hebrews 3:6)

We must "hold fast" both **confidence** and **rejoicing**. These are not optional accessories to faith—they are evidence of it. A spirit of chronic complaint and ingratitude is a warning sign that the soul is drifting from its anchor.

[Q] **"Does this mean we can lose our salvation by not being thankful enough?"**

Not that our thanksgiving earns or maintains salvation—but genuine faith _produces_ thanksgiving. A tree is known by its fruit. When gratitude fades, it often signals that trust has weakened. The remedy is not to manufacture false cheerfulness, but to return to the cross, behold Christ afresh, and let His love rekindle the flame.

## Practical Application

### Give Thanks in Everything

> _"In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:18)

This is not a suggestion—it is God's expressed will. Practical steps:

1. **Begin each day with thanksgiving** before requests. Let your first prayers be praise (Psalm 100:4).

2. **Keep a gratitude record**. David wrote many psalms of thanksgiving. Writing focuses the mind and preserves memories of God's faithfulness.

3. **Give thanks even in difficulty**. You need not thank God _for_ the evil, but _in_ the trial—thanking Him that He is present, that He will bring good, that nothing touches you without His permission.

4. **Approach God with thanksgiving**:

> _"Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."_ (Philippians 4:6)

Worry is forbidden; thanksgiving is commanded. The two cannot coexist.

### Praise Publicly and Privately

> _"My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear Him."_ (Psalm 22:25)

Our praise should not be confined to the closet. There is power in corporate thanksgiving:

> _"My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad."_ (Psalm 34:2)

When we testify of God's goodness, others are encouraged. David exemplified this:

> _"Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul."_ (Psalm 66:16)

Do you have a testimony? Share it. Your story of deliverance may be the word someone needs to find hope.

### The Danger of Ingratitude

Scripture solemnly warns what happens when hearts grow thankless:

> _"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."_ (Romans 1:21)

The downward spiral began with **failure to glorify and thank God**. From there came vain imaginations, darkened hearts, and ultimately the moral collapse described in the rest of Romans 1.

Ingratitude is not a minor flaw—it is the seedbed of apostasy. Those who cease to be thankful eventually cease to believe.

## Appeal

> _"O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together."_ (Psalm 34:3)

Dear friend, you were created for glory—God's glory. Sin interrupted that purpose, but Christ has restored it. Will you take up your original calling today?

If trials surround you, lift your voice like Paul and Silas at midnight. If blessings abound, let them drive you to your knees in wonder. If doubts assail, return to the cross and behold the love that died for you while you were yet a sinner.

The will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you is clear: **Give thanks**.

Not because your circumstances deserve it, but because your Savior does. Not because you feel like it, but because He is worthy. Not because the battle is easy, but because the battle is His.

Begin now. Open your lips in praise. Let the song of the redeemed rise from your heart. The prison doors may yet swing open, the chains fall off, and the powers of darkness flee—all because a child of God chose to magnify the Lord.

> _"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven."_ (Matthew 6:10)

In heaven, praise never ceases. May it be so in your heart, today and always.
