# Reading 177: Subjects of the Kingdom

## Introduction

Who are the true citizens of God's kingdom? This profound question has been misunderstood by many, yet Scripture speaks with unmistakable clarity. God's kingdom is not built on heredity, nationality, or religious affiliation, but on faith and overcoming—a spiritual transformation that makes men and women true children of Abraham and heirs of eternal promises. In this study, we will discover what it means to be a genuine Israelite and an overcomer in God's eternal kingdom.

## Core Truths

### The Call to Overcome

God's plan for His children is not merely forgiveness but complete victory over sin. Paul's appeal is direct and urgent:

> _"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."_ (Romans 12:21)

The apostle John identifies precisely what we must conquer:

> _"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world."_ (1 John 2:16)

These three categories—**the lust of the flesh** (bodily appetites), **the lust of the eyes** (covetousness), and **the pride of life** (self-exaltation)—encompass every temptation humanity faces. They are the same three avenues through which Eve was tempted in Eden (Genesis 3:6) and Christ was tempted in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1–11).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "overcome" (nikaō) appears seventeen times in the book of Revelation alone, emphasizing that the final conflict requires a victorious people. The name "Nicholas" comes from this same root, meaning "conqueror of the people."

### The Source of Victory

Can human willpower achieve this victory? Scripture is emphatic:

> _"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."_ (1 John 5:4)

Notice two essential truths here:

1. **The overcomer must be "born of God"**—this is the new birth (John 3:3–5)
2. **The instrument of victory is faith**—not human effort, but trust in Christ

[Q] **"Doesn't this emphasis on overcoming lead to legalism or self-righteousness?"**

Not when rightly understood. The victory is never our achievement but Christ's gift received by faith. We do not overcome _in order to be saved_, but because we _are being saved_. The indwelling Christ produces the victory: _"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me"_ (Philippians 4:13). The branch does not struggle to produce fruit—it simply abides in the vine (John 15:4–5). Our part is to surrender; Christ's part is to conquer through us.

[ILL] Consider a child learning to write. The father places his strong hand over the child's small hand, guiding each stroke of the pen. The child holds the pen, but the father's hand produces the beautiful letters. So it is with overcoming. We hold the will; Christ guides it. The work is accomplished, yet it is the Father's strength that writes His law upon our hearts.

## Deeper Truths

### The Seven Promises to Overcomers

In Revelation chapters 2 and 3, Christ addresses seven churches, and to each He gives a specific promise to "him that overcometh." These are not seven different groups but seven aspects of one complete inheritance:

| Promise                                 | Reference    | Meaning                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Tree of life**                        | Rev. 2:7     | Immortality restored                          |
| **Not hurt of second death**            | Rev. 2:11    | Eternal security                              |
| **Hidden manna and white stone**        | Rev. 2:17    | Intimate communion; new identity              |
| **Power over nations**                  | Rev. 2:26–28 | Authority with Christ                         |
| **White raiment; name in book of life** | Rev. 3:5     | Christ's righteousness; permanent citizenship |
| **Pillar in God's temple**              | Rev. 3:12    | Permanent place; God's name written upon them |
| **Sit with Christ on His throne**       | Rev. 3:21    | Sharing Christ's glory                        |

All seven are summarized in one magnificent promise:

> _"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My son."_ (Revelation 21:7)

[DYK🔎] The "white stone" of Revelation 2:17 likely alludes to the ancient Roman practice of giving a white stone (tessera) as a token of acquittal in court or admission to a banquet. The overcomer receives both—acquittal from guilt and invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

### Who Is the True Israel?

The name "Israel" first belonged to one man—Jacob—after his night of wrestling with the Angel:

> _"Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed."_ (Genesis 32:28)

**Israel** means "prince with God" or "overcomer." Jacob's descendants inherited this name, and to them were given extraordinary privileges:

> _"Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises."_ (Romans 9:4)

But Paul asks a startling question: **Who are the true Israelites?**

> _"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel: neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children... the children of the promise are counted for the seed."_ (Romans 9:6–8)

[Q] **"Doesn't God have a special plan for the Jewish nation in the end times?"**

Scripture teaches that God's covenant promises are fulfilled in spiritual Israel—all who believe in Christ, whether Jew or Gentile. The determining factor is not blood descent but faith:

> _"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."_ (Galatians 3:7)

> _"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."_ (Galatians 3:29)

John the Baptist warned the religious leaders of his day against presuming on their heritage: _"Think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham"_ (Matthew 3:9).

### The Olive Tree Illustration

Paul employs a powerful metaphor in Romans 11. The olive tree represents the true Israel of God—the covenant community. Natural branches (Jews who rejected Christ) were broken off because of unbelief, while wild branches (Gentiles who believed) were grafted in.

> _"And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; boast not against the branches."_ (Romans 11:17–18)

The warning is sobering: _"Be not highminded, but fear: for if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee"_ (Romans 11:20–21).

Yet hope remains for the natural branches:

> _"And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again."_ (Romans 11:23)

The gospel is _"the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek"_ (Romans 1:16). The door remains open to all.

[ILL] Imagine a family business passed down through generations. The heir by birth squanders his inheritance and abandons the enterprise. A faithful employee, adopted into the family, carries on the legacy with diligence and love. Who is the true heir—the one who bears the family name but rejects the family mission, or the one who embraces the family's values and purposes? So it is with spiritual Israel. The true children of Abraham are those who walk in Abraham's faith and obedience.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Character of God's People

Before conversion, the Gentiles were in a pitiable condition:

> _"At that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world."_ (Ephesians 2:12)

But through Christ, _"ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ"_ (Ephesians 2:13). The dividing wall is broken down; Jew and Gentile become one new man in Christ (Ephesians 2:14–15).

God's remnant people in the last days are described with unmistakable clarity:

> _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:12)

Two marks identify the true Israel of the end time:

1. **Commandment-keeping**—loyalty to God's law, including the Sabbath
2. **Faith of Jesus**—not merely faith _in_ Jesus, but the same quality of faith Jesus possessed, worked out in obedient lives

[DYK🔎] The Greek phrase "the faith of Jesus" (pistin Iēsou) in Revelation 14:12 is in the genitive case, indicating the faith that belongs to Jesus Himself—His own faith reproduced in His followers. This connects directly to Galatians 2:20: _"The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God."_

### Sanctuary Connection

The promises to overcomers are deeply rooted in sanctuary imagery:

- **White raiment** (Revelation 3:5) recalls the priestly garments—Christ's righteousness covering the believer
- **Pillar in God's temple** (Revelation 3:12) speaks of permanent standing in the heavenly sanctuary
- **Hidden manna** (Revelation 2:17) points to the pot of manna kept within the ark in the Most Holy Place (Hebrews 9:4)
- **Tree of life** (Revelation 2:7) was originally in Eden's sanctuary-garden, where God walked with man

The overcomer's experience is one of entering by faith into the heavenly sanctuary, standing in Christ's righteousness before the Father, and receiving the verdict of acquittal in the investigative judgment. Those whose names remain in the book of life (Revelation 3:5) are those who have overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony (Revelation 12:11).

## Practical Application

### What Does Overcoming Look Like Today?

1. **Daily surrender**: Each morning, commit your will to Christ. _"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me"_ (Galatians 2:20).

2. **Feed on the Word**: The "hidden manna" is spiritual nourishment from Scripture. _"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God"_ (Matthew 4:4).

3. **Maintain living faith**: Faith is not a one-time decision but a daily dependence. Pray for faith. _"Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief"_ (Mark 9:24).

4. **Resist specific temptations**: Identify your particular battlefield—is it lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, or pride of life? Bring these to Christ specifically, claiming His victory.

5. **Keep the commandments by faith**: God's law reveals His character and our duty. We keep it not to earn salvation but because Christ keeps it in us. _"I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart"_ (Psalm 40:8).

6. **Hold fast your confession**: _"Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for he is faithful that promised"_ (Hebrews 10:23).

### Marks of True Israelites

Ask yourself:

- Am I trusting in religious heritage, church membership, or any human merit? Or am I resting wholly on Christ's righteousness?
- Am I walking in the faith of Abraham—obedient, trusting, forward-looking?
- Am I keeping God's commandments, not as a means of salvation, but as the fruit of a living connection with Christ?

## Appeal

The Holy City has twelve gates bearing the names of the twelve tribes of Israel (Revelation 21:12) and twelve foundations bearing the names of the twelve apostles (Revelation 21:14). Entry requires belonging to the true Israel—not by blood, but by faith.

> _"And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it."_ (Revelation 21:24)

Will you be among them?

The call to overcome is not a burden but an invitation to complete freedom—freedom from the tyranny of sin, freedom to walk with God, freedom to inherit all things. Christ Himself is our example: _"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne"_ (Revelation 3:21).

He overcame. He invites us to share His throne.

Today, will you surrender your will afresh to Christ? Will you trust not in heredity or human effort, but in the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony? Will you take your place among the true Israel of God—the overcomers who keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus?

> _"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My son."_ (Revelation 21:7)

Come, claim your inheritance. Christ has won the victory. By faith, make His victory your own.
