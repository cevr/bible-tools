## Slide 1 – Q1: The Dragon’s War

- Question: What power makes war upon the remnant church, prior to the second
  advent?
- Key Text: Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and
  went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
  God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Power:** The dragon represents Satan working through earthly powers
  (Revelation 12:9).
- **The Target:** The "remnant" is the last remaining portion of God's faithful
  people.
  - Like a remnant of fabric, it must match the original apostolic church in
    doctrine and faith.
- **Identifying Marks:**
  - **Commandment Keeping:** They restore all ten precepts, including the
    Sabbath. This obedience is the fruit of having God’s law written on the
    heart (Hebrews 8:10).
  - **Testimony of Jesus:** Defined as the "spirit of prophecy" (Revelation
    19:10). God guides His final people through the prophetic gift.
- **The Conflict:** Satan is enraged because this group proves God's law can be
  kept through faith in Jesus.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Unconquered Fortress:**
  - Imagine a general who has conquered an entire country, except for one small
    fortress.
  - That fortress refuses to surrender, flies the true king's flag, and keeps
    his laws perfectly.
  - The enemy general will focus all his artillery on that one spot.
- **Application:**
  - Satan focuses his final wrath on the remnant who uphold the Law of God and
    the Faith of Jesus.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Rewards for the Overcomer

- Question: What reward is promised to the overcomer?
- Key Text: Revelation 2:7 – “He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
  saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree
  of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.”
- Additional Text: Revelation 2:17 – “...To him that overcometh will I give to
  eat of the hidden manna...”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Definition of Overcomer:** Not someone free from struggle, but one who gains
  victory over sin, self, and Satan through Christ’s merits.
- **The Rewards:** Restoration of what was lost in Eden.
  - **Tree of Life:** Access to immortality.
  - **Hidden Manna:** Spiritual sustenance and communion.
  - **White Raiment:** Christ’s character acknowledged before the Father
    (Revelation 3:5).
  - **Throne:** Sharing in Christ’s glory (Revelation 3:21).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Victory by Faith:**
  - The promise is to "him that overcometh."
  - This victory is not achieved by human willpower alone.
  - It comes by the "faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).
  - Christ overcame the world (John 16:33), and by faith, His victory becomes
    ours.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Patient and the Physician:**
  - A sick patient cannot cure themselves by "trying hard" to be healthy.
  - They must accept the medicine from the physician.
  - Christ is the Physician; His grace is the medicine.
  - The "overcomer" is the patient who trusts the Physician enough to take the
    medicine until the cure is complete.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Source of Victory

- Question: Through whom are we able to conquer?
- Key Text: Romans 8:37 – “Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors
  through Him that loved us.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **"More than Conquerors":** We are "super-victors."
  - Earthly conquerors may win battles but suffer great loss.
  - Christians conquer without losing anything of eternal value.
- **Union with Christ:**
  - **Justification:** We are motivated by His love demonstrated at the Cross.
  - **Sanctification:** We are empowered by His life imparted by the Spirit.
- **The Battle Position:**
  - An earthly soldier fights to _gain_ victory.
  - A Christian fights _from_ a position of victory already won by Christ.
  - When we claim Christ’s power over habit or sin, we use a power that has
    never lost a battle.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Child in the Forest:**
  - A small child walking through a dangerous forest is safe, not because of
    their own muscles, but because they hold their father's hand.
  - The child is "more than a conqueror" over the wolves because the father's
    strength is counted as the child's safety.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Invisible Leader

- Question: Who was the invisible leader of the army of Israel?
- Key Text: Joshua 5:14 – “And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the
  Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship,
  and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?”
- Key Text: 1 Corinthians 10:4 – “And did all drink the same spiritual drink:
  for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was
  Christ.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Captain:** The leader was Christ in His pre-incarnate form.
  - Joshua worshipped Him, recognizing His divinity.
- **"Nay":** The Captain was not merely on "Joshua's side." We must be on God's
  side.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Just as Christ led Israel to Canaan, He leads the Church to the heavenly
    Canaan.
  - He is our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary and our King in the battle
    against sin.
  - We follow the Commander; we do not fight alone.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Orchestra Conductor:**
  - In an orchestra, every musician watches the conductor.
  - If they play their own tune, there is chaos. If they follow the conductor,
    there is harmony.
  - Christ is the Conductor; our victory comes from keeping our eyes fixed on
    Him (Hebrews 12:2).

## Slide 14 – Q5: Spiritual Weapons

- Question: With what weapons is the Christian warfare conducted?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 10:4 – “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
  but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points

- **Carnal Weapons:** Fleshly methods like force, political manipulation, anger,
  debate, or mere human willpower.
- **Mighty through God:** Spiritual weapons like prayer, the Word of God, faith,
  and love.
- **Pulling Down Strongholds:**
  - Ancient strongholds were fortified castles.
  - Spiritual strongholds are deep-seated habits, prejudices, or false doctrines
    entrenched in the mind.
- **Application:** We cannot overcome Satan with human resolutions. We need the
  Divine power to blast away the citadels of self-love.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **Light vs. Darkness:**
  - You cannot fight a tank with a slingshot.
  - You cannot fight darkness with a sword.
  - To defeat darkness, you simply turn on the light.
  - We defeat spiritual darkness by turning on the light of God’s Word.

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Battle of the Mind

- Question: What are these weapons able to conquer?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 10:5 – “Casting down imaginations, and every high
  thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into
  captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **Internal Warfare:** The battle is primarily for the mind.
- **Imaginations:** Human reasoning and philosophies that contradict Scripture.
- **Every High Thing:** Pride and self-sufficiency that refuses to bow to God’s
  law.
- **Captivity of Thought:**
  - True sanctification touches the thoughts and motives, not just outward
    actions.
  - This is the "expulsive power of a new affection."
  - When we love Christ supremely, temptations are submitted to Him and taken
    captive.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Gardener:**
  - A gardener does not just cut the tops off the weeds; he must pull them out
    by the roots.
  - "Bringing into captivity every thought" is God's method of pulling up the
    roots of sin.
  - This allows the garden of the heart to bear the fruit of the Spirit.

## Slide 20 – Q7: The Whole Armor

- Question: What are we to put on?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:11 – “Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able
  to stand against the wiles of the Devil.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **The "Whole" Armor:**
  - We cannot leave off any piece.
  - Faith without truth, or gospel without obedience, leaves a fatal opening.
- **Wiles:** Satan uses trickery and deception, often disguising sin as
  harmless.
- **Put on Christ:**
  - It is God’s armor, not ours.
  - This is Righteousness by Faith: we "put on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Romans
    13:14).
  - His character covers and protects the believer.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Deep-Sea Diver:**
  - A diver wears a pressurized suit to survive the crushing weight of the
    ocean.
  - If there is even a small hole in the helmet or boot, the water rushes in.
  - We live in an atmosphere of sin; only the complete covering of Christ can
    protect us.

## Slide 23 – Q8: The Nature of the Enemy

- Question: What is included in the "wiles of the Devil" that one has to meet?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:12 – “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
  against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
  this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points

- **Not Flesh and Blood:**
  - Our enemy is never a human being (neighbor, boss, leader).
  - The enemy is the spiritual force working _behind_ the scenes.
  - We love the person but resist the spirit.
- **Principalities and Powers:** Satan has an organized military structure of
  fallen angels.
- **Divine Aid:** Because the enemy is invisible and supernatural, human
  strength is useless. We rely on the High Priest to send the Holy Spirit.

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **Termites in the Walls:**
  - If a house is attacked by termites, fighting them with a shotgun is useless.
  - The enemy is hidden within the structure.
  - You need a professional who understands the pest.
  - In spiritual warfare, we need Christ, who knows how to defeat the invisible
    enemy.

## Slide 26 – Q9: Belt and Breastplate

- Question: What are the first essentials of the needed armor?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:14 – “Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with
  truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness.”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points

- **Belt of Truth:**
  - Holds everything together.
  - Without a sincere love for truth, religion is loose and ineffective.
- **Breastplate of Righteousness:**
  - Protects the vital organs (heart and lungs).
  - **Imputed Righteousness (Justification):** Christ’s record covering us from
    the law’s accusation.
  - **Imparted Righteousness (Sanctification):** The life of obedience lived by
    the Spirit, protecting the conscience from defilement.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Weightlifter's Belt:**
  - A weightlifter wears a strong belt to support his core.
  - Without it, he risks injury under heavy loads.
  - The Christian wears the belt of Truth to support their character under the
    heavy pressures of life.

## Slide 29 – Q10: The Truth

- Question: What is the truth with which one's loins are to be girded?
- Key Text: John 17:17 – “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points

- **God's Word:** The Bible is the "truth" that sanctifies (makes holy).
- **Transformation:** The Bible is not just history; reading and obeying it
  changes the character.
- **Objective Standard:**
  - In a world of relative truth, the Christian stands on the absolute authority
    of Scripture.
  - The remnant must hold pure doctrines (Law, Sabbath, State of the Dead,
    Sanctuary) to withstand Satan’s errors.

## Slide 31 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Compass:**
  - A compass points north regardless of how the hiker feels.
  - The Word of God is our compass.
  - If we rely on feelings, we are lost. We must be girded with the unchanging
    map of Scripture.

## Slide 32 – Q11: Girding the Mind

- Question: What is meant by having the loins girded?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 1:13 – “Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober,
  and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
  revelation of Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 33 – Q11: Key Points

- **Mental Readiness:**
  - "Girding" means gathering up loose thoughts and focusing the mind on Christ.
  - A "loose" mind is easily distracted by temptation.
- **Sobriety:** Being serious and vigilant, not intoxicated by worldly cares.
- **Action:** We must study Scripture and guard the avenues of the soul (eyes
  and ears) to be ready for the enemy.

## Slide 34 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Runner:**
  - Before a race, a runner ties their shoelaces and tucks in their shirt.
  - They remove anything that might drag or trip them.
  - "Girding the mind" means tucking away doubts and distractions to run the
    race of faith.

## Slide 35 – Q12: The Breastplate of Righteousness

- Question: What is the "righteousness" of which the breastplate is composed?
- Key Text: Psalm 119:172 – “My tongue shall speak of thy word; for all thy
  commandments are righteousness.”

## Slide 36 – Q12: Key Points

- **The Standard:** God’s law is the transcript of His character; conformity to
  it is righteousness.
- **The Source (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - The law defines righteousness but cannot produce it in a sinner.
  - We need **Christ's Righteousness for us** (Justification/Pardon).
  - We need **Christ's Righteousness in us** (Sanctification/Obedience).
- **Protection:** When the law is written in the heart, sin becomes hateful,
  protecting us from temptation.

## Slide 37 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Mirror and the Water:**
  - A mirror can show you that your face is dirty, but it cannot wash your face.
  - The Law is the mirror showing our duty.
  - Christ is the water that cleanses us and the light that fills us.

## Slide 38 – Q13: Gospel Shoes

- Question: With what are the feet to be shod?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:15 – “And your feet shod with the preparation of the
  gospel of peace.”
- Reference: James 3:18.

## Slide 39 – Q13: Key Points

- **Stability:**
  - Roman soldier sandals had hobnails (cleats) to grip the ground.
  - The Gospel gives us sure footing; we have peace with God (Romans 5:1).
- **Readiness:** The Christian is always ready to share the good news.
- **Internal Peace:** In spiritual warfare, peace guards the believer from
  anxiety and fear.

## Slide 40 – Q13: Illustration

- **Boots on Rough Terrain:**
  - Walking barefoot on sharp rocks causes hesitation and pain.
  - Wearing heavy-duty boots allows a person to walk confidently.
  - The Gospel allows us to walk through the "rough terrain" of trials without
    slipping.

## Slide 41 – Q14: Shield of Faith

- Question: What piece of armor is next mentioned as necessary?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:16 – “Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith
  ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.”

## Slide 42 – Q14: Key Points

- **Faith Defined:** Taking God at His word (Hebrews 11:1). Trusting His love
  and power.
- **Fiery Darts:** Specific temptations—doubts, lusts, fears,
  discouragement—meant to inflame the passions.
- **Quenching the Darts:**
  - Faith replies to temptation with Scripture promises.
  - "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith" (1 John
    5:4).
  - We use faith to grasp the victory Christ has already won.

## Slide 43 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Wet Shield:**
  - Ancient shields were often covered in wet leather.
  - When a flaming arrow hit, the moisture extinguished the fire.
  - Faith acts like wet leather: when the spark of temptation hits, it dies
    because the heart trusts in a better promise from God.

## Slide 44 – Q15: Helmet of Salvation

- Question: What is the last and crowning piece of armor to be put on?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:17 – “And take the helmet of salvation.”

## Slide 45 – Q15: Key Points

- **Protecting the Head:** The seat of the intellect and will.
- **Assurance:** The helmet is the "hope of salvation" (1 Thessalonians 5:8).
  - It protects the mind from despair and Satan's accusations.
- **The High Priest:**
  - We look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith.
  - Knowing He intercedes in the Heavenly Sanctuary gives us confidence to "hold
    fast" (Hebrews 10:23).

## Slide 46 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Hard Hat:**
  - A construction worker wears a hard hat because the risk of falling objects
    is always present.
  - The Christian wears the assurance of salvation constantly.
  - When the blow of discouragement falls, the head remains safe.

## Slide 47 – Q16: Sword of the Spirit

- Question: What sword is to be used by the soldier of Christ?
- Key Text: Ephesians 6:17 – “The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
  God.”

## Slide 48 – Q16: Key Points

- **The Offensive Weapon:** Used to cut down lies and defend truth.
- **The Example of Jesus:**
  - In the wilderness temptation, Jesus used "It is written."
  - He relied on the Word, not His own power.
- **The Spirit’s Role:** The Spirit inspired the Word and brings it to our
  remembrance.
- **Sharpness:** It pierces the soul, exposing secret motives and cutting out
  the disease of sin (Hebrews 4:12).

## Slide 49 – Q16: Illustration

- **The Surgeon’s Scalpel:**
  - A surgeon uses a scalpel to cut out a tumor.
  - It is sharp and dangerous, but it saves life.
  - The Word of God cuts our pride and exposes our sin to save us from the
    "cancer" of iniquity.

## Slide 50 – Q17: Loyalty unto Death

- Question: Will there be those in the remnant church who will risk their lives
  in the contest against the enemy?
- Key Text: Revelation 12:11 – “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,
  and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the
  death.”

## Slide 51 – Q17: Key Points

- **Victory by Blood:** Their confidence is in Christ's atonement, not their own
  works.
- **The Witness:** They publicly declare God's truth.
- **Total Surrender:**
  - "Loved not their lives unto the death."
  - A death to self (Galatians 2:20) so complete they would rather die
    physically than disobey God.
  - The faith of the three Hebrews: "Our God is able... but if not, we will not
    serve thy gods" (Daniel 3:17-18).

## Slide 52 – Q17: Illustration

- **The Dead Soldier:**
  - A soldier afraid to die is easily manipulated.
  - A soldier who has already considered himself "dead" to the world cannot be
    threatened.
  - The martyrs broke Satan's power because they feared God more than man.

## Slide 53 – Q18: Final Victory

- Question: Will this commandment keeping company be victorious under Christ,
  their leader?
- Key Text: Revelation 15:2 – “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with
  fire; and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,
  and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass,
  having the harps of God.”

## Slide 54 – Q18: Key Points

- **Total Victory:**
  - They have victory over the beast, image, and mark (false worship and human
    laws).
  - They refused to compromise God's law.
- **The Song of Deliverance:** Like Israel at the Red Sea, they stand on the sea
  of glass.
- **Harps of God:** Symbolizing joy, harmony, and rest.
- **The Promise:** The battle is fierce, but the outcome is decided for those
  who remain in Christ.

## Slide 55 – Q18: Illustration

- **The Finish Line:**
  - When a runner sees the finish line, they find a burst of energy.
  - Revelation 15:2 shows us the finish line: the victors standing on the sea of
    glass.
  - This encourages us to press on, for the glory to come far outweighs present
    suffering (Romans 8:18).
