# Bible Study: Growth in Grace

## Introduction

The Christian life is not static—it is a living, growing journey upward toward God. Peter's final words to believers reveal both the pathway and the promise of spiritual growth: through God's grace and the knowledge of Christ, we may become "partakers of the divine nature" and build a character that will never fall. This study explores how heaven has provided everything needed for our transformation.

## Core Truths

### The Divine Command to Grow

Peter's closing exhortation is not merely suggestion but urgent command: _"But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ"_ (2 Peter 3:18).

The Christian experience must never stagnate. Just as a living plant either grows or withers, so the soul either advances toward God or retreats toward the world. There is no middle ground.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "grow" (auxanō) is the same word used for physical growth in children and plants. Peter deliberately chose language indicating that spiritual growth should be as natural and continuous as biological growth—something that happens when proper nourishment is received.

### The Multiplying Power of Knowledge

_"Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord"_ (2 Peter 1:2).

Notice the pathway: grace and peace come **through knowledge**—not mere intellectual information, but personal, experiential acquaintance with God and Christ. The more intimately we know our Saviour, the more His grace flows into our lives.

**Grace**: God's unmerited favor and transforming power working in us (Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11-12).

**Peace**: The settled assurance of reconciliation with God through Christ (Romans 5:1).

### The Divine Gift: Exceeding Great and Precious Promises

_"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust"_ (2 Peter 1:4).

Heaven has not left us to struggle alone. God has deposited in His Word **promises**—living, powerful pledges backed by the throne of the universe. These promises are:

- **Exceeding great**—adequate for every need
- **Precious**—of infinite value to the believing soul

Their purpose? That we might become **partakers of the divine nature**. The very character of God—His love, His purity, His patience—may be reproduced in human hearts through faith in these promises.

[Q] **"Can sinful human beings really become partakers of God's nature?"**

This is not pantheism or the claim that we become gods. Rather, it means that through Christ dwelling in us by His Spirit, His character traits—love, joy, peace, longsuffering—become genuinely ours. As iron in fire takes on the properties of fire while remaining iron, so the believer united to Christ by faith reflects His character while remaining a creature dependent on the Creator.

## Deeper Truths

### The Ladder of Christian Character

Peter presents what might be called the "ladder of grace"—eight successive graces building upon one another:

_"Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity"_ (2 Peter 1:5-7).

**Faith** stands at the base—the first step Godward. _"He that cometh to God must believe"_ (Hebrews 11:6). But faith alone, without development, is incomplete: _"Faith without works is dead"_ (James 2:20).

**Virtue** (moral excellence, courage)—faith must produce moral strength.

**Knowledge**—not mere information, but practical wisdom in applying truth.

**Temperance** (self-control)—mastery over appetites and passions.

**Patience** (steadfast endurance)—calm perseverance under trial.

**Godliness**—reverent devotion expressing itself in holy living.

**Brotherly kindness** (philadelphia)—tender affection for fellow believers.

**Charity** (agapē love)—unselfish, self-sacrificing love for all.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "add" (epichorēgeō) was used for a wealthy citizen who lavishly funded a theatrical production at his own expense. Peter pictures the believer as lavishly, generously supplying each grace in abundance—not grudgingly, but bountifully—while God provides the power for such giving.

### The Crown of All Graces: Charity

Charity—divine love—stands at the summit of Christian character. Paul describes its nature:

_"Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things"_ (1 Corinthians 13:4-7).

This is **the bond of perfectness** (Colossians 3:14)—the golden thread that binds all other graces together in complete harmony. Where charity reigns, every other virtue finds its proper place.

_"And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins"_ (1 Peter 4:8).

[ILL] Consider how the sun's warmth draws all growing things upward. Without the sun, seeds remain dormant, plants wither, and fruit never ripens. So charity is to the Christian graces—the warming, life-giving principle that causes all other virtues to flourish. Knowledge without love becomes cold criticism. Patience without love becomes mere stoicism. Even faith without love is empty (1 Corinthians 13:2). But when divine love fills the heart, every grace blossoms into its fullest beauty.

### The Warning of Spiritual Blindness

Peter solemnly warns of the condition of one who neglects this growth:

_"But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins"_ (2 Peter 1:9).

The believer who does not grow forward actually moves backward—becoming:

- **Blind**—unable to perceive spiritual realities
- **Short-sighted**—seeing only earthly, temporal things
- **Forgetful**—losing the sense of past deliverance from sin

[Q] **"How can someone who was truly converted forget they were cleansed from sin?"**

Neglected grace leads to deadened conscience. Like a person who has been healed but never exercises their restored limbs, the soul that does not actively grow becomes spiritually atrophied. The memory of conversion fades, the joy of salvation dims, and worldly things reclaim the affections. This is why Peter urges diligent, continuous development.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Righteousness Imparted—Not Merely Imputed

This passage beautifully illustrates the completeness of Christ's saving work. He not only **imputes** righteousness (declares us righteous at justification) but **imparts** righteousness (makes us actually righteous through sanctification).

The "exceeding great and precious promises" are the very means by which Christ's character is formed within us. When we believe God's promises—claiming them personally, acting upon them daily—the Holy Spirit works transformation. This is not human effort earning salvation; it is faith laying hold of divine power.

### Sanctuary Connections

This growth in grace corresponds to the believer's journey through the sanctuary:

- **Faith** begins at the **outer court**—accepting Christ's sacrifice at the cross
- **The developing graces** represent the daily ministry in the **holy place**—feeding on God's Word (showbread), prayer and intercession (incense), the light of the Spirit (candlestick)
- **Charity perfected** prepares us for the final work in the **most holy place**—where God's people are sealed with characters reflecting the divine image

God's purpose in the sanctuary service was always to dwell with His people, to transform them into His likeness. The investigative judgment reveals not merely professed believers but those who have allowed Christ to form His character within them.

### The Great Controversy in Character Development

Satan fell through pride and selfishness; his character is the opposite of love. The development of charity—unselfish love—in human hearts is the final vindication of God's government. When believers, by grace, overcome self and love as Christ loves, they demonstrate that God's law can be kept, that His character can be reproduced, and that Satan's charges against heaven are false.

## Practical Application

### Cultivating the Graces Daily

Growth in grace requires deliberate cooperation with divine power:

1. **Study the promises**—know what God has pledged to do for you
2. **Believe specifically**—apply promises to your particular needs and weaknesses
3. **Act in faith**—step forward trusting God to fulfill His word
4. **Examine progress**—honestly assess where each grace needs strengthening
5. **Seek the Spirit**—only He can produce genuine fruit (Galatians 5:22-23)

### Questions for Self-Examination

- Is my **faith** active, or merely theoretical?
- Am I cultivating **moral courage** to stand for right?
- Do I pursue **practical knowledge** of God's will?
- Have I gained **self-control** over appetite, passion, and temper?
- Can I endure trials with **patience**, without murmuring?
- Does **godliness** characterize my daily devotion and conduct?
- Do I show **brotherly kindness** to fellow believers, even difficult ones?
- Is **unselfish love** the governing principle of my life?

### The Unfailing Promise

_"Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall"_ (2 Peter 1:10).

Here is heaven's guarantee: the believer who diligently cultivates these graces, relying on divine power, **shall never fall**. Not because of personal strength, but because God's promises cannot fail, and those who build upon them are building upon the Rock.

## Appeal

_"For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ"_ (2 Peter 1:11).

Dear friend, heaven has opened a pathway before you—a ladder reaching from earth to glory. The first step is within reach of every willing soul: **faith** in Jesus Christ. And with each step upward—virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, charity—you climb nearer to God's eternal kingdom.

The promises are **exceeding great**. The power is **divine**. The result is **certain** for all who believe.

Will you, today, claim those precious promises? Will you surrender afresh to the transforming grace of Christ? He who began a good work in you will complete it (Philippians 1:6). Lay hold of His strength. Trust His promises. Grow in grace. And one day soon, an abundant entrance will be ministered unto you into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
