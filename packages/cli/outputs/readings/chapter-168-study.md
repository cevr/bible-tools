# Reading 168: Duties of Parents and Children

## Introduction

The family is God's foundational institution—established in Eden before sin entered, and designed to reflect the love, order, and authority found in heaven itself. In an age when family bonds are dissolving and respect for authority is vanishing, Scripture speaks with urgent clarity about the sacred duties binding parents and children together. These are not mere social conventions but divine commands woven into the fabric of God's moral law, with eternal consequences attached.

## Core Truths

### The Fifth Commandment: A Divine Foundation

> _"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee."_ (Exodus 20:12)

This command stands at the hinge point of the Decalogue—connecting our duty to God (commandments 1–4) with our duty to man (commandments 6–10). It is the first commandment with a promise attached (Ephesians 6:2), signaling its profound importance in God's moral economy.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "honour" (_kabad_) literally means "to make heavy" or "to give weight to." It implies treating parents as persons of significance, not lightly dismissing their wisdom, authority, or needs. This honor extends from childhood through adulthood—even caring for aged parents (Proverbs 23:22).

**Obedience is pleasing to God:**

> _"Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."_ (Colossians 3:20)

Here is a remarkable truth: the simple obedience of a child to a godly parent brings delight to the heart of the infinite God. What seems small in human eyes registers in heaven as worship.

### The Sacred Duty of Parents: Teaching God's Word

> _"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."_ (Deuteronomy 6:6, 7)

Notice the divine order: first, God's words must be _in the parent's heart_—not merely memorized, but living and active. Only then can they be transmitted authentically to children. Parents cannot give what they do not possess.

**Instruction should be:**

- **Diligent**—not haphazard or occasional
- **Integrated**—woven into daily life (sitting, walking, lying down, rising up)
- **Relational**—not cold lectures, but living conversation

[ILL] Consider how a master craftsman trains his apprentice. He does not merely hand the young man a book of instructions and walk away. No—he works alongside him, demonstrating each stroke, correcting each error, explaining the _why_ behind every technique. The apprentice learns not only the craft but catches the craftsman's spirit. So God intends parents to train children—not in occasional religious lessons, but in the constant workshop of daily living.

### Training with Wisdom and Correction

> _"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."_ (Proverbs 22:6)

**Training** (_chanak_ in Hebrew) means to dedicate, to inaugurate, to set on a specific path. It implies intentional direction—not leaving the child to find his own way, but actively guiding his steps toward righteousness.

> _"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."_ (Ephesians 6:4)

**Nurture** includes discipline and correction; **admonition** includes verbal instruction and counsel. Both are essential, balanced in love.

[Q] **"Isn't correction outdated or even harmful?"**

Scripture speaks with surprising directness:

> _"Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell."_ (Proverbs 23:13, 14)

> _"He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes."_ (Proverbs 13:24)

These verses shock modern sensibilities, yet their meaning is clear: loving correction—administered wisely, calmly, and age-appropriately—is an act of profound love. Its opposite—permissiveness masquerading as kindness—is actually a form of hatred, for it abandons the child to the destructive consequences of an uncorrected will.

**However, correction must never become cruelty:**

> _"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."_ (Colossians 3:21)

There is a world of difference between correction that trains the conscience and harshness that crushes the spirit. The father who disciplines in rage, inconsistency, or excessive severity does not correct—he _wounds_. Biblical discipline flows from love, aims at restoration, and is administered with self-control.

## Deeper Truths

### God's Approval of Parental Authority

> _"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him."_ (Genesis 18:19)

[DYK🔎] God here reveals the reason He could trust Abraham with the covenant promises: Abraham would _command_ his household. The Hebrew word implies not harsh tyranny but firm, loving leadership that expects obedience. God's covenant purposes flow through families who maintain His order.

This reveals a profound truth: God's work in the world is often advanced or hindered by what happens in the home. The family is not peripheral to God's kingdom—it is foundational.

### The Promise of Fruitful Correction

> _"Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul."_ (Proverbs 29:17)

> _"The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame."_ (Proverbs 29:15)

Two futures are set before every parent:

1. **Faithful correction** → rest, delight, wisdom in the child
2. **Neglect** → shame, sorrow, and a child ruled by folly

[Q] **"But what if I correct my child and they still go astray?"**

The promise of Proverbs 22:6 is a principle, not an absolute guarantee that removes human free will. Parents are responsible for faithful training—God holds each soul accountable for their own choices. Yet the principle stands: godly training creates a deep channel that the Holy Spirit can use throughout a lifetime, even when a child wanders.

### Timing Matters

> _"Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying."_ (Proverbs 19:18)

There is a window of opportunity that can close. A child who has never known loving boundaries becomes an adult who cannot submit to any authority—including God's. Early, consistent correction shapes the will before it hardens in rebellion.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Family as a Reflection of Divine Government

The home is meant to be a miniature heaven on earth—a place where God's principles of love, order, and authority are experienced in daily life. Satan knows this, which is why he targets the family with relentless fury.

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, one central issue is _authority_: Does God have the right to command? Is His law good? Satan's original lie was that God's authority was arbitrary and His law a burden. Every home where loving authority is exercised and cheerful obedience is rendered becomes a living refutation of Satan's charges.

**Children who learn to honor earthly parents are being prepared to honor their heavenly Father.** Conversely, children who despise parental authority often struggle to submit to God.

### A Sign of the Last Days

> _"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy."_ (2 Timothy 3:2)

Disobedience to parents is listed among the characteristic sins of earth's final generation—placed alongside pride, blasphemy, and unholiness. This is no minor failing in God's eyes. The breakdown of family order is a symptom of a society in terminal moral decline.

[DYK🔎] Every culture in history that has experienced major social collapse has first witnessed the disintegration of the family structure. Rome's fall was preceded by generations of family breakdown. God's warning in 2 Timothy is not merely religious—it is civilizational.

### Righteousness by Faith in the Home

How can parents fulfill these high duties? How can children genuinely honor parents they may find difficult? Not by human effort alone.

[ILL] A young tree cannot straighten itself once it has grown crooked. But the gardener, with patient, persistent effort over time, can bind it to a straight stake until it grows true. So the Holy Spirit—when invited daily into the home—binds our wayward hearts to Christ until His character is formed within us. Parents cannot change children's hearts, nor children their own. But Christ can.

> _"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."_ (Philippians 4:13)

The commands to parents and children are not calls to legalistic performance but invitations to dependence on Christ. Only He can give parents wisdom, patience, and consistency. Only He can give children a heart to obey. The home becomes the laboratory where righteousness by faith is tested and proved.

## Practical Application

**For Parents:**

1. **Begin with your own heart.** Are God's words living in you? You cannot impart what you do not possess.
2. **Make instruction intentional and integrated.** Do not relegate spiritual teaching to Sabbath only—weave it into every day.
3. **Correct early, consistently, and lovingly.** Do not discipline in anger. Let correction be followed by explanation and reconciliation.
4. **Guard against harshness.** Your goal is training, not breaking. A discouraged child is not a trained child.
5. **Pray daily for each child by name.** Only God can convert the heart—your role is to cooperate with His work.

**For Children (of any age):**

1. **Honor is lifelong.** Even adult children are called to respect and care for aging parents (Proverbs 23:22).
2. **Obedience is worship.** When you obey your parents in the Lord, you please God Himself.
3. **Forgive imperfect parents.** No earthly parent is perfect. Honor the position even when the person fails.
4. **Learn submission to authority.** The home is training ground for your relationship with God. A heart that rebels against parents will struggle to yield to God.

**For the Elderly:**

> _"Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD."_ (Leviticus 19:32)

Age itself commands respect. A society that discards its elderly has lost reverence for God Himself.

## Appeal

_"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."_ (Ephesians 6:1–3)

Dear friend, whatever your place in the family—parent, child, or both—God calls you to faithfulness in that station. The duties may seem ordinary, even mundane. But heaven watches the home with intense interest. Angels record the patience of a godly mother, the firmness of a loving father, the willing obedience of a child whose heart has been won to Christ.

The world is rushing toward judgment. Families are crumbling on every side. But God is calling out a people who will restore the ancient paths—who will rebuild the family altar, establish loving authority, and train a generation to know and obey the Lord.

Will you, by God's grace, make your home a fortress of faith? Will you commit today to fulfill the sacred duties He has given you?

Christ stands ready to help. He who honored His earthly parents perfectly, He who now intercedes for you in the heavenly sanctuary, offers His own righteousness to cover your failures and His own power to transform your home. Trust Him. Depend on Him. And begin today.
