## Slide 1 – Q1: The Commission to Preach

- Question: To whom is repentance to be preached?
- Key Text: Luke 24:47 – “And that repentance and remission of sins should be
  preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Universal Need)

- **A Universal Need**
  - Since all have sinned, the remedy must be offered to all.
  - The gospel is for the moralist, the pagan, and the backslider alike.
  - Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”
- **In His Name**
  - Repentance is effective only because of who Jesus is and what He has done.
  - Acts 4:12 – “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
    other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”
- **Connection to Remission**
  - God forgives when the sinner turns to Christ.
  - **Remission defined:** The cancellation of a debt or penalty; forgiveness
    through Christ’s payment.
  - Hebrews 9:22 – “And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
    without shedding of blood is no remission.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Universal Antidote**
  - Imagine a deadly plague sweeping through every nation on earth.
  - If a physician possessed the only cure, it would be criminal negligence to
    offer it only to a few villages.
  - **Lesson:** Sin is that universal plague. The gospel of repentance is the
    cure. It must be preached to all nations because the disease is in all
    nations.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Call to Sinners

- Question: Who are called to repentance?
- Key Text: Luke 5:32 – “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
  repentance.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (The Rescue Mission)

- **The Diagnosis**
  - A doctor cannot heal a patient who insists they are well.
  - Those who rely on their own works or heritage shut themselves out from
    grace.
- **The Invitation**
  - The call is specifically for “sinners.”
  - It is for those who acknowledge they have broken God's law and possess a
    fallen nature.
- **The Gift of Repentance**
  - We do not wait until we are "good enough" to come to Christ.
  - Even the ability to repent is a gift from Jesus.
  - Acts 5:31 – “Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
    Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Hospital**
  - A hospital is not a museum for displaying perfect health; it is a place for
    healing the sick.
  - The church is a hospital for sinners.
  - **Lesson:** If a man stays away from the hospital because he is "too sick,"
    he misunderstands its purpose. We come to Christ _because_ we are sinners,
    not because we are holy.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Knowing Our Condition

- Question: How is one to know he is a sinner?
- Key Text: Romans 3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no
  flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Law as Detector)

- **The Detector of Sin**
  - Like a straightedge shows a crooked line, God's law reveals our crooked
    characters.
  - Without the law, we compare ourselves to others and feel false security.
  - 2 Corinthians 10:12 – “For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or
    compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring
    themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not
    wise.”
- **The Definition of Sin**
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
    is the transgression of the law.”
  - To know if we are sinners, we must look into the mirror of the Ten
    Commandments (James 1:23–25).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Mirror**
  - A mirror can show you a dirty spot on your face, but the mirror cannot wash
    it off.
  - You do not wash with the mirror; you wash with water.
  - **Lesson:** The Law is the mirror that reveals our filth; Christ’s blood is
    the fountain that cleanses it. We must not despise the mirror for telling
    the truth.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Universal Sinfulness

- Question: Is this a universal rule?
- Key Text: Romans 3:9 – “What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise:
  for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under
  sin.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **No Favorites**
  - Religious background (Jew) or lack thereof (Gentile) makes no difference
    regarding our nature.
  - Access to truth increases responsibility but does not grant immunity from
    sin.
- **All Under Sin**
  - Humanity is held captive by a power it cannot break on its own.
- **Universal Need for Righteousness**
  - Because all are under sin, no one is justified by their own law-keeping.
  - Romans 3:21–22 – “But now the righteousness of God without the law is
    manifested... Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus
    Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Result of Transgression

- Question: To what is the transgressor of the law subject?
- Key Text: Ephesians 5:6 – “Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because
  of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Wrath and Law)

- **The Reality of Wrath**
  - God's wrath is His settled, holy opposition to evil.
  - Because sin destroys creation, God’s love demands He oppose it.
- **The Warning**
  - Paul warns against "vain words"—philosophies suggesting grace covers
    continued disobedience.
- **The Consequence**
  - **Transgression:** Literally "stepping across" the boundary of God's law.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Awakening the Soul

- Question: What is it that awakens the soul to a knowledge of its condition
  before the law?
- Key Text: John 16:8 – “And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin,
  and of righteousness, and of judgment.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (The Spirit's Work)

- **The Work of the Spirit**
  - The Holy Spirit performs the work of convicting the heart.
  - He presses the claims of God's law upon the conscience.
- **Not Human Eloquence**
  - Zechariah 4:6 – “Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the
    word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by
    my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.”
- **The First Step of Grace**
  - God disturbs our peace in sin so that we may find true peace in Christ.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Dark Room**
  - If a room is pitch black, you cannot see dust or cobwebs.
  - When sunlight streams in, the dirt becomes visible.
  - **Lesson:** The light didn't create the dirt; it only revealed it. The Holy
    Spirit sheds light on our hearts so we can be cleaned.

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Inquiry of the Convicted

- Question: What will be the inquiry of those who are thus convicted?
- Key Text: Acts 2:37 – “Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their
  heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren,
  what shall we do?”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Crisis of Will)

- **"Pricked in their Heart"**
  - Not just intellectual agreement, but deep spiritual realization of guilt.
- **The Demand for Action**
  - Realizing they are under condemnation, they know they cannot remain neutral.
- **End of Self-Sufficiency**
  - The question "What shall we do?" is a cry of helplessness.
  - They realized they needed a solution beyond themselves.

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Apostolic Reply

- Question: What reply should be returned to this inquiry?
- Key Text 1: Acts 2:38 – “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized
  every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye
  shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.”
- Key Text 2: Acts 16:31 – “And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
  thou shalt be saved, and thy house.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Repentance & Faith)

- **Two Essential Elements**
  - **Repent:** The turning _away_ from rebellion and sin.
  - **Believe:** The turning _toward_ Jesus, trusting His power to save.
- **Baptism**
  - The public confession of dying to the old life and rising in newness of
    life.
  - Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
    like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even
    so we also should walk in newness of life.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Application (Justification)

- **Righteousness by Faith**
  - We do not repent _to earn_ salvation.
  - We repent and believe _to receive_ the salvation purchased by Christ.
- **Justification Defined**
  - The legal act where God declares the repentant sinner righteous.
  - He imputes Christ’s perfect life to our account.
  - Romans 4:5 – “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
    justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Confession and Sorrow

- Question: How will the convicted sinner be constrained to act?
- Key Text: Psalm 38:18 – “For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for
  my sin.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Action)

- **Open Confession**
  - The truly convicted soul stops making excuses.
  - There is no blaming circumstances or others; just a frank declaration: "I
    have sinned."
- **Sorrow for Sin**
  - Not just fear of punishment.
  - Sorrow for the act itself—for breaking God’s law and grieving His love.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Godly Sorrow

- Question: What will godly sorrow work?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 7:10 – “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to
  salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Saving Sorrow)

- **The Function of Sorrow**
  - Sorrow is the catalyst that leads to a change of mind and action
    (repentance).
- **Unto Salvation**
  - Godly sorrow leads the sinner to the foot of the Cross.
  - It results in a life turned away from sin.
- **Not to be Repented Of**
  - One never regrets turning to God; the result is peace and joy.

## Slide 26 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Surgery**
  - The pain of a surgeon's scalpel is "godly sorrow."
  - It hurts, but it cuts out the cancer to save the life.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Worldly Sorrow

- Question: What will any other kind of sorrow do?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 7:10 (part b) – “...but the sorrow of the world
  worketh death.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points (Sorrow of Death)

- **Worldly Sorrow Examples**
  - Judas: Sorry he betrayed innocent blood, but did not return to the Master.
  - Esau: Wept for the lost blessing, not for his profane character.
- **Focus on Self**
  - Regrets the _consequences_ (shame, loss, punishment).
  - It is self-pity, not true contrition.
- **Outcome is Death**
  - It does not lead to Christ for cleansing; the sin remains.

## Slide 29 – Q12: True Repentance

- Question: What does true repentance involve?
- Key Text: Ezekiel 18:31 – “Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby
  ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will
  ye die, O house of Israel?”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points (Reformation)

- **Casting Away Transgression**
  - We cannot cling to pet sins; we cannot hold Christ with one hand and the
    world with the other.
- **A New Heart (Sanctification)**
  - God commands: "Make a new heart."
  - God promises: "A new heart also will I give you" (Ezekiel 36:26).
  - **Cooperation:** We must _will_ to separate from sin; God performs the
    miracle of recreation.
- **Why Will Ye Die?**
  - Sin is not necessary. To stay in sin is a tragic choice.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Living After Repentance

- Question: After repentance, how should one live?
- Key Text: Romans 6:1-2 – “What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin,
  that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live
  any longer therein?”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points (Dead to Sin)

- **Dead to Sin**
  - When we accept Christ, our "old man" is crucified (Romans 6:6).
  - A dead person does not respond to the old life's temptations.
- **Grace is not License**
  - Grace is the power that breaks the dominion of sin, not a cloak to cover it.
  - Justification (pardon) always leads to Sanctification (holy living).

## Slide 33 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Rescued Slave**
  - If a slave is purchased by a kind King and set free, he does not run back to
    his cruel old master.
  - He lives in gratitude and service to the King who bought him.
  - Romans 6:14 – “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not
    under the law, but under grace.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Allegiance

- Question: Whose servant is he that committeth sin?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:8 – “He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil
  sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested,
  that he might destroy the works of the devil.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: Key Points (Two Families)

- **The Source of Sin**
  - Habitual sin reflects the character of Satan, the originator of sin.
- **Two Families**
  - There are only children of God and children of the devil. No middle ground.
- **Victory in Christ**
  - Christ came to destroy the works of the devil.
  - We do not have to be servants of sin; Christ breaks the hold.

## Slide 36 – Q15: God’s Regard for the Penitent

- Question: How does God regard the truly penitent?
- Key Text: Isaiah 66:2 – “For all those things hath mine hand made, and all
  those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to
  him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.”

## Slide 37 – Q15: Key Points (Humility)

- **Poor in Spirit**
  - Those who recognize their spiritual bankruptcy without Christ (Matthew 5:3).
- **Contrite**
  - Brokenhearted over sin. God heals the broken heart (Psalm 51:17).
- **Trembling at the Word**
  - A high view of God’s authority.
  - Desiring to obey every word that proceeds from His mouth.

## Slide 38 – Q16: The Great Promise

- Question: What promise is made to those who confess their sins?
- Key Text: 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to
  forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

## Slide 39 – Q16: Key Points (Double Cure)

- **Faithful and Just**
  - Forgiveness is an act of justice because Jesus paid the price.
- **Forgiveness (Justification)**
  - He removes the _guilt_ of sin.
- **Cleansing (Sanctification)**
  - He removes the _stain_ and _power_ of sin ("all unrighteousness").
- **The Condition**
  - "If we confess." We must acknowledge our sins to our High Priest.

## Slide 40 – Q16: Application (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Earthly Sanctuary**
  - The sinner brought the lamb, confessed sin over its head, and transferred
    the sin to the sanctuary.
- **Heavenly Sanctuary**
  - We confess our sins to Christ, our High Priest in heaven.
  - He applies His blood to cover them.
  - He applies His Spirit to cleanse us from them.

## Slide 41 – Q17: The Cleansing Agent

- Question: By what are we cleansed from sin?
- Key Text: 1 John 1:7 – “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we
  have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
  cleanseth us from all sin.”

## Slide 42 – Q17: Key Points (The Blood)

- **Life in the Blood**
  - Leviticus 17:11 – “For the life of the flesh is in the blood...”
  - Christ’s sinless life is given in exchange for our sinful life.
- **Continuous Cleansing**
  - As we walk in the light, the blood of Jesus continually keeps us clean.
- **Victory**
  - Revelation 12:11 – “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by
    the word of their testimony...”

## Slide 43 – Q18: Direction of Repentance

- Question: Toward whom are we to repent?
- Key Text: Acts 20:21 – “Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks,
  repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 44 – Q18: Key Points (Toward God)

- **The Lawgiver**
  - We repent toward God (the Father) because it is His law we have broken.
- **The Injured Party**
  - Sin is a personal offense against our Creator.
  - Psalm 51:4 – “Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
    thy sight...”

## Slide 45 – Q19: Direction of Faith

- Question: Toward whom must we exercise faith?
- Key Text: Acts 20:21 – “...and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 46 – Q19: Key Points (Synergy of Salvation)

- **The Mediator**
  - We approach the Father through the "man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5).
- **Repentance and Faith Together**
  - We cannot truly repent without Christ's aid.
  - **The Cross:**
    - Shows the cost of sin -> Breaks our heart (**Repentance**).
    - Shows the love of God -> Gives us confidence (**Faith**).
- **Christ Our Righteousness**
  - Faith takes hold of Christ's merits and presents them to the Father in place
    of our sinful record.

## Slide 47 – Q19: Illustration

- **The Looking Glass**
  - You cannot see your face (to know you need washing) without light.
  - **Jesus is the Light:**
    - When we look at Him, we see our darkness (leading to Repentance).
    - Simultaneously, we see His arms open (leading to Faith).

## Slide 48 – Q20: Evidence of Repentance

- Question: How will one show that he has truly repented?
- Key Text: Matthew 3:8 – “Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.”

## Slide 49 – Q20: Key Points (Fruits of Grace)

- **Fruits, not Roots**
  - Works are not the root of salvation (faith), but the necessary fruit.
  - James 2:26 – “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
    works is dead also.”
- **Amendment of Life**
  - True repentance changes behavior (restoring what was stolen, learning
    gentleness).
  - Ezekiel 33:15 – “If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
    robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall
    surely live, he shall not die.”
- **Indwelling Christ**
  - John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and
    I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
    nothing.”

## Slide 50 – Q20: Illustration

- **The Apple Tree**
  - You do not make a dry stick into an apple tree by taping apples to it
    (hypocrisy).
  - An apple tree produces apples because the life of the tree is inside it.
  - **Lesson:** The Christian produces obedience because the life of Jesus is
    inside him through the Holy Spirit.
