# Chapter 80: The Gospel in the Old Testament

### Q1. In what condition did the sin of Adam place the human family?

**Verse:** “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin: and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Rom. 5:12.

**Answer:** The entrance of sin through Adam fundamentally altered the condition
of the entire human race. This text reveals several critical truths about our
natural state:

1.  **The Universality of Sin:** Sin is not merely an act we commit; it is an
    inherited condition of separation from God. Because Adam stood as the
    representative head of humanity, his fall brought the infection of
    selfishness and rebellion upon all his descendants.
2.  **The Penalty of Death:** The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). This is
    not only physical death but spiritual death—a severing of the lifeline
    between the soul and the Creator.
3.  **Total Helplessness:** Humanity is left in a state where we cannot save
    ourselves. The law of God, which is holy and just, condemns the sinner. We
    are born with a carnal nature that is "enmity against God" (Romans 8:7),
    unable to render perfect obedience on our own strength.

**Key Term:**

- **Original Sin/Depravity:** The teaching that all humans inherit a sinful
  nature and a propensity toward evil from Adam, making us subject to death and
  in need of a Savior from birth.

**[ILL]** Imagine a reservoir of water at the top of a mountain that becomes
poisoned at the source. Every stream, river, and faucet flowing from that source
will carry the same contamination. Adam was the headwaters of humanity; when he
fell, the stream of human life became contaminated with sin, and death passed
upon all who drink from it.

### Q2. How does the offer of salvation come to all?

**Verse:** “Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to
condemnation: even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all
men unto justification of life." Rom. 5:18.

**Answer:** Just as Adam’s fall affected the whole race, Christ’s victory
provides a remedy available to the whole race.

1.  **The Second Adam:** Christ came as the "Second Adam" (1 Corinthians 15:45).
    Where the first Adam failed in a perfect garden, Christ prevailed in a
    wilderness of temptation.
2.  **The Free Gift:** Salvation is not earned by human merit; it is a "free
    gift." God offers this gift to all men, though it is only effective for
    those who accept it.
3.  **Justification of Life:** This gift reverses the condemnation. It offers a
    legal standing of righteousness before God's throne.
    - **Imputed Righteousness:** Christ’s perfect life is credited to the
      believer's account.
    - **Imparted Righteousness:** The life of Christ is given to the believer to
      empower them to live a new life.

**Key Term:**

- **Justification:** A legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is
  righteous. It means being treated as if you had never sinned, solely because
  of the merits of Jesus Christ.

**[ILL]** If a man accumulates a debt of millions of dollars that he cannot pay,
he faces prison. If a wealthy benefactor steps in, pays the entire debt, and
deposits a fortune into the debtor's account, the man is free. Adam bankrupted
us; Christ (the Righteousness of One) paid our debt and credits His infinite
wealth to our account.

### Q3. Is there any other way to obtain salvation?

**Verse:** “Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other
name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Acts 4:12.

**Answer:** The Bible is emphatic that salvation is found exclusively in Jesus
Christ.

1.  **No Human Merit:** We cannot be saved by our own good works, by philosophy,
    by culture, or by adherence to religious rituals alone.
2.  **The Unique Bridge:** Sin created a gulf between a holy God and sinful man
    that only a Being who was both God and Man could bridge. Only Jesus,
    possessing the nature of God and the nature of man, could pay the penalty
    for the broken law and restore the relationship.
3.  **The Same for All Ages:** This truth applies to the Old Testament saints
    just as it does to us. They were not saved by animal sacrifices, but by the
    Messiah to whom those sacrifices pointed.

**Key Term:**

- **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation between God and man, accomplished
  through the life, death, and high priestly ministry of Jesus.

---

### Q4. Through what are men saved?

**Verse:** “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:
it is the gift of God." Eph. 2:8.

**Answer:** This verse serves as the cornerstone of the Protestant Reformation
and the Adventist understanding of the Gospel.

1.  **By Grace (The Source):** Grace is God’s unmerited favor and His enabling
    power. It is God loving us when we are unlovable and empowering us when we
    are weak. Salvation originates entirely in the heart of God.
2.  **Through Faith (The Instrument):** Faith is not the _cause_ of our
    salvation; it is the _hand_ that accepts it. It is the channel through which
    God’s grace flows into the soul.
3.  **Not of Yourselves:** We can claim no credit. Even the capacity to believe
    is a gift stimulated by the Holy Spirit and the Word of God (Romans 10:17).

**Key Term:**

- **Grace:** Often defined as God's unmerited favor, but in the context of
  _Righteousness by Faith_, it is also the power of God to transform the life
  and enable obedience (Titus 2:11-12).

**[ILL]** A beggar on the street is starving. A king approaches and offers him a
golden loaf of bread. The beggar stretches out his trembling hand to take it.
The beggar's hand did not bake the bread, nor did it earn the bread. The hand
simply received what the king graciously provided. Faith is the beggar's hand;
Grace is the King’s gift.

### Q5. By what were the patriarchs to receive the promises of God?

**Verse:** “Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the
promise might be sure to all the seed." Rom. 4:16.

**Answer:** The method of salvation has never changed. From Abel to the last
saved soul, the requirement has always been faith.

1.  **The Guarantee:** If the promise depended on our perfect performance of the
    law (works), it would never be "sure," because humans are frail and sinful.
    By basing the promise on _grace_ received by _faith_, God ensures that it
    rests on His faithfulness, not ours.
2.  **All the Seed:** This includes both the physical descendants of Abraham
    (the Jews) and the spiritual descendants (Gentile believers). The Old
    Testament patriarchs looked forward to the Cross; we look backward to it.
    The central object of faith—Christ—remains the same.

---

### Q6. What did the prophets teach concerning justification through faith?

**Verse:** "The just shall live by his faith." Hab. 2:4.

**Answer:** This Old Testament declaration is the seed of the New Testament
Gospel (quoted in Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, and Hebrews 10:38).

1.  **Life by Faith:** This refers to both legal standing (justification) and
    daily living (sanctification).
2.  **Continuous Dependence:** To "live by faith" means that the righteous
    person does not trust in their own heart or strength. Moment by moment, they
    draw spiritual life from God.
3.  **Transformation:** True faith works. It is a vital, active principle. As we
    trust God, His Spirit writes His law in our hearts, enabling us to live
    justly.

**[ILL]** Consider a deep-sea diver. He exists in an environment where he
naturally cannot survive (underwater/sinful world). He lives only because he is
connected by an air hose to a source of life above the surface. "The just shall
live by his faith" means constantly breathing the atmosphere of heaven through
the connection of faith, even while walking on earth.

### Q7. Through whom did the prophets teach should come the remission of sins?

**Verse:** “To Him give all the prophets witness, that through His name
whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins." Acts 10:43.

**Answer:** Peter declares here that the entire prophetic body of the Old
Testament testified of Jesus as the only source of forgiveness.

1.  **Universal Witness:** The prophets, through types, shadows, and direct
    predictions (like Isaiah 53), pointed to the "Lamb of God."
2.  **Remission of Sins:** This is more than just disregarding sin. It implies
    the removal of the guilt and power of sin.
    - In the **Sanctuary service**, the sinner brought a lamb, confessed his sin
      over it, and the sin was symbolically transferred to the sanctuary. This
      taught that sin requires blood (death) to be remitted (Leviticus 17:11).
    - Christ is the Antitype (the reality) who actually takes away the sin of
      the world (John 1:29).

**Key Term:**

- **Remission:** The cancellation of a debt or penalty; forgiveness. In the
  sanctuary, it involves separating the sin from the sinner.

### Q8. Did Abraham possess this faith?

**Verse:** “Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for
righteousness." Rom. 4:3. "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day: and he
saw it, and was glad." John 8:56.

**Answer:** Abraham is the father of the faithful, and his experience is the
model for Christian salvation.

1.  **Counted for Righteousness:** Abraham was not righteous by nature. When he
    believed God’s impossible promise (that he would have a son in his old age,
    pointing to the Messiah), God credited him with righteousness. This is
    _Justification by Faith_.
2.  **Seeing Christ's Day:** Jesus confirms that Abraham understood the Gospel.
    Through the command to offer Isaac (Genesis 22), Abraham was given a vivid
    enactment of how God the Father would give His Son for the world. He saw the
    substitutionary sacrifice and rejoiced in the salvation it provided.

**Key Term:**

- **Imputed Righteousness:** God crediting Christ's perfection to us, as He did
  to Abraham.

---

### Q9. How did Abraham have a view of Christ's day?

**Verse:** “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen
through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham." Gal. 3:8.

**Answer:** The Gospel is not a New Testament invention. It was "preached
before... unto Abraham."

1.  **The Covenant of Grace:** When God called Abraham, He established the
    covenant of grace. The promise that "in thee shall all nations be blessed"
    (Genesis 12:3) was a direct reference to Jesus Christ.
2.  **Justifying the Heathen:** The plan was always to save all nations through
    faith, not through the bloodline of one family or the keeping of the
    ceremonial law.
3.  **Old Testament Gospel:** Abraham was saved by the Gospel just as surely as
    Paul or Peter. He looked forward to the payment; we look back at the payment
    made.

### Q10. Whose children are all that believe?

**Verse:** “Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the
children of Abraham." Gal. 3:7.

**Answer:** Spiritual lineage supersedes physical lineage in the plan of
salvation.

1.  **The True Israel:** To be a "child of Abraham" means to share Abraham's
    faith. Those who trust in Christ for righteousness are the true heirs of the
    promises made to the patriarchs (Galatians 3:29).
2.  **Righteousness by Faith:** This doctrine unifies the Bible. It shows that
    God has one people (the faithful) and one plan of salvation (grace through
    faith) throughout all history.

---

### Q11. What did faith in Christ enable Moses to do?

**Verse:** “By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the
son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people
of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach
of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt." Heb. 11:24-26.

**Answer:** Faith is not merely an intellectual assent; it is a power that
transforms choices and behavior.

1.  **Refusing the World:** Moses had the world at his feet—wealth, power, and
    the throne of Egypt. Faith gave him "eyesalve" to see that the "pleasures of
    sin" are temporary (for a season).
2.  **Choosing the Reproach of Christ:** Moses understood the Messianic hope. He
    realized that being identified with the suffering people of God (and the
    coming Messiah) was worth more than earthly gold.
3.  **Sanctification:** This illustrates _imparted righteousness_. Faith enabled
    Moses to deny self, take up his cross, and follow the path of obedience,
    even when it was painful.

**[ILL]** A man is offered a single marshmallow now, or a feast if he waits one
hour. A child grabs the marshmallow. A mature adult waits for the feast. Faith
gives us the maturity to reject the "marshmallow" of fleeting worldly sin
because we see the "feast" of eternal life in Christ.

### Q12. From what source did the children of Israel draw spiritual life?

**Verse:** ” And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and
did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink:
for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was
Christ." 1 Cor. 10:2-4.

**Answer:** Paul reveals that the church in the wilderness was sustained by the
pre-incarnate Christ.

1.  **The Rock was Christ:** The water that flowed from the smitten rock to save
    them from thirst was a type of the living water Jesus offers (John 4:14).
    The rock had to be smitten (struck) just as Christ had to be stricken and
    smitten of God (Isaiah 53:4) to provide salvation.
2.  **Spiritual Meat/Drink:** The manna and the water were physical provisions,
    but to the eye of faith, they were spiritual lessons teaching dependence on
    God.
3.  **Christ's Presence:** Jesus was the Angel of the Lord who led them in the
    pillar of cloud and fire. The Israelites were interacting directly with the
    Son of God.

### Q13. Where must the gospel hope have been learned, before the New Testament was written?

**Verse:** “For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me; for he wrote
of Me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe My words?" John
5:46, 47.

**Answer:** Jesus explicitly ties faith in His mission to an understanding of
the Old Testament writings (Moses/Torah).

1.  **Moses Wrote of Christ:** Every sacrifice, every feast day, the high
    priest's garments, the sanctuary furniture—all were "object lessons" written
    by Moses to describe the work of Jesus.
    - The **Passover Lamb** = Christ our Passover.
    - The **High Priest** = Christ our Mediator.
    - The **Mercy Seat** = Christ our Propitiation.
2.  **The Foundation:** If one rejects the foundation (the Old Testament types),
    the building (the New Testament reality) cannot stand. Understanding the law
    and the prophets is essential to fully grasping the depth of the Gospel.

---

### Q14. Who inspired the Old Testament writers in their declarations?

**Verse:** “Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched
diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching
what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did
signify." 1 Peter 1:10, 11.

**Answer:** The unity of the Bible is guaranteed because it has one Author.

1.  **The Spirit of Christ:** It was the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus, who
    moved upon the Old Testament prophets.
2.  **Searching Diligently:** Even the prophets themselves studied their own
    writings to understand the "grace that should come." They saw the sufferings
    of Christ and the glory that should follow (the Cross and the Crown).
3.  **One Plan:** This verse confirms that the grace we experience today is the
    same grace they prophesied about.

---

### Q15. From what did Christ preach the gospel to His disciples when on the way to Emmaus?

**Verse:** “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them
in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself." Luke 24:27.

**Answer:** After His resurrection, Jesus validated the Old Testament as the
primary textbook for understanding His mission.

1.  **The Key to Scripture:** Jesus showed them that the Old Testament was not
    just history or law, but a revelation of Himself.
2.  **Suffering and Glory:** He likely traced the Messianic line from the seed
    of the woman (Genesis 3:15), to the suffering servant (Isaiah 53), to the
    pierced shepherd (Zechariah 12:10), showing that the Cross was not a defeat,
    but the fulfillment of God's eternal plan.
3.  **Burning Hearts:** When we see Jesus in the Old Testament, our hearts, like
    the disciples', will "burn within us" (Luke 24:32).

---

### Q16. Who is both author and finisher of the plan of salvation?

**Verse:** “Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith." Heb.
12:2.

**Answer:** The entire Bible focuses on one Person.

1.  **The Author (Alpha):** Jesus began the work. He is the Creator and the Lamb
    slain from the foundation of the world. He initiates our faith by drawing us
    to Himself.
2.  **The Finisher (Omega):** He completes the work. He does not leave us
    half-saved. Through the process of sanctification, He works in us "both to
    will and to do of His good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13) until we reflect His
    character.
3.  **The Focus:** The Christian life is maintained by "looking unto
    Jesus"—turning our eyes away from self, away from our failures, and away
    from the world, and fixing them steadily on our High Priest in the heavenly
    sanctuary.

**Key Term:**

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace in the believer, setting
  them apart for holy use and restoring the image of God in the soul.

**[ILL]** A painter starts a portrait (Author). He sketches the outline. But he
doesn't stop there; he fills in the colors, corrects the shadows, and perfects
the details until the image is complete (Finisher). Jesus has started a good
work in you, and He is faithful to complete it (Philippians 1:6).
