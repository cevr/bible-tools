# Bible Study: The Gospel in the Old Testament

## Introduction

One of the most liberating truths of Scripture is this: there has only ever been **one gospel, one Saviour, and one way of salvation**. From Eden's gate to Revelation's throne, God has offered fallen humanity the same gift—righteousness by faith in the promised Redeemer. The Old Testament saints were not saved by works or animal sacrifices any more than we are saved by church attendance or good deeds. They looked forward to the cross; we look back to it. But we all look to the same Lamb.

## Core Truths

### The Universal Problem: Sin and Death

The human condition is summarized in one devastating verse:

> _"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin: and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."_ (Romans 5:12)

Adam's fall was not merely personal—it was **federal**. As the head of the human race, his transgression brought condemnation upon all his descendants. We inherit both his fallen nature and the sentence of death. No amount of human effort can reverse this inheritance.

**Death**: The cessation of life as the wages of sin (Romans 6:23).

**Condemnation**: God's judicial verdict declaring man guilty and subject to the penalty of His broken law.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "Adam" (_adam_) literally means "mankind" or "humanity"—emphasizing that his fall represented all of us. When Adam sinned, humanity sinned.

### The Universal Remedy: Christ's Righteousness

But God did not leave humanity without hope:

> _"Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life."_ (Romans 5:18)

Notice the parallel structure. By **one man's offense**—condemnation to all. By **One Man's righteousness**—justification offered to all. The same federal principle that brought the curse brings the cure. Christ stands as the second Adam, the new Head of a redeemed humanity.

> _"Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."_ (Acts 4:12)

This is absolute. There is no salvation in Buddha, Mohammed, human philosophy, or moral achievement. There is salvation **only** in Jesus Christ—and this has been true since the garden of Eden.

## Deeper Truths

### Salvation Has Always Been by Grace Through Faith

> _"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God."_ (Ephesians 2:8)

This is not a New Testament innovation. Paul emphasizes that the patriarchs received God's promises the same way:

> _"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed."_ (Romans 4:16)

The prophet Habakkuk, writing centuries before Christ's birth, declared the eternal principle:

> _"The just shall live by his faith."_ (Habakkuk 2:4)

**Justification**: God's act of declaring a repentant sinner righteous, not because of their works, but because of Christ's merits received by faith.

**Grace**: God's unmerited favor—His gift of salvation freely offered to those who deserve only condemnation.

[Q] **"But weren't Old Testament believers saved by keeping the law and offering sacrifices?"**

Never. The law could only reveal sin, not remove it (Romans 3:20). The sacrifices could only symbolize forgiveness, not provide it (Hebrews 10:4). Every lamb pointed forward to "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). Old Testament saints were saved by **faith in the coming Redeemer**—the same faith by which we are saved today.

### Abraham: The Father of All Who Believe

> _"Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."_ (Romans 4:3)

Abraham was justified **by faith**, not by circumcision (which came later) or by works. His faith was not mere intellectual assent—it was trust in God's promise of a coming Seed who would bless all nations (Genesis 12:3; 22:18).

> _"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day: and he saw it, and was glad."_ (John 8:56)

How did Abraham see Christ's day? Through the gospel preached to him:

> _"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham."_ (Galatians 3:8)

[DYK🔎] When Abraham offered Isaac on Mount Moriah, he was acting out the gospel. Isaac, the beloved son, carried the wood for his own sacrifice up the mountain—just as Christ, God's beloved Son, carried His cross to Calvary. Abraham "saw" Christ's day in this prophetic drama and rejoiced!

> _"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."_ (Galatians 3:7)

Whether Jew or Gentile, bond or free, those who exercise Abraham's faith are his true spiritual descendants.

### Moses: Choosing the Reproach of Christ

> _"By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt."_ (Hebrews 11:24-26)

Notice carefully: Moses esteemed **"the reproach of Christ"**—not merely the reproach of Israel or the reproach of monotheism. Moses knew the Messiah. His faith was in Christ.

[ILL] Consider a man in prison offered a pardon by the king, on condition that he renounce his true identity and pretend to be someone else. Though freedom beckons, he refuses—because he knows who he really is and whose he really is. Moses, with all the treasures and pleasures of Egypt at his feet, chose instead the "reproach of Christ." He saw beyond Pharaoh's throne to a heavenly kingdom. True faith always chooses eternal riches over temporal gain.

### Israel Drank from Christ

> _"And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; and did all eat the same spiritual meat; and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."_ (1 Corinthians 10:2-4)

The manna from heaven represented Christ, the Bread of Life (John 6:31-35). The water from the rock represented Christ, the Living Water (John 4:10-14; 7:37-39). Israel's entire wilderness experience pointed to salvation in Christ.

[DYK🔎] The rock was struck **once** at Rephidim (Exodus 17:6), representing Christ smitten once for our sins. At Kadesh, Moses was commanded only to **speak** to the rock (Numbers 20:8)—representing how we receive Christ's blessings by faith and prayer, not by re-crucifying Him. Moses' error in striking the rock twice cost him entrance to Canaan because it misrepresented the gospel.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Spirit of Christ in the Prophets

> _"Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify."_ (1 Peter 1:10-11)

The prophets did not speak from their own wisdom. **The Spirit of Christ** inspired their words. When Isaiah wrote of the suffering Servant, when Daniel saw the Messiah cut off, when Zechariah beheld the pierced One—it was Christ's own Spirit revealing Christ's own mission.

This means the Old Testament is not merely **about** Christ in a distant sense—it is **from** Christ in the most intimate sense. He is both the subject and the source of Scripture.

### Christ Preached from Moses and the Prophets

> _"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself."_ (Luke 24:27)

On the Emmaus road, the risen Christ gave the ultimate Bible study. He showed that **every Scripture**—Genesis through Malachi—testified of Him. The disciples' hearts burned within them as scales fell from their eyes.

> _"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed Me; for he wrote of Me. But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe My words?"_ (John 5:46-47)

Jesus made belief in Moses' writings a test of genuine faith. Those who reject the Old Testament cannot truly receive Christ, for Moses wrote of Him.

### The Author and Finisher

> _"Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith."_ (Hebrews 12:2)

**Author** (_archegos_): Pioneer, founder, originator—the one who begins the work.

**Finisher** (_teleiotes_): Perfecter, completer—the one who brings the work to its full accomplishment.

Christ began the plan of salvation in the councils of eternity. He revealed it progressively through patriarchs and prophets. He accomplished it at Calvary. He now applies it through His high-priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. And He will complete it at His return.

[DYK🔎] The heavenly sanctuary reveals the full scope of Christ's saving work. The **outer court** (altar of sacrifice) represents His death for us—justification. The **holy place** (daily ministry) represents His work in us—sanctification. The **most holy place** (Day of Atonement) represents the final cleansing of sin from the universe and the vindication of God's character. From beginning to end, Christ is the Author and Finisher.

## Practical Application

### What This Truth Means for Us

1. **We have the same gospel as the patriarchs.** We are not superior to them because we live after the cross. They had the same Saviour, the same Spirit, and the same faith. Enoch walked with God. Abraham was called the friend of God. Moses spoke with God face to face. We are called to the same intimate fellowship.

2. **The Old Testament is essential to understanding Christ.** Jesus Himself said that those who reject Moses cannot truly believe in Him. We must study the types and shadows, for they illuminate the reality in Christ. The sanctuary service, the feasts, the sacrifices—all are gospel lessons in visual form.

3. **Salvation is entirely of grace, received by faith.** We cannot earn it, deserve it, or contribute to it. We can only receive it as a gift. This was true for Abraham; it is true for us. Our works are the **fruit** of salvation, never its **root**.

4. **Christ is the center of all Scripture.** Whether reading Genesis or Revelation, Isaiah or Romans, we should ask: "What does this reveal about Jesus?" Every prophecy, every type, every promise finds its fulfillment in Him.

5. **We must make the same choice Moses made.** The pleasures of sin are real but temporary. The treasures of Egypt (this world) are real but fleeting. The reproach of Christ leads to eternal riches. Will we, like Moses, esteem Christ's reproach as greater treasure than all the world can offer?

## Appeal

> _"Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."_ (Hebrews 12:2)

Beloved, Christ has run the race before us. He has pioneered the way through suffering to glory. Now He calls us to fix our eyes upon Him—not upon our failures, not upon our circumstances, not upon the opinions of men—but upon **Jesus**.

The gospel that saved Abraham, Moses, and David is the same gospel that saves you today. It is not complicated: believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved. Trust wholly in His merits, not your own. Let His righteousness cover you and His Spirit transform you.

Will you, today, join that great company of faith—Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, the prophets—who all obtained a good report through faith, looking unto Jesus?

The Author of your salvation is also its Finisher. What He began in you, He will complete. Trust Him. Follow Him. Look unto Him.

_"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."_ (Jude 24-25)
