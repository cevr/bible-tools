# Reading 1: The Sacred Scriptures

## Introduction

The Bible stands alone among all books ever written. It claims to be not merely human wisdom collected across centuries, but the very Word of the living God—"given by inspiration" and preserved by divine providence for all generations. In this study, we examine what Scripture teaches about itself: its origin, its purpose, and the confidence believers may place in its eternal truth.

## Core Truths

### The Bible's Own Names for Itself

In the days of Jesus, the collection of sacred writings was known simply as "the scriptures" (Matthew 21:42) and "the word of God" (Luke 8:21). The term "Scripture" comes from the Latin _scriptura_, meaning "writings"—but these are no ordinary writings. They are set apart as holy, authoritative, and divine.

> _"Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?"_ (Matthew 21:42)

[DYK🔎] The word "Bible" never appears in the Bible itself! It comes from the Greek _biblia_, meaning "little books," derived from _byblus_—the papyrus material on which ancient texts were written. The Greeks named this material after the Phoenician port of Byblos, where they imported it.

### The Divine Origin of Scripture

The Bible makes an extraordinary claim about its own origin:

> _"All scripture is given by inspiration of God."_ (2 Timothy 3:16)

The Greek word translated "inspiration" is _theopneustos_—literally "God-breathed." Scripture is not merely inspired in the way a poet might be inspired by a sunset. It is the very breath of God, exhaled through human writers.

> _"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."_ (2 Peter 1:21)

**Moved**: The Greek word _pheromenoi_ pictures a ship carried along by the wind. The prophets did not invent their messages; they were borne along by the Holy Spirit while retaining their individual personalities and styles.

Peter gives a specific example: David spoke prophetically about Judas, not because David foresaw Judas personally, but because "the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake" (Acts 1:16). The true Author behind the human penman was God Himself.

> _"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets."_ (Hebrews 1:1)

[ILL] Consider a skilled musician playing a variety of instruments—a violin, a trumpet, a flute. Each instrument has its own tone and character, yet all produce the same melody chosen by the musician. So God, the Divine Author, used prophets of different backgrounds, personalities, and eras. Moses the lawgiver, David the shepherd-king, Isaiah the court prophet, Amos the herdsman—each "instrument" had its own voice, yet all played the same harmonious message of redemption. The music was God's; the instruments were human.

## Deeper Truths

### The Threefold Division of the Old Testament

Jesus Himself recognized the structure of the Hebrew Scriptures:

> _"And He said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning Me."_ (Luke 24:44)

- **The Law of Moses** (Torah): Genesis through Deuteronomy
- **The Prophets**: Both the "former prophets" (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings) and the "latter prophets" (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the twelve Minor Prophets)
- **The Psalms** (or "Writings"): Psalms, Proverbs, Job, and the remaining books

[DYK🔎] Though the Bible contains sixty-six books written by approximately thirty-five to forty authors over some 1,500 years, it tells one unified story—the great controversy between Christ and Satan, culminating in God's eternal victory through the cross. No human committee could produce such harmony across millennia; only a Divine Mind could orchestrate it.

### Scripture's Testimony About Christ

Notice carefully what Jesus said on the road to Emmaus:

> _"And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself."_ (Luke 24:27)

Jesus pointed to the Old Testament prophecies as proof of His Messiahship. At that moment, the New Testament had not yet been written—yet Christ found Himself on every page of Moses and the Prophets. The sanctuary services, the Passover lamb, the serpent lifted in the wilderness, the Suffering Servant of Isaiah 53—all pointed to Him.

[Q] **"If the Bible is so important, why didn't Jesus write anything Himself?"**

Jesus did not need to write, for He _was_ the Word made flesh (John 1:14). The written Word testifies of the Living Word. When Christ opened the Scriptures on the Emmaus road, He showed that every sacrifice, every prophecy, every promise found its fulfillment in Him. The Bible is not merely a book _about_ God; it is God's revelation of Himself _through_ His Son. To know the Scriptures rightly is to know Christ.

### The Fourfold Purpose of Scripture

Paul outlines four practical uses of God's Word:

> _"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness."_ (2 Timothy 3:16)

- **Doctrine**: Teaching what is true
- **Reproof**: Showing what is wrong in our lives
- **Correction**: Directing how to get right
- **Instruction in righteousness**: Training how to stay right

These four purposes work together like a physician who diagnoses (doctrine), identifies the disease (reproof), prescribes treatment (correction), and provides ongoing care (instruction in righteousness). God's Word is not merely informational—it is transformational.

### The Ultimate Goal: A Complete Christian

> _"That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."_ (2 Timothy 3:17)

**Perfect**: The Greek _artios_ means "complete, capable, proficient"—equipped for every task. **Thoroughly furnished** (_exartizo_) means "fully outfitted," like a ship ready for voyage with every provision aboard.

God's purpose in giving us the Scriptures is not merely head knowledge. He intends to produce men and women who are spiritually mature, morally complete, and practically equipped for service. This is the very heart of righteousness by faith—Christ working _in_ us through His Word to accomplish what we cannot achieve by human effort.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Truth and the Character of God

> _"He is the Rock, His work is perfect: for all His ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is He."_ (Deuteronomy 32:4)

Because God is the "God of truth," His Word must also be truth:

> _"Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth."_ (John 17:17)

In the great controversy, Satan is the father of lies (John 8:44). His first assault in Eden was to cast doubt on God's Word: "Yea, hath God said?" (Genesis 3:1). The battle between truth and deception continues to this day. When we hold fast to Scripture, we stand with Christ against the deceiver.

### God's Word Exalted Above His Name

> _"Thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name."_ (Psalm 138:2)

[DYK🔎] A person's name in Hebrew culture represented their character—their reputation, their honor, their very identity. When God magnifies His Word above His name, He stakes His character on the fulfillment of Scripture. Every promise carries the weight of who God is. "God is not a man, that he should lie" (Numbers 23:19). His character guarantees His Word.

This has profound implications for the sanctuary truth. In the Most Holy Place, above the mercy seat, God's presence dwelt between the cherubim—directly over the ark containing His law, His written Word. The very structure of the sanctuary testified that God's Word is the foundation of His government and the expression of His unchanging character.

### A Light in Darkness

> _"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path."_ (Psalm 119:105)

In this dark world of sin and death, Scripture illuminates the way forward. The lamp does not show the entire journey at once—only the next step. So God's Word guides us day by day, decision by decision, keeping us on the narrow path that leads to eternal life.

[ILL] A traveler lost in a forest at night needs only a lantern to find the path home. The lantern does not reveal the entire forest, but it shows enough ground to take the next safe step. So Scripture does not satisfy idle curiosity about every mystery, but it reveals sufficient light for every step of obedience. "The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law" (Deuteronomy 29:29).

## Practical Application

### Valuing Scripture Above Earthly Necessities

> _"Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food."_ (Job 23:12)

Job, in the midst of overwhelming suffering, treasured God's Word more than his daily bread. Jesus echoed this principle when tempted in the wilderness: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).

This truth calls us to:

1. **Daily feeding**: Just as the body needs daily nourishment, the soul requires daily communion with God's Word.
2. **Priority adjustment**: When schedules are crowded, Scripture reading must not be the first casualty.
3. **Spiritual appetite**: A lack of hunger for the Word often signals spiritual illness.

### Trusting Scripture's Eternal Permanence

> _"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever."_ (Isaiah 40:8)

Empires rise and fall. Philosophies come into fashion and fade. Scientific theories are revised every generation. But the Word of God remains unchanged and unchangeable. When we build our lives on Scripture, we build on the only foundation that will endure the test of time and the fire of the final judgment.

[Q] **"But isn't the Bible just an ancient book written by fallible men? How can it speak to our modern situation?"**

The Bible was indeed written through human instruments—but they were "moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1:21). The Divine Author ensured that His message would transcend every age and culture. Human authors could not have foreseen our century, but God did. The same Word that guided Abraham through Chaldea, Moses through the wilderness, and Daniel through Babylon speaks with equal authority to believers navigating the complexities of the twenty-first century. "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven" (Psalm 119:89).

## Appeal

> _"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever."_ (Isaiah 40:8)

Friend, the God of the universe has spoken. He has not left us in darkness or uncertainty. Through prophets, apostles, and supremely through His Son, He has revealed His will, His character, and His plan of redemption. The Scriptures are His gift to you—"a lamp unto thy feet, and a light unto thy path."

Will you receive this gift? Will you esteem God's Word above your necessary food? Will you allow the Holy Spirit to use Scripture for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness—that you may be "perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works"?

The question is not whether God's Word is true. The question is whether we will believe it, obey it, and allow it to transform us into the image of Christ. May we say with the psalmist:

> _"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee."_ (Psalm 119:11)
