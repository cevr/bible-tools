### Q1. Daniel's second vision was given at what time?

**“In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and
visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of
the matters.” (Daniel 7:1)**

**Answer:**

The timing of this vision is significant. Chronologically, this chapter takes
place before the events of Daniel chapter 5 (the feast of Belshazzar and the
fall of Babylon). At this time, the Babylonian empire was nearing its close, and
the aging prophet Daniel was given a panoramic view of world history that would
extend to the end of time.

- **God Reveals the Future:** Before a major crisis or transition in history,
  God often reveals His plans to His servants (Amos 3:7). Just as Babylon was
  about to fall, God gave assurance that He holds the future.
- **The Importance of the Written Word:** The text notes that Daniel "wrote the
  dream." Prophecy is not left to oral tradition or vague memory; it is recorded
  so that generations may test it and find their faith strengthened.
- **The Great Controversy:** This vision pulls back the curtain on the **Great
  Controversy**—the cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan. While earthly
  kings (like Belshazzar) feast and ignore God, Heaven is recording history and
  determining the destiny of nations.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a ship captain navigating through treacherous
waters at night. Before the storm hits, he consults his chart and compass to
know exactly where the hidden rocks lie. In this vision, God provides the
"chart" of history for His people, so that when the storms of political strife
arise, they may know where they are in the stream of time and remain calm.

### Q2. What did the prophet first see?

**“Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four
winds of heaven strove upon the great sea.” (Daniel 7:2)**

**Answer:**

The vision begins with a scene of intense turmoil. Daniel sees the natural
elements in conflict.

- **Vision by Night:** The darkness of the night often symbolizes the moral
  darkness of this world, into which the light of prophecy shines (2 Peter
  1:19).
- **Striving:** The word "strove" implies violent conflict, bursting forth from
  all directions.
- **The Great Sea:** In Scripture, the sea is the setting from which these
  powers arise. As we will see in later questions, this represents the populated
  areas of the earth.

**Definition:**

- **Prophecy:** A message inspired by God, predicting future events or revealing
  God's will (2 Peter 1:21).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you stand on a beach during a hurricane, you see the
water churned up into foam and fury by the invisible force of the wind. The sea
cannot remain calm when the winds blow. Similarly, humanity cannot remain at
peace when the "winds" of human passion and satanic incitement blow upon the
nations.

### Q3. What was the result of this strife?

**“And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.”
(Daniel 7:3)**

**Answer:**

As a result of the conflict described in verse 2, four distinct entities emerge.

- **Product of Conflict:** These kingdoms did not arise through peaceful
  elections or voluntary agreement. They "came up" as a result of the winds
  striving—through war, conquest, and political upheaval.
- **Diverse:** They were different in character, administration, and religion.
  However, they all shared the nature of "beasts." In contrast to the "Lamb of
  God" (Jesus), earthly governments are often depicted as wild
  animals—predatory, ruling by force, and devouring the weak.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary service, beasts were
  sacrificed to make atonement for sin. Here, beasts represent powers that often
  oppose God. The ultimate solution to these predatory beasts is the ministry of
  the High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, who judges them (Daniel 7:9-10).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Walk through a zoo, and you will see animals that cannot
coexist in the same cage. A lion will eat a lamb; a bear will crush a smaller
animal. God uses these predatory animals to illustrate the nature of kingdoms
built on human pride and force. They survive by conquering others. The Kingdom
of God is the opposite: it is built on love, service, and self-sacrifice
(Matthew 20:25-28).

### Q4. What did the beasts represent?

**“These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of
the earth.” (Daniel 7:17)**

**Answer:**

The Bible provides its own key to interpretation. We do not need to guess.

- **Kings and Kingdoms:** In prophecy, a "king" is used interchangeably with the
  "kingdom" or empire he represents (compare Daniel 2:38-39). These are four
  universal empires that would dominate the world scene in succession.
- **Out of the Earth:** This phrase signifies their origin. They are "earthly,
  sensual, devilish" (James 3:15). They operate on the principles of this
  world—force, ambition, and selfishness.
- **Contrast with Christ's Kingdom:** Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this
  world" (John 18:36). While these kingdoms rise from the earth (human effort),
  Christ’s kingdom is the "stone cut out without hands" (Daniel 2:34, 45),
  signifying its divine origin.

**Righteousness by Faith Application:** We cannot build a righteous character by
"earthly" methods—willpower, legalism, or social reform alone. True
righteousness must come down from above; it is the gift of God through faith in
Jesus Christ (Philippians 3:9). Just as these beasts are of the earth, our
self-generated righteousness is like "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6). We need the
righteousness of Heaven.

### Q5. In symbolic language, what is represented by winds?

**[Whirlwind, commotion, war, strife, scattering, confusion, etc.] (Jeremiah
25:31-33; 49:36, 37)**

**Answer:**

Scripture consistently uses "wind" in a prophetic context to represent war,
military commotion, and strife.

- **Jeremiah 25:32:** "A great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of
  the earth." This describes the destruction of nations.
- **Agents of Destruction:** Winds represent the passions of men and the
  influence of Satan let loose for destruction.
- **Restrained by God:** Revelation 7:1-3 shows angels holding back the "four
  winds" so they do not blow until God's servants are sealed. This teaches us
  that political stability is often God's mercy, granting time for the gospel
  work to advance.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Consider a forest fire. The wind is the driving force
that pushes the fire from tree to tree, consuming everything in its path. In
history, the "winds" of war drive armies to conquer one nation after another,
redrawing the map of the world.

### Q6. What is symbolized by the term waters?

**“And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest,... are peoples, and
multitudes, and nations, and tongues.” (Revelation 17:15)**

**Answer:**

To understand the "sea" in Daniel 7:2, we look to the definition in Revelation.

- **Populated Areas:** Water represents a dense population—"peoples, and
  multitudes."
- **The Formula:** By combining the symbols, we understand the vision: **Wind**
  (War) + **Water** (People) = **Beasts** (Nations arising through conquest).
- **Prophetic Consistency:** This demonstrates the unity of the Bible. The
  definitions given to John on Patmos explain the visions given to Daniel in
  Babylon centuries earlier.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A lonely island in the middle of the ocean is surrounded
by water. In prophecy, the "sea" is the teeming masses of humanity. Just as the
sea is restless and constantly shifting, human society is unstable without God
(Isaiah 57:20).

### Q7. What was the first beast like?

**“The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings
thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon
the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.” (Daniel 7:4)**

**Answer:**

This beast corresponds to the **Head of Gold** in Daniel 2—the empire of
**Babylon** (605–539 B.C.).

- **The Lion:** The king of beasts represents the majesty and power of Babylon.
  The winged lion was a common symbol in Babylonian art/architecture.
- **Eagle's Wings:** Wings symbolize the swiftness of Nebuchadnezzar's conquests
  (Habakkuk 1:6-8; Jeremiah 4:13).
- **Wings Plucked:** The empire eventually ceased its conquests. Its expansion
  stopped.
- **Man's Heart:** A lion is bold and fearless. A "man's heart," in this
  context, suggests weakness, timidity, and a loss of the martial spirit. By the
  time of Belshazzar, the Babylonians had become luxury-loving and effeminate,
  shutting themselves within their walls rather than fighting.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:** Babylon represents human pride ("Is not
this great Babylon, that I have built?" - Dan 4:30). But human pride always
leads to weakness and a fall. True strength is not found in the "heart of a
lion" (self-confidence) nor the weak "heart of a man" (fear), but in a "new
heart" given by God—a heart of flesh that obeys His law (Ezekiel 36:26).

### Q8. By what was the second kingdom symbolized?

**“And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself
on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it:
and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.” (Daniel 7:5)**

**Answer:**

This beast corresponds to the **Chest and Arms of Silver** in Daniel 2—the
empire of **Medo-Persia** (539–331 B.C.).

- **The Bear:** Less majestic than the lion, but stronger and more brutal. This
  accurately represents the Medo-Persian armies, which relied on massive numbers
  and brute force rather than speed or strategy.
- **Raised on One Side:** This was a dual monarchy (Medes and Persians). The
  Persians eventually became the dominant power, "raising up" higher than the
  Medes.
- **Three Ribs:** These represent the three principal powers conquered by
  Medo-Persia: **Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt**.
- **"Devour Much Flesh":** This kingdom was known for its cruelty and its
  massive shedding of blood during its expansion.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A bear is a lumbering, crushing force. Unlike the lion
which might strike with precision, the bear overwhelms its opponent. This
describes the Persian method of warfare, where they would send hundreds of
thousands of soldiers to overwhelm the enemy by sheer weight of numbers.

### Q9. By what was the third universal empire symbolized?

**“After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back
of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was
given to it.” (Daniel 7:6)**

**Answer:**

This beast corresponds to the **Belly and Thighs of Brass** in Daniel 2—the
empire of **Greece** (331–168 B.C.) under Alexander the Great.

- **The Leopard:** A leopard is naturally swift.
- **Four Wings:** If two wings (Babylon) meant speed, four wings represent
  supernatural velocity. Alexander the Great conquered the known world in
  roughly 10 years—a feat unparalleled in ancient military history.
- **Four Heads:** Alexander died young (age 32) without a unified heir. His
  empire was divided among his four leading generals: **Cassander** (West),
  **Lysimachus** (North), **Ptolemy** (South, Egypt), and **Seleucus** (East,
  Syria).
- **Prophetic Accuracy:** This detail—four heads—was written hundreds of years
  before it happened. No human wisdom could have foreseen that the Greek empire
  would split exactly four ways, rather than remaining united or fracturing into
  dozens of pieces.

**Definition:**

- **Historicism:** The method of prophetic interpretation that sees these
  visions as a continuous timeline of history from the prophet's day until the
  Second Coming of Christ.

### Q10. How is the fourth kingdom represented?

**“After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful
and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured
and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was
diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.” (Daniel
7:7)**

**Answer:**

This beast corresponds to the **Legs of Iron** in Daniel 2—the **Roman Empire**
(168 B.C. – 476 A.D. in its pagan phase).

- **Dreadful and Terrible:** Daniel could find no animal in nature to describe
  it. It was a monster.
- **Iron Teeth:** It corresponds to the iron legs of Daniel 2. Rome was the
  "Iron Monarchy," known for its rigid discipline and crushing power.
- **Diverse:** Rome differed from the previous kingdoms. While Babylon, Persia,
  and Greece were purely monarchies, Rome began as a republic and later became
  an empire. Furthermore, it was "diverse" because it would eventually
  transition from a political pagan power into a religio-political power (Papal
  Rome).
- **Stamped the Residue:** Rome absorbed the cultures and territories of all
  previous kingdoms, enforcing its laws and will with absolute ruthlessness.

**Sanctuary Connection:** It was under the authority of this Roman power that
Jesus, the Lamb of God, was crucified (in the "outer court" of this earth). This
power also destroyed the earthly temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70.

---

### Q11. What was denoted by the ten horns?

**“And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and
another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he
shall subdue three kings.” (Daniel 7:24)**

**Answer:**

Just as the ten toes in Daniel 2 represented the division of Rome, the ten horns
here represent the same historical event.

- **Ten Kings (Kingdoms):** Rome was not conquered by a fifth universal empire.
  Instead, it disintegrated and was divided by barbarian tribes between A.D. 351
  and A.D. 476. These became the roots of modern European nations (e.g.,
  Saxons/English, Franks/French, Alamanni/Germans, Visigoths/Spanish, etc.).
- **The Stage for the Antichrist:** The verse mentions "another" little horn
  that rises _after_ or _among_ these ten. This sets the stage for the central
  focus of Daniel 7: the rise of a religious power that would usurp the
  prerogatives of God.
- **Subdue Three Kings:** History records that three of the original ten
  barbarian tribes (the Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths) were destroyed to make
  way for the rise of the Papacy.

**Righteousness by Faith & Conclusion:** This vision shows us that all earthly
power—no matter how "strong exceedingly"—eventually fragments and fails. The
succession of empires proves the Bible true. But the vision does not end with
the beasts; it ends with the **Judgment** and the **Kingdom of the Most High**
(Daniel 7:27). We are living in the time of the "horns" (divided Europe). Our
hope must not be in earthly political alliances, but in the High Priest in
heaven who is preparing a people to stand when the kingdoms of this world become
the kingdoms of our Lord.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you watch a sandcastle being built, it looks
impressive for a moment. But as the tide comes in, the water erodes the base,
and it collapses or breaks into lumps of wet sand. Earthly empires are like
sandcastles. Only the Kingdom built on the Rock (Christ) will stand forever.
