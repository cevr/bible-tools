# Bible Study: Four Great Monarchies

## Introduction

In Daniel chapter 7, God unveils the sweep of world history through a remarkable vision given to His prophet. Using vivid symbolic beasts, the Lord reveals the rise and fall of great empires—not as mere political commentary, but as evidence of His sovereign control over the affairs of nations and His ultimate purpose to establish an everlasting kingdom. This prophecy, given during Babylon's reign, accurately foretold centuries of history before they occurred, confirming the divine inspiration of Scripture.

## Core Truths

### The Setting of the Vision

Daniel received this prophecy "in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon" (Daniel 7:1)—approximately 553 B.C. This places the vision near the end of Babylon's supremacy, yet decades before its fall. God was showing His servant what would unfold across centuries to come.

> _"I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another."_ (Daniel 7:2-3)

[DYK🔎] This is the first of Daniel's personally received visions. Chapter 2 recorded Nebuchadnezzar's dream, which Daniel interpreted. Now God speaks directly to His prophet, expanding the revelation with greater detail about the nature and character of these kingdoms.

### Understanding the Symbols

Before examining each beast, we must understand the symbolic language God employs:

**Winds** represent strife, war, and political commotion. Jeremiah uses this imagery powerfully:

> _"A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations... evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth."_ (Jeremiah 25:31-33)

**Waters** symbolize peoples, multitudes, and nations:

> _"The waters which thou sawest... are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues."_ (Revelation 17:15)

**Beasts** represent kingdoms or political powers. The angel interpreter makes this unmistakably clear:

> _"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth."_ (Daniel 7:17)

The scene, then, is this: political strife and warfare among the populated regions of the earth, out of which four successive world empires emerge.

## Deeper Truths

### The Four Beasts Identified

#### The Lion with Eagle's Wings—Babylon (605-539 B.C.)

> _"The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it."_ (Daniel 7:4)

The lion, king of beasts, fitly represents Babylon—the golden head of Nebuchadnezzar's dream image (Daniel 2:38). Eagle's wings suggest the swiftness of Babylon's conquests under Nebuchadnezzar.

[DYK🔎] Archaeologists have discovered winged lions guarding the gates of ancient Babylon. This symbol was the empire's own chosen emblem! God used imagery the Babylonians themselves would recognize. Jeremiah also compared Babylon to both a lion and an eagle (Jeremiah 4:7; 49:19-22).

The plucking of wings and receiving of "a man's heart" may represent Babylon's decline from aggressive conquest to a more timid, defensive posture—particularly after Nebuchadnezzar's humbling experience recorded in Daniel 4.

#### The Bear Raised on One Side—Medo-Persia (539-331 B.C.)

> _"And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh."_ (Daniel 7:5)

The bear, though less majestic than the lion, is noted for brute strength and ferocity. This corresponds to the silver arms and breast of Daniel 2—the dual kingdom of the Medes and Persians.

The bear "raised up itself on one side" indicates the unequal union of these powers—Persia became the dominant partner. The three ribs likely represent the three major conquests that established Persian supremacy: **Lydia** (547 B.C.), **Babylon** (539 B.C.), and **Egypt** (525 B.C.).

[Q] **"How can we be certain these prophecies refer to specific historical empires?"**

Daniel 8 removes all doubt by naming two of these kingdoms explicitly: "The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia" (Daniel 8:20-21). Scripture interprets itself, leaving no room for speculation about the identity of at least two of these powers—and by extension, confirming the prophetic sequence.

#### The Four-Headed Leopard—Greece (331-168 B.C.)

> _"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it."_ (Daniel 7:6)

The leopard is known for speed and agility in attack. The addition of four wings emphasizes the unprecedented swiftness of Greek conquest under Alexander the Great, who conquered the known world in approximately ten years.

The **four heads** represent the fourfold division of Alexander's empire after his death in 323 B.C. His generals divided the territory:

- **Cassander**—Macedonia and Greece
- **Lysimachus**—Thrace and Asia Minor
- **Seleucus**—Syria and the East
- **Ptolemy**—Egypt and Palestine

[DYK🔎] Alexander the Great conquered more territory faster than any military leader before him. By age 30, he had created an empire stretching from Greece to India—approximately 2 million square miles. Yet he died at 32, and his empire immediately fractured, exactly as the four heads symbolized.

#### The Dreadful and Terrible Beast—Rome (168 B.C.—A.D. 476)

> _"After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns."_ (Daniel 7:7)

No known animal could represent this kingdom—it was unique in its ferocity and crushing power. The "great iron teeth" connect directly with the iron legs of Daniel 2, confirming this as Rome.

Rome conquered and absorbed all previous empires, breaking them utterly and absorbing their territories. It was "diverse from all the beasts that were before it"—Rome introduced concepts of law, citizenship, and governance unknown to previous empires.

[ILL] Consider how a mighty oak tree, though seemingly invincible, eventually yields not to a single catastrophic blow but to the gradual work of many smaller forces—wind, rain, insects, and time. So imperial Rome, though it seemed eternal to those who lived within it, was gradually divided by the migrations and invasions of the barbarian tribes, until what had been one great empire became many separate kingdoms.

### The Ten Horns—Division of Rome

> _"And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise."_ (Daniel 7:24)

As Rome declined, barbarian tribes carved the empire into separate kingdoms. Historians identify approximately ten major tribal groups that formed the basis of modern European nations:

1. Alemanni (Germans)
2. Franks (French)
3. Anglo-Saxons (English)
4. Burgundians (Swiss)
5. Visigoths (Spanish)
6. Suevi (Portuguese)
7. Lombards (Italians)
8. Heruli (destroyed)
9. Vandals (destroyed)
10. Ostrogoths (destroyed)

The prophecy continues with "another" horn rising among them (Daniel 7:24), but this extends beyond our present chapter reading into subsequent studies.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### God Rules Over the Kingdoms of Men

This prophecy powerfully demonstrates that "the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will" (Daniel 4:17). Empires rise and fall according to God's sovereign purpose, not by accident or mere human ambition.

> _"He changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings."_ (Daniel 2:21)

### The Decline of Human Glory

Notice the progression: from the noble lion to the lumbering bear, from the swift leopard to the nameless monster. While human kingdoms may increase in power, they decline in moral character. Gold gives way to silver, silver to bronze, bronze to iron, iron to clay mixed with iron. This reveals the trajectory of human government apart from God—increasing power coupled with decreasing glory.

### Prophecy Confirms Faith

Daniel 7 was written centuries before Greece or Rome existed as world powers, yet history fulfilled every detail with precision. This is God's signature upon His Word:

> _"I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did shew them suddenly, and they came to pass."_ (Isaiah 48:3)

When skeptics challenge the reliability of Scripture, fulfilled prophecy stands as irrefutable evidence of divine inspiration. No human prognosticator could predict the exact sequence and characteristics of empires spanning a thousand years.

## Practical Application

### Trust God's Control Over History

If God accurately predicted the rise and fall of great empires, we can trust Him with our individual lives. The same sovereign hand that guides nations guides His children through every circumstance.

### Study Prophecy Diligently

Jesus said, "When ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors" (Matthew 24:33). Prophetic study is not idle curiosity—it is preparation for Christ's return. We are to be watchmen, understanding the times.

### Live in Light of Eternity

These mighty empires—Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome—all passed away. "The world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever" (1 John 2:17). Invest in the eternal kingdom, not in the fleeting powers of earth.

### Stand Firm in Trial

The same God who preserved Daniel through Babylon's fall, through the lions' den, through regime changes, will preserve His faithful ones today. No earthly power can thwart His purposes or destroy His people.

## Appeal

> _"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him."_ (Daniel 7:27)

Friend, the empires of earth have risen and fallen exactly as God foretold. We live now in the time of the divided kingdoms—the toes of iron and clay—awaiting the stone cut without hands that shall break in pieces all earthly powers and stand forever.

Where is your citizenship? Is it in an earthly nation destined to pass away, or in the eternal kingdom of God? Christ invites you today to surrender your life to Him, to become a citizen of heaven, to prepare for His soon return.

The God who revealed the future to Daniel is the same God who calls you by name. Will you trust Him? Will you give Him your heart? Will you live for His eternal kingdom rather than the fleeting kingdoms of this world?

The choice is before you. May the Lord help you choose wisely, for eternity hangs in the balance.
