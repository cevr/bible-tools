# Bible Study: Wisdom—The Principal Thing

## Introduction

Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived apart from Christ, declared wisdom "the principal thing"—the first priority, the supreme pursuit. Yet true wisdom is not mere intellectual achievement or worldly cleverness. It is a divine gift, rooted in reverence for God and manifest in transformed character. This study explores the nature, source, and fruit of heavenly wisdom, and how we may obtain it for victorious Christian living.

## Core Truths

### Wisdom's Supreme Value

Scripture places wisdom above all earthly treasures:

> _"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom."_ (Proverbs 4:7)

> _"She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her."_ (Proverbs 3:15)

The Hebrew word for "principal" (_reshith_) means "first" or "chief"—the same word used in Genesis 1:1 for "beginning." Wisdom is not optional for the Christian; it is foundational. Without it, we stumble through life making decisions that lead to ruin. With it, we navigate every trial with divine guidance.

[DYK🔎] Solomon, who wrote most of Proverbs, could have asked God for anything—riches, long life, victory over enemies. Yet he asked for wisdom, and God was so pleased that He gave him everything else besides (1 Kings 3:9–13). This reveals what God values most.

### Wisdom's Promised Rewards

To those who embrace wisdom, God promises:

- **Promotion and honor**: _"Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honor"_ (Proverbs 4:8)
- **Grace and glory**: _"She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee"_ (Proverbs 4:9)

These are not merely earthly rewards but spiritual blessings—the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit (1 Peter 3:4), the crown of life promised to the faithful (James 1:12; Revelation 2:10).

## Deeper Truths

### The Source of True Wisdom

> _"For the Lord giveth wisdom."_ (Proverbs 2:6)

Wisdom cannot be manufactured by human effort or accumulated through mere study. It is a gift from above. The world's universities may produce knowledge, but only God can impart wisdom—the ability to rightly apply knowledge according to eternal principles.

[Q] **"Cannot I become wise through education and experience?"**

Education sharpens the mind, and experience teaches valuable lessons. But true wisdom—the kind that saves the soul and transforms the character—comes only from God. A man may have multiple degrees and yet be a fool in the things that matter most. Conversely, an unlettered believer who walks with God may possess wisdom that confounds the scholars (1 Corinthians 1:26–29). The Ethiopian eunuch was highly educated, yet he needed Philip to guide him into truth (Acts 8:30–31). Head knowledge without heart conversion produces only pride.

### How to Obtain Wisdom

> _"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."_ (James 1:5)

What a precious promise! God gives wisdom:

- **Liberally**—not sparingly, but abundantly
- **Without reproach**—He will not shame us for our ignorance or past failures

But there is a condition:

> _"But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord."_ (James 1:6–7)

Faith is the hand that receives God's gifts. The doubter, tossed about by every wind of circumstance and opinion, cannot grasp what God freely offers. This is not because God is unwilling, but because doubt refuses to receive.

[ILL] A father extends a gift to his child, but the child keeps pulling back his hand, uncertain whether to accept. The gift remains in the father's hand—not because of any reluctance on the father's part, but because the child will not take it. So God offers wisdom freely, but we must reach out in faith and take hold of it, trusting His word completely.

### The Beginning of Wisdom

> _"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments."_ (Psalm 111:10)

**The fear of the Lord**: This is not cringing terror but reverential awe—a profound respect for God's holiness, power, and authority that leads to humble obedience. It is the recognition that God is God, and we are not.

Notice the connection: _"a good understanding have all they that do His commandments."_ Wisdom is not merely intellectual—it is practical and moral. Those who obey God's law develop understanding. Obedience opens the mind to receive more light; disobedience closes it.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "fear" (_yirah_) in this verse carries the meaning of reverence, respect, and awe. It is the same attitude Isaiah experienced when he saw the Lord high and lifted up (Isaiah 6:1–5). This holy fear does not drive us from God but draws us to Him in humble worship.

### The Indwelling Presence and Deep Things of God

Jesus promised those who keep His words a most remarkable blessing:

> _"If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him."_ (John 14:23)

Here is the secret of true wisdom: the indwelling presence of the Father and the Son through the Holy Spirit. When heaven takes up residence in the heart, wisdom follows naturally.

> _"But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."_ (1 Corinthians 2:10)

What are these "deep things"?

> _"O Lord, how great are Thy works! and Thy thoughts are very deep."_ (Psalm 92:5)

God's works in creation, providence, and redemption contain inexhaustible depths. The plan of salvation—the sanctuary, the cross, the heavenly ministry of Christ—reveals wisdom that angels desire to look into (1 Peter 1:12). The Spirit of God searches these depths and reveals them to the humble, obedient heart.

### Transformation and the Renewed Mind

> _"Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God."_ (Romans 12:2)

This is righteousness by faith in action. We cannot renew our own minds any more than the Ethiopian can change his skin (Jeremiah 13:23). But when we yield to God, He transforms us—not outwardly first, but from within. The renewed mind can then discern God's will: what is good, acceptable, and perfect.

[Q] **"Can I really know God's specific will for my life?"**

Yes! God desires to reveal His will even more than we desire to know it. Through Scripture, through prayer, through providence, and through the counsel of godly believers, God guides those who sincerely seek Him. The condition is yieldedness: _"If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine"_ (John 7:17). The willing heart receives light; the resistant heart remains in darkness.

### The Visible Evidence of Wisdom

> _"Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed."_ (Ecclesiastes 8:1)

True wisdom produces visible transformation. Moses' face shone after communion with God (Exodus 34:29–35). Stephen's face appeared "as it had been the face of an angel" before the council (Acts 6:15). When heaven dwells within, heaven shines without. The hard, anxious, selfish lines of the countenance soften into peace, kindness, and holy joy.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Two Kinds of Wisdom

Paul draws a sharp distinction:

> _"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this world... But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory."_ (1 Corinthians 2:6–7)

> _"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God."_ (1 Corinthians 3:19)

**Worldly wisdom** exalts self, accumulates power, and seeks advantage over others. It produced the tower of Babel, the philosophy of Greece, and the schemes of modern secularism. It says, "There is no God" or "I am my own god."

**Divine wisdom** humbles self, surrenders power, and seeks the good of others. It produced the cross—the supreme demonstration of God's wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:23–24). To the world, the cross is foolishness. To the saved, it is the power and wisdom of God.

The great controversy between Christ and Satan is, at its heart, a conflict between these two wisdoms. Satan's way is self-exaltation (Isaiah 14:13–14). Christ's way is self-emptying love (Philippians 2:5–8). Every human heart must choose which wisdom to follow.

### The Character of Heavenly Wisdom

> _"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy."_ (James 3:17)

Notice the order: **first pure**. Purity is the foundation. Without holiness, the other qualities become mere sentimentality or weakness. But from purity flows:

- **Peaceable**—not contentious or divisive
- **Gentle**—not harsh or demanding
- **Easy to be entreated**—approachable, willing to listen
- **Full of mercy and good fruits**—compassionate action, not empty words
- **Without partiality**—treating all people fairly
- **Without hypocrisy**—genuine, transparent, consistent

This is the character of Christ. This is the fruit of the indwelling Spirit. This is what God produces in those who receive wisdom from above.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the lampstand in the Holy Place burned continually, representing the light of God's word and Spirit (Psalm 119:105). The priest who ministered there needed wisdom to perform the sacred service correctly.

In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ our High Priest ministers in perfect wisdom. He knows our needs, understands our weaknesses, and intercedes with divine insight (Hebrews 4:15–16). When we come to Him for wisdom, we approach One who has infinite resources and infinite willingness to share them.

The final generation—those prepared to meet Jesus at His coming—will need this wisdom supremely. In the time of trouble, when human wisdom fails completely, those who have learned to trust wholly in God will be guided by His Spirit through every perplexity (Isaiah 30:21).

## Practical Application

This truth calls us to:

1. **Prioritize wisdom above all earthly pursuits.** Career advancement, financial security, and social status are secondary. Ask yourself daily: "Am I growing in the wisdom that comes from God?"

2. **Ask God for wisdom in faith.** Not hesitantly, not doubting, but confidently claiming His promise (James 1:5). Make this a regular part of your prayer life: "Lord, give me wisdom for this decision, this relationship, this challenge."

3. **Cultivate the fear of the Lord.** Spend time contemplating God's holiness, His majesty, His power over all creation. Let awe and reverence grow in your heart. This is not optional mysticism—it is the very foundation of wisdom.

4. **Obey what you already know.** Understanding increases through obedience (Psalm 111:10). If you neglect known duty, you cannot expect greater light. Walk in the light you have, and more light will come.

5. **Surrender to the renewing of your mind.** Allow the Holy Spirit access to your thoughts, attitudes, and assumptions. Read Scripture not merely for information but for transformation.

6. **Reject worldly wisdom.** The counsel of the ungodly, the philosophy of secularism, the values of popular culture—these must be tested by Scripture and, where they conflict, rejected. "Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge" (Proverbs 19:27).

7. **Let your face shine.** As you receive wisdom from above, let it manifest in your countenance and conduct. Others should see in you the peace, gentleness, and purity that only heaven can give.

## Appeal

> _"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."_ (James 1:5)

Dear friend, do you lack wisdom? The promise is for you—today. God will not shame you for your past foolishness. He will not remind you of how often you have stumbled. He gives liberally, without reproach. Will you come to Him now in faith and ask?

The wisdom of this world is perishing with the world. But the wisdom from above leads to eternal life. It begins with reverential awe before a holy God and grows through humble obedience to His commandments. It transforms the mind, renews the character, and prepares the soul for heaven.

Choose wisdom—the principal thing. Exalt her, embrace her, and she will crown you with glory that will never fade.
