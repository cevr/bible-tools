### Q1. What is recommended as the principal thing to gain?

“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom.” — **Prov. 4:7.**

**Answer:** To make wisdom the "principal" thing means to assign it the highest
priority in life. In a world distracted by the pursuit of wealth, fame, and
pleasure, the Bible calls the believer to seek something far more enduring.

- **Defining Wisdom:** Biblical wisdom is not merely intellectual intelligence
  or the accumulation of facts. It is the ability to see life from God’s
  perspective and to apply His truth to daily living. It is "spiritual
  discernment" (1 Corinthians 2:14).
- **Christ Our Wisdom:** In the New Testament, we learn that Christ Himself "is
  made unto us wisdom" (1 Corinthians 1:30). Therefore, to "get wisdom" is to
  get Christ. It is to have His mind and His Spirit dwelling within.
- **The Foundation:** It is called the principal thing because without it, all
  other gains are temporary. A man may gain the whole world, but if he lacks the
  wisdom to secure his eternal soul, he has lost everything (Matthew 16:26).

**[ILL]** A ship’s captain may have a vessel with the fastest engines and the
finest sails, but if he lacks the compass and the chart (wisdom), his speed only
hastens his destruction on the rocks. So it is with human talent; without the
directing wisdom of God, our abilities may only lead us faster into error.

### Q2. What will this acquisition bring to those who obtain it?

“Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honor, when thou
dost embrace her. She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
glory shall she deliver to thee.” — **Prov. 4:8, 9.**

**Answer:** The rewards of divine wisdom are both for this life and the life to
come.

- **Promotion and Honor:** While the world seeks honor through self-promotion,
  the Bible teaches that "before honor is humility" (Proverbs 15:33). When a
  believer embraces the wisdom of God—which often looks like humility and
  service—God eventually exalts them in due time (1 Peter 5:6).
- **An Ornament of Grace:** This refers to the beauty of character.
  - **Definition:** _Grace_ is the unmerited favor of God and His enabling power
    working in the heart.
  - When we receive Christ’s wisdom, we receive His character. A "meek and quiet
    spirit" is an ornament of great price in the sight of God (1 Peter 3:4).
    This is **Sanctification**—the process of being made holy and beautiful in
    character by the indwelling Spirit.
- **A Crown of Glory:** This points to the final reward of the righteous. The
  wisdom that guides a man to the cross and keeps him in the narrow path will
  ultimately place a crown of life upon his brow (James 1:12).

**[ILL]** If a beggar embraces a prince, his rags are starkly visible. But when
a sinner embraces Wisdom (Christ), a "great exchange" happens: Christ takes our
rags of sin and clothes us in the "ornament" of His own righteousness (Isaiah
61:10).

---

### Q3. How are the things of earth to be compared to it?

“She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not
to be compared unto her.” — **Prov. 3:15.**

**Answer:** The value of wisdom exceeds all material wealth because wisdom is
eternal, while material wealth is fleeting.

- **The Limits of Wealth:** Rubies, gold, and silver can buy comfort, but they
  cannot buy peace of mind, forgiveness of sin, or entry into the Kingdom of
  Heaven. They cannot bribe the Judge of all the earth.
- **The Value of Truth:** The Psalmist declares God's law is "better unto me
  than thousands of gold and silver" (Psalm 119:72). Why? Because the Word of
  God converts the soul (Psalm 19:7).
- **Sanctuary Insight:** In the earthly sanctuary, gold was used to represent
  faith and love (Galatians 5:6; Revelation 3:18). The wisdom of God is the
  "gold tried in the fire"—a character tested and purified, which is the only
  treasure we can take with us to heaven.

**[ILL]** Imagine a man trapped in a burning desert. He finds a bag of diamonds.
Though they are worth millions in the city, in the desert they are worthless
because they cannot sustain life. He would trade them all for one cup of water.
In the spiritual desert of this world, material riches cannot save; we need the
Living Water of Jesus Christ (wisdom).

---

### Q4. Whence comes this precious acquirement?

“For the Lord giveth wisdom.” — **Prov. 2:6.**

**Answer:** True wisdom is supernatural in origin. It is a gift, not a human
invention.

- **The Source:** Just as the sun is the source of all light on earth, God is
  the Father of lights (James 1:17) and the source of all true understanding.
- **Not by Human Effort:** We cannot generate spiritual wisdom by university
  degrees or philosophical study. "The world by wisdom knew not God" (1
  Corinthians 1:21).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** This underscores the principle of dependence. Just
  as we cannot generate our own righteousness (Justification), we cannot
  generate our own wisdom. We must receive it from outside ourselves, from God
  alone.

---

### Q5. How may one obtain it?

“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” — **James 1:5.**

**Answer:** The condition for receiving wisdom is a sense of need and the act of
asking.

- **Acknowledging Lack:** The first step to wisdom is admitting we do not have
  it. "Blessed are the poor in spirit" (Matthew 5:3). Those who think they are
  already wise are effectively closed to God's guidance.
- **The Generosity of God:** God gives "liberally" (generously) and "upbraideth
  not" (does not scold or find fault). He does not mock our ignorance; He
  delights to teach us.
- **Prayer as the Key:** Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a
  friend. It is the appointed means of connecting our weakness to His strength.

**[ILL]** A loving father does not scold his toddler for not knowing how to walk
perfectly; he extends his hands to help. Even so, our Heavenly Father invites us
to ask for guidance, promising to supply it without making us feel small or
ashamed.

---

### Q6. What does this asking involve?

“But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave
of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he
shall receive anything of the Lord.” — **James 1:6, 7.**

**Answer:** The asking must be grounded in **faith**, which is taking God at His
word.

- **Faith Defined:** Faith is not a feeling; it is the substance of things hoped
  for (Hebrews 11:1). It is trusting that God is able and willing to keep His
  promises.
- **The Problem of Wavering:** To "waver" implies being double-minded (James
  1:8). This describes a person who asks for God's will but secretly plans to
  follow their own desires if God’s way is too difficult.
- **Total Surrender:** We cannot ask for wisdom to serve God _and_ Mammon.
  Victory over sin and true spiritual insight are given to those who have
  decided to be wholly on the Lord's side (Joshua 24:15).
- **Stability:** The wavering man is like the restless sea; the man of faith is
  anchored within the veil (Hebrews 6:19), resting on the immovable Rock, Christ
  Jesus.

---

### Q7. What is the beginning, or first state, of wisdom?

“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all
they that do His commandments: His praise endureth forever.” — **Ps. 111:10.**

**Answer:** Wisdom begins with a correct relationship to God's authority and His
law.

- **The Fear of the Lord:** This is not a crushing terror of punishment, but a
  deep, reverential awe of God’s holiness, justice, and love. It is the attitude
  of a saved sinner standing before the Infinite Creator. This links directly to
  the **First Angel's Message**: "Fear God, and give glory to him" (Revelation
  14:7).
- **Connection to the Law:** The verse explicitly links wisdom with "doing His
  commandments."
  - There is no true wisdom in rebellion.
  - To break the law of life (God's Ten Commandments) is the height of folly
    because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23).
- **Obedience by Faith:** We do not keep the commandments _to become_ wise or
  saved; rather, because we have received Christ (Wisdom) by faith, His Spirit
  writes the law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10), leading us to joyful obedience.

**[ILL]** A driver who ignores traffic laws claiming he is "too wise" for them
will soon crash. True wisdom recognizes that the laws were made for our safety
and happiness. Keeping the commandments is simply walking in the path where
God's blessings flow.

---

### Q8. What has the Saviour promised to those who will keep His words?

“If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and We
will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.” — **John 14:23.**

**Answer:** The promise is the personal, indwelling presence of the Father and
the Son through the Holy Spirit.

- **Love and Obedience:** Jesus clarifies that obedience is the fruit of love.
  "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). Legalism tries to obey _in
  order_ to be loved; the Gospel teaches we obey _because_ we are loved and love
  Him in return.
- **Making Their Abode:** This is the essence of the New Covenant. God does not
  just want to dwell in a tent or a stone temple; He wants to dwell in the human
  heart (1 Corinthians 6:19).
- **Imparted Righteousness:** When the Father and Son make their abode in us,
  the life of Christ replaces the life of self. This is the secret of overcoming
  sin: "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27).

---

### Q9. What among other things, will the Spirit of God do for those who are thus favored?

“But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit; for the Spirit searcheth all
things, yea, the deep things of God.” — **1 Cor. 2:10.**

**Answer:** The Holy Spirit acts as the divine Illuminator, revealing truths
that the natural mind cannot grasp.

- **The Role of the Spirit:** Jesus promised the Spirit would "guide you into
  all truth" (John 16:13). Without the Spirit, the Bible is a sealed book.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the Holy Place of the sanctuary, the seven-branched
  candlestick (representing the Holy Spirit) provided the only light. It shone
  upon the Table of Shewbread (the Word of God) and the Altar of Incense
  (Prayer). Only by the Holy Spirit’s light can we feed on the Word and offer
  acceptable prayer.
- **Searching the Deep Things:** The Spirit reveals the depths of God’s love and
  the plan of redemption, showing us the hideousness of sin and the beauty of
  holiness.

---

### Q10. What is included in these "deep things?"

“O Lord, how great are Thy works! and Thy thoughts are very deep.” — **Ps.
92:5.**

**Answer:** The "deep things" include the infinite wisdom displayed in creation
and the even greater mystery of redemption.

- **God's Works:** The complexity of the universe, from the stars to the atom,
  reveals a Designer of infinite depth.
- **God's Thoughts (The Plan of Salvation):** The deepest thought of God is the
  Atonement. How could a just God forgive rebels without destroying His law? The
  answer is the Cross. "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and
  peace have kissed each other" (Psalm 85:10).
  - **Definition - Atonement:** The work by which God reconciles humanity to
    Himself through the sacrifice and priestly ministry of Christ.
- **Eternal Study:** These deep things are what the angels desire to look into
  (1 Peter 1:12) and will be the science and song of the redeemed throughout
  eternity.

### Q11. How far may one hope to know the mind of God regarding himself?

“Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.” — **Rom. 12:2.**

**Answer:** We may know God's mind sufficiently to be completely transformed and
to understand His specific will for our lives.

- **Transformation:** The Greek word is _metamorphoo_ (metamorphosis). Just as a
  caterpillar is changed into a butterfly, the sinner is changed into a saint.
  This is not a superficial change, but a "renewing of the mind."
- **Non-Conformity:** "Be not conformed to this world." To know God's will, we
  must disconnect from the world's methods and philosophies.
- **Proving the Will of God:** As we walk by faith, obeying the light we have,
  we prove (test and experience) that God's will is indeed good and perfect. We
  find that His law is liberty (James 1:25).

**[ILL]** A dirty window cannot let in the sunlight clearly. The "renewing of
the mind" is the cleansing of the glass by the Holy Spirit so that the light of
God's will can shine through clearly.

---

### Q12. How will he appear who has been thus honored of God?

“Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's
wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.”
— **Eccl. 8:1.**

**Answer:** True wisdom affects the countenance. The peace and purity within are
reflected in the face.

- **Shining Face:** When Moses came down from the mount after communing with
  God, his face shone (Exodus 34:29). When Stephen stood before his accusers,
  his face was "as it had been the face of an angel" (Acts 6:15).
- **Character Change:** The "boldness" (or hardness/impudence) of the natural
  face is changed into the gentleness and serenity of Christ. Sin hardens the
  features; grace softens and illuminates them.
- **Witness:** This is a powerful witness to the world. A peaceful countenance
  in the midst of a troubled world testifies that the believer possesses a
  source of life that the world does not know.

---

### Q13. How many kinds of wisdom are there?

“Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect; yet not the wisdom of this
world... But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom,
which God ordained before the world unto our glory.” — **1 Cor. 2:6, 7.**

**Answer:** There are two distinct kinds of wisdom: the wisdom of this world and
the wisdom of God.

- **Wisdom of this World:** This is human philosophy, science falsely so-called,
  and reasoning that excludes God. It is based on pride and self-sufficiency.
- **Wisdom of God (Hidden Wisdom):** This is the Gospel. It is "hidden" to the
  natural man because it operates on principles opposite to the world—victory
  through surrender, life through death, greatness through service.
- **Great Controversy Context:** The conflict began with a false wisdom offered
  by the serpent ("Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil"). God's wisdom is
  the restoration of man through dependence on the Creator.

---

### Q14. How is worldly wisdom regarded by God?

“For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.” — **1 Cor. 3:19.**

**Answer:** God views human wisdom that ignores Him as utter foolishness.

- **Limitations of Human Reason:** Man tries to explain the universe without a
  Creator and solve the problem of sin without a Savior. These attempts always
  fail.
- **The Trap:** The verse continues, "He taketh the wise in their own
  craftiness." Human intellect, when divorced from God, often leads to
  destructive inventions and hopeless ideologies.
- **Humility Needed:** To enter the Kingdom, we must become as little children
  (Matthew 18:3). We must be willing to lay aside our intellectual pride and
  accept the simple, saving truths of Scripture.

**[ILL]** A man may be a brilliant mathematician, able to calculate the stars,
but if he cannot calculate the cost of his own soul, his wisdom is foolishness.
He is like a man who counts the grains of sand while a tidal wave approaches.

---

### Q15. What is the character of that wisdom which comes from God?

“But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and
easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and
without hypocrisy.” — **James 3:17.**

**Answer:** This verse describes the fruit of the Spirit—the character of Jesus
Christ reproduced in the believer.

- **First Pure:** Purity is the foundation. There is no true wisdom without
  holiness. We cannot compromise with sin to keep the peace ("peace at any
  price"). Righteousness must come first.
- **Then Peaceable:** Once the heart is pure (cleansed by the blood of Christ),
  true peace follows.
- **Gentle and Easy to be Intreated:** This means approachable and willing to
  yield in non-essentials. It is the opposite of stubbornness and pride.
- **Full of Mercy and Good Fruits:** Wisdom is practical. It results in acts of
  kindness and obedience.
- **Without Partiality or Hypocrisy:** It is sincere and treats all people with
  the value God places on them.
- **Conclusion:** This wisdom is nothing less than the **Imparted
  Righteousness** of Christ. When we "get wisdom" (Q1), we get this character.

**[ILL]** A tree is known by its fruit. Worldly wisdom produces pride, rivalry,
and ambition (James 3:14–16). Divine wisdom produces a life that looks like
Jesus—pure, kind, and obedient.
