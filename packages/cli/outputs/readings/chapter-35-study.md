# Reading 35: Our Pattern, Helper, and Friend

## Introduction

The Christian life is not merely a set of doctrines to believe or rules to follow—it is a living relationship with a Person. Jesus Christ came not only to die for us but to show us how to live, to walk beside us as Helper, and to befriend us with a love that never fails. In this study, we discover that the same Jesus who walked the dusty roads of Palestine now walks with us, offering His life as our pattern, His power as our help, and His heart as our truest friend.

## Core Truths

### Christ: Our Perfect Pattern

The apostle John presents a startling standard for Christian living:

> _"He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked."_ (1 John 2:6)

This is not mere imitation of external behavior but an inward transformation that reproduces Christ's life in us. Paul echoes this call:

> _"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus."_ (Philippians 2:5)

**The mind of Christ** is not something we manufacture through effort—it is something we receive through communion with Him. As we behold Him, we become changed (2 Corinthians 3:18).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "walk" (peripateo) in 1 John 2:6 means "to conduct one's life" or "to order one's behavior." John is saying that the whole course and conduct of our lives should mirror Christ's—not just occasional religious acts, but every moment of every day.

### The Pattern Demonstrated in Every Stage of Life

**In Childhood**: Even as a boy, Jesus demonstrated perfect submission to parental authority:

> _"And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them."_ (Luke 2:51)

Here is a lesson for every young person: obedience to parents is not weakness but Christlikeness. The Creator of the universe willingly placed Himself under the authority of a carpenter and his wife.

**In Growth**: _"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man."_ (Luke 2:52)

Notice the fourfold development: intellectual ("wisdom"), physical ("stature"), spiritual ("favor with God"), and social ("favor with man"). Jesus grew in every dimension of human life, showing us that true religion develops the whole person.

[Q] **"If Jesus was God, why did He need to grow and develop?"**

This touches the mystery of the Incarnation. Jesus took upon Himself true humanity. He did not merely appear human—He became human in every sense except sin (Hebrews 4:15). His growth was real, demonstrating that humanity, rightly related to God, can develop perfectly. This gives us hope: if Jesus could grow in favor with God as a man dependent upon the Father, so can we through the same means He used—prayer, the Word, and obedience.

**In Baptism**: Though sinless, Jesus submitted to baptism:

> _"Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness."_ (Matthew 3:15)

Jesus identified Himself fully with sinful humanity. In baptism, He consecrated Himself to His mission as the Lamb of God. His example teaches us that baptism is not optional for those who follow Him—it is the appointed means of publicly identifying with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Romans 6:3-5).

### The Pattern in Daily Habits

**In Prayer**: _"He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."_ (Luke 6:12)

If the Son of God needed prayer, how much more do we? Jesus prayed before every major decision, in times of crisis, and as the regular habit of His life. Prayer was not peripheral to His ministry—it was the very source of His power.

[DYK🔎] The Gospels record Jesus praying at least twenty-five times. He prayed at His baptism (Luke 3:21), before choosing the twelve disciples (Luke 6:12-13), at the transfiguration (Luke 9:28-29), before teaching the Lord's Prayer (Luke 11:1), in Gethsemane (Matthew 26:36-44), and on the cross (Luke 23:34, 46). His entire ministry was saturated with prayer.

**In Service**: _"Who went about doing good."_ (Acts 10:38)

This simple summary of Christ's life is profoundly challenging. He did not merely avoid evil—He actively did good wherever He went. His life was a constant ministry to human need: healing the sick, comforting the sorrowing, feeding the hungry, teaching the ignorant, and liberating the oppressed.

**In Sacrifice**: _"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich."_ (2 Corinthians 8:9)

[ILL] Imagine the wealthiest person on earth voluntarily leaving every comfort—palaces, servants, luxury—to live in a homeless shelter, working as a day laborer, all to help people who despised and rejected him. This faintly illustrates what Christ did. He left the infinite riches of heaven—the adoration of angels, the glory of the Father's presence—to be born in a stable, live as a peasant, and die as a criminal. Why? "For your sakes." This was not obligation but love.

**In Suffering**: _"Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously."_ (1 Peter 2:23)

When falsely accused, mocked, beaten, and crucified, Jesus did not retaliate. Instead, He prayed: _"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."_ (Luke 23:34)

This is the ultimate test of character—how we respond when wronged. Human nature demands revenge; divine nature extends forgiveness. The pattern Christ left us is supernatural, possible only through His indwelling Spirit.

## Deeper Truths

### Christ: Our Mighty Helper

Having established Christ as our pattern, we must immediately ask: How can sinful, fallen beings walk as He walked? The answer is glorious—Christ is not only our example but our enabler.

> _"I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save."_ (Isaiah 63:1)

**Mighty to save**—not merely willing, but able; not merely sympathetic, but powerful. The same Jesus who shows us how to live gives us the power to live that way.

> _"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."_ (Luke 19:10)

Christ came on a rescue mission. He seeks us before we seek Him. He saves us when we cannot save ourselves.

### Perfect Through Suffering

> _"For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."_ (Hebrews 2:10)

[Q] **"How could Jesus be 'made perfect' through suffering if He was already sinless?"**

The "perfecting" here is not moral (He was always sinless) but experiential and vocational. Through suffering, Jesus qualified Himself experientially to be our sympathetic High Priest. He knows by experience what temptation and suffering feel like. His perfection as Savior was completed when He passed through every trial humanity faces and emerged victorious.

This has profound implications:

> _"For in that He himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted."_ (Hebrews 2:18)

**"Succour"** (Greek: boetheo) means "to run to the cry of"—like a mother rushing to help her child. When we cry out in temptation, Jesus runs to our aid. He understands. He sympathizes. And He delivers.

### Saved to the Uttermost

> _"Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them."_ (Hebrews 7:25)

[DYK🔎] The Greek phrase translated "to the uttermost" (eis to panteles) can mean both "completely" (in scope) and "forever" (in time). Christ's salvation is total in extent—reaching the worst sinner—and eternal in duration—keeping us for all eternity. No sin is too great, no bondage too strong, no case too hopeless for His saving power.

Notice the present tense: _"He ever liveth to make intercession."_ This points us to Christ's ongoing ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. His death on the cross was not the end of His saving work but the foundation for His continuing ministry as our High Priest. Right now, at this very moment, Jesus lives and intercedes for you.

### Kept From Falling

> _"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy."_ (Jude 24)

Here is the answer to every discouraged heart: Christ is able to **keep you from falling**. Not merely to pick you up after you fall, but to prevent the fall altogether. This is complete salvation—deliverance not only from sin's penalty (justification) but from sin's power (sanctification).

**"Faultless"**—without blemish, without spot. This is Christ's goal for His people: to present us before the Father's throne as perfect as if we had never sinned. This is not mere legal fiction but actual character transformation accomplished by His indwelling Spirit.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

Christ's work as our Pattern, Helper, and Friend connects beautifully with the sanctuary message:

- **Outer Court (the Cross)**: Here Jesus became our sacrifice, paying the penalty for sin and becoming our perfect Pattern of self-sacrificing love.

- **Holy Place (Daily Ministry)**: Here Jesus serves as our Helper, interceding for us, sending the Holy Spirit (represented by the candlestick's light), feeding us with the bread of His Word (table of showbread), and presenting our prayers before the Father (altar of incense).

- **Most Holy Place (Investigative Judgment)**: Here Jesus works to present us "faultless"—cleansing not only the record of sin but the believer's character, preparing a people who will stand without a mediator during the time of trouble.

### The Great Controversy and Christ's Example

Satan's original accusation was that God's law could not be kept—that obedience was impossible. By living a sinless life in human flesh, Jesus answered this charge. He proved that humanity, empowered by divine grace, can obey God perfectly.

But more than this, Jesus demonstrated that God's government is not arbitrary or harsh. By His life of love and service, Jesus revealed the Father's character. _"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father"_ (John 14:9). The great controversy is ultimately about God's character—whether He is worthy of worship and trust. Jesus settled this question forever.

### Righteousness by Faith in Practice

The pattern Christ left us can only be reproduced through faith:

- **Imputed righteousness**: Christ's perfect life is credited to our account the moment we believe (Romans 4:5; 2 Corinthians 5:21).

- **Imparted righteousness**: Christ's life is reproduced in us as we abide in Him daily (John 15:4-5; Galatians 2:20).

We do not earn salvation by imitating Christ. Rather, being saved by grace through faith, we are empowered to walk as He walked. The pattern is not a ladder we climb to reach God but a life God reproduces in us as we surrender to Him.

[ILL] A young artist once desired to copy a masterpiece by Rembrandt. For months he studied the painting, analyzing every brushstroke and color. Then he attempted to reproduce it. Despite his best efforts, his copy was crude and lifeless. Finally, an old master painter took pity on him. "You cannot copy from the outside," the master said. "You must let Rembrandt's spirit enter you." The master then guided the young artist's hand, and together they produced a true work of art. So it is with following Christ. We cannot imitate Him by our own efforts. We must let His Spirit enter us, guide us, and work through us. Then His life will be reproduced in ours—not as a copy, but as a living reality.

## Christ: Our Truest Friend

### The Invitation to Friendship

> _"Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends."_ (John 15:15)

[DYK🔎] In the ancient world, to be called "friend of the king" was the highest honor a subject could receive. It meant having access to the king's presence, knowing his plans, and sharing his confidence. Jesus offers us this exalted position—not servants awaiting orders, but friends sharing His heart.

What makes this friendship possible?

- **He shares His plans with us**: _"All things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you"_ (John 15:15).
- **He laid down His life for us**: _"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends"_ (John 15:13).
- **He invites us into intimate communion**: _"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock"_ (Revelation 3:20).

### The Character of This Friend

> _"There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother."_ (Proverbs 18:24)

Human friendships, even the best, are limited. Brothers may fail us; friends may forsake us. But Jesus "sticketh closer"—He adheres, He clings, He never lets go. His love is not based on our performance but on His covenant faithfulness.

> _"A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity."_ (Proverbs 17:17)

**"At all times"**—not only when we are lovable, successful, or faithful. Christ loved us when we were enemies (Romans 5:8). He loves us in our failures, our doubts, our worst moments. This is not human friendship but divine love in friendship form.

[Q] **"Can I really call Jesus my 'friend'? Isn't that too familiar, too casual?"**

It would be presumptuous for us to claim such intimacy—but it is glorious that He invites it. Jesus used this term first, not us. He wants us to approach Him not with cringing fear but with loving trust. Yes, He is the Creator, the King of kings, the Judge of all. But He is also the One who washed His disciples' feet, wept at Lazarus's grave, and called a betrayer "friend" (Matthew 26:50). His majesty does not diminish His tenderness; His holiness does not prevent His accessibility.

## Practical Application

### Walking as He Walked

Based on Christ's example, here are specific ways we can follow His pattern:

1. **In the home**: Be subject to proper authority; honor parents; create harmony in family relationships (Luke 2:51).

2. **In growth**: Pursue balanced development—intellectual, physical, spiritual, and social. Neglect none of these (Luke 2:52).

3. **In ordinances**: Follow Christ in baptism and other appointed means of grace. If you have not been baptized by immersion upon confession of faith, consider following your Lord's example (Matthew 3:15).

4. **In prayer**: Establish regular times for communion with God. If Jesus needed all-night prayer sessions, we certainly need earnest, sustained prayer (Luke 6:12).

5. **In service**: Look for opportunities to do good. Ask each day, "Who needs my help? How can I bless someone?" (Acts 10:38)

6. **In sacrifice**: Be willing to give up comfort, possessions, and preference for the good of others (2 Corinthians 8:9).

7. **In suffering**: When wronged, do not retaliate. Commit your cause to God and pray for those who misuse you (1 Peter 2:23; Luke 23:34).

### Receiving His Help

Remember that Christ is not only your example but your enabler:

- **When tempted**: Call upon Him who is "able to succour them that are tempted" (Hebrews 2:18).
- **When fallen**: Return to Him who saves "to the uttermost" (Hebrews 7:25).
- **When discouraged**: Trust Him who is "able to keep you from falling" (Jude 24).

### Cultivating His Friendship

- **Spend time with Him**: You cannot be friends with someone you never talk to. Daily communion through prayer and Bible study deepens friendship with Jesus.
- **Share your heart**: A friend loves at all times—tell Him everything, hold nothing back.
- **Trust His love**: When circumstances seem dark, remember: He "sticketh closer than a brother."

## Appeal

> _"For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."_ (Hebrews 2:10)

Jesus passed through every trial, every temptation, every suffering—and He did it for you. He walked the path before you so that He could walk it with you.

Today, will you accept Him as your **Pattern**—surrendering to walk as He walked?

Will you receive Him as your **Helper**—trusting His power to save you completely?

Will you embrace Him as your **Friend**—opening your heart to the closest, truest companion you will ever know?

He stands at the door of your heart and knocks. He does not force entry—He waits for your invitation. Open to Him today. He has called you "friend." Will you call Him yours?

_"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."_ (Jude 24-25)
