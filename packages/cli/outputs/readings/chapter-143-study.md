### Q1. What was the character of Zacharias, and Elizabeth?

**“And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord blameless.” Luke 1:6.**

**Answer:** The Bible presents Zacharias and Elizabeth as examples of genuine,
practical godliness. Their character reveals that God has always had a people
who, by His grace, live in harmony with His will.

- **Righteousness Defined:** To be "righteous" means to be in right standing
  with God and to do what is right in His eyes.
  - **Justification:** They were accounted righteous not because of their own
    merits, but through faith in the promised Messiah (Romans 4:3).
  - **Sanctification:** This faith produced fruit. They were "walking" in
    obedience. True faith always works by love and purifies the soul (Galatians
    5:6).
- **Commandments and Ordinances:**
  - The **Commandments** refer to the moral law, the Ten Commandments, which
    reflect God's unchangeable character (Psalm 119:172).
  - The **Ordinances** refer to the ceremonial laws and religious statutes given
    to Israel to point them to the coming Savior.
- **Blameless:** This does not mean they were sinless by nature or never made
  mistakes, but that their hearts were loyal to God. When they failed, they
  utilized the provisions of grace (the sacrifices pointing to Christ) to be
  restored. They did not cherish known sin.

**[ILL]** Imagine a healthy fruit tree. The root is hidden underground—that is
faith in God. The fruit is visible to everyone—that is obedience to the
commandments. Zacharias and Elizabeth did not staple plastic fruit onto dead
branches (legalism); rather, their obedience was the natural outgrowth of a
living connection with God.

### Q2. What was obligatory under the old covenant besides the ten commandments?

**“Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a
worldly sanctuary.” Heb. 9:1.**

**Answer:** Under the old covenant administration, God provided a system to
teach the plan of salvation. While the Ten Commandments defined sin (Romans
7:7), the ceremonial system showed the remedy for sin.

- **Ordinances of Divine Service:** These were the specific instructions
  regarding the priesthood, the sacrifices, and the feast days.
- **A Worldly Sanctuary:** The word "worldly" here simply means "earthly" or
  made of materials from this world (gold, silver, wood, linen), as opposed to
  the heavenly sanctuary which the Lord pitched, and not man (Hebrews 8:2).
- **The Purpose:** This earthly sanctuary was a "schoolmaster" or visual aid to
  lead the people to Christ (Galatians 3:24). It was God’s way of dwelling among
  His people and teaching them the holiness of His law and the cost of their
  salvation.

---

### Q3. In what did these ordinances consist?

**“Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal
ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.” Heb. 9:10.**

**Answer:** The ceremonial law consisted of external rites that symbolized
internal truths.

- **Meats and Drinks:** These refer to the various meal offerings and drink
  offerings (libations) presented in the sanctuary service (Leviticus 23), not
  to the health laws regarding clean and unclean animals (which predate the
  ceremonial law, see Genesis 7:2).
- **Divers Washings:** Ceremonial cleansings that taught the necessity of purity
  and the washing away of sin (Leviticus 15).
- **Time of Reformation:** These ceremonies were temporary. They were "imposed"
  or assigned as a duty until Christ, the Reality, should come. When the
  substance appears, the shadow is no longer needed.

**Definition:** **Ceremonial Law:** The temporary system of types, symbols, and
sacrifices pointing forward to the cross of Christ.

---

### Q4. What did these prefigure?

**“For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of
the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year
continually, make the comers thereunto perfect.” Heb. 10:1.**

**Answer:** The entire ceremonial system was a "shadow" cast by the cross of
Christ back across history.

- **Shadow vs. Image:** A shadow can show the outline of an object, but it has
  no substance. You cannot grasp a shadow. Similarly, the blood of bulls and
  goats was a shadow; Christ is the Substance.
- **Limitations of the Shadow:** The animal sacrifices could not cleanse the
  conscience or change the human heart ("make the comers thereunto perfect").
  They provided legal ritual cleansing, but they could not eradicate the power
  of sin from the soul.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Even in the Old Testament, believers were not
  saved by the blood of animals, but by faith in the "good things to come"—the
  perfect sacrifice of Jesus.

**[ILL]** If you are lost in a dark cave and see a shadow of a man on the wall,
you know help is near. But the shadow cannot lift you up or carry you out. You
must wait for the man who casts the shadow. The Old Testament saints saw the
shadow and had faith in the Man (Christ) who was coming to save them.

---

### Q5. Why was it necessary for them to offer these sacrifices?

**“And if anyone of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth
somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which
ought not to be done, and be guilty; or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come
to his knowledge; then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female
without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.” Lev. 4:27, 28.**

**Answer:** Sacrifices were necessary to impress upon the sinner the terrible
reality of sin and its penalty.

- **Acknowledgment of Guilt:** When a person broke the Ten Commandments
  ("commandments of the Lord"), they incurred guilt. The law condemns the sinner
  to death (Romans 6:23).
- **Transfer of Sin:** By laying his hand on the head of the innocent victim and
  confessing his sin (Leviticus 4:29), the sinner symbolically transferred his
  guilt to the substitute.
- **Cost of Forgiveness:** The sinner had to slay the animal with his own hand.
  This visceral act taught that "without shedding of blood is no remission"
  (Hebrews 9:22) and that my sin causes the death of the Innocent One.

---

### Q6. Could these offerings take away their sins?

**“For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away
sins.” Heb. 10:4.**

**Answer:** No animal possesses moral character or free will; therefore, an
animal cannot truly substitute for a moral being made in the image of God.

- **The Problem:** Sin is a moral issue—rebellion against God's government of
  love.
- **The Solution:** Only a Life equal to the broken law could pay the price for
  its transgression. Only the Creator could redeem His creation.
- **The Void:** The rivers of blood flowing from Jewish altars for centuries
  could not wash away a single spot of sin in reality; they served only as a
  credit card slip, acknowledging a debt that Christ would pay in full at
  Calvary.

**Definition:** **Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man; the covering
of sin. In the Old Testament, it was symbolic; in Christ, it is actual.

---

### Q7. To what did they look forward?

**“Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering
thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared Me.” Heb. 10:5.**

**Answer:** The entire system looked forward to the Incarnation of Jesus Christ.

- **"Sacrifice... thou wouldst not":** God did not delight in the death of
  animals. He desired the obedience and love that the sacrifices represented.
- **"A Body Hast Thou Prepared Me":** This is the mystery of godliness. Christ,
  who is fully God, took upon Himself human nature (a body).
  - As God, He could offer an infinite sacrifice.
  - As Man, He could suffer and die in man's place.
- **The Purpose of the Body:** Christ took a body so that He could live a
  perfect life of obedience (sanctification) and die a sacrificial death
  (justification) for us.

---

### Q8. Where were the ten commandments written under the old covenant?

**“And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to Me into the mount, and be there: and
I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have
written; that thou mayest teach them.” Ex. 24:12.**

**Answer:** Under the administration of the old covenant, the law was written on
tables of stone.

- **Stone:** This signifies the durability and unchangeable nature of God's law.
  It stands fast forever and ever (Psalm 111:7-8).
- **External:** However, a law on stone is external to the man. It confronts him
  with a standard he cannot reach in his own strength. It says "Thou shalt not,"
  but gives no power to obey.
- **The Human Condition:** The stony tables mirrored the "stony heart" of
  unconverted man (Ezekiel 36:26).

---

### Q9. What was to be done with these commandments when the new covenant came in force?

**“But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel:
After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and
write it in their hearts.” Jer. 31:33 (Heb. 8:8-10).**

**Answer:** The New Covenant does not abolish the law; it relocates it.

- **Internalization:** God promises to take the same law that was on the stone
  (the standard of righteousness) and write it on the heart (the seat of
  affections and will).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** When the law is written in the heart, obedience
  becomes natural and joyful. We obey not to _be_ saved, but because we _are_
  saved and we love the Lawgiver (John 14:15).
- **Power:** The "writing" is done by the Spirit of the living God (2
  Corinthians 3:3). This is the experience of true sanctification—Christ living
  His life of perfect obedience within the believer.

**[ILL]** If you tell a statue, "Do not fall over," it obeys only because it is
stone. But if you have a living child, you teach them to walk. The law on stone
is like the statue; the law in the heart is like the instinct of a living
creature. The New Covenant gives us a new nature that loves to do God's will.

---

### Q10. Having God's commandments in the heart, should we also keep Christ and His sufferings in mind?

**“By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you,
unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that
which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures.” 1 Cor. 15:2, 3.**

**Answer:** Yes. We can never separate the Law from the Gospel.

- **The Source of Life:** The law is the standard of character, but the Gospel
  (Christ's death and resurrection) is the power that transforms us to meet that
  standard.
- **Memory:** We must constantly "keep in memory" the price paid for our
  redemption. If we lose sight of the Cross, the law becomes a burden, and we
  slide into legalism or despair.
- **Saved by the Gospel:** Paul emphasizes that we are saved by holding fast to
  the truth of Christ's sacrifice. It is the contemplation of His love that
  melts the heart and allows Him to write His law there (2 Corinthians 5:14).

---

### Q11. Is it enough simply to believe in the death of Christ?

**“For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which
sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him.” 1 Thess. 4:14.**

**Answer:** No, we must also believe in His resurrection.

- **A Living Savior:** A dead Savior could forgive the past, perhaps, but He
  could not give power for the future. Because He lives, we shall live also
  (John 14:19).
- **Intercession:** He rose to become our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary,
  where He now ministers the merits of His blood to blot out our sins and
  vindicate God's character (Hebrews 7:25).
- **Hope:** His resurrection is the guarantee of our own resurrection at the
  last day.

---

### Q12. By what act do we commemorate the resurrection of Christ?

**“Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the
faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead.” Col. 2:12.**

**Answer:** Baptism by immersion is the divinely appointed memorial of Christ's
resurrection.

- **Symbolism:**
  - **Going down:** Represents death to the old life of sin (crucifixion of the
    "old man").
  - **Under water:** Represents burial.
  - **Coming up:** Represents the resurrection to "newness of life" (Romans
    6:4).
- **Faith:** It is not the water that saves, but the "faith of the operation of
  God." It is a public act of faith in Christ’s power to cleanse and renew.

**Definition:** **Baptism:** From the Greek _baptizo_, meaning to dip, plunge,
or immerse completely.

---

### Q13. But what should always precede baptism?

**“Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the
name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.” Acts 2:38.**

**Answer:** Baptism has no value without genuine repentance.

- **Sequence:** First repentance, then baptism. You cannot bury a person who is
  still alive; likewise, the "old man of sin" must die through repentance before
  he is buried in the waters of baptism.
- **Remission:** Baptism is for the "remission" (forgiveness/removal) of sins.
  It serves as the formal entry into the covenant of grace.

**Definition:** **Repentance:** A deep, heartfelt sorrow for sin produced by the
Holy Spirit, accompanied by a turning away from sin and a turning toward God (2
Corinthians 7:10).

---

### Q14. Toward whom must repentance be exercised?

**“And have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the
Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord
Jesus Christ.” Acts 20:20, 21.**

**Answer:** The Bible specifies a dual focus for conversion:

1.  **Repentance toward God:** Why toward God? Because it is God's law that has
    been broken. Sin is an offense against the Father's government. We must
    acknowledge our rebellion against the Lawgiver.
2.  **Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ:** Why faith in Christ? Because we
    cannot atone for our own sin against the Lawgiver. We must look to the
    Mediator and Substitute who paid the debt.

**Note:** One cannot exist without the other. Repentance without faith is
despair (like Judas). Faith without repentance is presumption.

---

### Q15. Then by being baptized, what does one signify to the world?

**“For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.”
Gal. 3:27.**

**Answer:** Baptism is a public declaration that the believer has "put on"
Christ.

- **Imputed Righteousness:** We put on His robe of righteousness to cover our
  past sins (Justification).
- **Imparted Righteousness:** We put on His character, allowing Him to live His
  life through us (Sanctification).
- **Identity:** The baptized believer no longer identifies with the world, but
  with the King of Heaven. They are now a "Christian"—a little Christ.

**[ILL]** A soldier wears a uniform to signify which army he belongs to. He is
under the protection and the command of his general. Baptism is the uniform of
the Christian. We signify to the universe that we have changed sides in the
Great Controversy.

---

### Q16. How is the death of Christ to be commemorated?

**“For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's
death till He come.” 1 Cor. 11:26.**

**Answer:** While baptism commemorates the resurrection, the Lord's Supper
(Communion) commemorates the death of Christ.

- **"Show the Lord's Death":** It is a visible sermon. By partaking, we declare
  that our spiritual life depends entirely on the broken body and spilled blood
  of the Savior.
- **"Till He Come":** This ordinance spans the time between the first and second
  advents. It links the cross (what He did) with the crown (what He will do). It
  is a feast of hope.

---

### Q17. When and by whom was this ordinance instituted?

**“The Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread; and when
He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is My body, which is
broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me.” 1 Cor. 11:23, 24.**

**Answer:** This ordinance was instituted by Jesus Himself on the eve of His
crucifixion, replacing the Passover.

- **Symbols:** The bread represents His body. It was "broken" for us—signifying
  the immense suffering He endured to satisfy the claims of the law on our
  behalf.
- **Remembrance:** It is a memorial service. We do not re-sacrifice Christ (as
  in the mass); we remember the one-time, all-sufficient sacrifice He made
  (Hebrews 10:12).
- **Spiritual Feeding:** As the body is sustained by physical bread, the soul is
  sustained by partaking of the Word and the presence of Christ by faith (John
  6:53-63).

---

### Q18. What is signified by the cup?

**“After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying, This
cup is the new testament in My blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in
remembrance of Me.” 1 Cor. 11:25.**

**Answer:** The cup of unfermented wine (symbolizing pure blood, see Deut 32:14)
represents the blood of the New Covenant.

- **New Testament (Covenant):** A covenant is a binding agreement. God's
  covenant is His promise to save us and write His law in our hearts.
- **In My Blood:** In ancient times, covenants were ratified (sealed) by blood.
  The blood of animals ratified the Old Covenant (Exodus 24:8). The blood of
  Jesus ratified the New Covenant. It guarantees that God will keep His promises
  to us if we abide in Him.

---

### Q19. What was done by Christ and the disciples after partaking of the communion?

**“And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives.” Matt.
26:30.**

**Answer:** They concluded the service with a hymn of praise.

- **Victory in Suffering:** Even though Jesus knew He was going to the agony of
  Gethsemane and the cross, He sang. This teaches us that the joy of the Lord is
  our strength, even in the darkest hour.
- **Pattern:** This sets a pattern for our worship services to end with praise
  and thanksgiving for the atoning work of Christ.

---

### Q20. If one refuses to obey God, can he be profited by partaking of the communion?

**“Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord,
unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.” 1 Cor. 11:27.**

**Answer:** The ordinance brings a blessing only to those who partake with a
repentant and believing heart.

- **Unworthily:** This refers to the _manner_ of eating, not the _merit_ of the
  person. We are all unworthy sinners in ourselves. To eat "unworthily" means to
  treat the service as a common meal, or to partake while cherishing known sin
  without repentance, or to harbor hatred against a brother (see Matthew
  5:23-24).
- **Guilty:** To treat the symbols with indifference is to disrespect the
  sacrifice they represent.
- **Self-Examination:** The verse following (v. 28) says, "But let a man examine
  himself." The preparation for communion is a time for soul-searching,
  confession, and clearing the "king's highway" in our hearts. It is a time to
  renew our vows of obedience and faith.

**[ILL]** If a man carries a photo of his wife in his wallet but is unfaithful
to her in his life, the photo becomes a testimony against him. So it is with
Communion: if we hold the symbols of Christ's love in our hands but refuse Him
entrance to our hearts through obedience, the ordinance does not save us; it
condemns our hypocrisy. But for the struggling, repentant soul, it is strength
and life.
