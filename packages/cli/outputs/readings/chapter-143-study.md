# Bible Study: The Lord's Supper

## Introduction

The Lord's Supper stands as one of the most sacred ordinances given to the Christian church—a divinely appointed memorial of Christ's sacrifice that connects the believer's heart to Calvary. This study traces the golden thread from the Old Testament sacrificial system through to the New Covenant memorial, revealing how God has always sought to write His truth not merely on stone tablets but upon human hearts. Through understanding this ordinance, we discover the profound depths of God's plan to keep the cross ever before His people "till He come."

## Core Truths

### The Foundation of True Worship

Scripture presents Zacharias and Elizabeth as models of genuine piety:

> _"And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless."_ (Luke 1:6)

**Righteousness before God** encompasses both the moral law (the Ten Commandments) and the ceremonial ordinances He has instituted. True believers in every age have honored both the eternal principles of God's character and the specific observances He has appointed for their time.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "blameless" (_amemptos_) doesn't mean sinless perfection, but rather that Zacharias and Elizabeth walked in humble, sincere obedience, confessing their sins and trusting in God's mercy—the same faith that brings righteousness to believers today.

### The Old Covenant System: Shadow and Substance

The first covenant included specific ordinances of divine service:

> _"Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary."_ (Hebrews 9:1)

These ordinances consisted of:

- **Meats and drinks** (sacrificial meals and drink offerings)
- **Divers washings** (ceremonial purifications)
- **Carnal ordinances** (physical rituals pointing forward to spiritual realities)

All of these were _"imposed on them until the time of reformation"_ (Hebrews 9:10)—that is, until Christ's coming would bring the reality to which they pointed.

### The Purpose of Sacrifice

When an Israelite sinned, even through ignorance, he was required to bring a sacrifice:

> _"Then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned."_ (Leviticus 4:28)

Yet these animal sacrifices could never actually remove sin:

> _"For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins."_ (Hebrews 10:4)

[Q] **"If animal sacrifices couldn't take away sin, what was their purpose?"**

The sacrificial system served as a divine object lesson, teaching several vital truths:

1. **The seriousness of sin**—it costs life
2. **The necessity of substitution**—another must die in the sinner's place
3. **The promise of a coming Redeemer**—One whose sacrifice would truly atone

Every lamb slain pointed forward to _"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"_ (John 1:29).

## Deeper Truths

### From Shadow to Substance

The law had only _"a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things"_ (Hebrews 10:1). Christ Himself was the substance casting that shadow:

> _"Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared Me."_ (Hebrews 10:5)

The Father prepared a human body for the eternal Son—that He might offer the one sacrifice capable of truly cleansing the conscience and reconciling man to God.

[ILL] Consider an artist's preliminary sketch compared to the finished masterpiece. The sketch suggests, outlines, and hints—but lacks the color, depth, and life of the final painting. So the sacrificial system sketched the gospel in types and shadows, while Christ's sacrifice revealed the glorious reality in all its fullness. We who live after the cross see what Abraham and Moses could only dimly perceive.

### The Law Written on the Heart

Under the old covenant, God's commandments were written on tables of stone (Exodus 24:12). But the new covenant brings a transformative change—not in the law itself, but in its location:

> _"I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts."_ (Jeremiah 31:33)

**The moral law remains unchanged**—the same Ten Commandments that reveal God's character of love. What changes is the believer's relationship to that law. Through the indwelling Spirit and the new birth, obedience becomes not an external burden but an internal delight.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "heart" (_leb_) encompasses the entire inner person—mind, will, and affections. When God writes His law on the heart, He transforms the believer's thinking, desires, and choices from the inside out.

### The Two Great Memorials

The Christian faith rests upon two great realities that must never be forgotten:

1. **Christ died for our sins** (the cross)
2. **Christ rose again** (the resurrection)

Paul declares: _"If ye keep in memory what I preached unto you... Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures"_ (1 Corinthians 15:2, 3). And again: _"If we believe that Jesus died and rose again"_ (1 Thessalonians 4:14).

God has given two ordinances to commemorate these foundational events:

| Event                     | Memorial Ordinance | Scripture           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Christ's **Resurrection** | Baptism            | Colossians 2:12     |
| Christ's **Death**        | Lord's Supper      | 1 Corinthians 11:26 |

### Baptism: Commemorating the Resurrection

> _"Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead."_ (Colossians 2:12)

Baptism by immersion visibly dramatizes the gospel:

- **Going down into the water** = burial with Christ (death to the old life)
- **Rising from the water** = resurrection with Christ (newness of life)

But baptism must follow genuine **repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ** (Acts 20:21). Without the heart change, the outward form profits nothing.

> _"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ."_ (Galatians 3:27)

[Q] **"Can someone be saved without baptism?"**

Baptism is Christ's command for all who believe (Mark 16:16; Matthew 28:19). While circumstances may prevent baptism (such as the thief on the cross), willful refusal to follow Christ's clear instruction reveals a heart not fully surrendered. Baptism itself doesn't save—but a saving faith will desire to obey.

## The Lord's Supper: Commemorating the Death

### Institution and Meaning

On the night of His betrayal, Jesus instituted a new memorial:

> _"The Lord Jesus, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread; and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is My body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me."_ (1 Corinthians 11:23, 24)

> _"This cup is the new testament in My blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me."_ (1 Corinthians 11:25)

**The broken bread** represents Christ's body given for us—His sinless humanity offered on Calvary.

**The cup** represents His blood shed for the remission of sins—the blood of the new covenant.

[DYK🔎] The word "testament" (_diatheke_) means "covenant." When Jesus spoke of "the new testament in My blood," He declared that His sacrifice ratified the new covenant promised in Jeremiah 31:31-34—the covenant of forgiveness and heart transformation.

### A Memorial, Not a Sacrifice

> _"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He come."_ (1 Corinthians 11:26)

Notice three vital elements:

1. **It is a memorial** ("in remembrance of Me")—not a re-sacrifice of Christ
2. **It is a proclamation** ("ye do show the Lord's death")—preaching the gospel visually
3. **It is forward-looking** ("till He come")—pointing to the blessed hope

[Q] **"Is the Lord's Supper merely symbolic, or does something spiritual actually happen?"**

The bread and wine do not literally become Christ's body and blood (a doctrine called transubstantiation). Christ spoke metaphorically, as He often did: "I am the door," "I am the vine." Yet this ordinance is far more than mere ritual. When partaken with genuine faith, the Holy Spirit makes Christ's sacrifice real to the soul. The believer feeds spiritually upon Christ, drawing fresh strength and assurance from His death.

### The Closing Hymn

> _"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the Mount of Olives."_ (Matthew 26:30)

[DYK🔎] The hymn sung was likely from the Hallel psalms (Psalms 113-118), traditionally sung at Passover. These psalms proclaim God's deliverance and victory—words Jesus sang knowing He was about to face Gethsemane and Golgotha. What faith! What courage!

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

The Lord's Supper connects directly to the sanctuary message:

**Outer Court** (Altar of Sacrifice): The broken bread and cup point us back to Calvary—the place where the Lamb of God was slain. Each communion service anchors our faith in Christ's sufficient sacrifice.

**Holy Place** (Table of Shewbread): In the sanctuary, twelve loaves of bread were continually before the Lord, representing God's sustaining presence with His people. Jesus declared, _"I am the bread of life"_ (John 6:35). At the Lord's Supper, we acknowledge our continual dependence upon Christ for spiritual nourishment.

**Most Holy Place** (Day of Atonement): The phrase "till He come" reminds us that Christ's ministry continues in the heavenly sanctuary. We who partake worthily are preparing for the final work—the blotting out of sins and the sealing of God's people.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Communion Table

The Lord's Supper is a profound expression of righteousness by faith:

- We bring **nothing** to the table but our need
- We receive **everything** through Christ's broken body and shed blood
- The bread we eat becomes part of us—so Christ's righteousness must become part of our character
- We cannot manufacture this transformation; we can only receive it by faith

[ILL] A hungry man cannot be nourished by simply looking at food or admiring its arrangement on the plate. He must eat—taking the food into himself so it becomes part of his body. So we cannot be saved by merely admiring Christ from a distance or intellectually assenting to His sacrifice. We must "eat His flesh and drink His blood" (John 6:53-56)—receiving Him into our inmost being by living faith, so that His life becomes our life.

### Worthy Participation

Paul issues a solemn warning:

> _"Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord."_ (1 Corinthians 11:27)

To partake "unworthily" means:

- **Without genuine faith** in Christ's sacrifice
- **Without self-examination** and confession of known sin
- **Without reconciliation** with those we have wronged
- **While harboring deliberate rebellion** against God's known will

The solution is not to stay away from the table in fear, but to come with hearts prepared:

> _"But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup."_ (1 Corinthians 11:28)

## Practical Application

### How Should We Approach the Lord's Supper?

**Before the service:**

- Spend time in prayer and self-examination
- Confess known sins and claim Christ's cleansing blood
- Make things right with anyone you have wronged (Matthew 5:23-24)
- Meditate on the cross and Christ's sacrifice

**During the service:**

- Focus your mind on Calvary—what it cost to redeem you
- Receive the bread and cup with thanksgiving and faith
- Renew your commitment to follow Christ wholly
- Remember His promise: "I will come again"

**After the service:**

- Like the disciples, depart with a song of praise in your heart
- Live out the surrender you've made at the table
- Let the power of the cross shape your daily choices

### The Lord's Supper and Christian Unity

The communion service is also a powerful expression of Christian fellowship:

> _"For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."_ (1 Corinthians 10:17)

When we partake together, we declare:

- Our common need of a Savior
- Our shared faith in Christ's sacrifice
- Our unity as members of His body
- Our equal standing at the foot of the cross

No social distinctions, no educational achievements, no spiritual pride can stand before the broken body of our Lord. At His table, we are all simply sinners saved by grace.

## Appeal

Beloved, Christ has given us a precious memorial—not cold ritual, but living communion with the One who died that we might live. Each time we gather at His table, He invites us to remember:

_"This is My body, which is broken for you."_

The bread speaks of His humanity assumed for your sake. The cup speaks of His blood poured out for your sins. The broken emblems declare that death—His death—was necessary because sin cannot be overlooked or excused. And yet that same death proclaims love—infinite, unfathomable love for sinners who deserved nothing but judgment.

Will you come to His table with a prepared heart? Will you examine yourself, confess your sins, and receive afresh the assurance of His pardoning grace? Will you let the Lord's Supper be what He designed it to be—a means of drawing your soul closer to His wounded side?

> _"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He come."_ (1 Corinthians 11:26)

"Till He come"—these words ring with hope! The Lord's Supper points backward to Calvary, but it also points forward to glory. The same Jesus who said "This do in remembrance of Me" also promised, "I will come again" (John 14:3). We who partake today anticipate the day when we shall drink it new with Him in the Father's kingdom (Matthew 26:29).

Come to the table. Come with faith. Come often. Come till He comes.
