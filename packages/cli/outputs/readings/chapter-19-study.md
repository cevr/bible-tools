# Reading 19: The New Birth

## Introduction

The new birth stands at the very heart of the gospel. Without it, no soul can enter the kingdom of heaven. Yet this divine miracle—whereby a sinner, dead in trespasses, is raised to walk in newness of life—remains one of the most misunderstood doctrines in Christianity. Many suppose that reformation of habits or religious profession constitutes conversion, but Scripture reveals something far deeper: a complete transformation of nature, wrought not by human effort, but by the creative power of God through His Word and Spirit.

## Core Truths

### The Universal Need for Transformation

Scripture is clear about humanity's natural condition:

> _"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."_ (Romans 3:23)

This is not merely occasional wrongdoing—it describes a fundamental state of being. Paul declares that we were "dead in trespasses and sins," walking "according to the course of this world," fulfilling "the desires of the flesh and of the mind," and were "by nature the children of wrath" (Ephesians 2:1-3).

**Sin**: Missing the mark of God's perfect standard; falling short of His glory and character of love (Romans 3:23; 1 John 3:4).

Yet God's standard remains unchanged:

> _"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."_ (Matthew 5:8)

Here lies the great dilemma: sinners cannot dwell with a holy God, yet all have sinned. How can the impure become pure?

[DYK🔎] The phrase "come short of the glory of God" in the Greek suggests a continuous state—not merely past failures, but an ongoing inability to reach God's standard by human effort. We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners by nature.

### The Impossibility of Self-Reformation

Can human effort bridge this gap?

> _"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil."_ (Jeremiah 13:23)

This striking imagery reveals a profound truth: **sin is not merely what we do—it is what we are.** The leopard cannot remove its spots because they are part of its very nature. So fallen humanity cannot, by willpower or religious discipline, change the sinful heart.

Jesus Himself declared:

> _"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing."_ (John 15:5)

[Q] **"But surely sincere effort and good intentions count for something?"**

Human effort, however sincere, cannot change human nature. A bitter fountain cannot produce sweet water (James 3:11). The problem is not merely behavior—it is the heart itself. This is why reformation always fails where regeneration is needed. We may prune the branches, but only Christ can transform the root.

### Christ: The Only Way to God

How, then, can sinful humanity be brought to a holy God?

> _"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God."_ (1 Peter 3:18)

Christ alone bridges the infinite gulf. He is both our substitute (dying in our place) and our representative (living the life we should have lived). Through His sacrifice, the way is opened for sinners to approach God without being consumed.

[ILL] Consider a criminal on death row who receives a full pardon from the governor. He did not earn it, could not purchase it, and had no claim to it. It was pure grace. But that pardon only benefits him if he accepts it and walks out of the prison. So Christ has secured pardon for every sinner—but we must receive it by faith to experience its power.

## Deeper Truths

### The Meaning of the New Birth

Jesus made the necessity of spiritual rebirth unmistakably clear:

> _"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."_ (John 3:3)

The double "verily" (in Greek, "amen, amen") signals a truth of utmost importance. Jesus is not speaking of physical birth, nor of mere moral improvement. He speaks of a radical, supernatural transformation—becoming an entirely **new creature**.

> _"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."_ (2 Corinthians 5:17)

**New creature**: Not the old nature improved, but an entirely new creation—a new heart, new desires, new principles of action (Ezekiel 36:26).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "new" in 2 Corinthians 5:17 is _kainos_, meaning new in quality or kind—not merely recent in time. The new birth produces something that never existed before: a divinely transformed human character.

### Death Before Life

Before the new birth can occur, something must die:

> _"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."_ (Romans 7:9)

Paul speaks of a death to sin—a crucifixion of the old man with his sinful desires:

> _"How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"_ (Romans 6:2)

The law reveals sin for what it truly is. When its holy light shines upon the heart, the sinner sees his utter hopelessness and dies to all confidence in self-righteousness.

> _"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."_ (Romans 7:11)

> _"The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law."_ (1 Corinthians 15:56)

The law does not cause sin, but it exposes it and condemns it. Like a mirror, it shows the defilement but cannot cleanse it. This conviction is essential—for only those who know they are sick will seek the Physician.

### The Means of Regeneration

How is the new birth effected?

> _"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever."_ (1 Peter 1:23)

> _"Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently."_ (1 Peter 1:22)

The **Word of God** is the incorruptible seed. The **Spirit of God** applies that Word to the heart. Together, they accomplish what no human agency could achieve—the creation of a new nature.

[Q] **"Can we fully understand how this transformation happens?"**

Jesus answered this question directly:

> _"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit."_ (John 3:8)

We cannot fully comprehend the mystery of regeneration any more than we can trace the wind's origin. But we can see its effects: changed lives, transformed characters, sin overcome, love manifested. The fruit proves the tree.

### Two Natures—Two Destinies

> _"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."_ (John 3:6)

**Flesh** (or **carnal**): The unregenerate human nature, self-centered and inclined to sin (Romans 8:5-9).

**Spirit**: The renewed nature, God-centered and inclined to righteousness.

These two cannot coexist in harmony:

> _"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would."_ (Galatians 5:17)

The works of each nature are clearly manifest:

**Works of the flesh**: _"Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like."_ (Galatians 5:19-21)

**Fruit of the Spirit**: _"Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance."_ (Galatians 5:22-23)

Notice that Paul calls the sinful manifestations "works" but the righteous manifestations "fruit." Works are produced by effort; fruit grows naturally from a living connection. The Christian life is not achieved by striving but by abiding.

[ILL] An apple tree does not strain and struggle to produce apples. It simply receives nutrients from the soil, water from the rain, and light from the sun—and fruit appears naturally. So the believer, connected to Christ the True Vine, receives divine life and naturally produces the fruit of righteousness. The fruit is not the result of our labor, but of His life flowing through us.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Righteousness Defined and Experienced

What will the one born of God do?

> _"If ye know that He is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of Him."_ (1 John 2:29)

And what is righteousness?

> _"My tongue shall speak of Thy word: for all Thy commandments are righteousness."_ (Psalm 119:172)

**Righteousness**: Right-doing; conformity to God's law of love; the character of God expressed in human life (Psalm 119:172; Isaiah 51:7).

Here we see the beautiful harmony: the new birth does not abolish God's law—it writes that law upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10). The truly converted soul delights in God's commandments because a new nature now governs the life.

This is the essence of **righteousness by faith**:

- **Justification**: Christ's righteousness counted to us—our legal standing before God made right
- **Sanctification**: Christ's righteousness worked in us—our actual character transformed

Both are received by faith, both are accomplished by Christ, and both result in obedience to God's holy law—not as a means of earning salvation, but as the fruit of salvation received.

### Freedom from Condemnation

How did Paul experience this deliverance?

> _"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death."_ (Romans 8:2)

The "law of sin and death" is the unregenerate nature, the carnal mind ever impelling toward transgression. The "law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus" is the new nature imparted by the Holy Spirit, which inclines the heart toward righteousness.

**The moral law of God (Ten Commandments) stands as the test of character in both conditions:**

- Under the old nature, it condemns the sinner
- Under the new nature, it guides the saint

> _"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:1)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "no condemnation" in the Greek is emphatic—_ouden katakrima_—meaning absolutely nothing of condemnation, not even the smallest remnant. For those who are in Christ, the verdict is complete acquittal.

### The Sanctuary Connection

This transformation finds its type in the sanctuary service:

- **The altar of burnt offering** (outer court): The death of the old man, our sins laid upon Christ our Sacrifice
- **The laver**: Washing by the Word (Ephesians 5:26), cleansing through regeneration
- **The holy place**: Daily growth in grace—feeding on the bread of life (table of showbread), walking in divine light (candlestick), ascending prayers of communion (altar of incense)
- **The most holy place**: The final work of cleansing, the blotting out of sin, the sealing of a people who have overcome through the blood of the Lamb

The new birth initiates us into the sanctuary experience. Christ our High Priest ministers on our behalf, applying His blood for our justification and His life for our sanctification, until we stand complete in Him—without spot or blemish.

## Practical Application

### How the Born-Again Christian Lives

The one truly converted will regard sin with a new attitude:

> _"Whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death."_ (Romans 6:21)

> _"Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good."_ (Romans 12:9)

> _"Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby."_ (1 Peter 2:1-2)

The regenerated soul:

1. **Experiences shame** over past sins, not nostalgic longing
2. **Abhors evil**—not merely avoids it, but detests it
3. **Lays aside** malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy, evil speaking
4. **Desires the Word** as a hungry infant craves milk
5. **Grows continually** in grace and knowledge

### Love as Evidence of New Life

> _"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God."_ (1 John 4:7)

Genuine love—not mere sentiment, but self-sacrificing, Christlike love—is the surest evidence of the new birth. Where this love is absent, the profession of conversion is empty.

### Victory Over the World

> _"For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."_ (1 John 5:4)

The new birth brings victory—not merely the promise of future victory, but present, experiential overcoming. The world's allurements, its pleasures and pressures, lose their power over the soul united with Christ.

> _"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:11)

This is the Christian's daily posture: reckoning oneself dead to sin's claims and alive to God's purposes. It is not a feeling we wait for, but a faith we exercise.

## Appeal

Dear friend, have you experienced the new birth? Not merely an emotional experience at an altar call, not simply intellectual assent to doctrines, but a genuine transformation of nature—old things passed away, all things become new?

The same God who spoke light into existence at creation speaks still: _"Let there be light"_ in the darkened heart. The same power that raised Christ from the dead is available to raise you from spiritual death to newness of life.

You cannot change yourself. The Ethiopian cannot change his skin. But Christ can do what you cannot. He stands ready to receive every penitent soul, to forgive every confessed sin, and to create within you a clean heart.

> _"A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh."_ (Ezekiel 36:26)

Will you come to Him today? Will you surrender your helplessness and receive His almighty power? The wind of the Spirit is blowing—will you set your sail to catch it?

_"Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."_ (John 3:3)

But blessed assurance: **whosoever will may come.** And the one who comes to Christ, He will in no wise cast out (John 6:37). Come as you are—and be born anew.
