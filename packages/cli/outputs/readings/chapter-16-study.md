# Bible Study: Repentance

## Introduction

Repentance is the gateway to salvation—the divinely appointed turning point where the sinner, awakened by the Holy Spirit, forsakes sin and embraces Christ. Yet this vital truth is often misunderstood. Some imagine repentance as mere remorse; others suppose it must be accomplished by human willpower before one can come to Christ. Scripture reveals something far more beautiful: repentance itself is a gift from God, inseparably connected with faith in Jesus Christ, and it produces a transformed life that bears the unmistakable fruits of genuine conversion.

## Core Truths

### The Universal Need for Repentance

The call to repentance is not limited to any nation, class, or generation. Christ commissioned His disciples that _"repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations"_ (Luke 24:47). This universal message arises from a universal need.

Why must repentance be preached to all? Because _"all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"_ (Romans 3:23). Paul labored to prove _"both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin"_ (Romans 3:9). No human being, however moral or religious, stands exempt from this verdict.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "repentance" is _metanoia_, meaning a complete change of mind—not merely feeling sorry, but a fundamental transformation in how one thinks about God, self, and sin.

### How Sin Is Revealed

If all are sinners, how does one come to know it? _"By the law is the knowledge of sin"_ (Romans 3:20). God's holy law—the Ten Commandments—serves as a divine mirror, revealing the true condition of the heart.

Many live in spiritual blindness, unaware of their danger. The law strips away self-deception:

- It shows what God requires
- It exposes where we have fallen short
- It reveals that _"the wages of sin is death"_ (Romans 6:23)

_"Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience"_ (Ephesians 5:6).

### The Holy Spirit's Convicting Work

Yet the law alone cannot produce repentance. Something more is needed—a divine Agent to press the truth upon the conscience. Jesus promised: _"When He is come, He will reprove the world of sin"_ (John 16:8).

The Holy Spirit takes the law and applies it to the heart. He awakens the sleeping conscience, makes sin appear "exceeding sinful" (Romans 7:13), and creates that deep distress of soul that cries out, _"Men and brethren, what shall we do?"_ (Acts 2:37).

[Q] **"Can a person repent whenever they choose, or is repentance dependent on God?"**

Scripture reveals a profound truth: repentance is both a human responsibility and a divine gift. Paul asked, _"Despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?"_ (Romans 2:4). Christ Himself is _"exalted... to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins"_ (Acts 5:31). We cannot manufacture genuine repentance by our own efforts; it flows from beholding God's love and goodness, which the Holy Spirit reveals to the receptive heart.

## Deeper Truths

### Godly Sorrow vs. Worldly Sorrow

Not all sorrow over sin is genuine repentance. Paul distinguishes two kinds:

_"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death"_ (2 Corinthians 7:10).

**Godly sorrow** flows from seeing sin as God sees it—as an offense against infinite love, a violation of His holy character, a wound to the heart of Christ. It leads to genuine turning from sin.

**Worldly sorrow** is different altogether. The worldly person regrets being caught, fears consequences, or mourns lost reputation—but never truly hates the sin itself. Judas experienced such sorrow; he was _"sorry"_ enough to return the thirty pieces of silver, yet his remorse led only to despair and death, not to the Saviour's arms.

[ILL] Consider two children caught stealing cookies. One weeps bitterly—but only because punishment is coming. Given another opportunity, he would steal again. The other child, seeing the grief in his mother's eyes, realizes he has wounded someone who loves him deeply. His tears spring from a broken heart over having hurt her. The first sorrow is worldly; the second is godly. Only the second leads to genuine change.

### The Inseparable Connection of Repentance and Faith

Paul summarized his entire ministry as _"testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ"_ (Acts 20:21).

Notice the order and the objects:

- **Repentance toward God**—because sin is transgression of _His_ law (1 John 3:4)
- **Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ**—because He alone can save (Acts 4:12)

[DYK🔎] In Acts 20:21, Paul uses the Greek word "eis" (toward/into) for both repentance and faith, suggesting movement—the soul turning _toward_ God and _into_ union with Christ.

Here is a truth often overlooked: **faith and repentance cannot be separated**. Some teach that one must first repent by human effort, then exercise faith. But this puts the cart before the horse. Scripture reveals that it is by beholding Christ—by faith—that the heart is melted to repentance.

_"Without Me ye can do nothing"_ (John 15:5).

The sinner cannot, by sheer willpower, produce genuine sorrow for sin. But when, by faith, he looks upon _"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"_ (John 1:29), when he sees the infinite sacrifice made for his salvation, his heart is touched. Love for Christ begets hatred for the sins that crucified Him.

[Q] **"But doesn't Acts 2:38 say 'Repent, and be baptized'—implying repentance comes first, without faith?"**

Look carefully at what Peter preached _before_ the people cried, "What shall we do?" He proclaimed Christ—His death, resurrection, and exaltation (Acts 2:22–36). The people were _"pricked in their heart"_ (v. 37) by _hearing of Christ_. Their repentance was produced by a message that awakened faith. Peter then instructed them to formalize and demonstrate that repentance through baptism. Faith and repentance worked together from the beginning.

### What True Repentance Involves

Genuine repentance is not merely sorrow—it involves a complete turning:

_"Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die?"_ (Ezekiel 18:31).

True repentance includes:

1. **Conviction**—recognition of specific sins
2. **Contrition**—genuine sorrow for having offended God
3. **Confession**—acknowledging sins to Christ: _"I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin"_ (Psalm 38:18)
4. **Conversion**—actual turning from sin to righteousness

_"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"_ (1 John 1:9).

Every known sin must be brought to Christ. Nothing can be hidden, excused, or retained. The blood of Jesus _"cleanseth us from all sin"_ (1 John 1:7)—but only as we bring our sins to Him in honest confession.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Repentance and the Sanctuary

The sanctuary service beautifully illustrates repentance and forgiveness:

In the **outer court**, the repentant sinner brought his sacrifice. He laid his hands upon the innocent lamb and confessed his sins, symbolically transferring his guilt to the substitute. The lamb was slain; blood was shed. This pointed forward to Christ, _"the Lamb of God"_ (John 1:29), whose blood alone cleanses from sin.

Today, repentant sinners bring their sins to Jesus in the **heavenly sanctuary**, where He ministers as our High Priest. _"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous"_ (1 John 2:1). His blood speaks for us; His righteousness covers us.

[DYK🔎] In the ancient sanctuary, the sinner's confession and the priest's ministry worked together—the sinner brought the sacrifice, but the priest applied the blood. So today, we confess; Christ applies His merits. Both are necessary.

### Repentance and Righteousness by Faith

Here is the golden truth that must be grasped: **repentance is not something we accomplish to earn salvation; it is a fruit of looking to Christ by faith.**

Ellen White beautifully expressed this principle:

> "Repentance, as well as forgiveness, is the gift of God through Christ. It is through the influence of the Holy Spirit that we are convicted of sin and feel our need of pardon. None but the contrite are forgiven; but it is the grace of God that makes the heart penitent." (_Steps to Christ_, p. 26)

This protects us from two errors:

1. **Presumption**—thinking we can be saved without genuine repentance
2. **Despair**—thinking we must somehow produce sufficient sorrow before coming to Christ

The truth is beautifully simple: **Come to Christ as you are.** Look upon His love. Behold the cross. As you do, the Holy Spirit will work repentance in your heart. Faith and repentance flow together from the same divine Source.

### Fruits Meet for Repentance

Genuine repentance produces visible results. John the Baptist thundered: _"Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance"_ (Matthew 3:8)—or, as the margin reads, "answerable to amendment of life."

What are these fruits?

- **Forsaking known sin**: _"How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"_ (Romans 6:2)
- **Restitution where possible**: Zacchaeus said, _"If I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold"_ (Luke 19:8)
- **Changed life patterns**: _"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands"_ (Ephesians 4:28)
- **Transformed relationships**: reconciliation, forgiveness, love

[Q] **"What if I've repented but keep falling into the same sin?"**

God distinguishes between struggling against sin and cherishing it. The truly repentant soul _hates_ sin even while battling its power. If you fall, do not despair—return immediately to Christ. But examine your heart: Are you fighting against the sin, or secretly enjoying it? Are you using all the means of grace—prayer, Scripture, fellowship—or neglecting them? _"He that committeth sin is of the devil"_ (1 John 3:8) speaks of one who _practices_ sin as a way of life, not one who stumbles while earnestly seeking victory.

Remember: Christ's blood cleanses; His power enables. Through faith, you can overcome every besetting sin.

## Practical Application

### How God Regards the Penitent

_"To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word"_ (Isaiah 66:2).

What tender assurance! The God of the universe, before whom angels veil their faces, _looks_ with special favor upon the humble, broken-hearted sinner who comes trembling to His throne. He does not despise such a one; He welcomes him.

[ILL] A child who has disobeyed runs from his father, hiding in shame. But when, with tears streaming down his face, he finally approaches his father to confess, what does the father do? He opens his arms wide. He lifts the child onto his lap. He forgives, and the relationship is restored. So our heavenly Father receives the truly penitent. _"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear Him"_ (Psalm 103:13).

### Daily Response to This Truth

This truth calls us to:

1. **Honest self-examination**—Allow the law and the Spirit to reveal hidden sins
2. **Immediate confession**—Bring every known sin to Christ without delay
3. **Active faith**—Look to Jesus, not to your own sorrow, for salvation
4. **Obedient living**—Demonstrate genuine repentance by bringing forth its fruits
5. **Continual dependence**—Recognize your need of Christ every moment

## Appeal

_"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord"_ (Acts 3:19).

Dear friend, have you experienced genuine repentance? Not merely the worldly sorrow that fears consequences, but the godly sorrow that breaks the heart over having grieved infinite Love?

If the Holy Spirit is now convicting you of sin, do not resist. Do not harden your heart. Do not wait until you feel you have repented "enough." Come to Jesus now, just as you are. Bring your sins, your failures, your shame—and lay them at the foot of the cross. As you behold the Lamb of God, your heart will be softened; genuine repentance will flow; and you will hear the blessed words: _"Thy sins are forgiven."_

_"Him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out"_ (John 6:37).

Will you come today?
