## Slide 1 – Q1: Communication in Eden

- **Question:** How did God communicate with man in the Eden?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 3:9 – “And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto
  him, Where art thou?”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Face-to-Face Communion

- Before the entrance of sin, humanity enjoyed open communion with the Creator.
- There was no veil, no separation, and no need for an intermediary.
- Adam and Eve spoke with God freely:
  - Exodus 33:11 – “And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man
    speaketh unto his friend...”
- Direct communication was the natural result of holiness; God's glory was a
  source of life, not terror.
- The question’s key text (Genesis 3:9) captures the tragic moment after the
  Fall:
  - Man hid himself, but God took the initiative to seek him out.
  - God’s call was the first step in redemption.

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Barrier of Sin

- **The Separation:**
  - Isaiah 59:2 – “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
    and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.”
- **The Goal of Salvation:**
  - To restore this face-to-face communion.
  - Revelation 22:4 – “And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in
    their foreheads.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Windowpane:**
  - Imagine a clear windowpane allowing sunlight to flood a room. This
    represents Eden.
  - Imagine that window painted over with thick black paint. The sun still
    shines, but the connection is broken.
  - **Sin is that black paint.**
- **God’s Mercy:**
  - God did not destroy the house.
  - He devised a plan to let the light in through a different method until the
    window could be fully cleaned.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Communication Since the Fall

- **Question:** Since the fall, how has God made known His will?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 1:1 – “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners
  spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: God’s Agency – The Prophet

- Since sin made direct contact with God’s consuming glory impossible (Exodus
  33:20), God established the agency of **prophets**.
- **Sundry Times:**
  - God revealed truth progressively as men could bear it (John 16:12).
  - The plan of salvation unfolded step by step, from Eden to the Cross.
- **Divers Manners:**
  - God used dreams, visions, audible voices, and the ministry of angels.
- **By the Prophets:**
  - A prophet is a spokesperson for God, one who pours forth words given by
    another.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Definition of a Prophet

- A man or woman called by God to receive divine communications and transmit
  them to the people.
- They serve as God’s "mouth."
- Exodus 4:16 – “And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,
  even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead
  of God.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Ambassador:**
  - When a king wishes to speak to rebels barricaded in a fortress, he does not
    walk in alone lest they be destroyed by his army.
  - He sends an ambassador with a white flag.
  - The ambassador speaks not his own words, but the words of the king.
- **Application:**
  - The prophet is God's ambassador to a rebel world.

## Slide 9 – Q3: The Object of Prophecy

- **Question:** What was the object of speaking "by the prophets"?
- **Key Text:** Amos 3:7 – “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he
  revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Revealing the Secret

- God’s government is transparent to His people; He does not strike without
  warning.
- **The "Secret":** Primarily His covenant and the plan of salvation.
  - Psalm 25:14 – “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he
    will shew them his covenant.”
- **Warning Before Judgment:**
  - Noah before the Flood.
  - Abraham before Sodom.
  - John the Baptist before the First Advent.
- **Guidance:** The prophetic gift reveals God's mind regarding sin and
  righteousness to prepare the people.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Covered Before the Storm:**
  - God reveals His secrets so we may be covered before judgment comes.
- **Safety in Christ:**
  - The only safety is found in Christ, having His righteousness imputed for
    pardon and imparted for obedience.
- **The Prophetic Call:**
  - Prophets were sent to call people back to this covenant relationship.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Influence of the Prophets

- **Question:** By what influence did the prophets reveal God's will?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:21 – “For the prophecy came not in old time by the
  will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Moved by the Holy Ghost

- Prophecy is not the product of human genius or philosophical speculation.
- It is the result of the Holy Ghost moving upon the human agent.
- **"Moved":**
  - The Greek implies being "borne along," like a ship driven by the wind.
  - The prophet is the vessel; the Spirit is the wind determining the message.
- **Human and Divine Union:**
  - Like Christ (fully God and fully man), Scripture is a union of the divine
    and human.
  - The vocabulary may be the writer's, but the truth is infallibly God's.

## Slide 14 – Q4: Definition of Inspiration

- **Inspiration:** The supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit on the writers
  of Scripture.
- It ensures that what they wrote or spoke was the Word of God.
- 2 Timothy 3:16 – “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
  profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
  righteousness.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: The Name of the Gift

- **Question:** Then what may the gift of prophecy be called?
- **Answer:** A gift of the Holy Spirit, or a spiritual gift.

## Slide 16 – Q5: A Spiritual Gift

- Because prophecy comes only when men are "moved by the Holy Ghost," it is a
  "Spiritual gift."
- 1 Corinthians 12:1 – “Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not
  have you ignorant.”
- It is not a natural talent developed by education.
- It is a sovereign bestowal of the Spirit for the edification of the church.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Modes of Revelation

- **Question:** What was said regarding the words of God's prophets?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 12:6 – “And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a
  prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and
  will speak unto him in a dream.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Visions and Dreams

- God identifies the legitimate modes of communication:
  - **Visions:** Usually received while awake or in a trance.
  - **Dreams:** Received while asleep.
- **Supernatural State:**
  - The prophet’s natural senses are often suspended.
  - They see and hear realities of the spiritual world.
  - Example: Daniel 10:17 – “...for as for me, straightway there remained no
    strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Telescope:**
  - A telescope allows a person to see things that are real but far beyond the
    naked eye.
  - The Spirit acts as a telescope for the prophet.
  - It brings the distant future or the hidden realities of heaven into sharp
    focus.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Preserving the Word

- **Question:** How were the Lord's words preserved to the people?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:1 – “In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon
  Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the
  dream, and told the sum of the matters.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: The Written Word

- God commanded prophets to commit revelations to writing.
- This transitioned the message from a momentary oral proclamation to a
  permanent record.
- **Purpose:**
  - To preserve truth for future generations (Psalm 102:18).
  - To provide a standard to test all future teaching (Isaiah 8:20).
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Satan twists oral tradition.
  - The written Word is the unchangeable "sword of the Spirit" (Ephesians 6:17).

## Slide 22 – Q8: Understanding Future Events

- **Question:** What had these writings to do with the people's understanding
  future events?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:2 – “In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood
  by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to
  Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the
  desolations of Jerusalem.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Studying the Prophecies

- Prophets studied the writings of other prophets.
- Daniel studied Jeremiah to understand the timing of deliverance.
- **Historicist Understanding:**
  - Daniel recognized specific time periods predicted by God.
  - This validates the study of time prophecies today.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Application (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Intercession:**
  - Daniel was praying toward the desolate sanctuary in Jerusalem (Daniel 9:17).
  - His study of prophecy led him to intercede for the restoration of the
    sanctuary services.
- **Type of Christ:**
  - This intercession and restoration is a type of Christ’s work for us in the
    heavenly sanctuary.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Exhortation to Obedience

- **Question:** How did God's ministers use the words of the prophets in
  exhorting the people to obedience?
- **Key Text:** Zechariah 7:7 – “Should ye not hear the words which the Lord
  hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in
  prosperity...?”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Moral Restoration

- The primary purpose of the prophetic gift is moral and spiritual restoration,
  not just satisfying curiosity.
- **The Call to Believe:**
  - 2 Chronicles 20:20 – “...Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be
    established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.”
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - Prophets preached that ritual service was useless without a changed heart.
  - Zechariah 7:9 – “Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true
    judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother.”
  - They pointed away from human works to the necessity of a heart renewed by
    God.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Map:**
  - A map is useful only if the traveler follows it.
  - Prophecies are the map of the Christian journey.
  - To admire the map but ignore its directions is to ensure we get lost.

## Slide 28 – Q10: Test of a Prophet (Prediction)

- **Question:** How were people to know whether or not the words of prophets
  were from the Lord?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 18:22 – “When a prophet speaketh in the name of the
  Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the
  Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou
  shalt not be afraid of him.”

## Slide 29 – Q10: The Test of Accuracy

- **Predictive Accuracy:**
  - God claims the unique ability to declare the end from the beginning (Isaiah
    46:9–10).
  - If a prophet makes a specific prediction that fails, they are not speaking
    for God.
- **Note on Conditional Prophecy:**
  - Some prophecies are conditional upon repentance (e.g., Jonah at Nineveh,
    Jeremiah 18:7-10).
  - However, a failed prediction without a conditional cause exposes a false
    prophet.

## Slide 30 – Q11: The Supreme Test (Law & Doctrine)

- **Question:** What was considered a still better test on this point?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 13:1-3 – “If there arise among you a prophet... and
  giveth thee a sign or a wonder, And the sign or the wonder come to pass...
  saying Let us go after other gods... Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of
  that prophet... for the Lord your God proveth you...”

## Slide 31 – Q11: Fidelity to God’s Law

- Even if a prophet performs a miracle or makes a correct prediction, if they
  lead people to violate God's commandments, they are false.
- **Satanic Counterfeits:**
  - Satan can work miracles to deceive (2 Thessalonians 2:9).
- **The Standard:**
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
    to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

## Slide 32 – Q11: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Loving God with All the Heart:**
  - Deuteronomy 13:3 – “...for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether ye
    love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.”
- **The New Covenant:**
  - True prophecy leads to the law written on the heart.
  - Any "gift" that excuses sin or downplays obedience is a deception.

## Slide 33 – Q12: Prophecy in the Last Days

- **Question:** What was predicted concerning the spirit of prophecy in the last
  days?
- **Key Text:** Joel 2:28 – “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will
  pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall
  prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.”

## Slide 34 – Q12: The Outpouring

- God promised a special outpouring of the Spirit in the "last days."
- This results in the reactivation of the prophetic gift among God's people.
- **"All Flesh":**
  - The gift is not limited to a priestly class.
  - It is seen across different ages and genders ("sons and daughters").

## Slide 35 – Q13: Commencement of Fulfillment

- **Question:** When did this prediction commence to be fulfilled?
- **Key Text:** Acts 2:16, 17 – “But this is that which was spoken by the
  prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will
  pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh...”

## Slide 36 – Q13: Early and Latter Rain

- Peter identified Pentecost as the commencement of this fulfillment.
- **The Early Rain:**
  - Launched the Christian church with power and gifts.
- **The Latter Rain:**
  - Prophecy indicates a dual fulfillment.
  - The Spirit will be poured out again just before the harvest (end of the
    world) to ripen the grain (James 5:7).

## Slide 37 – Q14: Extent of the Promise

- **Question:** To whom was this promise to extend?
- **Key Text:** Acts 2:38, 39 – “...Repent, and be baptized everyone of you...
  and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you,
  and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord
  our God shall call.”

## Slide 38 – Q14: To All That Are Afar Off

- The promise is not limited to the apostles.
- It extends "to all that are afar off"—down to the very end of the age.
- **Two distinct blessings:**
  1.  **Remission of Sins:** The removal of guilt (Justification).
  2.  **Gift of the Holy Ghost:** The power for a new life and service
      (Sanctification).

## Slide 39 – Q15: Attitude of the Church

- **Question:** What relation should the Christian church sustain toward these
  spiritual gifts?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 12:1 – “Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren,
  I would not have you ignorant.”

## Slide 40 – Q15: Avoiding Ignorance

- Paul admonishes the church not to be ignorant regarding gifts.
- **Ignorance leads to:**
  1.  **Fanaticism:** Accepting false manifestations as genuine.
  2.  **Rejection:** Rejecting genuine manifestations due to prejudice.
- We are called to study, understand, and test the gifts.

## Slide 41 – Q16: The Object of Gifts

- **Question:** What is the object of these gifts?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 12:7 – “But the manifestation of the Spirit is
  given to every man to profit withal.”

## Slide 42 – Q16: For the Profit of All

- Gifts are not for self-aggrandizement or status.
- They are for the "profit" or benefit of the entire body of believers.
- They are tools for service.

## Slide 43 – Q16: Illustration

- **The Carpenter’s Tools:**
  - A carpenter has a hammer, a saw, and a plane.
  - The hammer does not boast over the saw.
  - Each tool is designed for a specific function to build the house.
- **Application:**
  - Spiritual gifts are God's tools to build His spiritual house, the church.

## Slide 44 – Q17: Varieties of Gifts

- **Question:** What are some of these gifts?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 – “For to one is given by the Spirit the
  word of wisdom... to another faith... to another the gifts of healing... to
  another prophecy...”

## Slide 45 – Q17: Unity in Diversity

- The Spirit bestows many gifts: wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles,
  prophecy, discernment, and tongues.
- **One Spirit:** Though gifts differ, the Source is the same.
- **Sovereignty:**
  - 1 Corinthians 12:11 – “But all these worketh that one and the selfsame
    Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.”
  - God chooses the gift that fits us for His work.

## Slide 46 – Q18: The Desirable Gift

- **Question:** Which one of these does the apostle say is especially desirable?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 14:1 – “Follow after charity, and desire spiritual
  gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.”

## Slide 47 – Q18: Prophecy and Love

- **Charity (Love):** The context in which all gifts must operate.
- **Prophecy:** Paul elevates this as the most desirable gift for the church to
  seek.
- It holds a primary place because it communicates God's mind clearly to the
  community.

## Slide 48 – Q19: Benefit to Believers

- **Question:** Whom was this gift designed to benefit?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 14:22 – “...prophesying serveth not for them that
  believe not, but for them which believe.”

## Slide 49 – Q19: For the Church

- Prophecy is primarily for the "inside" of the church ("them which believe").
- Miracles may arrest the attention of unbelievers.
- Prophecy is designed to guide, correct, comfort, and instruct the church
  family itself.

## Slide 50 – Q20: Effect on the Church

- **Question:** What effect is the exercise of these gifts to have upon the
  church?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 4:12-13 – “For the perfecting of the saints, for the
  work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come
  in the unity of the faith...”

## Slide 51 – Q20: Perfecting the Saints

- **Purpose:** The gifts are the means God uses to bring His people to spiritual
  maturity.
- **Unity:** Prophecy protects the church from "every wind of doctrine"
  (Ephesians 4:14).
- **Goal:** The "measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."

## Slide 52 – Q20: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Victory over Sin:**
  - God provides the Spirit of Prophecy to help the church attain a character
    like Christ’s.
- **Not by Human Effort:**
  - We cannot reach this "measure of the stature" alone.
  - We need the ministry of the gifts pointing us constantly to the power of
    Christ.

## Slide 53 – Q21: Placement in the Body

- **Question:** Where did God place these gifts?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 12:28 – “And God hath set some in the church,
  first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers...”

## Slide 54 – Q21: Set by God

- God "set" the gifts in the church; they are constituent parts of the body.
- A body is not complete without eyes or ears.
- **The Prophetic Eye:**
  - The church is not complete without the "eyes" of the church—the prophets.
  - 1 Samuel 9:9 – “...for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called
    a Seer.”

## Slide 55 – Q22: New Testament Prophet

- **Question:** Who came down from Judea to Ceasarea while Paul was there?
- **Key Text:** Acts 21:10 – “And as we tarried there many days, there came down
  from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.”
- **Point:** Years after Christ ascended, the gift was still active. Agabus was
  a prophet, distinct from the twelve apostles.

## Slide 56 – Q23: Agabus’s Action

- **Question:** What did he do as soon as he saw the apostle?
- **Key Text:** Acts 21:11 – “And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's
  girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost,
  So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man...”
- **Point:** An object lesson delivering a specific warning to prepare the
  believer for trial.

## Slide 57 – Q24: Result of the Trial

- **Question:** At a later period, what did Paul say these trials had wrought?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 1:12 – “But I would ye should understand, brethren,
  that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the
  furtherance of the gospel.”
- **Point:** The prophecy did not prevent the trial, but prepared Paul for it.
  God overruled the enemy's attack for the gospel.

## Slide 58 – Q25: Duration of Gifts

- **Question:** How long was it designed that these gifts should last?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 13:9, 10 – “For we know in part, and we prophesy
  in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part
  shall be done away.”

## Slide 59 – Q25: Until the Perfect Comes

- The gifts are necessary as long as we know "in part."
- **When is "the perfect"?**
  - Verse 12 says it is when we see "face to face."
  - This refers to the Second Coming and glorification.
- **Conclusion:** Since we do not yet see Jesus face to face, the church still
  needs the gifts of the Spirit.

## Slide 60 – Q26: Admonition

- **Question:** What admonition does Paul give respecting the gift of Prophecy?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 5:20 – “Despise not prophesyings.”

## Slide 61 – Q26: Do Not Despise

- Why would people despise the gift?
  1.  **Reproof:** It cuts across cherished sins and calls for self-denial.
  2.  **Counterfeits:** False prophets cause some to reject all prophecy.
  3.  **Simplicity:** God often uses humble instruments (fishermen, women) which
      the proud may despise.
- **Application:** To despise the message is to despise the Sender.

## Slide 62 – Q27: The Testimony of Jesus

- **Question:** What is the "testimony of Jesus"?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 19:10 – “...worship God: for the testimony of Jesus
  is the spirit of prophecy.”

## Slide 63 – Q27: Defined as Spirit of Prophecy

- The "Testimony of Jesus" is not just our testimony _about_ Him.
- It is His testimony _to_ us.
- It is defined specifically as the **Spirit of Prophecy**—Jesus speaking to His
  church through the medium of the Holy Spirit and the prophet.

## Slide 64 – Q28: Necessity for the End

- **Question:** Why is it necessary for the church now to have confirmed in it
  the testimony of Christ?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 1:6, 7 – “Even as the testimony of Christ was
  confirmed in you: So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of
  our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 65 – Q28: Waiting for the Coming

- Paul connects the "testimony of Christ" (prophecy) with the church "waiting
  for the coming of our Lord."
- **End-Time Necessity:**
  - Approaching the crisis of the last days, we need Heaven's guidance more, not
    less.
  - A prepared church will "come behind in no gift."

## Slide 66 – Q29: The Remnant Church

- **Question:** What will characterize the last, or "remnant," church?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:17 – “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and
  went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
  God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 67 – Q29: Two Marks of the Remnant

- **1. They Keep the Commandments:**
  - They restore the Law of God, including the Sabbath.
  - This is the fruit of Righteousness by Faith (obedience through Christ).
- **2. They Have the Testimony of Jesus:**
  - As defined in Rev 19:10, this is the **Spirit of Prophecy**.

## Slide 68 – Q29: Application (Sanctuary Connection)

- **The Most Holy Place:**
  - The Ark of the Covenant contained the **Law** (Commandments).
  - Above the Law was the Mercy Seat, where God's presence (Shekinah) spoke to
    the High Priest.
- **The Remnant Parallel:**
  - God’s end-time people possess the **Law** (Commandments).
  - They possess the direct guidance of the Spirit through the prophetic gift
    (**Testimony of Jesus**).
- **Conclusion:** God has not left His people alone in the last days.
