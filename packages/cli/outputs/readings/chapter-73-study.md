# Bible Study: The Two Laws

## Introduction

Scripture reveals that God has given mankind two distinct codes of law—one moral and eternal, the other ceremonial and temporary. Understanding the difference between these two laws is essential for rightly dividing the word of truth and for grasping the beauty of God's plan of salvation. This study examines the origin, nature, purpose, and duration of each law, showing how Christ stands at the center of both.

## Core Truths

### The Standard of Judgment

Every human being will one day stand before God's throne of judgment. What will be the standard by which all are measured?

> "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil." (Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14)

> "So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty." (James 2:12)

The moral law—God's Ten Commandments—is the unchanging standard by which all humanity will be judged. James calls it "the law of liberty" because true freedom is found not in lawlessness but in willing, loving obedience to God's righteous requirements.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "whole duty of man" in Ecclesiastes 12:13 is actually just "whole of man" in the Hebrew. The translators added "duty" for clarity, but the original suggests something deeper—keeping God's commandments is not merely man's obligation but his very purpose and essence.

### Two Distinct Laws Identified

Scripture clearly distinguishes between two codes of law:

**The Moral Law** (Ten Commandments):

- Spoken directly by God to all the people (Deuteronomy 4:12, 13)
- Written by God's own finger on tables of stone (Exodus 31:18)
- A complete and perfect law by itself: "He added no more" (Deuteronomy 5:22)
- Describes sin: "Sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4)

**The Ceremonial Law** (Law of Moses):

- Given through Moses as intermediary (Leviticus 1:1, 2)
- Written by Moses in a book (Nehemiah 8:1; 9:14)
- Called "the handwriting of ordinances" (Colossians 2:14)
- Called "the law of commandments contained in ordinances" (Ephesians 2:15)

> "These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice; and He added no more. And He wrote them in two tables of stone." (Deuteronomy 5:22)

[Q] **"Aren't all Old Testament laws equally binding or equally abolished?"**

This common misunderstanding fails to recognize what Scripture itself distinguishes. The moral law and ceremonial law differ in their origin, nature, purpose, and duration. The moral law was spoken and written by God Himself; the ceremonial law was communicated through Moses. The moral law defines sin; the ceremonial law provided the remedy for sin through types and shadows pointing to Christ. The moral law is eternal; the ceremonial law was "imposed on them until the time of reformation" (Hebrews 9:10). Failure to distinguish between these laws leads either to legalism (binding the ceremonies on Christians) or antinomianism (abolishing God's moral requirements).

### The Moral Law Existed Before Sinai

The Ten Commandments did not originate at Sinai—they were merely codified there. The moral law was binding from the beginning of human history.

> "Adam was not deceived; but the woman being deceived was in the transgression." (1 Timothy 2:13, 14)

Eve was "in the transgression"—she broke the law. Since "sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4), and sin existed before Sinai, the law must have existed before Sinai. Indeed, every one of the Ten Commandments can be shown to have been known and binding before Moses received them on stone.

The moral law covers man's complete duty to God and to his fellow creatures:

> "Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." (Matthew 22:37-40)

[DYK🔎] The Sabbath commandment specifically anchors the moral law before Sinai. Genesis 2:2, 3 records that God blessed and sanctified the seventh day at Creation—more than 2,000 years before Moses received the tables of stone.

### The Ceremonial Law Introduced After Sin

The ceremonial or typical law was introduced _after_ man sinned, because God in mercy provided a remedial system—a plan of redemption pointing forward to Christ.

> "And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering." (Genesis 4:3, 4)

> "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain." (Hebrews 11:4)

Abel offered by _faith_—faith in what? Faith in the coming Redeemer to whom his sacrifice pointed. The entire ceremonial system—its sacrifices, washings, feast days, and sanctuary services—was designed to teach the plan of salvation through object lessons pointing to Christ.

[ILL] Consider a man who has lost his way in a dark forest at night. A kind friend gives him a lantern to guide his steps until morning light. The lantern serves a vital purpose in the darkness, but when the sun rises, the lantern is no longer needed—its purpose has been fulfilled. So the ceremonial law served to guide God's people through the darkness until Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, should arise. When He came, the shadows gave way to the substance.

## Deeper Truths

### The Nature and Character of Each Law

Scripture speaks very differently about these two laws:

**The Moral Law:**

- "The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul" (Psalm 19:7)
- "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" (Romans 7:12)
- "The law is spiritual" (Romans 7:14)

**The Ceremonial Law:**

- Could "not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience" (Hebrews 9:9)
- "A shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things" (Hebrews 10:1)
- "Carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation" (Hebrews 9:10)

The moral law is described as perfect, holy, just, good, and spiritual. The ceremonial law is described as imperfect (unable to perfect the conscience), shadowy, and carnal (pertaining to outward, physical rituals). This dramatic difference in language reveals their fundamentally different natures.

[Q] **"But doesn't Colossians 2:14 say that the law was nailed to the cross?"**

Let us read carefully what was nailed to the cross:

> "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross." (Colossians 2:14)

Notice: it was "the handwriting of ordinances"—the ceremonial law written by Moses' hand. Paul continues by listing examples: "meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come" (Colossians 2:16, 17). These are ceremonial sabbaths connected with the annual feast days (Leviticus 23:24, 32, 39), not the weekly Sabbath of the fourth commandment, which was established at Creation before sin existed and therefore before any remedial "shadow" was needed.

The ceremonial law was "against us" and "contrary to us" because its animal sacrifices continually reminded the worshipper of his guilt without actually removing it. Christ's sacrifice did what those shadows could never do—He obtained "eternal redemption for us" (Hebrews 9:12).

### Christ and the Moral Law

The prophet Isaiah foretold Christ's relationship to the moral law:

> "The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the law, and make it honourable." (Isaiah 42:21)

How did Christ magnify the law?

1. **By revealing its deep spiritual nature** — In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ showed that the law reaches beyond outward actions to the thoughts and intents of the heart. Hatred is murder in principle; lust is adultery in principle (Matthew 5:17-48).

2. **By living in perfect obedience** — "I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in His love" (John 15:10). Christ kept both the letter and spirit of every commandment, demonstrating that obedience is possible through divine power.

3. **By giving His life for transgressors** — "Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification" (Romans 4:25). Christ's death magnified the law by showing its unchanging claims—so sacred that even God's Son must die rather than see it set aside.

[DYK🔎] The word "magnify" in Isaiah 42:21 comes from the Hebrew _gadal_, meaning to make great, to enlarge, to exalt. Christ did not shrink, diminish, or abolish the law—He enlarged our understanding of its spiritual depth and exalted its authority by His perfect life and sacrificial death.

### Christ and the Ceremonial Law

While Christ magnified the moral law, His death _ended_ the ceremonial law:

> "Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances." (Ephesians 2:15)

The ceremonial law was a "shadow of good things to come" (Hebrews 10:1). When the substance arrives, the shadow ceases. Every lamb slain pointed to "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). When Christ died, the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51)—God Himself declaring that the typical system had met its antitype.

> "But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands... neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us." (Hebrews 9:11, 12)

The earthly sanctuary service was a shadow of Christ's present ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. The sacrifices taught justification through the blood of the Lamb. The daily ministration taught sanctification through Christ's continual intercession. The Day of Atonement taught the final blotting out of sins and the cleansing of the sanctuary. All these find their fulfillment in Christ.

### Faith Establishes the Moral Law

Here is a truth of immense practical importance:

> "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law." (Romans 3:31)

True faith in Christ does not abolish the moral law—it _establishes_ it. When we trust in Christ for righteousness, the Holy Spirit writes God's law upon our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). What we could never do in our own strength—keep God's commandments perfectly—Christ accomplishes in us and through us.

But dependence on the abolished ceremonial system has the opposite effect:

> "Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing." (Galatians 5:2)

To return to the ceremonies after Christ has come is to deny that He is the fulfillment of those shadows. It is to turn back from the substance to grasp at shadows.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Unchanging Character of God's Law

The moral law reflects the unchanging character of God Himself. It is a transcript of His nature—holy, just, good, and spiritual. Because God cannot change, His moral law cannot change.

> "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." (Matthew 5:18)

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the character of God's law is central. Satan has charged that the law is arbitrary and impossible to keep. Christ's perfect life demonstrated that the law is righteous and that obedience is possible through divine power. Christ's death demonstrated that the law is so sacred it cannot be set aside even to save sinners—atonement must be made.

### The Sanctuary Connection

The two laws find their deepest meaning in the sanctuary:

**The Moral Law** — The Ten Commandments were placed _inside_ the ark of the covenant, beneath the mercy seat, in the Most Holy Place (Deuteronomy 10:1-5). This placement reveals profound truth: God's mercy (the mercy seat) covers those who have broken His law (beneath the mercy seat), but it does not abolish the law—it remains as the foundation of God's throne.

**The Ceremonial Law** — Every ceremony of the sanctuary service pointed to some aspect of Christ's work. The daily sacrifices pointed to His death. The priestly intercession pointed to His heavenly ministry. The Day of Atonement pointed to the final judgment and cleansing of sin.

In the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ ministers today, John saw "the temple of God... and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament" (Revelation 11:19). The moral law still exists in heaven—the very foundation of God's government.

### The Sabbath: Moral or Ceremonial?

Some have suggested that the seventh-day Sabbath was part of the ceremonial law and therefore abolished at the cross. But the evidence is conclusive:

1. **The Sabbath originated at Creation** (Genesis 2:2, 3)—before sin existed and before any ceremonial system was needed.

2. **The Sabbath commandment is part of the Ten Commandments**—written by God's own finger on tables of stone and placed inside the ark.

3. **The Sabbath is not a shadow** pointing to Christ—it is a memorial of Creation (Exodus 20:8-11) and a sign of sanctification (Ezekiel 20:12).

4. **Christ declared Himself Lord of the Sabbath** (Mark 2:28) and kept it during His earthly ministry (Luke 4:16).

The ceremonial "sabbath days" (Colossians 2:16) connected with the annual feasts were indeed shadows that ended at the cross. But the weekly Sabbath of the fourth commandment remains as part of God's eternal moral law.

## Practical Application

### Understanding Our Obligation

The moral law reveals God's will for human conduct. Through it we understand what sin is and recognize our need of a Saviour. The law is a mirror showing our true condition (James 1:23-25), but it has no power to cleanse us from the guilt it reveals.

**Practical steps:**

1. **Study the Ten Commandments prayerfully** — Ask God to reveal the deep spiritual meaning of each precept and where you fall short.

2. **Do not seek justification by law-keeping** — No amount of future obedience can atone for past transgression. Trust wholly in Christ's righteousness for your standing before God.

3. **Do not despise the law because you cannot keep it** — The problem is not with the law but with us. Through faith in Christ, the Holy Spirit empowers obedience that was impossible in our own strength.

### Living in Gospel Freedom

True gospel freedom is not freedom from obedience but freedom _for_ obedience. Christ delivers us from the guilt and power of sin so that we may walk in newness of life.

> "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Romans 8:2-4)

Christ does not merely forgive—He transforms. The same power that raised Him from the dead is available to give you victory over every known sin. This is righteousness by faith: Christ living His obedient life in you.

### Discernment in Modern Applications

Some today teach that all Old Testament law is abolished. Others bind upon Christians the ceremonial requirements never intended for the Christian era. Discernment requires asking:

- Is this command part of the eternal moral law written by God, or the ceremonial law written by Moses?
- Does this precept predate Sinai (showing its universal nature), or was it introduced after sin (showing its remedial purpose)?
- Is this described as eternal and spiritual, or as temporary and shadowy?
- Did Christ magnify and establish this law, or did His death bring it to an end?

## Appeal

> "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man." (Ecclesiastes 12:13)

Dear friend, God's moral law stands forever. It will be the standard in the judgment. But there is good news—Christ has kept that law perfectly for you, and He offers you His righteousness as a free gift. More than that, He offers to live His obedient life in you, writing His law upon your heart so that obedience becomes not a burden but a delight.

Will you accept Christ today as both your substitute and your indwelling Saviour? Will you trust Him to forgive your past transgressions and to empower your future obedience? He is faithful who has promised. Heaven and earth may pass away, but His word—and His law—shall never fail.
