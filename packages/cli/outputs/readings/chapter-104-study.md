# Reading 104: The Resurrection—Death Conquered, Life Restored

## Introduction

The resurrection stands as the cornerstone of Christian hope. Without it, death would hold eternal victory over humanity, and all who have trusted in Christ would be forever lost. Yet God, in His infinite love, has promised to ransom His people from the grave, breaking death's power through Jesus Christ. This study traces the biblical teaching on resurrection from promise to fulfillment, revealing two distinct resurrections and the ultimate destruction of death itself.

## Core Truths

### God's Promise to Ransom from the Grave

From ancient times, God declared His intention to defeat death:

> _"I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction."_ (Hosea 13:14)

**Ransom**: A price paid to secure release from bondage or captivity. God Himself would pay the price to free humanity from death's dominion.

This is no mere wish or hope—it is a divine decree. God speaks to death as a conquered enemy, declaring, "I will be thy plagues." The grave, which has swallowed countless millions, will itself be destroyed.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word translated "ransom" (_padah_) was used for redeeming a firstborn son or freeing a slave. God pictures Himself as the kinsman-redeemer purchasing His people out of death's slavery.

### Resurrection Comes Through Christ Alone

> _"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."_ (1 Corinthians 15:21, 22)

Two representatives stand at the head of humanity:

- **Adam**—through his sin, death passed to all mankind
- **Christ**—through His righteousness and resurrection, life is offered to all

This parallel is profound. Just as we did not choose to be born into Adam's dying race, so we cannot earn our way out. Resurrection comes only "in Christ"—through union with Him who conquered the grave.

### Without Resurrection, All Is Lost

Paul confronts the gravity of this truth directly:

> _"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished."_ (1 Corinthians 15:16-18)

Consider what hangs upon the resurrection:

- If Christ did not rise, He was not who He claimed to be
- If Christ did not rise, sin remains unforgiven
- If Christ did not rise, every believer who has died is **perished**—gone forever

The word "perished" (_apollumi_) means utterly destroyed, lost beyond recovery. Without resurrection, there is no immortal soul floating to heaven—there is only annihilation. The resurrection is not optional doctrine; it is essential hope.

[Q] **"Don't believers go directly to heaven at death? Why is resurrection so important?"**

Scripture consistently teaches that the dead "sleep" until resurrection (John 11:11-14; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-16). The righteous dead are not yet in heaven enjoying their reward—they await the resurrection morning. This is why Paul says they would have "perished" if there were no resurrection. The hope of Christianity is not disembodied existence but bodily resurrection to eternal life. Jesus did not come merely to save souls but to save whole persons—body, mind, and spirit—restored and glorified.

### The Motive: God's Immeasurable Love

> _"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_ (John 3:16)

Resurrection flows from love. God did not devise a plan to rescue humanity because He was obligated or because we deserved it. He gave His Son because He _loved_. The cross and the empty tomb together reveal a Father who would pay any price to bring His children home.

## Deeper Truths

### Christ's Proof of Resurrection from Moses

The Sadducees, a Jewish sect, denied the resurrection entirely (Luke 20:27). They accepted only the five books of Moses and claimed these taught no afterlife. Jesus met them on their own ground:

> _"Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For He is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto Him."_ (Luke 20:37, 38)

Christ's argument is penetrating: God spoke to Moses at the burning bush saying "I am" (not "I was") the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—centuries after these patriarchs had died. If they had ceased to exist forever, God would not call Himself their God in the present tense. They must live again.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "all live unto Him" indicates that while the patriarchs sleep in death, their future resurrection is so certain in God's purpose that He speaks of them as living. To the eternal God, the resurrection is as certain as if it had already occurred.

### Nature's Illustration: The Seed Must Die

> _"That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die."_ (1 Corinthians 15:36)

> _"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."_ (John 12:24)

[ILL] Consider the kernel of wheat. When planted, it is buried in dark, cold earth. To all appearances, it perishes—the outer shell decays, the seed disappears from sight. Yet within that apparent death, life is at work. The seed breaks open, sends forth a shoot, and rises from the soil as a living plant bearing many grains. So it is with the resurrection. The body laid in the grave seems utterly lost. But God, who gives life to seeds, will give life to His sleeping saints. What is buried in weakness and corruption will rise in power and glory.

This illustration also points to Christ Himself. He was the corn of wheat who fell into the ground and died. Had He not died, He would have remained alone—the only sinless One. But through His death and resurrection, He brings forth "much fruit"—countless redeemed souls raised to eternal life.

### Two Resurrections, Two Destinies

Scripture clearly distinguishes two resurrections:

> _"There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."_ (Acts 24:15)

> _"All that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."_ (John 5:28, 29)

| Resurrection of Life      | Resurrection of Damnation |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| The just/righteous        | The unjust/wicked         |
| Those who have done good  | Those who have done evil  |
| At Christ's second coming | After the thousand years  |
| To eternal life           | To final judgment         |

**The First Resurrection—Of the Just:**

> _"For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

The righteous dead rise at Christ's return. They receive their reward at this moment:

> _"For thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just."_ (Luke 14:14)

**The Second Resurrection—Of the Unjust:**

> _"But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished."_ (Revelation 20:5)

A thousand years separates the two resurrections. The wicked remain in their graves while the saints reign with Christ in heaven, participating in the judgment (Revelation 20:4; 1 Corinthians 6:2, 3).

[Q] **"If salvation is by grace through faith, why does Jesus say those who 'have done good' receive the resurrection of life?"**

Good works do not earn salvation—they evidence it. Those who have truly believed in Christ demonstrate their faith by a transformed life (James 2:17, 18). Jesus is not teaching salvation by works but identifying the two groups by the fruit their lives have produced. As He said elsewhere, "By their fruits ye shall know them" (Matthew 7:20). Genuine faith works by love and produces obedience (Galatians 5:6).

### The Transformed Resurrection Body

The resurrection body will be gloriously different from our present mortal frame:

> _"It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body."_ (1 Corinthians 15:42-44)

| Present Body             | Resurrection Body       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Corruption (decay)       | Incorruption (immortal) |
| Dishonor (sin's effects) | Glory (radiant beauty)  |
| Weakness (frailty)       | Power (vitality)        |
| Natural (earthly)        | Spiritual (heavenly)    |

**Spiritual body**: Not immaterial or ghostly, but a body animated and empowered by the Spirit rather than mere natural life. Christ's resurrection body was real and tangible—He ate food and invited Thomas to touch His wounds (Luke 24:39-43; John 20:27)—yet it possessed capacities beyond our present understanding.

> _"We look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body."_ (Philippians 3:20, 21)

The pattern for our resurrection bodies is Christ Himself. As He now exists in glorified humanity at the Father's right hand, so shall we be.

### The Psalmist's Hope

> _"As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness."_ (Psalm 17:15)

David looked forward to resurrection morning. He knew that:

- He would **awake**—resurrection is described as waking from sleep
- He would **behold God's face**—see the Lord in person
- He would bear **God's likeness**—be transformed into Christ's image
- He would be **satisfied**—every longing fulfilled at last

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "satisfied" (_saba_) means to be filled to the full, completely content. Every hunger of the soul, every unfulfilled desire for righteousness, every longing to see God—all will be perfectly satisfied in that moment.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Death as an Enemy, Not a Friend

Scripture never calls death a blessing or a doorway to higher existence. It is called "the last enemy" (1 Corinthians 15:26). Death entered through sin and represents Satan's temporary victory over humanity. The resurrection is God's answer—His triumph over the enemy.

> _"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."_ (1 Corinthians 15:26)

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, death is Satan's weapon. But through the resurrection, Christ wrests that weapon away and turns it against the enemy. Death itself will die.

### The Second Death—Final and Complete

Those raised in the second resurrection face the second death:

> _"And fire came down from heaven and devoured them."_ (Revelation 20:9)

> _"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."_ (Revelation 21:8)

**The second death**: Final, irreversible destruction. There is no resurrection from the second death, no further opportunity, no endless conscious torment—only complete annihilation. This is the wages of unrepented sin: not eternal life in torment, but eternal death—the cessation of existence.

Notice who faces this fate: not only the outwardly wicked (murderers, sorcerers) but also:

- **The fearful**—those who let fear keep them from following Christ
- **The unbelieving**—those who refused to trust God
- **All liars**—those who loved and practiced falsehood

Sin, in any form persisted in, leads to the same end.

### Sanctuary Connection: The Day of Atonement and Final Separation

The two resurrections echo the Day of Atonement pattern. On that solemn day, Israel was divided into two groups: those who had afflicted their souls and entered into the atonement, and those who refused and were "cut off" from among the people (Leviticus 23:29).

In the heavenly sanctuary ministry, Christ now ministers in the Most Holy Place. Those who by faith enter into this work—confessing sins, allowing Christ to cleanse and transform their characters—will share in the resurrection of life. Those who reject Christ's atoning work will share in the resurrection of damnation.

The sanctuary teaches that final separation is coming. The cleansing of the sanctuary results in two classes: a purified people sealed for eternity, and those whose names are blotted from the book of life.

### The Ultimate Victory

> _"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"_ (1 Corinthians 15:55)

Paul quotes Hosea's ancient promise, now fulfilled in Christ. Death's "sting" is sin—it is sin that gives death its power to condemn (1 Corinthians 15:56). But Christ has removed sin's guilt through His sacrifice and broken death's power through His resurrection.

For the righteous:

> _"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."_ (Luke 20:36)

Immortality—endless, secure, unbreakable life—is the gift of God to those who trust in Christ. Never again will death threaten. Never again will the grave claim its prey. God's children will live forever.

## Practical Application

### Living in Resurrection Hope

**1. Face death without despair.** The grave is not the end. For those in Christ, it is merely a sleep from which we will awake to unimaginable joy. When we stand at the graveside of believing loved ones, we sorrow, but "not as others which have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13).

**2. Invest in eternal realities.** If resurrection is certain, then this life is preparation for the life to come. Our choices, character development, and faithfulness matter eternally. What we sow now, we will reap then.

**3. Let hope purify your life.** "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure" (1 John 3:3). Resurrection hope is not passive waiting but active preparation. Knowing we will stand before Christ and be fashioned into His likeness should motivate present holiness.

**4. Comfort others with this truth.** Paul commands believers to "comfort one another with these words" concerning the resurrection (1 Thessalonians 4:18). In a world filled with fear and uncertainty about death, Christians possess a hope worth sharing.

**5. Trust God's keeping power.** Our loved ones who sleep in Jesus are safe. They are not lost, wandering, or suffering. They rest securely until the voice of the Life-giver calls them forth. We can entrust them—and ourselves—to His faithful care.

## Appeal

> _"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?"_ (John 11:25, 26)

Jesus asked Martha this question, and He asks it of you today. Do you believe? The One who spoke these words proved His authority by calling Lazarus from the tomb. That same voice will one day echo across the earth, and the dead in Christ will rise.

But resurrection hope is not automatic. It belongs to those who are "in Christ"—united with Him by faith, trusting His sacrifice, surrendered to His lordship. To die without Christ is to await the resurrection of damnation.

Today, while mercy lingers, the invitation stands open. Christ died that you might live. He rose that you might rise. He offers Himself as your righteousness, your life, your hope.

Will you receive Him? Will you trust the One who holds the keys of death and the grave? In Him—and in Him alone—death loses its sting, and the grave surrenders its victory.

_"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? ... Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (1 Corinthians 15:55, 57)
