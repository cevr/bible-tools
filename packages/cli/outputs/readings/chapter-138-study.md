# Bible Study: Perfection of Character

## Introduction

Can a fallen human being truly become perfect? The Bible answers with a resounding "Yes"—not through human effort, but through the transforming power of Christ dwelling within. This study explores God's plan to restore His image in humanity, taking sinners "short of the glory of God" and preparing them to stand "blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."

## Core Truths

### The Universal Problem: Sin's Defacing Work

Every human being enters this world under the shadow of sin's curse:

> _"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."_ (Romans 3:23)

The phrase "come short" (Greek: _hystereō_) means to fall behind, to be lacking, to fail to reach a standard. God's glory—His character of perfect love and righteousness—is the standard. Sin has marred that image in every human heart.

[DYK🔎] The "glory of God" in Scripture often refers to His character. When Moses asked to see God's glory, the Lord proclaimed His name: "merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (Exodus 34:6). We have fallen short of reflecting this character.

Paul's indictment is thorough:

> _"There is none righteous, no, not one: there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."_ (Romans 3:10-12)

By nature, we cannot remedy our condition. The Ethiopian cannot change his skin, nor the leopard his spots (Jeremiah 13:23). We need a power outside ourselves.

### The Divine Solution: New Creation in Christ

Here is the gospel's glorious answer:

> _"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."_ (2 Corinthians 5:17)

**New creature**: Not merely reformed, but _re-created_. The Greek word _ktisis_ (creation) is the same word used for God's original creative work. What God did at the beginning of the world, He does again in the believing heart—He creates something that did not exist before.

[ILL] Consider a caterpillar. No amount of education or effort can teach it to fly. It must undergo a complete transformation—metamorphosis—emerging as an entirely new creature with wings. So with the sinner: human effort cannot produce holiness. We must be born again, made new by the creative power of God.

### What It Means to Be "In Christ"

> _"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:1)

Being "in Christ" is not merely a legal status—it is a living relationship. The branch is "in" the vine, drawing life from it moment by moment (John 15:4-5). Those in Christ:

- Have no condemnation (their guilt is removed)
- Walk not after the flesh (their conduct is changed)
- Walk after the Spirit (their power source is divine)

## Deeper Truths

### The Two Harvests: Flesh versus Spirit

Scripture presents two contrasting ways of life with two opposite fruits:

**The works of the flesh** (Galatians 5:19-21):

- Moral impurity: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness
- False worship: idolatry, witchcraft
- Broken relationships: hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders
- Intemperance: drunkenness, revelings

**The fruit of the Spirit** (Galatians 5:22-23):

- **Love, joy, peace**—the inward disposition
- **Longsuffering, gentleness, goodness**—relations with others
- **Faith, meekness, temperance**—self-government under God

[DYK🔎] Notice Paul says "works" (plural) of the flesh but "fruit" (singular) of the Spirit. The flesh produces scattered, disconnected acts of sin. The Spirit produces one unified harvest—love in all its expressions. You cannot have joy without love, or peace without gentleness. The fruit comes as a whole.

[Q] **"Can I pick and choose which fruits of the Spirit I want? I struggle with temperance but feel loving."**

The Spirit's fruit is a unified cluster. Where the Spirit truly dwells, all these graces develop together—though some may be stronger than others at different stages of growth. If we lack temperance, we ask God to develop what is lacking. He is faithful to complete what He begins (Philippians 1:6). But genuine love will not coexist indefinitely with deliberate intemperance, for love does not seek its own pleasure at the expense of God's will.

### Sons of God: Present Reality, Future Glory

> _"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."_ (Romans 8:14)

Sonship is not future—it is _now_. Those led by the Spirit are presently God's children. Yet there is more to come:

> _"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is."_ (1 John 3:2)

The full manifestation awaits Christ's return. We shall see Him face to face and be "like Him"—not merely outwardly, but in character, in nature, in glory. This is the destiny of the redeemed.

### The Purifying Hope

> _"And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."_ (1 John 3:3)

Here is the test of genuine hope: it _purifies_. Those who truly believe Christ is coming do not continue in sin—they actively cooperate with God in cleansing their lives. The hope of seeing Jesus inspires present holiness.

[Q] **"Doesn't 'purifieth himself' suggest salvation by works?"**

The verb is reflexive but not independent. We purify ourselves _in Christ_, using the means He provides: His word, His Spirit, His grace. A child washes his own hands, but only because his parent has provided soap, water, and instruction. The effort is real, but the power and provision come from another. So we "work out" our salvation because "it is God which worketh in" us (Philippians 2:12-13).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Biblical Perfection: What It Means

> _"But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing."_ (James 1:4)

The Bible clearly teaches perfection as God's goal for His people. But what does "perfect" mean?

**Perfect** (Greek: _teleios_) means _complete, mature, reaching the intended end_. A perfect apple is one that has fully ripened. A perfect student has completed the course. Christian perfection is character _fully developed_ according to God's design—every faculty surrendered to Him, every grace matured.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word _tam_ (often translated "perfect") describes Job: "perfect and upright" (Job 1:1). It means _complete, whole, with integrity_—not sinless in the absolute sense, but wholly devoted to God, with no double-mindedness or reservation.

### Perfection Is Progressive

> _"Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection."_ (Hebrews 6:1)

We do not arrive at perfection the moment we accept Christ. The "principles" (first elements, milk) are the starting point. From there we "go on"—press forward, advance, grow.

> _"But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."_ (2 Peter 3:18)

Growth is the law of Christian life. The Christian who is not growing is dying.

### The Ladder of Grace

Peter outlines the progressive steps:

> _"And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity."_ (2 Peter 1:5-7)

**The ascending order:**

1. **Faith**—the foundation, trust in God's word
2. **Virtue**—moral courage, strength of character
3. **Knowledge**—understanding God's will and ways
4. **Temperance**—self-control in all things
5. **Patience**—steadfast endurance under trial
6. **Godliness**—Christlike character, piety
7. **Brotherly kindness**—affection for fellow believers
8. **Charity (love)**—the crowning grace, the bond of perfectness (Colossians 3:14)

[ILL] This is like ascending a ladder. Each rung depends on the one below. You cannot skip rungs. Faith must produce virtue before knowledge can be properly used. Knowledge without temperance becomes dangerous. And all the graces, no matter how developed, are incomplete without love—the capstone that holds everything together.

### Christ's Grand Design

Why does Christ require so much of His followers?

> _"That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."_ (Ephesians 5:27)

Christ is preparing His bride. A bride adorns herself for her husband. The church adorns herself with the character of Christ—"the fine linen, clean and white," which is "the righteousness of saints" (Revelation 19:8).

This connects directly to the **sanctuary truth**. In the Most Holy Place, the final work of atonement is being completed. Christ our High Priest is now making intercession, applying His blood to cleanse the sanctuary and His people. The investigative judgment reveals who has truly cooperated with God's grace. Those whose sins are confessed and forsaken will have them blotted out; they will stand before God "without spot" in the time of trouble.

### The Means of Growth

**The Word of God:**

> _"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby."_ (1 Peter 2:2)

> _"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee."_ (Psalm 119:11)

> _"Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart."_ (Jeremiah 15:16)

The Word must be:

- _Desired_—hungered for like a baby craves milk
- _Hidden_—memorized, treasured, stored in the heart
- _Eaten_—digested, made part of our being

[DYK🔎] When Jeremiah says he "ate" God's words, he uses the imagery of the priest eating the sacrificial meat. God's word becomes our nourishment—it sustains spiritual life just as food sustains physical life.

**Prayer:**

> _"But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost."_ (Jude 1:20)

> _"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."_ (James 1:5)

> _"Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."_ (Philippians 4:6)

Prayer is the breath of the soul. Through prayer we receive wisdom, strength, and the Holy Spirit's power. Nothing is too great for God to handle, nothing too small to bring before Him.

## Practical Application

### The Promise of Complete Sanctification

> _"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

This is God's purpose: **whole-person sanctification**—spirit, soul, and body. Not partial transformation, but complete. Not for a few elite Christians, but for all who will cooperate with His grace.

**Spirit**—our connection with God, our conscience, our worship
**Soul**—our mind, emotions, and will
**Body**—our physical habits, health, and actions

God wants it all. He wants to sanctify us _wholly_.

### Living This Truth Today

1. **Acknowledge your need daily.** Begin each morning recognizing that you have "come short" and need Christ's righteousness.

2. **Abide in Christ.** Maintain constant connection through prayer, meditation on Scripture, and conscious dependence on the Spirit.

3. **Walk by the Spirit.** In every decision, ask: "Am I following the flesh or the Spirit?" Choose the Spirit's leading.

4. **Add to your faith.** Identify where you are on Peter's ladder. Which grace needs development? Ask God to strengthen that area.

5. **Feed on God's Word.** Read it, memorize it, meditate upon it. Let it become part of your thinking.

6. **Pray without ceasing.** Make every circumstance an occasion for communion with God.

7. **Cooperate with the refining process.** When trials come, let patience have her "perfect work." Do not fight against God's discipline.

8. **Keep the hope of Christ's coming before you.** This hope purifies. Let the thought of seeing Jesus face to face inspire present holiness.

## Appeal

> _"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:23-24)

God would not command perfection if it were impossible. He would not call us to holiness and then withhold the power to achieve it. The One who calls is _faithful_—He _will do it_.

The question is not whether God can perfect you. The question is: Will you let Him?

Today, if you hear His voice, harden not your heart. Surrender every reservation. Open every room of your soul to His cleansing presence. Let the great Refiner have His way, and He will present you faultless before the throne of His glory with exceeding joy (Jude 1:24).

_"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."_
