# Bible Study: Regeneration

## Introduction

Regeneration is the divine work by which God creates new life in the soul dead in sin. Far more than moral reform or religious improvement, regeneration is nothing less than a second birth—a complete re-creation by the power of the Holy Spirit. This study traces the golden thread of redemption from Eden lost to Eden restored, showing how God's plan encompasses not only the renewal of fallen humanity but the ultimate regeneration of the entire earth itself.

## Core Truths

### Christ's Mission: Seeking the Lost

The very purpose of Christ's coming to earth was redemptive. Jesus declared:

> _"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost."_ (Luke 19:10)

This single verse captures the entire gospel in miniature. Notice the active pursuit—Christ **came** to **seek**. Salvation is not humanity reaching up to God, but God reaching down to humanity. The shepherd does not wait for lost sheep to find their own way home; He goes after them.

**Redeemed from the curse**: Paul expands on what this salvation involves:

> _"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us."_ (Galatians 3:13)

The "curse of the law" is death—the wages of sin (Romans 6:23). Christ did not remove the law; He bore its penalty in our place. The law remains holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12), but its condemning power over the repentant sinner is broken.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "redeemed" (ἐξαγοράζω, _exagorazō_) means "to buy out of the marketplace." It was used for purchasing slaves to set them free. Christ paid the full price to liberate us from sin's slave market.

### The New Birth: Becoming Children of God

Who shall ultimately see God and dwell in His presence?

> _"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."_ (Matthew 5:8)

Purity of heart is not natural to fallen humanity. It must be received. This is why Jesus told Nicodemus, "Ye must be born again" (John 3:7). The question then becomes: **How does one become a child of God?**

> _"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."_ (Galatians 3:26)

> _"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God."_ (1 John 5:1)

**Faith** is the instrument through which we receive the new birth. But this is no mere intellectual agreement to historical facts about Jesus. Living faith transforms the life.

### Living Faith: More Than Mental Assent

[Q] **"If we are saved by faith alone, does it matter how we live?"**

James addresses this directly:

> _"For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."_ (James 2:26)

This is not a contradiction of salvation by grace through faith. Rather, it describes the **nature** of saving faith. A living tree naturally produces fruit; a living faith naturally produces obedience. The works do not save us—they are evidence that we have been saved.

John connects this truth to our prayer life:

> _"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight."_ (1 John 3:22)

And regarding the conscience:

> _"Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God."_ (1 John 3:20, 21)

When we knowingly continue in sin, our faith weakens and our confidence before God diminishes. Not because we are saved by our works, but because a divided heart cannot fully trust.

## Deeper Truths

### Justification and the Law

Here we must understand a vital distinction that has confused many sincere believers:

> _"Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin."_ (Romans 3:20)

The law cannot justify because that is not its function. A mirror reveals dirt on your face; it cannot wash the dirt away. The law reveals sin; it cannot remove sin. The law diagnoses; it does not cure.

**How then are we justified?**

> _"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (Romans 5:1)

**Justification**: God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is counted righteous because of Christ's merits credited to their account. It is not based on what we have done, but on what Christ has done for us.

[ILL] Imagine a criminal standing before a judge, clearly guilty of a capital offense. The evidence is overwhelming; the verdict is certain. But just before sentencing, the judge's own son steps forward and says, "I will take his punishment. Let him go free." The judge, in perfect justice, accepts the substitution. The guilty man walks out of the courtroom—not innocent of the crime, but pardoned. His record shows "debt paid in full." This is justification: Christ took our condemnation so we could receive His acquittal.

### From Death to Life: The Work of Regeneration

Paul describes our condition before regeneration in stark terms:

> _"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."_ (Romans 7:9)

Before we understood God's holy requirements, we felt spiritually "alive"—comfortable in our sins. But when the law did its work of conviction, we recognized our true state: spiritually dead, condemned, helpless.

How does God remedy this death?

> _"Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ."_ (Ephesians 2:5)

**Quickened**: Made alive. The same power that raised Christ from the tomb raises dead souls to spiritual life.

Paul gives this work a specific name:

> _"According to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost."_ (Titus 3:5)

**Regeneration**: From the Greek _palingenesia_ (παλιγγενεσία)—literally "birth again" or "genesis again." It is a complete re-creation of the inner person.

[DYK🔎] The word _palingenesia_ appears only twice in the New Testament—once referring to individual new birth (Titus 3:5) and once referring to the cosmic renewal at Christ's second coming (Matthew 19:28). This links personal regeneration with the ultimate regeneration of all creation!

---

### The Evidence of New Life

How do we know if regeneration has truly occurred? John provides a clear test:

> _"We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death."_ (1 John 3:14)

Love for fellow believers is the unmistakable fruit of the new birth. Where there is spiritual life, there will be love—not merely sentimental feeling, but self-sacrificing commitment to others' good.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Cosmic Scope of Redemption

Regeneration is not merely personal—it is planetary. To understand this, we must trace the story from Eden.

**Before the fall**, humanity had access to the tree of life:

> _"And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden."_ (Genesis 2:9)

**After transgression**, that access was barred:

> _"So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."_ (Genesis 3:24)

The curse extended to the very ground:

> _"Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life."_ (Genesis 3:17)

[Q] **"Did Satan gain actual authority over the earth through Adam's fall?"**

Scripture indicates that he did. When Adam yielded to temptation, he forfeited his dominion:

> _"For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."_ (2 Peter 2:19)

Satan himself claimed this authority when tempting Christ:

> _"And the devil said unto Him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me."_ (Luke 4:6)

Jesus did not dispute this claim. Satan had become "the prince of this world" (John 12:31). But Christ came to reclaim what was lost—both the people and the planet.

### The Purchased Possession

Paul reveals that redemption encompasses more than souls:

> _"In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of His glory."_ (Ephesians 1:13, 14)

The "purchased possession" awaiting redemption is the earth itself. The Holy Spirit in our hearts is the **earnest**—a down payment guaranteeing the full inheritance to come.

**How will the earth be cleansed from the curse?**

> _"Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."_ (2 Peter 3:12, 13)

**When will this cosmic regeneration occur?**

> _"And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."_ (Matthew 19:28)

Here Jesus uses the same word—_palingenesia_—to describe the renewal of all things at His glorious return. Personal regeneration now foreshadows planetary regeneration then.

### Sanctuary Shadows

The sanctuary service beautifully illustrates regeneration:

- At the **altar of burnt offering** (outer court), the sinner brought a sacrifice pointing to Christ's substitutionary death—the basis of our justification.
- At the **laver**, the priests washed before entering the holy place—symbolizing the "washing of regeneration" (Titus 3:5).
- In the **holy place**, the candlestick (Holy Spirit's light), the table of showbread (Word of God), and the altar of incense (prayer) sustained the spiritual life of regenerated believers—ongoing sanctification.
- The **Most Holy Place** ministry pointed forward to the final cleansing and the complete eradication of sin from the universe.

Just as the sanctuary moved from justification (altar) through sanctification (daily ministry) to final cleansing (Day of Atonement), so God's work in us moves from new birth through character development to complete restoration.

### The Final Restoration

What will the regenerated earth look like?

> _"For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."_ (Habakkuk 2:14)

Will the curse ever return?

> _"And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him."_ (Revelation 22:3)

**No more curse**—eternally secure. What Adam lost, Christ restores—and more. For the redeemed will never again be subject to the possibility of falling.

Will the tree of life be restored to humanity?

> _"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."_ (Revelation 22:14)

[DYK🔎] Notice: Those who "do His commandments" have "right to the tree of life." This is not legalism—it is the fruit of regeneration. Those born again by the Spirit love God's law and keep it from the heart (Ezekiel 36:26, 27). Obedience is not the root of salvation but its fruit; yet without that fruit, there is no life.

## Practical Application

### What Does This Mean for Daily Living?

1. **Rest in Christ's finished work**. Justification is complete the moment you believe. You cannot add to it by your efforts. Stop trying to earn what has already been given.

2. **Cooperate with the Spirit's ongoing work**. Regeneration begins a process. The same power that created new life in you will sustain and grow that life—if you submit daily. "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you" (Philippians 2:12, 13).

3. **Test yourself by love**. Do you love the brethren? Not in feeling only, but in patient, self-denying service? This is the evidence that you have passed from death to life.

4. **Keep your conscience clear**. When you know something is wrong, don't do it. When you know something is right, do it. A condemning heart blocks confidence before God and weakens faith.

5. **Live in hope of the regeneration**. The same God who is renewing your heart will renew the heavens and the earth. Let this blessed hope purify your life today: "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure" (1 John 3:3).

[ILL] A caterpillar does not become a butterfly by trying harder to be beautiful. It submits to a process—the cocoon, the waiting, the transformation wrought by unseen forces. When it emerges, it is no longer the same creature. So the regenerated soul does not improve the old life; it receives an entirely new one. Our part is to enter the cocoon of surrender and let God do His transforming work.

## Appeal

> _"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."_ (2 Corinthians 5:17)

Friend, have you been born again? Not merely convinced of truth, not merely a church member, not merely trying to live a good life—but **regenerated** by the power of the Holy Spirit?

If not, Christ is seeking you today. He came to save that which was lost. He stands at the door of your heart and knocks (Revelation 3:20). Will you open to Him?

If you have already received this new birth, are you walking in its power? Are you experiencing the "washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost" day by day? Or have you settled into a form of godliness without the power?

The same God who spoke worlds into existence can speak new life into your soul. The same power that will one day regenerate the earth is available now to regenerate your heart.

"Behold, I make all things new" (Revelation 21:5).

Will you let Him make **you** new—today?
