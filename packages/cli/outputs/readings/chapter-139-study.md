# Reading 139: The Importance of Prayer

## Introduction

Prayer is the breath of the soul—the vital link between fallen humanity and our loving Father in heaven. Far from being a mere religious formality, prayer is the divinely appointed channel through which God pours out His richest blessings upon His children. In this study, we explore what Scripture teaches about the privilege, practice, and power of prayer, and why it is especially urgent for those living in the last days.

## Core Truths

### The Promise of Prayer

God has made astonishing promises to those who pray. These are not conditional upon our worthiness, but upon His faithfulness and love:

> _"Everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."_ (Matthew 7:8)

Notice the certainty of these words: **everyone** who asks, **receives**. There is no ambiguity, no exception clause for the undeserving. Our Lord desires to give even more than we desire to receive.

Jesus illustrates this willingness by appealing to the natural affections of earthly parents:

> _"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?"_ (Matthew 7:11)

**[DYK🔎]** The Greek word translated "good things" in Matthew 7:11 is parallel to Luke 11:13, where Jesus specifies the "Holy Spirit" as the supreme gift the Father gives. The best gift heaven can bestow is not material prosperity but the presence and power of God Himself dwelling within us.

### In Whose Name We Pray

Our prayers do not come to the Father through our own merit, but through the merit and mediation of Christ:

> _"Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it."_ (John 14:13, 14)

To pray "in Jesus' name" is not a magical formula, but an acknowledgment that we approach God solely on the basis of Christ's righteousness, not our own. We come as beggars, empty-handed, yet confident—because we come in the name of the Beloved Son.

**[Q] "Why must we ask God for things He already knows we need?"**

It is true that our Father knows our needs before we ask (Matthew 6:8). Yet prayer is not about informing God—it is about **aligning our hearts with His will**, acknowledging our dependence, and receiving what He longs to give. James declares:

> _"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning."_ (James 1:17)

God is the unchanging Source of all good. Prayer opens the channel; unbelief and neglect close it.

## Deeper Truths

### How We Should Pray

Scripture gives us clear guidance on the **manner** of acceptable prayer:

**With the Spirit and Understanding:**

> _"I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also."_ (1 Corinthians 14:15)

Prayer should engage both heart and mind—not cold formalism, nor emotional frenzy, but heartfelt, intelligent communion with God.

**With Thanksgiving:**

> _"Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God."_ (Philippians 4:6)

Gratitude is the atmosphere of faith. To thank God before the answer comes demonstrates trust in His character.

**Without Vain Repetition:**

> _"But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking."_ (Matthew 6:7)

God is not impressed by eloquence or length. Sincerity, not volume, moves the heart of heaven.

**[ILL]** A child does not come to his father with a prepared speech, hoping to persuade him by fine words. He comes simply, openly, trustingly—telling his needs, sharing his heart. So should we come to our heavenly Father. He delights not in formality but in fellowship.

### The Essential Elements of Prayer

**Faith:**

> _"But without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him."_ (Hebrews 11:6)

> _"Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them."_ (Mark 11:24)

Faith is not merely believing God _can_ answer—it is believing He _will_ according to His word. This faith grasps the promise before the evidence appears.

**Forgiveness:**

> _"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."_ (Mark 11:25, 26)

An unforgiving spirit blocks the channel of blessing. We cannot receive heaven's pardon while withholding our own.

**[Q] "What if I don't _feel_ like forgiving?"**

Forgiveness is first an **act of the will**, not a feeling. We choose to forgive as an act of obedience, and God supplies the grace to make it real in our hearts. As we surrender our resentment, He replaces it with His love (Romans 5:5).

## The Practice of Prayer

### Secret Prayer

> _"But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."_ (Matthew 6:6)

The closet of secret devotion is the birthplace of spiritual power. What we are in private with God determines what we are in public before men.

Jesus Himself modeled this discipline:

> _"And when He had sent the multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, He was there alone."_ (Matthew 14:23)

**[DYK🔎]** The Gospels record at least seven separate occasions when Jesus withdrew to solitary places for prayer—before major decisions, after exhausting ministry, and in times of crisis. If the sinless Son of God needed such communion, how much more do we?

### Prayer Under Persecution

When opposition threatens, should we abandon our devotions? Daniel's example answers:

> _"Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime."_ (Daniel 6:10)

Daniel neither flaunted his piety nor hid it in fear. He simply continued his **customary** communion with God, trusting the consequences to heaven. His faithfulness in prayer led to deliverance from the lions' den—a testimony that has inspired believers for millennia.

### Family and Corporate Prayer

Scripture commends household devotion. Cornelius is praised:

> _"A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway."_ (Acts 10:2)

The early church gathered for united prayer:

> _"He came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying."_ (Acts 12:12)

The atmosphere of united prayer brought Peter's miraculous release from prison. There is power when believers unite their petitions.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Praying Without Ceasing

Paul's exhortation seems impossible:

> _"Pray without ceasing."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:17)

> _"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit."_ (Ephesians 6:18)

This does not mean perpetual kneeling, but **perpetual dependence**—a heart habitually turned heavenward, a spirit of constant communion, an awareness that every moment we need divine grace.

**[ILL]** A child learning to walk keeps one hand always within reach of his father. He may look around, play, even run a few steps—but he never strays far from that guiding hand. So the Christian "prays without ceasing" by maintaining constant heart-connection with God, drawing strength for every step.

### The Lesson of Importunity

Jesus' parable of the persistent widow teaches a vital principle:

> _"Though I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me."_ (Luke 18:4, 5)

The lesson is not that God must be pestered into action, but that **persevering faith** is precious to Him:

> _"And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them? I tell you that He will avenge them speedily."_ (Luke 18:6–8)

Yet immediately Jesus asks a searching question:

> _"Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?"_ (Luke 18:8)

The issue at Christ's return is not whether God is willing to answer, but **whether His people will still be praying and believing**.

### Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the altar of incense stood before the veil, and its fragrant smoke ascended continually before God. This represented the prayers of God's people mingled with the merits of Christ (Revelation 8:3, 4). Our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary receives our prayers, purifies them with His own righteousness, and presents them acceptable before the Father.

**[DYK🔎]** The altar of incense was overlaid with gold and stood higher than the other furniture in the holy place—symbolizing that prayer, offered through Christ, reaches to the very throne of God.

When we pray in Jesus' name, we are not merely using a formula. We are **connecting with Christ's mediatorial ministry** in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary. Our prayers ascend through Him, the Mediator of the new covenant (Hebrews 8:1, 2; 9:24).

## Practical Application

### Prayer for the Last Days

Jesus gave special counsel for those living near His return:

> _"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."_ (Luke 21:36)

This is not casual advice—it is urgent command. The perils of the last days demand **intensified prayer**:

- To discern deception in an age of spiritual confusion
- To stand firm amid unprecedented trial
- To have our characters sealed in righteousness
- To be found watching when Christ appears

**The parable of the widow was given precisely for this purpose:**

> _"And He spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint."_ (Luke 18:1)

### What This Means for You

This truth calls us to:

1. **Regular secret devotion**—daily, unhurried time with God in the closet of prayer
2. **Family worship**—establishing altars of prayer in our homes
3. **Corporate prayer**—joining with fellow believers for united intercession
4. **Persevering faith**—continuing to pray even when answers delay
5. **Forgiving hearts**—keeping the channel clear of bitterness
6. **Constant dependence**—breathing prayer throughout the day

## Appeal

> _"Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full."_ (John 16:24)

Heaven's storehouse is open. The Father waits with infinite longing to bestow His richest gifts upon His children. The question is not whether He will give, but whether we will ask.

Will you establish—or renew—a life of prayer? Will you come daily, humbly, persistently to the throne of grace? Will you pray in faith, forgive freely, and trust wholly in Christ's mediation?

The Son of man is coming. He is asking even now: _"Shall I find faith on the earth?"_

Let your answer be found in the closet, at the family altar, and among the praying people of God—watching, praying, believing until He comes.
