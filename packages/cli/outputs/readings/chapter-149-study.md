# Bible Study: Support of the Ministry

## Introduction

God has established a sacred system for financing His work on earth—the tithe. Far from being mere religious taxation, tithing reveals profound truths about stewardship, trust, and our relationship with the Creator who owns all things. Understanding this principle transforms our view of possessions and opens channels of divine blessing.

## Core Truths

### God Owns Everything

Before we can understand tithing, we must grasp a foundational truth: **nothing truly belongs to us**.

> _"The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts."_ (Haggai 2:8)

> _"For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine."_ (Psalm 50:10, 11)

This is not merely poetic language. The Creator of heaven and earth retains ownership of all He has made. We are not owners but **stewards**—managers of Another's property.

> _"For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods."_ (Matthew 25:14)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "steward" literally means "one who is over a house"—managing everything but owning nothing. This was Abraham's servant Eliezer's position (Genesis 15:2), and it perfectly describes our relationship to God's resources.

### The Tithe Belongs to God

Having established God's ownership, we discover He has reserved a specific portion:

> _"And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord."_ (Leviticus 27:30)

**Tithe**: A tenth part of one's increase, set apart as holy—belonging to God, not to the giver.

Notice the language: the tithe **is** the Lord's. We do not give God the tithe; we **return** to Him what already belongs to Him. This is why withholding tithe is called something startling:

> _"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings."_ (Malachi 3:8)

[Q] **"But isn't calling it 'robbery' rather harsh? I earned this money through my own labor."**

Scripture addresses this directly: _"But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth"_ (Deuteronomy 8:18). Every ability to work, every opportunity for income, every breath we draw comes from God. The tithe simply acknowledges this reality. To keep what belongs to Another—while knowing it belongs to Him—is indeed robbery, however respectable it may appear.

## Deeper Truths

### Tithing Predates and Transcends the Mosaic Law

Some argue that tithing was part of the ceremonial law abolished at the cross. But Scripture reveals tithing began long before Moses:

> _"For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all."_ (Hebrews 7:1, 2)

Abraham paid tithe to Melchisedec approximately **430 years before** the Mosaic law was given at Sinai. Jacob also vowed to tithe (Genesis 28:22). This places tithing among the eternal moral principles, not temporary ceremonial regulations.

[DYK🔎] The Melchisedec priesthood is remarkable: no recorded beginning or end, superior to the Levitical priesthood, and—most significantly—**the very order to which Christ belongs** (Hebrews 6:20). If Abraham tithed under this priesthood, and Christ ministers under this same priesthood today, what does this suggest about tithing's continued validity?

### Christ Confirmed the Tithing Principle

Jesus Himself addressed tithing directly:

> _"Ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."_ (Matthew 23:23)

Christ's rebuke was not for tithing—even of garden herbs—but for neglecting justice, mercy, and faith **while** tithing. Notice His verdict on tithing itself: **"these ought ye to have done."** Jesus affirmed tithing while calling for balanced, heart-felt religion.

[ILL] Consider a man who meticulously pays his rent each month but treats his landlord with contempt, damages the property, and violates every term of the lease. His punctual payments do not make him a good tenant. Yet imagine another man who speaks kindly of his landlord, cares beautifully for the property, but refuses to pay rent, saying "I show my appreciation in other ways." Neither is faithful. Christ calls us to **both**—the tithe **and** the weightier matters, joined in loving obedience.

### God's Plan for Gospel Support

The New Testament directly connects Old Testament tithing principles with gospel ministry:

> _"Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel."_ (1 Corinthians 9:13, 14)

The phrase **"even so"** (in like manner) connects the Levitical support system with gospel ministry support. Under the old economy, the Levites received the tithe for their service (Numbers 18:21). Paul argues that **the same principle** supports those who preach the gospel.

> _"If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?"_ (1 Corinthians 9:11)

> _"For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things."_ (Romans 15:27)

Paul calls this a **duty**—not optional generosity but sacred obligation.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Heart Behind the Tithe

Tithing is ultimately about **trust and love**. When asked about the greatest commandment, Jesus quoted:

> _"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength."_ (Luke 10:27)

How can we love God with "all our strength" yet cling anxiously to possessions as if He cannot provide? Tithing becomes a tangible expression of faith—a weekly or monthly declaration that we trust the Giver more than the gift.

> _"Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase."_ (Proverbs 3:9)

[Q] **"But I can barely make ends meet. How can I afford to tithe?"**

This is where faith meets reality. The world says, "Pay your bills first, then give God what's left." God says, _"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you"_ (Matthew 6:33). Tithing is not about what we can afford—it's about whom we trust. Countless believers have testified that they cannot explain mathematically how 90% goes further than 100%, but they have experienced it.

### The Danger of Riches

Scripture warns:

> _"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."_ (1 Timothy 6:9)

> _"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy."_ (1 Timothy 6:17)

Wealth has a subtle power to capture the heart. Regular tithing serves as a safeguard—a systematic reminder that God, not money, is our security. The act of releasing the tenth breaks the grip of covetousness and keeps eternal priorities in view.

### Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary system, the Levites who ministered received no land inheritance in Israel. Their inheritance was **the Lord Himself** (Numbers 18:20)—and the tithes were God's provision for their service. This beautiful arrangement meant that as Israel prospered, so did those who served at the sanctuary.

Today, Christ ministers in the heavenly sanctuary as our great High Priest (Hebrews 8:1-2). His earthly representatives—those who preach the gospel—are supported by the same principle. The tithe system connects us to the ongoing work of Christ's ministry.

## Practical Application

### Render to God What Is God's

> _"Then saith He unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."_ (Matthew 22:21)

We pay taxes because we recognize civil obligation. Should we not also recognize our obligation to heaven's government?

### Bring All the Tithe

> _"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house."_ (Malachi 3:10)

The **storehouse** represents the organized treasury where God's work is coordinated and supported. In ancient Israel, this was the temple; today, it is the organized church through which global mission is sustained.

[DYK🔎] Archaeological evidence confirms that ancient Israelite communities had designated storage facilities for tithes near the temple and in Levitical cities. This was not random giving but **systematic, organized support** for God's work—a principle that continues today.

### God's Promise to Faithful Stewards

> _"And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts."_ (Malachi 3:11)

This is one of the few places where God invites us to **test Him**: _"prove me now herewith"_ (Malachi 3:10). He promises protection and blessing to those who honor Him with their substance.

This does not mean tithers become wealthy in worldly terms. But it does mean God takes responsibility for those who faithfully return His portion. He promises to "rebuke the devourer"—those unexpected expenses, breakdowns, and losses that so often consume our resources.

## Appeal

_"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."_ (Matthew 22:21)

The tithe is not ours to give or withhold—it belongs to God. Returning it is simply an act of honesty and trust. But more than financial duty, tithing is a heart response to the God who gave His only Son for our redemption.

Have you been faithful in this sacred trust? If not, today is the day to begin. Not from guilt or fear, but from love—love for the God who owns all, provides all, and asks so little in return. He who gave heaven's greatest treasure for your salvation can surely be trusted with your finances.

Will you honor Him with your substance? Will you prove Him and discover that His promises are true? The faithful steward will one day hear those blessed words: _"Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"_ (Matthew 25:23).
