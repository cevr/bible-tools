# Reading 93: The Lord's Day

## Introduction

Which day is truly "the Lord's day"? This question deserves careful, reverent
examination. Scripture reveals that Christ Himself—the Creator of all
things—established, blessed, and kept the seventh-day Sabbath, making it His own
day in a unique and eternal sense. Understanding this truth connects us with
Christ's creative work, His earthly ministry, and His unchanging law of love.

## Core Truths

### Christ the Creator

The foundation of the Sabbath's authority rests upon Christ's identity as
Creator. Scripture is unmistakably clear:

> _"All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was
> made."_ (John 1:3)

> _"For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in
> earth, visible and invisible... all things were created by Him, and for Him."_
> (Colossians 1:16)

Paul confirms this truth: _"God, who created all things by Jesus Christ"_
(Ephesians 3:9). The Jesus who walked the shores of Galilee is the same Divine
Person who spoke worlds into existence.

**Creation**: The act by which God brought all things into existence from
nothing by the word of His power (Hebrews 11:3; Genesis 1:1).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word "logos" (Word) in John 1:1-3 carries the meaning of both
"spoken word" and "divine reason." When Christ spoke, creation happened—the same
voice that said "Let there be light" later said "Lazarus, come forth."

### The Sabbath Established at Creation

When the creation week concluded, Christ did something extraordinary:

> _"And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested
> on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the
> seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His
> work which God created and made."_ (Genesis 2:2-3)

Three distinct acts marked this day:

1. **God rested**—not from weariness, but as an example and blessing for
   mankind
2. **God blessed**—setting the day apart with special divine favor
3. **God sanctified**—making it holy, set apart for sacred purpose

**Sanctified**: Set apart for holy use; made sacred by God's own declaration and
presence (Genesis 2:3; Exodus 20:11).

This occurred before sin entered, before any Jewish nation existed, before any
ceremonial system was established. The Sabbath belongs to creation itself.

### Made for Man

Christ Himself declared the Sabbath's universal purpose:

> _"The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath."_ (Mark 2:27)

Notice: Christ did not say "made for Jews" or "made for Israel." The Sabbath was
made for _man_—humanity as a whole. It was given in Eden when only Adam and Eve
existed, centuries before Abraham was born.

[DYK🔎] The word "man" in Mark 2:27 is the Greek _anthropos_, meaning "humanity"
or "mankind"—the same word used in John 3:16 ("God so loved the world"). Christ
explicitly linked the Sabbath to all people, not one nation.

### Christ—Lord of the Sabbath

> _"Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath."_ (Mark 2:28)

This remarkable claim establishes Christ's special relationship to this day. As
Creator, He made it. As Lord, He owns it. As Redeemer, He honors it. If any day
deserves to be called "the Lord's day," it is the day of which He declared
Himself Lord.

## Deeper Truths

### Christ's Perfect Example

Did Christ practice what He taught regarding the Sabbath? The evidence is
overwhelming:

> _"And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His custom
> was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to
> read."_ (Luke 4:16)

The phrase "as His custom was" reveals a lifelong habit—not occasional
observance but consistent practice. At the end of His ministry, Christ could
honestly say:

> _"I have kept My Father's commandments."_ (John 15:10)

[Q] **"But didn't Jesus break the Sabbath by healing on that day?"**

Jesus never broke the Sabbath—He broke the man-made traditions the Pharisees had
added to it. When accused of Sabbath-breaking, He responded: _"Wherefore it is
lawful to do well on the Sabbath days"_ (Matthew 12:12). Christ distinguished
between the divine institution and human additions. He showed the true spirit of
Sabbath-keeping: mercy, healing, and doing good—not idle inactivity or
burdensome rules.

### Christ's Concern for Future Sabbath-Keeping

One of the most striking evidences of the Sabbath's continuing importance comes
from Christ's prophecy about Jerusalem's destruction—an event occurring nearly
40 years after His death:

> _"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath
> day."_ (Matthew 24:20)

Why would Christ instruct His followers to pray about Sabbath observance decades
in the future if the Sabbath were to pass away at the cross? This prayer makes
sense only if Christ expected His disciples to continue honoring the Sabbath
long after His ascension.

[ILL] Imagine a father leaving instructions for his children before a long
journey. Would he say, "Be sure to lock the doors each night" if he intended to
remove the doors before leaving? Christ's instruction about the Sabbath in
Matthew 24:20 reveals His expectation that His followers would still be keeping
it when Jerusalem fell in A.D. 70.

### The Disciples After the Cross

How did Christ's closest followers understand the Sabbath after His death? Luke
provides the answer:

> _"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath
> day according to the commandment."_ (Luke 23:56)

Notice: they rested "according to the commandment"—not according to Jewish
custom or national tradition, but according to God's commandment. The very next
verse clarifies the sequence:

> _"Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came
> unto the sepulchre."_ (Luke 24:1)

The Sabbath "according to the commandment" is clearly the day before the first
day—what we call Saturday.

[DYK🔎] Luke, writing years after the cross to Gentile readers, still identified
the seventh day as "the Sabbath day according to the commandment." He made no
mention of any change or new observance replacing it.

### The Apostolic Practice

The apostle Paul, missionary to the Gentiles, consistently honored the Sabbath:

> _"And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days
> reasoned with them out of the Scriptures."_ (Acts 17:2)

The phrase "as his manner was" echoes Luke's description of Christ in Luke 4:16.
Paul's habit—his custom—was Sabbath worship.

Consider the evidence from Acts:

- **Acts 13:14, 42, 44**—Paul preaches on the Sabbath; Gentiles request he
  return the next Sabbath; nearly the whole city gathers
- **Acts 16:13**—Paul meets for worship by a riverside on the Sabbath in
  Philippi, a Roman colony with no synagogue
- **Acts 18:4, 11**—Paul reasons in the synagogue every Sabbath for a year and a
  half in Corinth

[Q] **"Didn't Paul only go to synagogues on Sabbath to reach Jews?"**

Acts 16:13 shows Paul seeking a place of Sabbath worship where there was no
synagogue—among Gentiles by a riverside. Acts 13:42-44 reveals Gentiles
specifically requesting Sabbath instruction and gathering "almost the whole
city." If Paul taught Gentiles that Sabbath-keeping was unnecessary, why did he
never suggest they meet on another day? Why did they come on the Sabbath?

### The Enduring Law

Scripture testifies to the permanence of God's commandments:

> _"The works of His hands are verity and judgment; all His commandments are
> sure. They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
> uprightness."_ (Psalm 111:7-8)

Christ Himself affirmed:

> _"It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to
> fail."_ (Luke 16:17)

Rather than abolishing the law, Christ came to fulfill the prophecy:

> _"He will magnify the law, and make it honourable."_ (Isaiah 42:21)

**Magnify**: To enlarge, expand, or show the full depth and spiritual
application of God's law (Matthew 5:21-28).

Christ magnified the Sabbath by stripping away human traditions, revealing its
true purpose of blessing, healing, and communion with God.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sabbath in the Great Controversy

The Sabbath stands at the heart of the great controversy between Christ and
Satan. It is the memorial of creation—a weekly reminder that God, not chance,
made us. It is the seal of God's authority—containing His name (Lord), His
title (Creator), and His territory (heaven and earth).

Satan's first attack on humanity questioned God's word: "Hath God said?" (Genesis
3:1). His continuing strategy questions God's law: "Does it really matter which
day?" The Sabbath commandment uniquely identifies the true God as Creator and
Lawgiver. To undermine this command is to undermine allegiance to God Himself.

### The Sabbath and Righteousness by Faith

The Sabbath is not merely a day of rest—it is a profound symbol of righteousness
by faith. Just as we cease our physical labor to enter God's rest, so we cease
our spiritual self-effort to rest in Christ's righteousness:

> _"There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is
> entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from
> His."_ (Hebrews 4:9-10)

We cannot work our way into salvation any more than we can work our way into
Sabbath rest. We enter by faith, trusting God's completed work—both in creation
and redemption.

### The Sabbath and the Sanctuary

In the earthly sanctuary, the Sabbath commandment rested at the very heart of
the ark, covered by the mercy seat where God's presence dwelt. The law,
including the Sabbath, was not abolished at the cross but remains in the
heavenly sanctuary:

> _"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple
> the ark of His testament."_ (Revelation 11:19)

The commandments that include the Sabbath remain in heaven's Most Holy Place,
the standard by which all will be judged. Christ's present ministry in the
heavenly sanctuary writes this law in the hearts of His people (Hebrews 8:10).

## Practical Application

Understanding that Christ is Lord of the Sabbath transforms how we approach this
day:

1. **Preparation**—Like the disciples who prepared spices before the Sabbath
   (Luke 23:56), we prepare our homes and hearts before sundown Friday

2. **Worship**—Like Christ and Paul, we gather for worship, study, and
   fellowship with God's people

3. **Doing Good**—Like Christ who healed on the Sabbath, we look for
   opportunities to bless and serve others

4. **Rest in Christ**—We cease our labors and anxieties, trusting wholly in
   Christ's finished work for our salvation

5. **Creation Joy**—We spend time in nature, appreciating the Creator's
   handiwork and refreshing our souls

The Sabbath is not a burden but a gift—twenty-four hours set apart to cease
striving and receive God's blessing. It is a weekly reminder that we belong to
the Creator who loved us enough to give us His time.

## Appeal

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My
> holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable;
> and shalt honour Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
> pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: Then shalt thou delight thyself in the
> Lord."_ (Isaiah 58:13-14)

Christ created the Sabbath. Christ blessed and sanctified it. Christ kept it
throughout His earthly life. Christ declared Himself its Lord. Christ expected
His followers to honor it after His ascension. The apostles practiced it. The
commandment remains "sure" and stands "for ever and ever."

If any day deserves to be called "the Lord's day," it is the seventh-day
Sabbath—the day Christ made, the day Christ claimed, the day Christ blessed for
all humanity.

Will you honor Christ by keeping His day holy? Will you enter into His rest—both
the weekly Sabbath rest and the eternal rest of trusting wholly in His
righteousness? The Lord of the Sabbath invites you to experience the blessing He
created for you from the foundation of the world.
