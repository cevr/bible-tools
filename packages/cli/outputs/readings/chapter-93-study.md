### Q1. On what foundation is the Christian church built?

“And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
Himself being the chief cornerstone." Eph. 2:20.

**Answer:** The Christian church does not rest upon human traditions, decrees of
councils, or the shifting sands of popular opinion. It is established upon the
enduring record of God’s will—the writings of the **prophets** (Old Testament)
and the **apostles** (New Testament)—held together by **Jesus Christ**, the
Chief Cornerstone.

- **The Cornerstone:** In ancient architecture, the cornerstone was the first
  stone set; it determined the angle and stability of the entire building. If
  the cornerstone is removed, the building collapses. Similarly, all doctrine
  must align with Christ’s life and teachings.
- **Unity of Scripture:** The church is built on both the prophets and the
  apostles. This teaches us that the Old Testament is not obsolete; it is the
  foundation upon which the New Testament stands. Christ Himself constantly
  appealed to the prophets to validate His mission (Luke 24:27).
- **The Living Temple:** Paul uses the imagery of a temple (Ephesians 2:21). In
  the **earthly sanctuary**, the law of God was in the Most Holy Place. In the
  **spiritual temple** (the church), Christ writes that same law upon the hearts
  of His people (Hebrews 8:10).

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a builder trying to construct a second story
(the New Testament) while destroying the first story (the Old Testament). The
house would fall. The apostles built _upon_ the prophets, they did not destroy
them. To understand the "Lord's Day" in the New Testament, we must look at the
foundation laid in the beginning.

### Q2. By whom were all things created?

“Which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all
things by Jesus Christ. " Eph. 3:9.

**Answer:** While God the Father is the Source of all life, He created all
things _through_ His Son, Jesus Christ (John 1:1–3; Colossians 1:16).

- **Christ the Creator:** The One who died on Calvary is the same One who spoke
  the worlds into existence. He is not merely a created being; He is the
  Architect of creation.
- **Redemption and Creation:** This connection is vital for **Righteousness by
  Faith**. The power required to create a world from nothing is the same power
  required to create a clean heart in a sinner (Psalm 51:10). If we trust Him to
  create the universe, we can trust Him to re-create our characters.
- **Implication for Worship:** If Christ is the active Agent of creation, then
  the memorial of creation (the Sabbath) is specifically a memorial of Christ’s
  work.

---

### Q3. When was the creation finished?

“And God saw everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the
evening and the morning were the sixth day. Thus, the heavens and the earth were
finished, and all the host of them." Gen. 1:31; 2:1.

**Answer:** The work of creation was not an endless evolutionary process but a
distinct event completed in six literal days.

- **"Very Good":** When Christ finished His work, it was perfect. There was no
  sin, no death, and no flaw.
- **The Finished Work:** Just as creation was a "finished" work that man could
  add nothing to, so **justification** is a finished work of Christ. We cannot
  add our works to His creation to improve it, nor can we add our merits to His
  atonement to save ourselves. We simply accept what He has done.

**Definition:**

- **Justification:** The legal declaration by God that a repentant sinner is
  righteous, based solely on the merits of Jesus Christ, credited (imputed) to
  the believer’s account (Romans 3:24–28).

---

### Q4. What did the Creator do on the seventh day?

“And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on
the seventh day from all His work which He had made." Gen. 2:2.

**Answer:** On the seventh day, Christ (the Creator) rested.

- **Divine Rest:** God did not rest because He was tired, for the Creator
  "fainteth not, neither is weary" (Isaiah 40:28). He rested to set an example
  and to establish a specific cycle for humanity.
- **Ceasing from Works:** To "rest" (Hebrew _shabath_) literally means to cease
  or desist.
- **Spiritual Significance:** This rest points to the spiritual rest we find in
  the Gospel. As God rested from His works, the believer rests from his own
  attempts to earn salvation (Hebrews 4:10). We stop trying to save ourselves
  and rest in the finished work of Jesus.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A painter who finishes a masterpiece steps back, puts
down his brush, and enjoys the beauty of what he has made. He doesn't stop
because he is exhausted, but because the work is complete and perfect. The
Sabbath is an invitation to step back and admire God’s perfect work—both in
creation and in redemption.

---

### Q5. After resting from His creative work on that seventh day, what did the Creator do?

“And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had
rested from all His work which God created and made." Gen. 2:3.

**Answer:** The Creator performed three distinct acts regarding the seventh day:
He **rested** on it, He **blessed** it, and He **sanctified** it.

- **Blessed:** God placed a special spiritual favor upon this specific 24-hour
  period. No other day of the week received this blessing.
- **Sanctified:** To sanctify means "to set apart for a holy use." God separated
  this day from the other six working days. It acts as a partition in time
  between the common and the holy.
- **The First Sabbath:** This occurred in Eden, before sin entered the world.
  Therefore, the Sabbath is not a "Jewish institution" (as there were no Jews in
  Eden), but a gift for mankind.

**Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The process of being made holy or set apart for God. In
  the Christian life, it is the work of the Holy Spirit imparting the life of
  Christ to the believer, resulting in obedience and victory over sin (1
  Thessalonians 4:3).

---

### Q6. For whom did Christ say the Sabbath was made?

“And He said unto them, the Sabbath was made for man." Mark 2:28. _(Note: The
text quoted is Mark 2:27; the question cites Mark 2:28 which declares His
Lordship. Both are connected.)_

**Answer:** Jesus plainly declared that the Sabbath was made for **man**
(mankind)—the human race.

- **A Gift, Not a Burden:** The Pharisees had loaded the Sabbath with man-made
  rules, making it a burden. Jesus restored it to its original purpose: a
  blessing "for man." It was designed for our physical rest and our spiritual
  refreshment.
- **Universal Scope:** Since it was made for "man," it applies to all men in all
  ages. As long as there are men who need rest and a connection with their
  Creator, the Sabbath remains in effect.
- **Relationship to Health:** The Creator knows our frame. He designed us to
  need one day in seven for recuperation. To ignore this is to violate the laws
  of our own being.

---

### Q7. What is Christ's relation to the Sabbath?

” Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath." Mark 2:28.

**Answer:** Because Christ is the Creator who made the day, rested on it, and
blessed it, He is the rightful **Lord of the Sabbath**.

- **Ownership:** If Christ is the Lord _of_ the Sabbath, then the Sabbath
  belongs to Him. It is His day.
- **The True "Lord's Day":** Many claim the first day of the week is the "Lord's
  Day," but Jesus never claimed lordship over Sunday. He specifically claims the
  Sabbath (the seventh day) as His territory.
- **Discipleship:** If we call Him "Lord," we ought to respect what He claims as
  His own. "Why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"
  (Luke 6:46).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a landlord owns a property, he has the right to set
the rules for that property. A tenant cannot simply decide to pay rent on a
different day or claim ownership of a different house. Christ, the Lord of Time,
has marked the seventh day as His property. To appropriate another day is to
trespass on His authority.

---

### Q8. How much honor is due to Christ?

“All men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father." John 5:23.

**Answer:** The Father has committed all judgment and authority to the Son.
Therefore, we cannot honor the Father while dishonoring the Son's commandments
or His created institutions.

- **Equality:** In the **Great Controversy**, Satan has sought to diminish the
  position of Christ. True Christianity elevates Christ to His rightful place as
  equal with the Father.
- **Practical Honor:** We honor Christ not merely by lip service, but by walking
  as He walked. To keep the day He made and kept is a high form of honor.

---

### Q9. Did Christ keep the Sabbath?

“And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His custom was,
He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read." Luke
4:16. "I have kept My Father's commandments." John 15:10.

**Answer:** Yes. It was Jesus’ lifelong **custom** (habit) to keep the Sabbath.

- **Christ Our Example:** "He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so
  to walk, even as He walked" (1 John 2:6). Jesus is the pattern of a perfect
  human life. He lived a life of obedience to the Law of God.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** This is the core of the Gospel. Jesus lived a
  perfect life of obedience _for us_.
  - **Imputed:** His record of Sabbath-keeping and law-keeping is credited to us
    for our **Justification**.
  - **Imparted:** Through the Holy Spirit, He comes to live that same life of
    obedience _in us_ for our **Sanctification**. Christ in the heart will not
    break the Sabbath today any more than He broke it 2,000 years ago.

### Q10. When the Saviour predicted the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and the consequent flight of the disciples from all Judea, how did He urge them to regard the Sabbath in that flight?

“But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day."
Matt. 24:20.

**Answer:** Jesus was looking forward nearly 40 years to the destruction of
Jerusalem (which occurred in A.D. 70). He instructed His disciples to pray that
their flight would not be on the Sabbath.

- **Proof of Permanence:** If the Sabbath was to be abolished at the Cross (A.D.
  31), why would Jesus be concerned about His disciples keeping it in A.D. 70?
  This shows clearly that Jesus expected His followers to be observing the
  Sabbath long after His resurrection.
- **Practical Concern:** Flight in winter is physically difficult; flight on the
  Sabbath is spiritually burdensome for those who love God’s law. Christ desired
  His people to be free to rest and worship, even amidst tribulation.

---

### Q11. Did the followers of Christ keep the Sabbath after His death?

“And they returned and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day
according to the commandment." Luke 23:56.

**Answer:** Yes. Even in their grief, with their Master in the tomb, the
disciples (specifically the faithful women) respected the commandment.

- **"According to the Commandment":** Luke, writing decades after the
  resurrection, does not say they rested according to "the old Jewish custom,"
  but according to the **commandment**. The Holy Spirit recognizes the
  commandment as still binding.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - **Friday:** Christ died (The Sacrifice/Outer Court).
  - **Sabbath:** Christ rested in the tomb.
  - **Sunday:** Christ arose (High Priest ministry begins).
  - Even in His death, Christ honored the Sabbath rest.

---

### Q12. What did they do on the next day? and what day of the week was it ?

"Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto
the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others
with them." Luke 24:1.

**Answer:** On the **first day of the week** (Sunday), they came to do the work
(anointing the body) that they would not do on the Sabbath.

- **Distinction of Days:** The Bible clearly distinguishes between the "Sabbath"
  (7th day) and the "first day" (Sunday). The disciples rested on one and worked
  on the other.
- **No Transfer of Holiness:** There is no record here, or anywhere in
  Scripture, that the holiness of the Sabbath was transferred to the day of the
  resurrection. The resurrection is a glorious event, but Scripture gives us a
  specific memorial for it: **Baptism** (Romans 6:3–6), not Sunday-keeping.

**NOTE:** The order is clear:

1.  Preparation Day (Friday)
2.  The Sabbath (Saturday)
3.  First Day of the Week (Sunday)

---

### Q13. What day does the commandment say is the Sabbath?

” But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God." Ex. 20:10.

**Answer:** The Fourth Commandment is specific: The **seventh day** is the
Sabbath.

- **God's Definition:** Mankind often tries to change God's definitions. Some
  say, "one day in seven is enough." But God specifies _which_ day. It is not
  "a" sabbath, but "the" Sabbath.
- **Of the Lord:** Again, notice the title. It is the Sabbath "of the Lord," not
  of the Jews. It belongs to God.
- **The Seal of the Law:** This commandment contains the elements of a royal
  seal:
  1.  **Name:** "The Lord thy God."
  2.  **Title:** Creator ("made heaven and earth").
  3.  **Territory:** Heaven and earth. Without this commandment, the Law would
      not identify _who_ is speaking.

---

### Q14. How enduring are the commandments?

“The works of His hands are verity and judgment; all His commandments are sure.
They stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness." Ps.
111:7, 8.

**Answer:** God’s commandments are "sure" and they stand "forever and ever."

- **The Character of God:** The Law is a transcript of God's character. Since
  God does not change (Malachi 3:6), His moral law cannot change.
- **Truth and Uprightness:** To abolish the law would be to abolish the standard
  of truth.
- **The New Covenant:** Under the New Covenant, God does not abolish the law; He
  writes it **in the heart** (Hebrews 8:10). He empowers the believer to keep
  it.

---

### Q15. What did Christ say of the commandments?

“It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
Luke 16:17.

**Answer:** Christ affirmed the immutability (unchangeableness) of the Law in
the strongest possible terms.

- **Heaven and Earth:** As long as the sky is above us and the earth is beneath
  us, the Law of God remains in effect.
- **Tittle:** A "tittle" was a tiny mark in Hebrew writing, similar to the
  dotting of an 'i' or crossing of a 't'. Not even the smallest part of the Law
  was to be removed by Christ's ministry.
- **Grace and Law:** Grace does not remove the law; grace forgives our
  transgression of the law and empowers us to keep it. "Do we then make void the
  law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Romans 3:31).

---

### Q16. What was Christ to do to the law when He came?

“The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake: He will magnify the law
and make it honorable." Isa. 42:21.

**Answer:** Christ's mission was to **magnify** the law.

- **Meaning of Magnify:** To magnify does not mean to alter or destroy; it means
  to show something in its fullest detail and greatness.
- **Sermon on the Mount:** Jesus magnified the law by showing it reaches the
  thoughts and intents of the heart (Matthew 5:21–28). He showed that the
  commandment against killing also forbids hatred; the commandment against
  adultery also forbids lust.
- **Making it Honorable:** The Pharisees had buried the law under useless
  traditions. Christ swept those away and revealed the Law as a beautiful law of
  love (Romans 13:10).

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you look at a leaf under a magnifying glass, you do
not destroy the leaf or change it into a rock. You simply reveal the intricate
veins and details that were always there but not clearly seen. Jesus put the
magnifying glass of His life and teaching over the Ten Commandments, revealing
their deep spiritual beauty.

---

### Q17. What did the Saviour say about the Sabbath?

” Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days." Matt. 12:12.

**Answer:** Jesus taught that the Sabbath is a day for mercy and restoration.

- **Lawful to do Good:** The Jewish leaders accused Jesus of breaking the
  Sabbath because He healed the sick. Jesus clarified that acts of mercy and
  necessity are in perfect harmony with the Sabbath.
- **Restoration:** The Sabbath is a memorial of creation. Healing restores the
  body (creation). Therefore, healing is a fitting Sabbath activity.
- **Not License for Sin:** This does not mean we can do our own business or
  pleasure (Isaiah 58:13), but rather that we should be active in the Lord's
  work of helping others, rather than adhering to cold, man-made restrictions.

---

### Q18. How did the apostle Paul use the Sabbath days?

” And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days
reasoned with them out of the Scriptures." Acts 17:2. See also Acts 13:14, 42,
44; 16:13; 18:1-4, 11.

**Answer:** The Apostle Paul, the great teacher of grace, habitually kept the
Sabbath and used it as his primary day for teaching the Gospel.

- **Gentile Observance:** In Acts 13:42, the **Gentiles** (not just Jews) begged
  Paul to preach to them the next Sabbath. In Acts 16:13, Paul met with
  believers by a riverside on the Sabbath where there was no synagogue.
- **Paul's "Manner":** Just as it was Christ's custom (Luke 4:16), it was Paul's
  manner. Paul did not teach that the Sabbath was nailed to the cross. He taught
  that the ceremonial laws (types and shadows, like animal sacrifices) were met
  in Christ, but the moral law remained.

---

### Q19. On what day was John in the Spirit?

“I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day." Rev. 1:10.

**Answer:** John received the Revelation on "the Lord's day." Based on the
previous scriptures, this can only be the **seventh-day Sabbath**.

- **Biblical Evidence:**
  1.  God calls the Sabbath "My holy day" (Isaiah 58:13).
  2.  Jesus said He is "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28).
  3.  Nowhere does Scripture call Sunday the "Lord's Day."
- **The Climactic Truth:** The Bible begins with the Sabbath in Genesis
  (Creation) and ends with the Sabbath in Revelation (the Lord's Day). It is the
  golden thread binding God's creative and redemptive work together.
- **The Final Test:** In the last days, the issue of worship will be central
  (Revelation 14:7). Worshipping the Creator involves honoring the sign of His
  creation.

**Conclusion:** The Sabbath is not merely a day of vacation. It is a sign of
**Righteousness by Faith**—that we are resting in Christ’s finished work of
creation and redemption. It is the outward sign of an inward covenant: "that ye
may know that I am the Lord that doth **sanctify** you" (Exodus 31:13). To keep
it is to acknowledge God as our Creator and our Sanctifier.
