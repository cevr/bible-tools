# Reading 111: Departing and Being with Christ

## Introduction

Philippians 1:23 is one of the most frequently cited passages in debates about
what happens at death. Does Paul teach that believers go immediately to be with
Christ upon dying? A careful examination of Paul's own words—interpreted by
Paul's other writings—reveals a beautiful harmony between his longing for
Christ's presence and the biblical doctrine of the resurrection.

## Core Truths

### Paul's Earnest Dilemma

The apostle Paul, writing from prison, expressed a deeply personal struggle:

> _"For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with
> Christ; which is far better."_ (Philippians 1:23)

The word "strait" (Greek: _synechomai_) means to be pressed or constrained from
both sides—like being caught between two walls closing in. Paul was not choosing
between heaven and earth, but between two ways his life could glorify Christ:

1. **To live** — continuing his ministry for the believers
2. **To die** — departing from this world of sin and suffering

> _"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."_ (Philippians 1:21)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "depart" (_analyō_) was used for loosening a ship
from its moorings or striking a tent to move on. Paul saw death not as the final
destination but as the breaking of camp for a journey toward something greater.

### What Was the "Gain" in Dying?

Many assume Paul meant immediate conscious bliss in heaven. But notice the
context: Paul explains his struggle by saying Christ would be _magnified_
whether by life or death (verse 20). The "gain" relates to Christ's cause, not
merely Paul's personal comfort.

> _"Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you."_ (Philippians
> 1:24)

Paul chose to remain—not because death would be bad for him personally, but
because his continued ministry was more beneficial for the church.

[Q] **"But doesn't 'to depart and be with Christ' prove immediate presence with
Jesus at death?"**

This is a fair question, and we must let Paul interpret Paul. Notice that
Philippians 1:23 does not specify _when_ or _how_ the departed believer would be
with Christ. Paul addresses this explicitly elsewhere.

## Deeper Truths

### Paul's Own Teaching on When Believers Meet Christ

In 1 Thessalonians 4, Paul gives the clearest timeline for when believers will
be "with the Lord":

> _"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
> of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise
> first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
> them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with
> the Lord."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16–17)

Notice the sequence:

1. Christ descends with a shout
2. The dead in Christ **rise first**
3. Living believers are caught up **together with them**
4. **Then**—and only then—"so shall we ever be with the Lord"

Paul does not say, "The righteous dead are already with Christ, and we will join
them." He says they _rise first_, and then all believers meet Christ
_together_.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "so shall we ever be with the Lord" uses the Greek _houtōs_
("in this manner" or "thus"). Paul is saying this resurrection event is _the
means_ by which believers come to be with Christ permanently—not death itself.

### The State of the Dead: No Lapse of Time

If the dead are unconscious until the resurrection, how could departing be
"better" for Paul?

> _"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing."_
> (Ecclesiastes 9:5)

> _"His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his
> thoughts perish."_ (Psalm 146:4)

[ILL] Imagine falling into a deep, dreamless sleep. Whether you sleep for eight
hours or eight hundred years, when you awake, it seems but a moment. So it is
with death. For Paul, closing his eyes in death would be followed—in his
conscious experience—by the immediate glory of the resurrection morning. Two
thousand years may pass on earth, but for the sleeping saint, it is as the
"twinkling of an eye" (1 Corinthians 15:52).

This is why departing could be "far better." Not because Paul would immediately
enter heaven, but because his next conscious moment would be the presence of
Christ at His coming—with no more suffering, no more prison chains, no more
persecution.

### Paul's Final Testimony Confirms This

Near the end of his life, Paul wrote to Timothy:

> _"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I
> have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
> Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
> the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto
> all them also that love his appearing."_ (2 Timothy 4:6–8)

Paul expected his crown **"at that day"**—the day of Christ's appearing—not at
the moment of death. And he expected to receive it alongside "all them also that
love his appearing," not before them.

[Q] **"If death is unconscious sleep, doesn't that make it something to fear?"**

On the contrary! The biblical teaching removes fear. Death for the believer is
rest from labor (Revelation 14:13), a peaceful sleep (John 11:11–14) from which
Christ Himself will awaken them. There is no intermediate state of waiting or
uncertainty—only rest, then resurrection glory.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Satan's Ancient Lie

The doctrine of immediate consciousness after death traces back to Eden:

> _"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die."_ (Genesis
> 3:4)

God said, "Thou shalt surely die" (Genesis 2:17). Satan contradicted, "Ye shall
not surely die." This lie—that the soul is inherently immortal and continues
conscious after death—opened the door to spiritualism, purgatory, prayers to
saints, and communication with "the dead."

The biblical truth that the dead sleep until the resurrection protects believers
from these deceptions.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest entered the Most Holy Place on the Day
of Atonement—not to bring the dead into God's presence, but to cleanse the
record of sins for the living and sleeping saints alike. Christ's ministry in
the heavenly sanctuary prepares a people to meet Him at His coming:

> _"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look
> for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation."_ (Hebrews
> 9:28)

The reward is given at Christ's appearing, not at death. This preserves the
integrity of judgment—no one receives their final destiny before the verdict is
rendered (Revelation 22:12; 2 Corinthians 5:10).

## Practical Application

This truth calls us to:

1. **Hope in the resurrection**, not in death itself. Our comfort is not that
   loved ones are "looking down" but that they rest securely until Jesus calls
   them forth (John 5:28–29).

2. **Live urgently for Christ**. Like Paul, we should desire both to serve
   faithfully now and to see Christ at His coming. Neither death nor life should
   be wasted.

3. **Guard against spiritualistic deception**. If the dead are unconscious, any
   "spirit" claiming to be a departed loved one is a demonic deception. "Beloved,
   believe not every spirit, but try the spirits" (1 John 4:1).

4. **Comfort the grieving with truth**. We "sorrow not, even as others which
   have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13). Our loved ones in Christ are safe in
   His keeping, awaiting the glad reunion.

## Appeal

> _"Wherefore comfort one another with these words."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:18)

Dear friend, are you longing for Christ's presence? That longing is good and
holy. But take comfort: whether you live until His coming or sleep in death, your
next conscious moment of meeting Jesus will come at the same glorious
instant—when the trumpet sounds and the dead in Christ rise first.

Do not be troubled by the sleep of death. Rest in the certainty of resurrection.
And until that day, may your life—like Paul's—magnify Christ, whether by life or
by death. He who conquered the grave holds the keys (Revelation 1:18), and He
has promised:

> _"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were
> dead, yet shall he live."_ (John 11:25)

Trust Him. Live for Him. And look for that blessed hope.
