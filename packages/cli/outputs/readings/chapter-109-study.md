### Q1. When man had been created from the dust, what did he become?

**“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” Gen. 2:7.**

**Answer:**

This verse provides the fundamental biblical equation for the nature of man. It
reveals that humanity is a compound being, created through a specific process.

- **The Divine Equation:** The Bible does not say that man _was given_ a soul,
  as if the soul were a separate entity capable of existing outside the body.
  Rather, it says man **became** a living soul. The equation is:
  - **Dust of the Ground** (The body, lifeless matter)
  - **+ Breath of Life** (The life-giving spirit/spark from God)
  - **= A Living Soul** (A living person).

- **Defining Terms:**
  - **Soul (Hebrew: _Nephesh_):** In the Old Testament, this word primarily
    means a "living being," a "creature," or a "person." It refers to the whole
    individual—mental, physical, and emotional combined.
  - **Breath of Life (Hebrew: _Neshamah_):** This is the life principle or spark
    of life that originates from God. It is not a conscious ghost; it is the
    power of God that animates the clay.

- **Sanctuary & RBF Connection:** Just as Adam was formed of dust and was
  lifeless until God breathed into him, so are we spiritually dead in trespasses
  and sins (Ephesians 2:1) until Christ breathes the Holy Spirit into us.
  - **Justification** puts us in a right standing, like the formed body ready
    for life.
  - **Sanctification** is the daily in-breathing of the life of Christ, enabling
    the "soul" to live in obedience to God’s law. We are dependent creatures; we
    have no life in ourselves. "In him we live, and move, and have our being"
    (Acts 17:28).

**[ILL]** Consider a light bulb. You have the glass bulb and filament (the
body/dust). You have the electricity (the breath/energy). When you put them
together, you get _light_. The light is not a separate object tucked inside the
glass; it is the result of the union of the bulb and electricity. If you cut the
power, the light does not "go" somewhere; it simply ceases to exist until the
power is restored. So it is with the soul: Dust + Breath = Living Soul.

### Q2. To what other order of beings is the term soul applied?

**“And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle:
one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the
asses, and of the sheep.” Num. 31:28.**

**Answer:**

Scripture uses the term "soul" broadly, far beyond the common assumption that it
applies only to humans.

- **Universal Terminology:** In this passage, the word "soul" is applied to
  "beeves" (cattle), "asses" (donkeys), and "sheep." This confirms that a "soul"
  is simply a living, breathing creature.
  - In Genesis 1:20 and 1:24, the creation account uses the same Hebrew word
    (_nephesh_) for fish, birds, and land animals, translated often as "living
    creature."

- **No Natural Immortality:** If the word "soul" implied an immortal,
  indestructible essence, then cows and sheep would also be immortal. The Bible
  teaches that both man and beast are "living souls"—animate beings dependent on
  breath—and both are subject to death (Ecclesiastes 3:19–20).

- **The Value of a Soul:** While animals are living souls, man was created in
  the _image of God_ (Genesis 1:27). This gives the human soul infinite value, a
  value fully realized at the Cross, where the Son of God gave His life to
  redeem human souls from the curse of the law (Galatians 3:13).

---

### Q3. Is the term "living souls" applied to anything besides man and beast?

**“And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the
blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.” Rev. 16:3.**

**Answer:**

Here, even the creatures of the sea are described as "living souls."

- **Consistency of Scripture:** From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible is
  consistent. A soul is a living, breathing entity. When the breath of life is
  present in a physical body (whether man, beast, or fish), it is a living soul.
  When life ceases, the soul dies.

- **The Mortality of the Soul:** Notice the text explicitly says, "every living
  soul **died**." This flatly contradicts the popular theology that the soul is
  naturally immortal and cannot die.
  - **Immortality:** This is a quality belonging only to God by nature: "Who
    only hath immortality" (1 Timothy 6:16).
  - **Gift of God:** For humans, immortality is a gift sought for and received
    at the resurrection, not a possession we have now (Romans 2:7; 1 Corinthians
    15:53–54).

### Q4. Can a soul suffer thirst?

**“As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.” Prov.
25:25.**

**Answer:**

Yes, a soul can thirst. This verse demonstrates that the "soul" possesses
physical longings and bodily needs.

- **Physical Reality:** An immaterial, disembodied spirit would not require
  water. A "soul"—a living person—does. This reinforces that the soul
  encompasses the physical body.

- **Spiritual Application (RBF):** Just as the physical soul thirsts for water,
  the awakened conscience thirsts for righteousness.
  - We cannot generate righteousness ourselves. We are dry and parched ground.
  - **Christ our Righteousness:** Jesus cries out, "If any man thirst, let him
    come unto me, and drink" (John 7:37).
  - **The Gospel:** The "good news from a far country" (heaven) is that
    provision has been made for our salvation. The thirst of the guilty
    conscience is quenched only by the water of life—the forgiveness and
    cleansing power of Jesus (Revelation 22:17).

### Q5. May it also suffer hunger?

**“Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer
hunger.” Prov. 19:15.**

**Answer:**

Yes, a soul suffers hunger.

- **The Whole Person:** Once again, the attributes of the body are attributed to
  the soul because the soul _is_ the person. If you do not work, you—the
  soul—will go hungry (2 Thessalonians 3:10).

- **Practical Application:** This text warns against spiritual slothfulness.
  - **Sanctification:** Holiness is not achieved in "deep sleep" or idleness.
    While we are saved by grace through faith, that faith works (Galatians 5:6).
    We must "labor" to enter into rest (Hebrews 4:11)—meaning we must actively
    cooperate with God, surrendering our will and exercising faith to overcome
    sin.
  - An "idle soul" in the church—one who does not feed on the Word or exercise
    in prayer—will suffer spiritual famine (Amos 8:11).

### Q6. Is it capable of eating?

**“But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul
shall be cut off from his people.” Lev. 7:20.**

**Answer:**

Yes, the soul eats. This verse places the "soul" directly in the context of the
Levitical sanctuary services.

- **Sanctuary Context:** The "soul" here is the worshiper. If the worshiper
  partakes of the holy peace offering while in a state of uncleanness
  (defilement), that person is cut off.
- **Holiness Required:** This teaches a profound lesson about the plan of
  salvation. God requires a cleansing before we can partake of His table.
  - **Cleansing:** We cannot cleanse ourselves. We must wash in the "fountain
    opened... for sin and for uncleanness" (Zechariah 13:1).
  - **Communion:** To eat of the holy things with "uncleanness upon him"
    represents presumptuous sin—claiming the blessings of the covenant while
    holding onto cherished sin. True Righteousness by Faith involves a cleansing
    of the heart (Acts 15:9), not just a legal fiction.

**[ILL]** Imagine a guest coming to a royal banquet covered in mud. He sits and
eats without washing. He insults the host and the purity of the meal. So it is
with the soul that seeks to partake of Christ's blessings without submitting to
Christ's cleansing power.

### Q7. Can it be injured?

**“And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword.”
Joshua 11:11.**

**Answer:**

Yes. A soul can be physically smitten and killed by a sword.

- **Tangible Nature:** You cannot cut a ghost with a sword. You cannot injure an
  immaterial spirit with a physical weapon. The fact that souls were "smitten"
  proves conclusively that in biblical language, a soul is a flesh-and-blood
  person.
- **Great Controversy:** In this world of sin, souls are subject to violence,
  injury, and death. This is the result of the rebellion that began in heaven.
  We look forward to a new earth where "violence shall no more be heard in thy
  land" (Isaiah 60:18).

### Q8. Can the soul die?

**“Behold, all souls are Mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of
the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Eze. 18:4.**

**Answer:**

This is the definitive text on the mortality of the soul.

- **The Wages of Sin:** The penalty for sin is not eternal life in torture, but
  death (Romans 6:23). "The soul that sinneth, it **shall die**."
- **Shattering the Myth:** This verse cannot be reconciled with the doctrine of
  the "immortal soul." If the soul were naturally immortal, God could not say it
  "shall die." The devil preached the first sermon on the immortality of the
  soul in Eden: "Ye shall not surely die" (Genesis 3:4). God says the opposite.

- **The Need for Atonement:** Because the soul that sins must die, and "all have
  sinned" (Romans 3:23), every human being is under the death sentence. This
  creates the desperate need for the Gospel.
  - **Substitution:** We need a Substitute who can die in our place.
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** We claim Christ's death as our death. We are
    "crucified with Christ" (Galatians 2:20). Because He died the death the soul
    deserved, we may receive the life He deserves.

### Q9. What is said of the soul of Christ?

**“Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall divide the
spoil with the strong; because He hath poured out His soul unto death.” Isa.
53:12.**

**Answer:**

This is one of the most precious verses in the Old Testament regarding the
Atonement.

- **The Nature of Christ's Sacrifice:** Jesus did not merely lend His body to be
  abused while His "real" immortal soul floated away to paradise. The text says
  He **poured out His soul unto death**.
  - He gave His all. He experienced the full wages of sin—the death of the
    soul—so that we might live.
  - "He made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin" (2 Corinthians 5:21).

- **The Sanctuary Truth:** In the earthly sanctuary, the lamb had to be slain.
  Its life (its soul, which is in the blood—Leviticus 17:11) had to be poured
  out at the foot of the altar. Christ, the Antitype, fulfilled this completely.
- **Assurance:** Because He poured out His soul unto death, He has conquered the
  grave. He can now "divide the spoil"—He has snatched the keys of death from
  the enemy (Hebrews 2:14).

### Q10. What becomes of the soul at death?

**“What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his
soul from the hand of the grave?” Ps. 89:48.**

**Answer:**

At death, the soul goes to the grave.

- **The Grave (Hebrew: _Sheol_):** The Psalmist asks a rhetorical question. No
  man can deliver his soul from the "hand of the grave." This confirms that the
  destination of the soul at death is not heaven, nor a place of burning
  torment, but the grave—the realm of silence and unconsciousness.
- **State of the Dead:** "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in
  that very day his thoughts perish" (Psalm 146:4). The reverse of creation
  takes place:
  - Creation: Dust + Breath = Living Soul.
  - Death: Dust returns to earth - Breath returns to God = Soul ceases (Dead
    Soul).

**[ILL]** When you snap a photo, the image is on the screen. If you smash the
phone, the image is gone. The "image" doesn't float into the cloud by itself; it
depends on the hardware to exist. The resurrection is God "restoring the file"
in a new, glorified body.

---

### Q11. Where did Christ's soul go at His death?

**“He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was
not left in hell [hades], neither His flesh did see corruption.” Acts 2:31.**

**Answer:**

When Jesus died, His soul went to "hell" (Greek: _Hades_), which simply means
the grave or the place of the dead.

- **Not a Place of Torment:** Christ did not go to a place of fire; He went to
  the tomb. He rested in the grave over the Sabbath, and rose on the third day.
- **The Resurrection Hope:** The Good News is that His soul was not _left_
  there!
  - "But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them
    that slept" (1 Corinthians 15:20).
  - Because He conquered the grave, we have the assurance that though our souls
    may sleep in the dust, they will not be left there if we are in Christ.

- **Note on the Text:** The verse clarifies that while His soul went to the
  grave, it was not abandoned there to decay ("see corruption"). He was raised
  to life. This is the pattern for the believer: we sleep in Jesus, awaiting the
  call of the Life-giver at the Second Coming (1 Thessalonians 4:16).

- **Practical Conclusion:** We are mortal souls, made of dust, dependent on God
  for every breath. Sin condemns this soul to death. But Christ, the spotless
  Soul, poured out His life to pay our debt. By faith in Him, we pass from death
  to life, awaiting the resurrection when "this mortal must put on immortality"
  (1 Corinthians 15:53).
