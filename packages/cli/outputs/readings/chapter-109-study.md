# Reading 109: Living Souls

## Introduction

What is the soul? Few questions have generated more confusion in religious thinking than this one. Popular religion teaches that humans possess an immortal soul—a conscious, immaterial essence that departs the body at death to live on eternally. But what does the Bible actually teach? By carefully examining Scripture's own definition and usage of the term "soul," we discover a truth both simpler and more profound than common assumptions suggest.

## Core Truths

### The Biblical Definition of Soul

The foundation for understanding the soul lies in the creation account itself:

> "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." (Genesis 2:7)

Notice carefully what this verse teaches. God did not place a soul _into_ man; rather, man _became_ a living soul. The soul is not something we _have_—it is what we _are_. The combination of the body (dust) plus the breath of life equals a living soul.

**Body (dust) + Breath of Life = Living Soul**

This is not merely a theological formula—it is the Creator's own definition of human existence.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word translated "soul" is _nephesh_, which appears over 750 times in the Old Testament. It is translated variously as "soul," "life," "person," "creature," and even "appetite"—never once with the meaning of an immortal, immaterial entity separate from the body.

### The Soul Applied to All Living Creatures

Scripture applies the term "soul" (_nephesh_) far more broadly than popular religion assumes:

**To animals:**

> "And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep." (Numbers 31:28)

Here cattle, donkeys, and sheep are called "souls" just as humans are.

**To sea creatures:**

> "And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea." (Revelation 16:3)

Fish and marine life are called "living souls." If the soul were an immortal, immaterial essence unique to humans, why would Scripture apply this term to animals and sea creatures?

[DYK🔎] In Genesis 1:20-21, 24, the same Hebrew word _nephesh_ is used for sea creatures, birds, and land animals before it is ever applied to man. The Bible makes no distinction between human souls and animal souls in terms of their basic nature—both are living creatures dependent upon the breath of life.

### The Soul's Physical Characteristics

If the soul were an immaterial entity separate from the body, it could not experience physical sensations. Yet Scripture repeatedly describes the soul in physical terms:

**The soul thirsts:**

> "As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country." (Proverbs 25:25)

**The soul hungers:**

> "Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger." (Proverbs 19:15)

**The soul eats:**

> "But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people." (Leviticus 7:20)

**The soul can be physically harmed:**

> "And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword." (Joshua 11:11)

[Q] **"Aren't these just figurative expressions? Doesn't the Bible often use physical language to describe spiritual realities?"**

Scripture does use figurative language, but these passages describe literal, physical experiences. When Leviticus 7:20 speaks of a soul eating sacrificial meat, it is not using metaphor—it is describing a person eating food. When Joshua 11:11 records souls being smitten with the sword, actual people were being killed. The consistent biblical pattern presents the soul as the whole person—body and breath united—not as a separate spiritual component.

## Deeper Truths

### The Soul Can Die

Here we arrive at the most decisive evidence against the popular doctrine of the immortal soul:

> "Behold, all souls are Mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die." (Ezekiel 18:4)

This is not figurative death—"separation from God" as some suggest. The entire context of Ezekiel 18 contrasts physical life and physical death as consequences of righteousness and wickedness.

[ILL] Consider a candle flame. The flame exists when wick, wax, and oxygen combine. Blow out the candle, and where does the flame go? It doesn't travel somewhere else—it simply ceases to exist. The flame was not something the candle _had_ that departed; it was the result of certain conditions being met. So it is with the soul: when the breath of life departs from the body, the living soul ceases to exist—not because something leaves, but because the combination that constituted life has been dissolved.

### Christ's Soul and Death

Perhaps the most compelling testimony comes from the experience of our Lord Himself:

> "Therefore will I divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong; because He hath poured out His soul unto death." (Isaiah 53:12)

Christ's soul was "poured out unto death." Not _through_ death to somewhere else—_unto_ death. Death was the destination, not a doorway.

**Where did Christ's soul go?**

> "What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?" (Psalm 89:48)

The soul goes to the grave (_sheol_). This is confirmed by the apostle Peter:

> "He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in hell [hades], neither His flesh did see corruption." (Acts 2:31)

The Greek word _hades_ corresponds to the Hebrew _sheol_—both meaning "the grave" or "the realm of the dead." Christ's soul went to the grave, but was not _left_ there because He rose on the third day.

[DYK🔎] The English word "hell" in the King James Version translates three different words: _sheol_ (Hebrew), _hades_ (Greek), and _gehenna_ (Greek). Only _gehenna_ refers to the lake of fire and final destruction. _Sheol_ and _hades_ simply mean the grave—the silent realm of the dead where all go, righteous and wicked alike, to await the resurrection.

### The Reversal at Death

At creation, God combined dust and breath to form a living soul. At death, this process reverses:

> "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." (Ecclesiastes 12:7)

The breath (_ruach_)—the life principle from God—returns to Him who gave it. The body returns to dust. And the soul? It ceases to exist until the resurrection, when God will once again combine body and breath to restore living souls.

[Q] **"If the spirit returns to God, doesn't that prove some conscious part of us goes to heaven?"**

The Hebrew word _ruach_, translated "spirit," also means "breath" or "wind." It is the life-giving principle from God, not a conscious entity. Ecclesiastes 3:19-21 makes this clear by stating that the same _ruach_ (breath/spirit) is in both man and beast—and both return to dust at death. The breath of life returns to God in the sense that He alone is the source and sustainer of life; it does not imply conscious existence in His presence.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Satan's Original Lie

The doctrine of the immortal soul traces its origin not to Scripture but to the serpent in Eden:

> "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die." (Genesis 3:4)

God had clearly stated, "Thou shalt surely die" (Genesis 2:17). Satan directly contradicted God, teaching that death was not real—that some conscious part of humans would live on regardless of disobedience.

This lie has borne terrible fruit throughout history:

- **Spiritualism** rests upon the belief that the dead can communicate with the living
- **Purgatory and prayers for the dead** assume conscious existence after death
- **The eternal torment doctrine** requires immortal souls suffering endlessly

All these errors spring from accepting Satan's lie over God's truth.

### The Sanctuary and the State of the Dead

The sanctuary message illuminates this truth beautifully. In the Most Holy Place, judgment is rendered from the books—the records of human lives (Daniel 7:9-10; Revelation 20:12). Why would God need books if the dead were already in heaven or hell, their fate decided? The judgment investigates the lives of the dead _because they are sleeping in their graves, awaiting the verdict_.

The resurrection is the great hope of Scripture (1 Corinthians 15; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18). But if the righteous dead are already enjoying heaven's bliss, what need is there for resurrection? Paul's extended argument for the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15) becomes meaningless if believers are already conscious in glory.

### The Character of God

The biblical teaching about the soul reveals a God of justice and mercy. Consider the alternative: if souls are naturally immortal, God is compelled to keep sinners alive somewhere for eternity. The only options become eternal bliss or eternal torment—and billions upon billions would suffer conscious agony forever with no end, no relief, no hope.

But the Bible teaches that God will ultimately destroy sin and sinners completely:

> "For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch." (Malachi 4:1)

The wicked will be "as though they had not been" (Obadiah 16). This is not cruelty but mercy—the cessation of existence rather than endless suffering.

## Practical Application

Understanding the true nature of the soul has profound practical implications:

1. **Protection from deception**: Knowing that the dead sleep unconscious in the grave protects us from spiritualism's deceptions. When "spirits of the dead" appear or speak, we know they are demonic impersonations, not our loved ones (Revelation 16:14; 2 Corinthians 11:14).

2. **Proper grief and hope**: We grieve, but "not as others which have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13). Our loved ones who died in Christ are not watching us from heaven, anxious about our struggles. They rest peacefully, unconscious, awaiting the resurrection morning when we shall be reunited.

3. **Motivation for the gospel**: The dead are not being tortured in hell right now, crying out for relief. But they are truly dead—without Christ, without hope, without future. This should motivate us to share the gospel while there is time.

4. **Trust in God's character**: We worship a God who is truly loving, truly just. He does not torture His creatures endlessly. Sin and sinners will be completely destroyed, and the universe will be clean forever.

## Appeal

> "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." (John 5:28-29)

The hope of Scripture is not the immortality of the soul but the resurrection of the dead. Jesus did not promise His followers they would float off to heaven as disembodied spirits. He promised He would come again and raise them from the dead (John 14:1-3; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).

Friend, will you accept God's truth over popular tradition? Will you trust the plain words of Scripture over the serpent's ancient lie? The Bible's teaching about the soul is not meant to discourage but to direct our hope where it truly belongs—to Jesus Christ, the resurrection and the life.

Those who sleep in Jesus will wake at His voice. May we be ready to meet Him, whether living or sleeping, and may we together enter that eternal life which God alone possesses and freely gives to all who believe.
