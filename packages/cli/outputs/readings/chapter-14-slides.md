## Slide 1 – Q1: Purpose of Christ’s Coming

- **Question:** For what purpose did Christ come into the world?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 1:15 – “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all
  acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I
  am chief.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **A Rescue Mission:** Jesus came to address the desperate emergency of sin
  that separated humanity from God (Isaiah 59:2 – “But your iniquities have
  separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you,
  that he will not hear.”).
- **To Save, Not Condemn:** The world was already condemned; Christ came to
  offer a way of escape (John 3:17 – “For God sent not his Son into the world to
  condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”).
- **For Sinners:** The gospel is specifically for those who recognize their
  need, just as a physician is for the sick (Matthew 9:12 – “But when Jesus
  heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but
  they that are sick.”).
- **The Great Controversy:** Christ entered the enemy’s territory to reclaim the
  human race (Luke 19:10 – “For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that
  which was lost.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Lifeboat:**
  - Imagine a ship sinking in a stormy ocean.
  - A captain does not launch a lifeboat merely to teach drowning passengers how
    to swim better.
  - He launches it to pull them out of the water.
  - **Lesson:** We are drowning in sin; Christ is the Lifeboat who comes to pull
    us to safety.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Only Source of Salvation

- **Question:** Can we obtain salvation through any other source?
- **Key Text:** Acts 4:12 – “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there
  is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Infinite Problem, Infinite Sacrifice:** Only an infinite sacrifice could
  remedy the violation of God’s eternal law.
- **Christ as the Ladder:** Jesus is the only link connecting earth to heaven
  (Genesis 28:12 – “And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
  the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and
  descending on it.”; John 1:51 – “And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say
  unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending
  and descending upon the Son of man.”).
- **No Human Merit:** Salvation is found entirely in the Person of Jesus, not in
  works, philosophy, or penance.
- **Definition of Atonement:** It literally means "at-one-ment"—reconciliation
  through Christ’s life, death, and ministry (Romans 5:11 – “And not only so,
  but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now
  received the atonement.”).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Key:**
  - If you lose your house key, you might try a stick or a wire, but they won't
    work.
  - Only the key cut by the locksmith to fit the specific tumblers will open the
    door.
  - **Lesson:** Christ is the only One who fits the requirements of the broken
    Law and the love of the Father; He alone unlocks heaven for us.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Saved From What?

- **Question:** From what does Christ save His people?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 1:21 – “Thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall
  save His people from their sins.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Saved From Sin, Not In Sin:** God delivers us from the practice and rule of
  iniquity, not just the penalty.
- **Justification (Guilt):** He saves us from the guilt of past sins (Romans
  3:24-25 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is
  in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in
  his blood...”).
- **Sanctification (Power):** He saves us from the power of sin in daily life (1
  Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification,
  that ye should abstain from fornication.”).
- **Grace to Overcome:** His grace is power to break the dominion of sin (Romans
  6:14 – “For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the
  law, but under grace.”).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Doctor:**
  - A patient with a deadly infection does not want a doctor who only gives
    painkillers to mask the symptoms of death.
  - He wants a doctor who kills the infection and restores health.
  - **Lesson:** Jesus is the Great Physician who cures the disease of sin, not
    just the symptoms.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Faith and Forgiveness

- **Question:** In the case of the woman who washed the Saviour's feet in the
  house of Simon the Pharisee, what was said to her because of her act?
- **Key Text:** Luke 7:50 – “And He said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved
  thee; go in peace.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **Faith as the Instrument:** The washing of feet did not save her; her faith
  grasped the gift (Ephesians 2:8 – “For by grace are ye saved through faith;
  and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.”).
- **Justification by Faith:** She was declared righteous; her record was wiped
  clean because she trusted Christ.
- **Resulting Peace:** Justification brings peace with God (Romans 5:1 –
  “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord
  Jesus Christ.”).
- **Living Connection:** To remain saved, one must continue walking in faith
  (Galatians 5:1 – “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath
  made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”).

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Pardon:**
  - A prisoner on death row is "saved" the moment he receives a pardon.
  - However, if he leaves prison and commits another crime, he falls under
    condemnation again.
  - **Lesson:** We must walk in the liberty Christ gives us.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Enduring to the End

- **Question:** Who only will finally be saved?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:13 – “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same
  shall be saved.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **Perseverance:** The Christian life is a marathon. We must hold fast our
  confidence (Hebrews 3:14 – “For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold
  the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.”).
- **Danger of Drawing Back:** God has no pleasure in those who retreat (Hebrews
  10:38 – “Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul
  shall have no pleasure in him.”).
- **Daily Dependence:** We are saved today if we are in Christ today.

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Harvest:**
  - A farmer plants a seed; it sprouts and grows.
  - But the crop is only "saved" when it is harvested.
  - If it withers before harvest, the early growth is in vain.
  - **Lesson:** We must ripen into the full character of Christ (Mark 4:28-29 –
    “For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the
    ear, after that the full corn in the ear. But when the fruit is brought
    forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle...”).

## Slide 16 – Q6: Turning From Righteousness

- **Question:** If one has had the assurance of sins forgiven, but has afterward
  turned from his righteousness, what will be the result?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 18:24 – “But when the righteous turneth away from his
  righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the
  abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness
  that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath
  trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **Conditional Covenant:** God deals with us based on our present relationship
  with Him.
- **Reality of Apostasy:** A justified believer can turn away and return to a
  life of sin.
- **Sanctuary Truth:** In the earthly sanctuary (Leviticus 16), sins were not
  finally "blotted out" until the Day of Atonement. If a man confessed but later
  forsook God, his past forgiveness did not secure him.
- **Necessity of Holiness:** God demands a heart that remains loyal.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Citizenship:**
  - An immigrant granted citizenship has new rights.
  - But if that citizen commits treason against the government, citizenship can
    be revoked.
  - **Lesson:** We must not commit treason against Heaven by returning to the
    service of Satan.

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Unmerciful Servant (Part 1)

- **Question:** In the parable, when one who owed his lord ten thousand talents
  was unable to pay, at his own request what did his master do for him?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:27 – “Then the lord of that servant was moved with
  compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Impossible Debt:** Ten thousand talents represents our infinite sin debt
  which we cannot pay.
- **God’s Character:** He delights in mercy (Micah 7:18 – “Who is a God like
  unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the
  remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he
  delighteth in mercy.”).
- **Full Forgiveness:** Justification is the complete cancellation of our record
  of sin through Christ.

## Slide 21 – Q8: The Unmerciful Servant (Part 2)

- **Question:** After receiving forgiveness for his enormous debt, what did the
  servant do to another who owed him but a hundred pence, and asked for mercy?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:29, 30 – “And his fellow-servant fell down at his
  feet, and be-sought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee
  all. And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay
  the debt.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points

- **Test of Character:** The servant received mercy (justification) but was not
  changed by it (sanctification).
- **Inconsistency:** He accepted the benefit of salvation but rejected the
  spirit of the Saviour.
- **Imparted Righteousness Missing:** God gives grace to change our hearts; this
  servant lacked that imparted grace.

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Unmerciful Servant (Part 3)

- **Question:** What was then done with this unmerciful servant?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:32-34 – “Then his lord, after that he had called him,
  said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
  thou desiredst me. Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
  fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and
  delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto
  him.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points

- **Revocation of Pardon:** The forgiveness previously granted was revoked.
- **Principle:** Faith without works is dead (James 2:26 – “For as the body
  without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”).
- **Investigative Judgment:** This parable illustrates the judgment review. If
  the fruit of the Spirit is missing, the profession of faith was vain.

## Slide 25 – Q10: Application of the Parable

- **Question:** What application of the parable did the Saviour make?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:35 – “So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also
  unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
  trespasses.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points

- **Heart Work:** Outward profession is not enough; faith must work by love
  (Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing,
  nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”).
- **Conditional Salvation:** Eternal security is conditional on maintaining the
  character of Christ.
- **The Lord's Prayer:** Matthew 6:12 – “And forgive us our debts, as we forgive
  our debtors.”

## Slide 27 – Q10: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Pipe:**
  - A pipe lets water flow through it.
  - If the pipe is blocked at the outlet, no fresh water can enter the inlet.
  - **Lesson:** If we block the flow of mercy to others, we block the flow of
    God's mercy to ourselves.

## Slide 28 – Q11: The End of Faith

- **Question:** What is the end, object, or design of faith?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:9 – “Receiving the end of your faith, even the
  salvation of your souls.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Goal:** Faith is the means; the complete restoration of the soul is the
  end.
- **Soul Salvation:** This encompasses the whole person—mind, character, and
  eventually the body.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Salvation: Now and Future

- **Question:** Does one receive this salvation when he first believes?
- **Key Text:** Romans 13:11 – “And that, knowing the time, now it is high time
  to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.”

## Slide 31 – Q12: Key Points

- **Already/Not Yet:** We are saved when we believe (Justification), but
  salvation is also a future event we approach (Glorification).
- **Nearer:** Every day brings us closer to final deliverance.
- **The Blessed Hope:** We look for deliverance from "the body of this death"
  (Romans 7:24 – “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body
  of this death?”).

## Slide 32 – Q13: Kept by Power

- **Question:** How is one kept, or preserved, until that salvation is given?
  and when is it to be revealed?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:5 – “Who are kept by the power of God through faith
  unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points

- **Kept by God:** We are guarded by God's power (Sanctification).
- **Through Faith:** God provides power; we provide consent (faith).
- **The Last Time:** The final consummation happens at the Second Coming.

## Slide 34 – Q13: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Anchor:**
  - A ship in a storm is safe not because the captain holds the chain, but
    because the anchor holds the ground.
  - **Lesson:** Our faith is the chain; Christ is the Anchor (Hebrews 6:19 –
    “Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast...”).
    As long as we are connected, we are kept.

## Slide 35 – Q14: Who Receives Salvation?

- **Question:** Who will receive that salvation?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 9:28 – “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of
  many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without
  sin unto salvation.”

## Slide 36 – Q14: Key Points

- **Those Who Look for Him:** Believers live in expectancy (2 Timothy 4:8 –
  “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness... and not to me
  only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”).
- **Without Sin:**
  - _First Coming:_ He came bearing our sin.
  - _Second Coming:_ The sin problem has been dealt with in the Sanctuary; He
    comes as King.

## Slide 37 – Q15: Natural Condition of Man

- **Question:** In what condition are all men naturally?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Galatians 3:22 – “But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin.”
  - Romans 3:23 – “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”

## Slide 38 – Q15: Key Points

- **Universal Need:** All are infected with sin; we are born captives (Psalm
  51:5 – “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive
  me.”).
- **Short of Glory:** We have fallen short of God’s character (Exodus 33:18-19 –
  “And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory... And he said, I will make
  all my goodness pass before thee...”).

## Slide 39 – Q16: The Wages of Sin

- **Question:** What is the wages of sin?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:23 – “The wages of sin is death.”

## Slide 40 – Q16: Key Points

- **Wages:** Something earned. We have earned death.
- **Death:** This is the "second death"—eternal separation from the Source of
  life (Revelation 20:14 – “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.
  This is the second death.”).

## Slide 41 – Q17: The Gift of God

- **Question:** What is the gift of God?
- **Key Text:** Romans 6:23 – “...but the gift of God is eternal life through
  Jesus Christ our Lord.”

## Slide 42 – Q17: Key Points

- **A Free Gift:** Eternal life cannot be earned by works.
- **Contrast:** Wages are paid for work; gifts are received by grace.

## Slide 43 – Q18: Where is the Gift?

- **Question:** In whom is now this gift?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 5:11 – “This is the record, that God hath given to us
  eternal life, and this life is in His Son.”

## Slide 44 – Q18: Key Points

- **Life is in a Person:** We have life only by having Jesus.
- **Vine and Branches:** Connection is essential (John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye
  are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth
  much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.”).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Christ _is_ our righteousness and life.

## Slide 45 – Q19: Who May Have This Life?

- **Question:** How many may have this life?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Revelation 22:17 – “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come... And whosoever
    will, let him take the water of life freely.”
  - 1 John 5:12 – “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
    of God hath not life.”

## Slide 46 – Q19: Key Points

- **Whosoever Will:** The invitation is universal.
- **The Condition:** One must be "athirst" (recognize need).
- **Possessing the Son:** The deciding factor is a vital connection with the Son
  of God.

## Slide 47 – Q20: How Must One Have Christ?

- **Question:** How must one have Christ?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 13:5 – “Know ye not your own selves, how that
  Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?”

## Slide 48 – Q20: Key Points

- **Christ In You:** The mystery of the gospel is the indwelling Christ
  (Colossians 1:27 – “To whom God would make known what is the riches of the
  glory of this mystery... which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”).
- **Reprobates:** Without this indwelling, we are counterfeit Christians.

## Slide 49 – Q20: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Glove:**
  - A glove can do nothing by itself.
  - If a hand fills the glove, it can work and lift.
  - **Lesson:** We are the glove; Christ is the hand. He must be _in_ us to
    perform His will.

## Slide 50 – Q21: Believing and Life

- **Question:** How do we really have Christ in us unto eternal life?
- **Key Text:** John 6:47 – “He that believeth on Me hath everlasting life.”

## Slide 51 – Q21: Key Points

- **Believing:** More than intellectual assent; demons believe but are not saved
  (James 2:19 – “Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
  devils also believe, and tremble.”).
- **Eating His Flesh:** Believing means internalizing His word and life (John
  6:63 – “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the
  words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”).

## Slide 52 – Q22: The Exchanged Life

- **Question:** What follows the reception of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 2:20 – “I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me;
  and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
  God.”

## Slide 53 – Q22: Key Points

- **Crucified Self:** The old ego is dead; Christ takes over the heart.
- **Faith OF the Son:** We rely on His faithfulness.
- **Victory:** Because Christ lives in us, He lives His victorious life through
  us.

## Slide 54 – Q22: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Driver:**
  - It is like sliding over from the driver's seat and letting Jesus take the
    wheel.
  - He doesn't just give directions; He drives the car.

## Slide 55 – Q23: Regarded Before Quickened

- **Question:** How are all regarded before they are quickened with Christ?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:4-5 – “God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love
  wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us
  together with Christ.”

## Slide 56 – Q23: Key Points

- **Dead in Sins:** A spiritual corpse cannot help itself.
- **Quickened:** We are "made alive"—a spiritual resurrection.
- **Rich in Mercy:** God loved us while we were dead in sin.

## Slide 57 – Q24: The New Birth

- **Question:** What is this spiritual transition from death to life called?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:23 – “Being born again, not of corruptible seed; but
  of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.”

## Slide 58 – Q24: Key Points

- **The New Birth:** We must be born of the Spirit (John 3:3 – “Except a man be
  born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”).
- **Regeneration:** The imparting of a new nature (Titus 3:5 – “Not by works of
  righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by
  the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.”).
- **The Seed:** The Word of God germinates in the heart to produce new life.

## Slide 59 – Q25: Barred from the Tree of Life

- **Question:** When our first parents transgressed, what was done to prevent
  them from living forever in sin?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Genesis 3:22 – “And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the
    tree of life, and eat, and live forever.”
  - Genesis 3:24 – “So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the
    garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep
    the way of the tree of life.”

## Slide 60 – Q25: Key Points

- **Mercy in Disguise:** Living forever as a sinner would be eternal misery.
- **The Solution:** Death is necessary to end the cycle of sin; we must die in
  Christ to be raised to newness of life.

## Slide 61 – Q26: The Promise of Victory

- **Question:** By whom did the Lord say that Satan, the originator of sin,
  should be destroyed?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 3:15 – “I will put enmity between thee and the woman,
  and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
  bruise his heel.”

## Slide 62 – Q26: Key Points

- **The First Gospel Promise:** God promised a Deliverer immediately after the
  fall.
- **The Seed:** Christ is the Seed (Galatians 4:4 – “But when the fulness of the
  time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman...”).
- **Bruised Head vs. Heel:** Satan would wound Christ (cross), but Christ would
  crush Satan's kingdom.

## Slide 63 – Q27: Purpose of Christ's Death

- **Question:** For what purpose did Christ die?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:14 – “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of
  flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through
  death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil.”

## Slide 64 – Q27: Key Points

- **Destroying the Destroyer:** Christ died to pay the penalty and break Satan's
  legal hold.
- **The Power of Death:** Jesus holds the keys of death (Revelation 1:18 – “I am
  he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and
  have the keys of hell and of death.”).

## Slide 65 – Q28: The Plan from the Beginning

- **Question:** How early was it determined that Christ should die?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 13:8 – “And all that dwell upon the earth shall
  worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain
  from the foundation of the world.”

## Slide 66 – Q28: Key Points

- **The Everlasting Covenant:** The plan was in place before creation (1 Peter
  1:20 – “Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but
  was manifest in these last times for you.”).
- **Costly Grace:** God counted the cost before creating beings with free will.

## Slide 67 – Q29: The Promise to Abraham

- **Question:** Through whom was Abraham to receive the promise of God?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 12:7 – “The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy
  seed will give this land.”

## Slide 68 – Q29: Key Points

- **The Covenant:** God called Abraham and promised land and posterity.
- **Significance:** This covenant forms the basis of the gospel story in the Old
  Testament.

## Slide 69 – Q30: Extent of the Promise

- **Question:** How far was the promise to Abraham to extend?
- **Key Text:** Acts 3:25 – “And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth
  be blessed.”

## Slide 70 – Q30: Key Points

- **Universal Blessing:** The promise extends to every family (kindred) on
  earth.
- **Gospel Mission:** This is the mandate for global evangelism.

## Slide 71 – Q31: The Seed Identified

- **Question:** To whom does the "seed" of the Old Testament refer?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:16 – “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises
  made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed,
  which is Christ.”

## Slide 72 – Q31: Key Points

- **Christ is the Center:** The ultimate fulfillment of the covenant is Jesus
  Christ.
- **Yes and Amen:** All promises are fulfilled in Him (2 Corinthians 1:20 – “For
  all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God
  by us.”).

## Slide 73 – Q32: Abraham’s Faith

- **Question:** How did the Lord regard Abraham's faith?
- **Key Text:** Romans 4:3 – “Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him
  for righteousness.”

## Slide 74 – Q32: Key Points

- **Imputed Righteousness:** Abraham had no righteousness of his own; he
  believed God's promise.
- **"Counted":** God credited Christ's righteousness to him. Salvation has
  always been by faith.

## Slide 75 – Q33: Law and Righteousness

- **Question:** Since man had sinned, if righteousness could come by the law,
  then what must we conclude?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 2:21 – “If righteousness come by the law, then Christ
  is dead in vain.”

## Slide 76 – Q33: Key Points

- **The Law Cannot Save:** The Law shows sin but cannot wash it away (Romans
  3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in
  his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”).
- **Necessity of the Cross:** If obedience could save, Jesus did not need to
  die.
- **Law and Gospel:** The Law points to our need; the Gospel provides the
  remedy.

## Slide 77 – Q34: Reckoned Under Sin

- **Question:** Why have all been reckoned under sin?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:22 – “But the Scripture hath concluded all under
  sin, that the promise by faith of Christ Jesus might be given to them that
  believe.”

## Slide 78 – Q34: Key Points

- **Level Ground:** God declares everyone a sinner so He can offer salvation to
  everyone on the same basis—faith.
- **No Boasting:** No one can save themselves; all need the Promise.

## Slide 79 – Q35: Christ Our All

- **Question:** What does Christ become to the true believer?
- **Key Text:** John 14:6 – “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and
  the life; no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.”

## Slide 80 – Q35: Key Points

- **The Way:** Without Him, there is no going.
- **The Truth:** Without Him, there is no knowing.
- **The Life:** Without Him, there is no living.
- **Access:** He is our Mediator in the Heavenly Sanctuary.

## Slide 81 – Q36: Becoming Children of God

- **Question:** How then do all become children of God?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:26 – “For ye are all the children of God by faith in
  Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 82 – Q36: Key Points

- **Adoption:** We are not natural-born spiritual children; by nature we are
  "children of wrath" (Ephesians 2:3 – “...and were by nature the children of
  wrath, even as others.”).
