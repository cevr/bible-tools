# Reading 106: The Fate of the Transgressor

## Introduction

What becomes of those who persistently reject God's mercy? This solemn question demands a biblical answer—one that reveals both God's justice and His character of love. Scripture speaks plainly: sin ends in death, complete and final, not in endless torment. Understanding this truth clears away centuries of confusion and reveals a God who is both just and merciful in His final dealings with sin.

## Core Truths

### The Wages of Sin Is Death

The Bible speaks with unmistakable clarity about sin's ultimate consequence:

> _"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)

> _"The soul that sinneth, it shall die."_ (Ezekiel 18:4)

Notice the stark contrast: **death** versus **eternal life**. If the wicked lived forever in torment, they would possess a form of immortality—the very thing Scripture reserves exclusively for those who receive God's gift through Christ.

[DYK🔎] The word "death" in Scripture comes from the Greek _thanatos_, meaning the cessation of life. The biblical writers could have used words meaning "torment" or "suffering" if that were the intended meaning, but they consistently chose words meaning death, destruction, and perishing.

### The Nature of This Death

Scripture describes the fate of the wicked with remarkable consistency using terms that all point to the same conclusion—complete destruction:

**"Everlasting destruction"** (2 Thessalonians 1:9)
**"Perish"** (Luke 13:3; John 3:16; 2 Peter 2:12)
**"Consume away"** (Psalm 37:20)
**"Burn up"** (Malachi 4:1)
**"Be as though they had not been"** (Obadiah 1:16)

> _"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power."_ (2 Thessalonians 1:9)

The destruction is _everlasting_ in its results—not in its duration. The fire produces permanent, irreversible death, not perpetual dying.

[Q] **"But doesn't 'everlasting destruction' mean being destroyed forever and ever?"**

Consider: We speak of "everlasting redemption" (Hebrews 9:12), meaning redemption that lasts forever in its _effects_, not a process of being redeemed eternally. Likewise, "everlasting destruction" refers to destruction whose _results_ are permanent—the destroyed remain destroyed forever. Sodom and Gomorrah suffered "eternal fire" (Jude 7), yet those cities are not still burning today; they were reduced to ashes (2 Peter 2:6), serving as an _example_ of what awaits the ungodly.

## Deeper Truths

### The Complete End of Sin and Sinners

Scripture employs vivid imagery to convey the totality of this destruction:

> _"For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch."_ (Malachi 4:1)

Neither **root** nor **branch**—nothing remains. The wicked are compared to:

- **Fat of lambs** that melts away (Psalm 37:20)
- **Stubble** consumed by fire (Malachi 4:1)
- **Chaff** blown away by wind (Psalm 1:4)
- **Natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed** (2 Peter 2:12)

[ILL] Consider a document thrown into a roaring fire. For a moment it burns brightly, but soon it is reduced to ash, then to nothing. The fire does not preserve the document in a perpetual state of burning—it _consumes_ it utterly. So shall it be with sin and sinners: the fire accomplishes its work completely, leaving nothing behind.

### The Place of the Wicked Shall Not Be

> _"For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be."_ (Psalm 37:10)

> _"As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation."_ (Proverbs 10:25)

The contrast is absolute: the righteous have an _everlasting foundation_; the wicked are _no more_. If the wicked existed eternally in torment, they would certainly _be_ somewhere—but Scripture declares they "shall not be."

[DYK🔎] The original reading (chapter note) observed: "It would be difficult to keep the wicked in eternal torment without any place even, in which to exist." This simple logic cuts through centuries of theological confusion. If their _place_ shall not be, how can _they_ continue to exist?

### When and Where Does This Occur?

The judgment and destruction of the wicked is not at death, but at a specific future time:

> _"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished."_ (2 Peter 2:9)

The wicked are _reserved_—held in the grave—until the day of judgment. Job confirms this:

> _"That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? They shall be brought forth to the day of wrath."_ (Job 21:30)

The location is this earth itself:

> _"Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner."_ (Proverbs 11:31)

Revelation 20 describes the scene:

> _"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."_ (Revelation 20:9)

[Q] **"If there is no eternal hell burning now, where did that idea come from?"**

The doctrine of eternal torment entered Christianity from Greek philosophy, not from Scripture. The Hebrew and Greek words translated "hell" (sheol, hades, gehenna) refer to the grave, the realm of the dead, or the valley outside Jerusalem where refuse was burned. Jesus used "gehenna"—a literal place where fire _consumed_ what was cast into it—as an illustration of final destruction, not endless torture. The Bible's consistent testimony is that the wicked perish, are destroyed, and cease to exist.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### God's Character Vindicated

The doctrine of eternal torment presents God as infinitely more cruel than the worst human tyrant—torturing beings He created for endless ages. But Scripture reveals a different God:

> _"For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye."_ (Ezekiel 18:32)

God takes _no pleasure_ in the death of the wicked—how much less in their endless torture! The final destruction of sin is a "strange act" (Isaiah 28:21), grievous to God's loving heart, but necessary for the eternal security of the universe.

### The Sanctuary and Final Cleansing

In the earthly sanctuary, the Day of Atonement accomplished complete cleansing—sin was not merely covered but removed. The scapegoat, bearing the confessed sins of the people, was led into the wilderness to perish (Leviticus 16:21-22).

So in the great antitype, sin and sinners are not preserved eternally but removed from existence. The universe is _cleansed_—not merely quarantined. The Most Holy Place ministry completes what began at the cross: the full eradication of sin from God's creation.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "consume" in relation to sin (_kalah_) means "to complete, finish, bring to an end." God's work regarding sin is not perpetual management but complete resolution.

### The New Earth: Righteousness Dwells

> _"Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."_ (2 Peter 3:13)

The earth, long cursed by sin, will be purified by fire—not destroyed but renewed. From those ashes rises the eternal home of the redeemed:

> _"Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth."_ (Matthew 5:5)

No corner of God's creation will harbor rebellion. No hidden dungeon of torment will mar the universe's peace. Every creature in heaven and earth will unite in praise:

> _"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."_ (Revelation 5:13)

## Practical Application

### This Truth Should Lead Us to Christ

Understanding the fate of the transgressor should drive us not to terror but to the Savior. The same Bible that reveals sin's wages also offers escape:

> _"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_ (John 3:16)

The choice is clear: **perish** or **everlasting life**. There is no third option.

### This Truth Reveals God's Love

A God who would torture creatures eternally could not be called love. But a God who weeps over the lost (Luke 19:41), pleads with rebels to return (Ezekiel 33:11), and ultimately grants even the impenitent the mercy of non-existence—this God can be loved without reservation and trusted completely.

### This Truth Calls Us to Witness

> _"Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."_ (Luke 13:3)

The fate of the wicked is real and terrible—not because it lasts forever, but because it is _final_. There is no second chance, no escape from the grave, no eventual restoration. This urgency should fuel our witness: souls hang in the balance between eternal life and eternal death.

### Righteousness by Faith: Our Only Hope

No human effort can satisfy the claims of broken law. Only Christ's perfect righteousness, received by faith, can shield us from sin's wages. This is why the gospel is so precious:

> _"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)

Christ bore our death that we might receive His life. He descended into the grave that we might ascend to glory. This gift cannot be earned—only received with grateful, trusting hearts.

## Appeal

> _"I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live."_ (Deuteronomy 30:19)

Friend, God sets before you today two paths—and only two. One leads to life eternal in His presence, where "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying" (Revelation 21:4). The other leads to destruction, complete and final, where sin and suffering cease because the sinner ceases to exist.

God pleads with you: **Choose life.**

Not because He delights in threatening you with death, but because He loves you infinitely and gave His Son to die in your place. The same fire that destroys the wicked will purify this earth into an eternal paradise. Will you be among those who inherit it?

Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart. Surrender to Christ. Let His righteousness cover you. Let His life transform you. And look forward with confidence to that day when every tear is wiped away and every creature joins the eternal anthem:

_"Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever."_
