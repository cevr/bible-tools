### Q1. Regarding the wicked, what question does Peter ask?

**“For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it
first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of
God?" 1 Peter 4:17.**

**Answer:** The Apostle Peter poses a solemn question regarding the final
destiny of those who reject God's grace. The verse establishes a sequence in the
divine plan:

1.  **Judgment begins at the "house of God":** This refers to the
    **Investigative Judgment** (Daniel 7:9–10). Before Christ returns, the lives
    of all who have claimed His name are reviewed in the heavenly sanctuary to
    see if their faith is genuine and their characters have been brought into
    harmony with God's law through the power of the Holy Spirit (Ecclesiastes
    12:14).
2.  **The end of the disobedient:** If the righteous are saved "scarcely"
    (meaning with difficulty, requiring the infinite cost of the cross and the
    agonizing work of separating from sin), there is absolutely no hope for
    those who "obey not the gospel."

The "gospel of God" is not merely a theory, but the "power of God unto
salvation" (Romans 1:16). It is the good news that Christ not only forgives the
past but writes His law in the heart (Hebrews 8:10). Those who reject this
transforming power cannot stand in the presence of a holy God.

- **Definition—Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the
  heavenly sanctuary (beginning in 1844, based on Daniel 8:14) where the records
  of God's people are reviewed to blot out confessed sins before the Second
  Coming.

**[ILL]** Imagine a raging forest fire approaching a town. The only safety is
inside a special fireproof shelter constructed by a master engineer. If those
inside the shelter (the "house of God") must diligently ensure the doors are
sealed and the instructions followed to survive the heat, what hope is there for
the man who stands outside in the open forest, mocking the fire and refusing the
shelter? He has no protection against the consuming element.

### Q2. What does Paul say is the wages of sin?

**“For the wages of sin is death." Rom. 6:23 (Eze. 18:4).** **NOTE. - Die. - To
cease to live; to expire; to decease; to perish. - Webster.**

**Answer:** The Bible presents a sharp contrast between what we earn and what
God gives.

- **Wages:** Something earned; a debt paid for work performed. The inevitable
  result of a life of sin—separation from God—is death. Since God is the only
  Fountain of Life (Psalm 36:9), to separate from Him is to cut off one's source
  of existence.
- **Death:** The wages is not "eternal life in misery," but **death**. Ezekiel
  18:4 confirms, "The soul that sinneth, it shall die." This is the cessation of
  being, the "second death" from which there is no resurrection.

This doctrine protects the character of God. He does not torture His enemies for
eternity; rather, He allows them to reap the natural harvest of their
choice—non-existence. Righteousness by Faith teaches us that we have no life in
ourselves. We only have life by abiding in Christ (1 John 5:11–12).

- **Definition—Second Death:** The final punishment of the wicked in the lake of
  fire, resulting in total annihilation and eternal separation from life
  (Revelation 20:14).

**[ILL]** If an employee works faithfully for a month, the employer owes them a
paycheck. It is not a gift; it is a wage—a rightful earning. Similarly, the
sinner works for Satan and serves self. The "paycheck" for that work is death.
God does not inflict it arbitrarily; it is the natural payout of the work
performed.

---

### Q3. What will be the character of this death?

**“Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the
Lord, and from the glory of His power." 2 Thess. 1:9 (Acts 3:23) (Matt.
10:28).** **NOTE. - Destroy. - To kill; to slay; to ruin; to put an end to. -
Webster.**

**Answer:** The punishment is not everlasting _tormenting_, but everlasting
_destruction_.

1.  **The Duration:** The _effect_ of the punishment is eternal. Just as
    "eternal judgment" (Hebrews 6:2) means a judgment with eternal results, not
    a judge sitting on a bench forever, "everlasting destruction" means the
    destruction is final and irreversible.
2.  **The Source:** It comes "from the presence of the Lord." For the righteous,
    God's presence is light and life; for sin and sinners, our God is a
    "consuming fire" (Hebrews 12:29). Sin cannot exist in His glory.
3.  **The Nature:** Matthew 10:28 clarifies that God is able to "destroy both
    soul and body in hell." This refutes the idea of an indefeasible, immortal
    soul that cannot be destroyed. Only God possesses immortality (1 Timothy
    6:16); man receives it only as a gift through Christ.

**[ILL]** If a house is destroyed by fire, it turns to ash. The fire may go out
once the fuel is consumed, but the destruction is "everlasting"—the house never
comes back. It is gone forever. So it is with the wicked; they are not preserved
in the fire, they are consumed by it.

---

### Q4. What does the Saviour say will befall those who do not repent?

**“I tell you, Nay; but, except ye repent, ye shall all like wise perish." Luke
13:3 (1 Cor. 1:18) (Job 20:4-6).** **NOTE. - Perish.- To die; to lose life; to
wither and decay; to be destroyed; to come to nothing; to be blotted from
existence. - Webster.**

**Answer:** Jesus draws a line in the sand: Repentance or Perishing. There is no
middle ground.

- **Repentance:** This is more than saying "I'm sorry." It is a change of mind,
  a turning away from sin, and a yielding of the will to God (Acts 3:19). It is
  a gift from God that leads us to hate sin (Acts 5:31).
- **Perish:** The alternative to repentance is to "perish." As the note
  indicates, this means to be blotted from existence.

The popular theology of "eternal conscious torment" changes the word "perish" to
mean "live forever in pain." But Jesus meant what He said. "God so loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not **perish**, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). The choice is
Life or Death, not Life in Bliss vs. Life in Pain.

**[ILL]** A man is drifting in a boat toward a massive waterfall. A rescue rope
is thrown (the Gospel). If he grabs it, he is pulled to safety
(Repentance/Faith). If he ignores it, he goes over the edge. He does not fall
forever; he hits the bottom and is destroyed.

---

### Q5. In what condition does the apostle say they shall thus perish?

**“But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak
evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their
own corruption." 2 Peter 2:12.**

**Answer:** Peter uses strong language to describe the end of those who cling to
sin. He compares them to "natural brute beasts."

- **No Natural Immortality:** Animals do not have immortal souls. When they die,
  they cease to exist. Peter says the wicked shall perish _in the same
  manner_—they shall be "destroyed" and "utterly perish."
- **Corruption:** They perish in their own corruption. Sin is self-destructive.
  By rejecting Christ, who is the only remedy for the corruption of the heart,
  they are left with nothing but decay.
- **Sanctification Connection:** We must partake of the "divine nature" (2 Peter
  1:4) to escape the corruption of the world. Without the imparted life of
  Christ, man is merely "natural," and the natural man cannot inherit the
  kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 15:50).

---

### Q6. To what are the wicked in their punishment compared?

**“But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the lord shall be as the fat
of lambs; they shall consume, into smoke shall they consume away." Ps. 37:20.**
**NOTE. - Consume. - To destroy by separating the parts of a thing by
decomposition, as by fire, etc.; to bring to utter ruin; to exterminate. -
Webster.**

**Answer:** The Psalmist uses imagery from the **Sanctuary service** to describe
the fate of the wicked.

- **The Fat of Lambs:** In the ancient Hebrew sacrifices, the fat was burned
  upon the altar. It did not burn forever. It burned until it was consumed,
  turning into smoke that vanished into the air.
- **Into Smoke:** Just as smoke dissipates and is seen no more, so the wicked
  will vanish. This imagery is incompatible with the idea of a sinner writhing
  in a dungeon of fire for eternity. The fire does its work of purification and
  consumption, leaving nothing but clean air.

**[ILL]** Watch a candle flame burn down. When the wax (the fat) is all gone,
the flame flickers and dies. The smoke rises and disappears. You cannot gather
that smoke back together to make a candle. It is consumed away. This is the
Bible's illustration of the end of sin.

---

### Q7. What will be the results of this punishment?

**“As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more; but the righteous is an
everlasting foundation." Prov. 10:25.**

**Answer:** The result is total non-existence: "the wicked is no more."

- **The Contrast:** The righteous are established on an "everlasting
  foundation"—the Rock, Christ Jesus (1 Corinthians 3:11). Because they are
  built on Him, they share His eternity.
- **The Wicked:** Because they built their lives on self and sin (the sand), the
  storm of judgment sweeps them away entirely. They do not exist in a parallel
  universe of suffering; they are simply "no more."

---

### Q8. Will any part of them be left?

**“For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud,
yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall
burn them up, saith the lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
branch." Mal. 4:1.**

**Answer:** Malachi provides one of the most graphic descriptions of the final
executive judgment.

- **Burn as an Oven:** The earth itself becomes a furnace of fire.
- **Stubble:** Dry straw. Stubble does not burn for billions of years; it
  flashes up and is turned to ash almost instantly.
- **Neither Root nor Branch:**
  - **The Root:** Satan is the root of all sin.
  - **The Branches:** His followers (evil angels and unrepentant humans).
  - This signifies the **complete eradication of sin from the universe**. If a
    root is left, the weed can grow back. God promises that affliction shall not
    rise up a second time (Nahum 1:9). Therefore, Satan and all who cling to him
    must be completely destroyed.

- **Definition—Atonement (Final):** The work is not complete until the universe
  is clean. Christ's atonement involves not just forgiving sin, but eliminating
  it so that the universe is safe for eternity.

---

### Q9. What will then be their condition?

**“For as ye have drunk upon My holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink
continually; yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall
be as though they had not been." Obad. 1:16.**

**Answer:** This is perhaps the strongest statement on annihilation in
Scripture: **"They shall be as though they had not been."**

- **Total Erasure:** If someone is being tortured in hell, they very much "are."
  They exist. But the Bible says their end condition is as if they never
  existed. They are wiped from the memory of the universe, except as a lesson of
  the sad history of sin.
- **God's Mercy:** Even in this, God is merciful. It would be an act of cruelty
  to keep a being alive who hates God, forcing them to exist in a universe
  filled with God's glory which they loathe. To let them return to nothingness
  is the only just and merciful end for those who reject Life.

**[ILL]** Think of a bad dream. While you are in it, it seems real. But when you
wake up, it fades, and soon it is as though it never happened. The nightmare of
sin will be over, and the universe will wake up to eternal peace.

---

### Q10. Where will the place of the wicked then be?

**“For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be; yea, thou shalt
diligently consider his place, and it shall not be." Ps. 37:10.** **NOTE. - It
would be difficult to keep the wicked in eternal torment without any place even,
in which to exist.**

**Answer:**

- **The Search:** The Psalmist invites us to look for the sinner's "place."
- **The Result:** It "shall not be." If there is a burning hell where millions
  of souls are screaming, that is a "place." But the Bible says the place itself
  is gone.
- **Sanctuary Truth:** The purpose of the sanctuary service was to cleanse the
  camp of sin. On the antitypical Day of Atonement, sin is placed on the head of
  the scapegoat (Satan) and sent into the wilderness of non-existence. When the
  fire cleanses the earth, the "place" of sin is purified.

---

### Q11. Where will they receive their recompense, death, which is the wages of sin?

**“Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; much more the wicked
and the sinner." Prov. 11:31.**

**Answer:** Contrary to popular belief, "hell" is not a subterranean cavern or a
distant spiritual dimension existing right now.

- **Location:** The wicked are punished **"in the earth."**
- **Timing:** This happens at the end of the world, not at the moment of death.
  The righteous inherit the earth made new, and the wicked meet their fate on
  this earth as it is purified by fire.

---

### Q12. How is this accomplished?

**“And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the
saints about, and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven,
and devoured them." Rev. 20:9**

**Answer:** Revelation 20 describes the final scene after the 1,000 years
(millennium).

1.  **The Siege:** The wicked are resurrected (the second resurrection) and, led
    by Satan, attempt to attack the New Jerusalem, the "camp of the saints."
2.  **The Fire:** Fire comes down _from God out of heaven_. It is not a place
    they go to; it is a judgment that comes upon them.
3.  **The Result:** It **"devoured"** them. To devour means to eat up
    completely. It does not say "fire came down and tortured them forever," but
    it consumed them.

This is the "strange act" of God (Isaiah 28:21). He cleanses His universe by
fire, just as He once cleansed it by water (the Flood).

---

### Q13. Do the wicked go directly to this punishment at death? If not, when do they receive it?

**“The lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve
the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished." 2 Peter 2:9 (Job 21:29,
30).**

**Answer:**

- **Current State:** The wicked are not currently in fire. They are being
  **"reserved"** (held in custody) in the grave.
- **Future Judgment:** They are reserved _unto_ the day of judgment.
- **Justice:** No civil judge puts a criminal in prison before the trial. God,
  the righteous Judge, does not punish a soul before the Judgment takes place.
  All who have died are sleeping in the grave until the resurrection—the
  righteous to the resurrection of life, the wicked to the resurrection of
  damnation (John 5:28-29).

**[ILL]** If a man commits a crime, he is held in a jail cell (reserved) until
his court date. He is not sent to the electric chair or the penitentiary until
the judge bangs the gavel and issues the sentence. So it is with God's judgment.

---

### Q14. The earth, the sinner's "place," has been cursed with sin. To what is that reserved?

**“But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in
store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
men." 2 Peter 3:7.**

**Answer:** The earth itself is "kept in store" for fire. The physical world has
been marred by six thousand years of sin and the curse. It must be purified.

- **The Lake of Fire:** This earth, when wrapped in the cleansing flames of God,
  _is_ the lake of fire.
- **Perdition:** This word means "destruction" or "ruin." This fire brings about
  the final ruin of ungodly men and the purification of the elements.

---

### Q15. What will be the result of this fire on the earth?

**“Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the
heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with
fervent heat." 2 Peter 3:12.**

**Answer:** The fire will be intense enough to melt the very elements.

- **Dissolved:** The atomic structure of the cursed earth is broken down.
- **Fervent Heat:** This intense heat ensures that no trace of the curse
  remains. This includes the works of man—his cities, his monuments to pride,
  and the scars of sin on nature. All are erased.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:** We cannot cling to this world. "Love
  not the world, neither the things that are in the world" (1 John 2:15). If we
  love the world, we will perish with the world. If we love Christ, we have a
  treasure that fire cannot touch.

---

### Q16. What does our Saviour call the earth when in this condition?

**“The Son of man shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out of His
kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them
into a furnace of fire." Matt. 13:41, 42.**

**Answer:** Jesus refers to the earth in this state as a **"furnace of fire."**

- **Gathering Out:** Notice that the wicked are gathered _out_ of His kingdom.
  They are removed so that the kingdom may be pure.
- **Things that Offend:** Not just people, but "things"—sin, habits, rebellion.
- **The Purpose:** A furnace is used to purify metal (dross is burned off) or to
  destroy trash. Here, the dross of sin is burned away so that the pure gold of
  the New Earth may remain.

---

### Q17. After the burning of the earth, what is to come?

**“Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new
earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:13.** **NOTE. - The "place" of
the wicked no longer exists. That, too, will be gone.**

**Answer:** After the fire has done its work, God re-creates.

- **New Earth:** From the purified ashes of the old world, God creates a new
  home for the redeemed, restoring the beauty of Eden.
- **Wherein Dwelleth Righteousness:** This is the key characteristic. No sin, no
  rebel, no tempter will ever enter there.
- **Sanctification:** If only righteousness dwells there, we must possess
  righteousness _now_. We cannot expect to enjoy that land if we are not
  comfortable with holiness here. Through faith in Jesus, His righteousness is
  imputed to us for our title to heaven, and imparted to us for our fitness for
  heaven.

**[ILL]** A grand old mansion has become infested with a deadly mold and rot
that cannot be scrubbed out. The owner burns it down to the foundation and
builds a brand new, perfect home on the same site. The old rot is gone forever;
the new home is spotless.

---

### Q18. But where will the righteous then be found?

**“Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
Father." Matt. 13:43.**

**Answer:** While the wicked are reduced to ashes (Malachi 4:3), the righteous
"shine forth."

- **Glorification:** This speaks of the glorified bodies of the saints,
  reflecting the image of Jesus.
- **Victory:** The Great Controversy is ended. The accusations of Satan are
  silenced. God's people are vindicated, not by their own works, but because
  they are in Christ.

---

### Q19. What promise of the Saviour's will at that time be verified?

**“Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth." Matt. 5:5.**

**Answer:**

- **The Meek:** Those who have submitted their will to God, who have ceased
  trying to justify themselves and have accepted the righteousness of Christ.
- **Inherit the Earth:** Not the old, sin-cursed earth, but the New Earth. The
  wicked schemed to possess the earth through power and greed, but they lose
  everything. The meek, who gave up everything for Christ, receive the earth as
  an eternal inheritance.

---

### Q20. What universal song will be sung?

**“And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth,
and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and
unto the Lamb forever and ever." Rev. 5:13.**

**Answer:** This verse describes the ultimate harmony of the universe.

- **Every Creature:** Note that _every_ conscious being is praising God.
- **The Implication:** If billions of wicked souls were writhing in eternal
  torture in a hell, they would be cursing God or screaming in agony. They would
  not be singing "Blessing and honor."
- **The Conclusion:** The fact that _every_ voice in the universe joins this
  anthem proves that the wicked are no more. They have been "as though they had
  not been." The universe is clean. Sin is gone. Only love and loyalty remain.

**"Affliction shall not rise up the second time." (Nahum 1:9).** The tragedy of
sin is over. God is All in All.
