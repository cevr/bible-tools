# Bible Study: Spiritual Gifts

## Introduction

From the Garden of Eden to the present day, God has consistently sought to communicate with His children. Though sin severed the direct communion humanity once enjoyed with their Creator, the Lord in His mercy established the gift of prophecy—and other spiritual endowments—to guide, instruct, and prepare His people. This study explores how God speaks through prophets, how we may discern true from false messengers, and why these gifts remain essential for the remnant church awaiting Christ's return.

## Core Truths

### God's Original Communication with Humanity

In Eden, before sin entered, God spoke directly with Adam and Eve. The intimacy of that fellowship is glimpsed in the tender scene following the fall:

> _"And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?"_ (Genesis 3:9)

This was not the call of One who did not know Adam's location, but the loving inquiry of a Father seeking His wayward child. Sin had broken the face-to-face communion, yet God immediately pursued reconciliation.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word translated "called" (_qara_) is the same word used when God "called" light into existence (Genesis 1:3). God's voice that created the universe now reached out to redeem the fallen.

### Prophecy: God's Appointed Channel

After Eden, God adapted His communication to humanity's fallen condition:

> _"God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets."_ (Hebrews 1:1)

The phrase "sundry times and divers manners" reveals that God uses various methods—dreams, visions, direct speech, symbolic actions—but always through chosen human instruments. Why does God use prophets rather than speaking to each person directly?

> _"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets."_ (Amos 3:7)

God desires an informed people. Before any major divine action—whether judgment or deliverance—He graciously warns and instructs through prophetic messengers. This is not arbitrary; it reflects God's character of justice and mercy. He never brings calamity without first offering opportunity for repentance.

### The Holy Spirit: Source of All True Prophecy

The prophetic gift does not originate in human wisdom or initiative:

> _"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."_ (2 Peter 1:21)

**Moved** (Greek: _pherō_) means "carried along" or "borne along"—like a ship driven by the wind. The prophet's personality and style remain, but the message comes from God. The Holy Spirit is the true Author; the prophet is the instrument.

[DYK🔎] Second Samuel 23:2 records David's testimony: _"The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and His word was in my tongue."_ David understood that his inspired psalms were not his own invention but divine communication through him.

## Deeper Truths

### How God Speaks to Prophets

Scripture reveals the methods God employs:

> _"If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make Myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream."_ (Numbers 12:6)

**Visions** often occurred while the prophet was awake, sometimes with overwhelming physical effects (Daniel 10:8–9). **Dreams** came during sleep but carried the same divine authority. Both were supernatural revelations—not the product of human imagination.

### The Preservation of Prophetic Words

God intended His messages to be preserved for future generations:

> _"Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters."_ (Daniel 7:1)

Jeremiah was similarly instructed to write his prophecies (Jeremiah 51:60–61). These written records became the means by which later believers could understand God's unfolding plan. Daniel himself studied the writings of Jeremiah to understand the timing of Israel's restoration:

> _"I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem."_ (Daniel 9:2)

[ILL] Consider a father who must go on a long journey. Before leaving, he writes detailed instructions for his children—how to manage the household, what dangers to avoid, what provisions he has made for their needs. Those written words become the family's guide in his absence. So God, through the prophets, has given His church written instructions to guide us until Christ returns.

### Testing the Prophets

Not everyone who claims to speak for God actually does. Scripture provides clear tests:

**Test 1: Fulfillment of Predictions**

> _"When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously."_ (Deuteronomy 18:22)

**Test 2: Harmony with Established Truth**

> _"If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet."_ (Deuteronomy 13:1–3)

This second test is even more important. A false prophet might, through satanic power, perform impressive signs. But if the message leads away from God's revealed truth—His law, His character, His commandments—the prophet is false, regardless of miracles.

[Q] **"If a prophet performs genuine miracles, doesn't that prove they are from God?"**

Not necessarily. Satan can counterfeit miraculous signs (Exodus 7:11–12; 2 Thessalonians 2:9). The supreme test is always: Does this message harmonize with Scripture? Does it uphold God's law and lead people to love and obey the Lord? Isaiah 8:20 declares: _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."_ Truth is internally consistent; error eventually contradicts itself or God's established word.

## Spiritual Gifts in the New Testament Church

### Joel's Promise Fulfilled

The prophet Joel foretold an outpouring of the Spirit in the last days:

> _"And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions."_ (Joel 2:28)

Peter, on the Day of Pentecost, declared this prophecy was beginning its fulfillment:

> _"But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel..."_ (Acts 2:16–17)

This promise was not limited to the apostolic age. Peter explained its scope:

> _"For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call."_ (Acts 2:38–39)

As long as God is calling sinners to salvation, the promise of spiritual gifts remains available to His church.

### The Variety of Spiritual Gifts

Paul instructed the Corinthians:

> _"Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant."_ (1 Corinthians 12:1)

The Spirit distributes various gifts for the common good:

> _"But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal."_ (1 Corinthians 12:7)

These gifts include:

- Word of wisdom
- Word of knowledge
- Faith
- Gifts of healing
- Working of miracles
- **Prophecy**
- Discerning of spirits
- Divers kinds of tongues
- Interpretation of tongues (1 Corinthians 12:8–10)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "gifts" (_charismata_) comes from _charis_, meaning "grace." Spiritual gifts are grace-gifts—not earned or deserved, but freely bestowed by God for service.

### Prophecy: The Most Desirable Gift

Among these gifts, Paul singles out prophecy for special commendation:

> _"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."_ (1 Corinthians 14:1)

Why prophecy? Because _"prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe"_ (1 Corinthians 14:22). The gift of prophecy edifies, instructs, and unifies the believing community. It builds up the body of Christ.

### The Purpose of Spiritual Gifts

> _"And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."_ (Ephesians 4:11–13)

Notice the three-fold purpose:

1. **Perfecting of the saints** — developing mature, Christlike character
2. **Work of the ministry** — equipping believers for service
3. **Edifying the body** — building up the church in unity and strength

And the duration? _"Till we all come... unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."_ Has the church reached that maturity? If not, the gifts remain needed.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Gifts and the Sanctuary

The spiritual gifts reflect Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. As our High Priest, Christ distributes gifts to His people—not for self-glorification, but for service. The lamps of the golden candlestick (representing the church, Revelation 1:20) burn only as they receive oil (the Holy Spirit) from the sanctuary. The gifts flow from Christ's priestly intercession; they are provisions for the church militant.

### Gifts and Righteousness by Faith

Spiritual gifts are not the basis of salvation; they are instruments of service. We receive them not because we deserve them, but because Christ graciously bestows them. Just as justification comes by faith apart from works, so spiritual gifts come by grace apart from merit. Yet these gifts, rightly received, contribute to sanctification—the Holy Spirit working through the gifts transforms the church into Christ's likeness.

### The Great Controversy Dimension

Why does the dragon make war with those who _"have the testimony of Jesus"_ (Revelation 12:17)? Because the gift of prophecy exposes Satan's deceptions and guides God's people through the final crisis. A church with prophetic guidance is a church Satan cannot easily mislead. Thus he wages special warfare against this gift, seeking either to counterfeit it or to cause God's people to despise it.

## The Testimony of Jesus

### What Is the Testimony of Jesus?

Revelation 19:10 provides a key definition:

> _"The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."_

The "testimony of Jesus" is Christ's own testimony given through the prophetic gift. When Jesus testifies to His church through a prophet, that is the spirit of prophecy in operation.

### The Remnant Church Identified

Two identifying marks characterize God's last-day people:

> _"And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."_ (Revelation 12:17)

1. **They keep the commandments of God** — all ten, including the Sabbath
2. **They have the testimony of Jesus Christ** — the spirit of prophecy

These are not two separate groups but one remnant people who maintain both loyalty to God's law and possession of the prophetic gift.

[Q] **"Isn't the gift of prophecy just a New Testament phenomenon that has passed away?"**

Paul answers directly: We need spiritual gifts until we reach "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Ephesians 4:13). He writes that we "know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away" (1 Corinthians 13:9–10). "That which is perfect" is Christ's return and the glorification of the saints—not the completion of the New Testament canon. Until then, the church needs all the gifts God provides.

### Paul's Urgent Counsel

> _"Despise not prophesyings."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:20)

To despise prophesyings is to reject God's appointed means of guidance. Paul links this directly to the church's preparation for Christ's coming:

> _"Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: so that ye come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (1 Corinthians 1:6–7)

A church "waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" should "come behind in no gift." The remnant church, of all churches, should possess and value the prophetic gift.

## Practical Application

### For Personal Growth

- **Study the Bible as supreme** — All prophetic gifts must be tested by Scripture. Grow in your knowledge of God's Word so you can discern truth from error.
- **Value the gift of prophecy** — Do not despise prophesyings. Prayerfully study the messages God has given through His prophets, including those given for the remnant church.
- **Seek the Spirit's gifts** — Pray for God to bestow upon you and your church whatever gifts are needed for effective ministry and spiritual growth.

### For the Church Community

- **Unity through the gifts** — Recognize that diversity of gifts produces unity of purpose. Each member's gift contributes to the whole.
- **Test all things** — Hold fast what is good (1 Thessalonians 5:21). Do not accept any message that contradicts Scripture, but do not reject genuine prophetic guidance.
- **Prepare for Christ's coming** — The gifts are given especially to prepare the church for the final crisis. Use them to build up one another in faith and character.

### In the Great Controversy

- **Recognize the enemy's strategy** — Satan seeks to counterfeit the prophetic gift (false prophets) or to cause God's people to despise it. Guard against both extremes.
- **Keep the commandments and have the testimony** — These twin marks identify God's remnant. Let both be evident in your life and church.

## Appeal

> _"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets."_ (Amos 3:7)

God has not left His people to walk in darkness. Through the ages, He has provided light through prophets, and in these last days, He has confirmed the testimony of Christ in His remnant church. The same Spirit who moved holy men of old continues to guide, instruct, and prepare the church for Christ's return.

Will you receive what God has provided? Will you test all things by His Word and hold fast that which is good? Will you be among those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ?

The dragon is angry. The final conflict is upon us. But God has not left us without guidance. _"Despise not prophesyings."_ Rather, cherish every ray of light God has given, walk in the truth as it is revealed, and press on toward "the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."

> _"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."_ (Revelation 22:20)
