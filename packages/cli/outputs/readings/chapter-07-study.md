# Reading 7: The Prophetic Timeline of Daniel 7-9

## Introduction

Daniel chapters 7, 8, and 9 form an interconnected prophetic masterpiece revealing God's foreknowledge of world empires and His ultimate plan to restore His people and cleanse His sanctuary. These prophecies, spanning from ancient Babylon to the final work of Christ in heaven, demonstrate that history unfolds under divine supervision—and that we live in the most solemn period of earth's history.

## Core Truths

### The Four Beasts of Daniel 7: A Prophetic Panorama

Daniel 7 presents a vision of four great beasts arising from the sea, representing successive world empires that would dominate God's people:

> _"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth."_ (Daniel 7:17)

- **The Lion** — Babylon (605–538 B.C.), the golden kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar
- **The Bear** — Medo-Persia (538–334 B.C.), raised up on one side, depicting Persian dominance
- **The Leopard** — Grecia (334–168 B.C.), with four wings and four heads representing Alexander's swift conquests and the subsequent fourfold division of his empire
- **The Terrible Beast** — Pagan Rome (168 B.C.–5th century A.D.), dreadful and exceedingly strong, with ten horns representing the divided kingdoms of Europe

[DYK🔎] The sequence of empires in Daniel 7 precisely parallels Daniel 2's metallic image (gold, silver, brass, iron)—God gave the same prophecy twice, in different symbols, to establish certainty (Genesis 41:32).

### The Little Horn: A Power Against God

From among the ten horns arose a "little horn" power—Papal Rome—which gained full ecclesiastical and political authority by 538 A.D. after uprooting three opposing kingdoms: the Heruli, Vandals, and Ostrogoths.

> _"And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws."_ (Daniel 7:25)

This power would:

- **Speak blasphemies** against God (Daniel 7:8, 20; 8:11)
- **Persecute God's people** throughout the Dark Ages (Daniel 7:21, 25; 8:10, 24–25)
- **Cast down truth** and exalt tradition above Scripture (Daniel 8:12, 25)
- **Attempt to change God's law**—particularly the Sabbath commandment (Daniel 7:25)

[Q] **"Isn't it presumptuous to identify a specific religious power as the little horn?"**

Scripture itself provides the identifying marks. We do not judge individuals within any system, but we must recognize prophetic fulfillment. The Reformers—Luther, Calvin, Wesley, and many others—universally identified this power from Scripture. Our concern is faithfulness to God's word, not antagonism toward any people. God has sincere followers in every communion (Revelation 18:4).

## Deeper Truths

### Daniel 8: The Ram, the Goat, and the Sanctuary

Daniel 8 parallels chapter 7 but begins later in prophetic history:

- **The Ram** — Medo-Persia (Daniel 8:20)
- **The He-Goat** — Grecia, with its "notable horn" representing Alexander the Great (Daniel 8:21)

> _"Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."_ (Daniel 8:8)

[DYK🔎] Alexander the Great conquered the known world in only ten years, yet died at age 32. His empire immediately divided among four generals—Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy—exactly as prophesied.

From one of these divisions arose another little horn—first Pagan Rome, then transitioning into Papal Rome. This power would:

- **Magnify himself even to the prince of the host** (Daniel 8:11)—claiming titles belonging to Christ alone
- **Take away the daily** and **cast down the sanctuary** (Daniel 8:11)—obscuring Christ's heavenly ministry through an earthly counterfeit priesthood
- **Cast down the truth to the ground** (Daniel 8:12)

### The 2300 Day Prophecy: Heaven's Timeline

The TIME prophecy of Daniel 8 stands as the longest prophetic period in Scripture:

> _"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."_ (Daniel 8:14)

Gabriel explained the EVENT prophecy (the beasts) but left the TIME prophecy unexplained. Daniel was overwhelmed:

> _"And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it."_ (Daniel 8:27)

[ILL] Imagine receiving a sealed letter containing momentous news, but being told you could not open it yet. Daniel carried the burden of this unexplained time prophecy, not knowing when the sanctuary would be cleansed or what that cleansing meant. His prayer in chapter 9 arose from this very burden.

### Daniel 9: The Key That Unlocks the Timeline

Daniel's heartfelt prayer (Daniel 9:1–19) brought Gabriel back to complete the explanation:

> _"O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding... therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision."_ (Daniel 9:22–23)

The **Seventy Week Prophecy** (Daniel 9:24–27) is "cut off" (Hebrew: _chatak_) from the larger 2300-year prophecy. These 490 years were allotted to the Jewish nation to fulfill their covenant mission.

**The Starting Point**: The decree of Artaxerxes in 457 B.C. (Ezra 7:6–8) to restore Jerusalem's government.

> _"Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks."_ (Daniel 9:25)

[DYK🔎] In Bible prophecy, a day represents a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). This principle unlocks the meaning of prophetic time periods throughout Daniel and Revelation.

## The Prophetic Timeline Revealed

### The 70 Weeks (490 Years) for Israel

| Period   | Years     | Event                                    |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 7 weeks  | 49 years  | Jerusalem rebuilt (457–408 B.C.)         |
| 62 weeks | 434 years | To Messiah the Prince (408 B.C.–A.D. 27) |
| ½ week   | 3½ years  | Christ's ministry (A.D. 27–31)           |
| ½ week   | 3½ years  | Gospel to Jews (A.D. 31–34)              |

**Key Fulfillments:**

- **A.D. 27** — Jesus baptized and anointed for ministry: _"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me"_ (Luke 4:18). Jesus began preaching, _"The time is fulfilled"_ (Mark 1:15).

- **A.D. 31** — "In the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease" (Daniel 9:27). Christ crucified; the temple veil torn (Matthew 27:51). The sacrificial system met its fulfillment.

- **A.D. 34** — Stephen stoned; gospel goes to Gentiles (Acts 7–8). Jewish national probation as God's exclusive covenant people closes.

[Q] **"How can we be certain A.D. 27 was the correct year for Christ's baptism?"**

History confirms Artaxerxes' seventh year as 457 B.C. Adding 483 years (69 weeks) brings us precisely to A.D. 27. Luke 3:1 places Jesus' baptism in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar"—which historians date to A.D. 27. The prophecy was fulfilled to the exact year.

### The Remaining 1810 Years

After the 490 years ended in A.D. 34, **1810 years** remained of the 2300-year prophecy:

**457 B.C. + 2300 years = A.D. 1844**

> _"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."_ (Daniel 8:14)

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Heavenly Sanctuary and Christ's Ministry

The earthly sanctuary was a "shadow" and "pattern" of heavenly realities (Hebrews 8:1–5; 9:23–24). Just as the earthly high priest entered the Most Holy Place once yearly on the Day of Atonement to cleanse the sanctuary (Leviticus 16), so Christ, our heavenly High Priest, entered upon a final phase of ministry in 1844.

> _"We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man."_ (Hebrews 8:1–2)

**The Cleansing of the Sanctuary:**

In the earthly type, the Day of Atonement involved:

- The removal of accumulated sins from the sanctuary
- The vindication of God's character and law
- A solemn time of heart-searching for Israel (Leviticus 16:29–31)

In the heavenly antitype, since 1844:

- Christ examines the records of all who have professed His name
- The investigative judgment determines who among the dead and living are truly His
- God's people are called to deep heart-searching and putting away of sin

[ILL] In ancient Israel, while the high priest ministered in the Most Holy Place, the people outside were to afflict their souls, searching their hearts and confessing every sin. Anyone who did not participate was "cut off" from Israel (Leviticus 23:29). We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement. The heavenly High Priest is completing His work. This is no time for spiritual carelessness.

### The Great Controversy in Daniel's Prophecies

Throughout Daniel 7–9, we see the cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan:

- **Satan's work through earthly powers**: Persecution, blasphemy, casting down truth, attempting to change God's law
- **Christ's ultimate victory**: _"The judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion"_ (Daniel 7:26)
- **The saints vindicated**: _"The saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever"_ (Daniel 7:18)

The little horn's attack on the "daily" (Christ's continual priestly ministry) and the "sanctuary" (God's throne of grace) reveals Satan's strategy: obscure the way of salvation, substitute human priests for the divine Mediator, and direct worship away from heaven to earthly counterfeits.

## Practical Application

### Living in the Antitypical Day of Atonement

We live in the most solemn period of earth's history. Christ's work in the Most Holy Place will soon be complete. What does this mean for us?

**1. Heart-Searching and Confession**

> _"Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."_ (Psalm 139:23–24)

Every known sin must be confessed and forsaken. Christ's blood is available now; it will not always be so.

**2. Confidence in Our High Priest**

> _"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."_ (Hebrews 4:16)

The investigative judgment is not cause for fear but for confidence. We have an Advocate who pleads His own blood on our behalf (1 John 2:1).

**3. Character Preparation**

> _"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still."_ (Revelation 22:11)

A time is coming when probation closes and character is forever fixed. Now is the time, through Christ's indwelling power, to develop characters that reflect His image.

**4. Proclaiming the Three Angels' Messages**

The judgment-hour message of Revelation 14:6–7 calls the world to _"Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come."_ We are to be heralds of this solemn truth.

## Appeal

> _"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."_ (Revelation 22:12)

Beloved, we stand at the end of the longest time prophecy in Scripture. The 2300 years have run their course. Christ is now completing His high-priestly work in heaven's Most Holy Place. Soon He will lay aside His priestly garments and come as King of kings.

The question before each of us is this: Is my name being confessed before the Father and His angels? (Revelation 3:5) Have I committed my life fully to Christ, allowing Him not only to forgive my sins but to cleanse my character?

If you have never surrendered to Jesus, do so today. If you have grown cold or careless, return to Him now. He is faithful to forgive and to cleanse (1 John 1:9). The door of mercy still stands open—but it will not remain so forever.

_"Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts."_ (Hebrews 4:7)
