### Q1. What do the four beasts of Daniel 7 represent in the stream of history?

**"Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four
winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up
from the sea, diverse one from another." (Daniel 7:2–3)**

**Answer:** According to the sure word of prophecy, the four beasts represent
four successive world empires that would arise from the agitation of the nations
("winds" striving on the "sea," representing peoples/multitudes, Revelation
17:15). As outlined in the provided text and confirmed by history:

1.  **The Lion:** Represents **Babylon** (605–538 B.C.).
2.  **The Bear:** Represents **Medo-Persia** (538–334 B.C.). The bear raising
    itself on one side signifies the dominance of the Persians over the Medes.
3.  **The Leopard:** Represents **Grecia** (334–168 B.C.). The four wings
    symbolize the speed of Alexander’s conquests. After Alexander's death, the
    kingdom was divided into four parts (the four heads).
4.  **The Terrible Beast:** Represents **Pagan Rome** (168 B.C. to the 5th
    Century A.D.). This iron monarchy crushed the nations of the earth.

The prophecy indicates that this fourth beast would eventually be broken into
ten kingdoms (the ten horns), corresponding to the divided nations of Europe.

- **Key Definition:**
  - **Prophecy:** History written in advance by God, demonstrating His
    sovereignty over the rise and fall of nations (Isaiah 46:9–10).

**[ILL]** Imagine a relay race where a torch is passed from one runner to
another. In Daniel 7, the "torch" of world dominance is passed from Babylon to
Medo-Persia, to Greece, and finally to Rome. God gave this preview not merely to
teach history, but to show that He knows the end from the beginning and that all
earthly power is temporary. The only Kingdom that shall stand forever is the
Kingdom of Christ (Daniel 2:44).

### Q2. Who is the "little horn" power described in Daniel 7, and what did it do?

**"I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little
horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the
roots..." (Daniel 7:8)**

**Answer:** The text identifies the "little horn" as **Papal Rome**. This power
did not arise as a separate beast but grew out of the fourth beast (Rome) among
the ten horns (divided Europe).

- **Historical Identification:** It gained full supremacy by **538 A.D.**,
  shortly after the uprooting of three opposing Arian tribes: the Heruli,
  Vandals, and Ostrogoths.
- **Characteristics (Daniel 7:25):**
  - **Blasphemy:** Speaking great words against the Most High.
  - **Persecution:** Wearing out the saints of the Most High.
  - **Changing God's Law:** Thinking to change "times and laws."

This power represents a religious-political system that seeks to obscure the
work of Christ. While Christ teaches that salvation is by faith alone in His
merits (Romans 3:28), this earthly system substituted human works and an earthly
priesthood.

- **Righteousness by Faith Application:** The "little horn" represents the
  spirit of _anti-Christ_, which is ultimately the spirit of self-dependence.
  Any system that places a human being or human works in the place of Christ's
  mediation is an attack on the Gospel. Our standing before God relies solely on
  the High Priest in heaven, Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5), not on earthly
  priests or pontiffs.

### Q3. What symbols are introduced in Daniel 8, and how do they parallel Daniel 7?

**"The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia..." (Daniel 8:20–21)**

**Answer:** Daniel 8 provides an "event prophecy" that parallels Daniel 7 but
focuses more intensely on the attack against the Sanctuary.

1.  **The Ram:** Corresponds to the Bear of Daniel 7—**Medo-Persia** (538–334
    B.C.).
2.  **The He-Goat:** Corresponds to the Leopard of Daniel 7—**Grecia** (334–168
    B.C.).
    - The "notable horn" was **Alexander the Great**, who conquered the known
      world in roughly ten years.
    - When he was broken (died) in 323 B.C., four horns came up, representing
      the division of his empire into four Hellenistic kingdoms.
3.  **The Little Horn (Daniel 8):** Corresponds to the Terrible Beast and Little
    Horn of Daniel 7 combined. It begins as **Pagan Rome** (conquering
    geographically) and transitions into **Papal Rome** (conquering
    spiritually).

**[ILL]** Think of a camera lens zooming in. Daniel 2 showed the statue (broad
view). Daniel 7 showed beasts (political nature). Daniel 8 zooms in specifically
on the conflict between these powers and the **Sanctuary of God**. The focus
shifts from "who rules the earth" to "who is attacking God's plan of salvation."

### Q4. How does the Little Horn of Daniel 8 attack the Sanctuary and the Law?

**"Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the
daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down."
(Daniel 8:11)**

**Answer:** The "little horn" (Papal phase) is described as casting truth to the
ground. Its attack is three-fold:

1.  **Against the People:** Persecuting the saints (Daniel 8:24).
2.  **Against the Truth:** Attempting to change the Law of God (Daniel 7:25),
    specifically the Sabbath, which is the seal of God’s authority.
3.  **Against the Sanctuary:** It "cast down" the place of God's sanctuary.
    Since the earthly temple was destroyed in A.D. 70, this attack is against
    the **Heavenly Sanctuary**.

By establishing an earthly priesthood, the mass, and the confessionals, the
Papacy obscured the minds of men from the _true_ Daily Ministry (intercession)
of Jesus in heaven. It set up an earthly counterfeit, directing eyes to man
rather than to Christ.

- **Key Definition:**
  - **The "Daily" (Tamid):** The continual ministry of Christ as our High Priest
    in the Holy Place, interceding for us and supplying grace (Hebrews 7:25).

### Q5. What specific time prophecy is introduced in Daniel 8:14?

**"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed." (Daniel 8:14)**

**Answer:** This is the longest time prophecy in the Bible. While the angel
Gabriel explained the _beasts_ in Daniel 8, the _time_ element was not
immediately explained, causing Daniel to faint (Daniel 8:27). It was not until
Daniel 9 that Gabriel returned to give the "key" to unlock this 2300-day period.

- **The Day-Year Principle:** In Bible prophecy, a symbolic day equals a literal
  year.
  - Numbers 14:34: "Each day for a year."
  - Ezekiel 4:6: "I have appointed thee each day for a year."
- Therefore, 2300 prophetic days = **2300 literal years**.

**[ILL]** If you have a map that says "1 inch = 100 miles," you cannot measure
the distance with a ruler and say, "It is only 3 inches." You must apply the
scale. Prophecy has a scale: 1 prophetic day = 1 solar year. Without this key,
the prophecy remains a mystery; with it, it becomes a precise clock of history.

### Q6. What is the "Seventy Weeks" prophecy, and when does the timeline begin?

**"Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city... Know
therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to
restore and to build Jerusalem..." (Daniel 9:24–25)**

**Answer:** The 70 weeks (490 prophetic days, or 490 years) were "determined" or
literally **"cut off"** from the longer 2300-year prophecy. This time was
allotted specifically to the Jewish nation to finish their probation.

- **The Start Date:** The timeline begins with the decree of Artaxerxes to
  restore and build Jerusalem.
  - Scripture records this in Ezra 7:6-8.
  - Historical Date: **457 B.C.** (Autumn).
- **The Math:**
  - 70 weeks x 7 days/week = 490 days (years).
  - Starting at 457 B.C., the 490 years end in **A.D. 34**.

- **Key Definition:**
  - **Probation:** A period of testing or trial. God gave the Jewish nation 490
    years to accept the Messiah and fulfill their mission to the world.

### Q7. How does the Seventy-Week prophecy pinpoint the Messiah?

**"And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for
himself..." (Daniel 9:26)**

**Answer:** This prophecy is the mathematical proof of Jesus’ Messiahship.

1.  **Seven Weeks (49 years):** Rebuilding the walls/streets of Jerusalem
    (completed 408 B.C.).
2.  **Sixty-Two Weeks (434 years):** Brings us to the "anointing" of the
    Messiah.
    - 408 B.C. + 434 years = **A.D. 27**.
    - In A.D. 27, Jesus was baptized and anointed by the Holy Spirit (Luke
      3:21-22; Acts 10:38). "Messiah" means "Anointed One."
3.  **The Final Week (7 years):** From A.D. 27 to A.D. 34.
    - **"In the midst of the week" (A.D. 31):** Messiah was "cut off"
      (crucified). His death caused the sacrifice and oblation to cease (Daniel
      9:27) because the veil of the temple was torn; the earthly type met the
      Antitype.
    - **End of the Week (A.D. 34):** The stoning of Stephen marked the rejection
      of the gospel by the Sanhedrin. The gospel then went to the Gentiles (Acts
      7:59; 8:1,4).

- **Righteousness by Faith:** Christ was "cut off, but not for Himself." He was
  cut off for _us_. This is the heart of the Gospel—Substitution. He took our
  death so that we might have His life. Our justification is grounded in this
  historical event predicted centuries in advance.

### Q8. When does the 2300-year prophecy end, and what is the "Cleansing of the Sanctuary"?

**"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be
cleansed." (Daniel 8:14)**

**Answer:** Since the 70 weeks (490 years) were the first part of the 2300
years:

- **Total:** 2300 years.
- **Subtract:** 490 years (ended in A.D. 34).
- **Remaining:** 1810 years.
- **Calculation:** A.D. 34 + 1810 = **A.D. 1844**.

In 1844, Jesus did not return to the earth (as many early Advent believers
mistakenly hoped), but He entered the **Most Holy Place** of the heavenly
sanctuary to begin His final work: the **Cleansing of the Sanctuary**.

- **The Meaning of the Cleansing:**
  - In the earthly type (Leviticus 16), the sanctuary was cleansed once a year
    on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).
  - This symbolized the removal of the record of sin from God's house.
  - In 1844, Christ began the work of **Investigative Judgment**, reviewing the
    lives of believers to blot out sins before His return.

- **Experiential Application (Righteousness by Faith):** While Christ cleanses
  the sanctuary in heaven, a corresponding work must take place in the hearts of
  His people on earth. We must afflict our souls (repentance) and cooperate with
  Him to have every sin rooted out of our lives. _"Christ is waiting with
  longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in His church. When the
  character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will
  come to claim them as His own."_ (Christ's Object Lessons, p. 69).

**[ILL]** Imagine a courtroom. Before the Judge delivers the verdict and the
rewards, there is an examination of the evidence. 1844 marked the opening of the
books in heaven. As our High Priest, Jesus stands to plead His blood for every
repentant sinner. The question in this judgment is not "Are you good enough?"
but "Are you covered by the Blood, and has your faith produced the fruit of
obedience?" (Revelation 14:12).
