# Bible Study: Increase of Knowledge

## Introduction

Daniel 12:4 predicts that in "the time of the end," knowledge would dramatically increase and many would "run to and fro." This prophecy, sealed for centuries, has found remarkable fulfillment in modern times—not by accident, but by divine design. God has orchestrated history to prepare the world for the final proclamation of the gospel before Christ's return.

## Core Truths

### The Sealed Book Opened

Daniel received visions he could not fully understand. The angel's instruction was clear:

> _"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."_ (Daniel 12:4)

This sealing was not permanent—it had a definite expiration: **"the time of the end."** The very truths Daniel recorded would become clear to God's people when that appointed time arrived.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew phrase translated "run to and fro" (_shut_) is the same word used in Amos 8:12 to describe people searching diligently for something. In Daniel's context, it suggests an intensive searching of Scripture—people would examine prophecy with renewed understanding in the last days.

### The Time of the End Identified

Scripture provides clear markers for when "the time of the end" would begin:

> _"And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed."_ (Daniel 11:35)

> _"And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."_ (Daniel 7:25)

**Time and times and the dividing of time** equals 3½ prophetic years, or **1,260 prophetic days**. Using the day-for-a-year principle (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6), this represents 1,260 literal years of papal persecution.

- **Beginning**: AD 538 (when the last Arian opposition to papal supremacy was removed)
- **Ending**: AD 1798 (when the papal power received its "deadly wound" through Napoleon's general Berthier)

The "time of the end" therefore **began in 1798**—and it is precisely from this date that we witness the explosion of knowledge and invention.

[Q] **"Isn't 'increase of knowledge' just about general education or technology?"**

While the prophecy has certainly been fulfilled in scientific and technological advancement, its primary focus is on _understanding of prophecy itself_. The book of Daniel, "sealed" for centuries, would be "opened" and understood by God's people. Both meanings have been remarkably fulfilled since 1798—knowledge has increased in every sphere, and prophetic understanding has been restored to the church.

## Deeper Truths

### The Explosion of Invention—By Divine Design

Consider what has emerged since 1798:

| Invention            | Year |
| -------------------- | ---- |
| Steamboat            | 1807 |
| Steam printing press | 1811 |
| Railroad             | 1825 |
| Reaper and mower     | 1833 |
| Telegraph            | 1837 |
| Sewing machine       | 1846 |
| Telephone            | 1876 |
| Automobile           | 1886 |
| Radio                | 1895 |
| Airplane             | 1903 |

[DYK🔎] The _London Spectator_ observed: "More has been done in the course of our lifetime than in all the previous existence of the race." For thousands of years, humanity traveled no faster than a horse could run. Then, within a single century, steam power, electricity, and flight transformed human capability entirely.

**Why this sudden burst?** The timing is not coincidental. God has providentially released knowledge to enable the fulfillment of another crucial prophecy:

> _"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."_ (Matthew 24:14)

[ILL] Consider a farmer who has fields to harvest but only a hand scythe. The work would take lifetimes. But give him a combine harvester, and the same field can be gathered in days. God has given His church the "harvesting equipment" of modern technology—rapid transit, instant communication, mass printing—precisely because the final harvest must reach every nation, kindred, tongue, and people (Revelation 14:6) in one generation.

### The Gospel Connection

Luther, Wesley, and other great reformers could not preach that Christ's coming was "near" in the prophetic sense. Why?

1. The 1,260 years of Daniel 7:25 had not yet ended
2. The signs of Matthew 24:29-30 had not yet occurred
3. The means to reach "all the world" did not exist

But since 1798:

- The prophetic time periods have been fulfilled
- The signs in sun, moon, and stars have occurred (1780, 1833)
- Technology has enabled global gospel proclamation

Christ declared:

> _"When ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors."_ (Matthew 24:33)

**We are that generation.**

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### God's Appointed Times

Scripture repeatedly emphasizes that God works according to "appointed times":

- The judgment is an appointed time: _"Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness"_ (Acts 17:31)
- The end is an appointed time: _"For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie"_ (Habakkuk 2:3)
- Even the "time of the end" was appointed in God's mind before Daniel wrote (Daniel 8:19)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "appointed time" (_moed_) is the same word used for the sanctuary festivals in Leviticus 23. Just as the earthly feasts occurred at precise times pointing to Christ's work, so the prophetic time periods point to specific moments in the heavenly sanctuary ministry.

### The Sanctuary and Prophetic Understanding

The opening of Daniel's sealed book coincides with the opening of the Most Holy Place in the heavenly sanctuary. In 1844—within the "time of the end"—Christ began His final work of investigative judgment (Daniel 8:14). As this work began in heaven, understanding of these very truths was restored to God's people on earth.

The increase of knowledge is not merely intellectual—it is **spiritual**. God is preparing a people who understand the times and know what they ought to do (1 Chronicles 12:32).

### The Great Controversy Climax

Satan has long worked to obscure prophetic truth. During the 1,260 years of persecution, Bibles were chained, prophecy was misinterpreted, and darkness covered the earth. But God's word cannot be forever silenced.

The unsealing of Daniel, the advent movement, the restoration of truth, and the technological explosion are all part of God's final strategy in the great controversy—preparing every nation to hear heaven's final appeal before probation closes.

[Q] **"But hasn't every generation thought they were the last?"**

Previous generations lacked the specific prophetic markers that now exist. They did not see:

- The completion of the 1,260-year prophecy
- The darkening of the sun and moon (May 19, 1780)
- The falling of the stars (November 13, 1833)
- The beginning of the judgment hour message (1844)
- The global capacity to reach every nation

We are not guessing—we are reading the fulfilled signs Christ Himself gave.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for Us

1. **We live in the most solemn period of earth's history.** The investigative judgment is ongoing. Our names will come up in review. Are we ready?

2. **Technology is a sacred trust.** The same tools that can distract and destroy can also spread the gospel. How are we using the increase of knowledge?

3. **Time is short.** Every fulfilled prophecy declares that Christ's coming is "at the doors." This is not a time for spiritual slumber but for earnest preparation.

4. **The truth must go forward.** We are called to be co-laborers with heaven in reaching every nation. Will we use the resources God has provided?

### Questions for Self-Examination

- Am I personally studying the prophecies that God has unsealed for this generation?
- Am I using technology as a tool for the gospel or merely for entertainment?
- Do I live with the solemn awareness that the judgment is now in session?
- Am I actively sharing the message of Christ's soon return?

## Appeal

> _"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."_ (Romans 13:12)

Beloved, we are not in darkness that that day should overtake us as a thief (1 Thessalonians 5:4). God has given us the unsealed prophecies, the fulfilled signs, and the means to reach the world. What more could He do?

The question now is not whether the prophecies are true—history has vindicated them beyond doubt. The question is: **What will we do with this knowledge?**

Christ stands at the door. The final message is going forth. Will you be among those who hasten His coming by sharing His truth? Will you surrender fully to His work of preparation in your heart?

The increase of knowledge points to one certain reality: **Jesus is coming soon.** May we be found watching, working, and waiting for His glorious appearing.
