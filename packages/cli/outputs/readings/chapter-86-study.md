# Reading 86: Reasons for Sabbathkeeping

## Introduction

Why does God ask His people to keep the Sabbath holy? This study explores the profound reasons behind the fourth commandment, revealing that the Sabbath is far more than a day of physical rest—it is God's appointed memorial of creation, His sign of sanctification, and His pledge of redemption. In a world filled with false gods and counterfeit worship, the Sabbath stands as the distinguishing mark of the true and living God.

## Core Truths

### The Sabbath Identifies the True God

In a world of many gods, how can we know the true God from the false? Scripture gives us a clear answer:

> _"The Lord is the true God, He is the living God, and an everlasting king... The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. He hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by His discretion."_ (Jeremiah 10:10-12)

The distinguishing mark of the true God is that **He is the Creator**. Every false god—whether ancient idol or modern philosophy—fails this test. They have made nothing.

When Paul stood before the idolatrous philosophers of Athens, he identified the true God by this same standard:

> _"God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands."_ (Acts 17:23-24)

At Lystra, when the pagans attempted to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods, the apostles redirected them to the Creator:

> _"Turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein."_ (Acts 14:15)

[DYK🔎] The language of Acts 14:15—"heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein"—deliberately echoes the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:11), showing that the apostles pointed Gentiles to the Creator-God of the Sabbath.

### The Sabbath as Creation's Memorial

The fourth commandment itself declares why God set apart the seventh day:

> _"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."_ (Exodus 20:11)

**The Sabbath is the great memorial of creation.** Just as nations erect monuments to commemorate founding events, God established a weekly memorial—not in stone, but in time itself—that humanity might never forget their Creator.

[ILL] Consider how families treasure certain days—birthdays, anniversaries, memorial days. These dates carry no special power in themselves, but they preserve precious memories and relationships. So the Sabbath preserves our relationship with the Creator. If a husband stopped observing his wedding anniversary, his wife might rightly question his love. When we abandon God's memorial day, we risk losing our living connection with our Maker.

## Deeper Truths

### A Sign of Knowing God

The Sabbath serves as more than a memorial—it is a **sign** between God and His people:

> _"Hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God."_ (Ezekiel 20:20)

**Sign**: A visible mark or token that identifies and distinguishes. The Sabbath identifies who God is (the Creator) and who we are (His people who acknowledge Him).

But why is knowing God so vital?

> _"And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent."_ (John 17:3)

To know God is to have eternal life. This is not mere intellectual knowledge, but an intimate, experiential relationship. The Sabbath is God's appointed means of nurturing this saving knowledge.

[Q] **"Can't I know God without keeping the Sabbath?"**

Certainly, God has many ways of revealing Himself. But consider: if God specifically designed the Sabbath as a sign "that ye may know that I am the Lord your God," would we not be wise to accept His appointed means? The Sabbath provides twenty-four sacred hours each week for fellowship with our Creator—time set apart from worldly pursuits for spiritual communion. Those who bypass God's chosen sign may still know something of God, but they forfeit the blessing He designed to deepen that knowledge.

### A Sign of Sanctification

The Sabbath carries a second profound meaning:

> _"Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you."_ (Exodus 31:13)

**Sanctification**: The work by which God makes the believer holy—set apart for sacred use and progressively transformed into Christ's likeness (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 5:23).

Notice carefully: the same God who created the heavens and earth is the One "that doth sanctify you." The creative power displayed in Genesis is the same power that re-creates the fallen soul. Just as God spoke and worlds came into being, so He speaks and new hearts are formed (Ezekiel 36:26; 2 Corinthians 5:17).

[DYK🔎] The connection between creation and sanctification runs throughout Scripture. Paul declares: "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works" (Ephesians 2:10). The Greek word for "workmanship" is _poiema_—from which we derive "poem." We are God's masterpiece, His new creation!

The Sabbath thus points forward as well as backward—not only to creation's week, but to God's ongoing creative work in redeeming sinners. When we rest on the Sabbath, we testify that we cannot save ourselves; we must rest in Christ's finished and continuing work for us.

### A Memorial of Redemption

Israel received an additional reason for Sabbathkeeping:

> _"And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day."_ (Deuteronomy 5:15)

During their Egyptian bondage, the Israelites had largely lost the knowledge of God. Pharaoh's oppression made Sabbath observance extremely difficult, if not impossible. Their deliverance was thus a powerful reason to honor the day that slavery had stolen from them.

But this reason extends to all believers. **Egypt represents the bondage of sin** (Revelation 11:8). Everyone delivered from sin's slavery has the same reason for Sabbathkeeping as Israel had:

> _"He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen with gladness: and gave them the lands of the heathen... that they might observe His statutes, and keep His laws."_ (Psalm 105:43-45)

God delivers His people **for a purpose**—that they might keep His commandments. Freedom from sin's bondage leads to joyful obedience, not lawless license.

[ILL] A freed slave who treasures his liberty will never forget the day of his emancipation. He will tell his children and grandchildren, "On this day, I was set free!" The Sabbath is such a memorial. Each week, the redeemed sinner remembers: "I was in bondage to sin, but God delivered me with a mighty hand. Now I rest in His salvation."

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Original Purpose of Rest

The word "Sabbath" comes from the Hebrew _shabbat_, meaning **rest**. But what kind of rest?

Before the Fall, God designed that humanity's time should be occupied with pleasant, invigorating labor:

> _"And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."_ (Genesis 2:15)

Wearisome, exhausting toil came as a consequence of sin:

> _"Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life... In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread."_ (Genesis 3:17-19)

Since the Fall, the Sabbath does provide physical rest to both man and beast (Exodus 23:12). But **physical rest was not its original or primary purpose**. The Sabbath existed before sin entered, before work became burdensome. Its primary purpose is **spiritual communion with the Creator**.

[Q] **"If the Sabbath rest isn't mainly about physical rest, why cease from work?"**

We cease from ordinary labors—not because they are sinful—but to have a frequently recurring period for contemplating the Creator and His works. Just as we cease other activities during prayer, we cease weekly activities during the Sabbath to give undivided attention to spiritual things. The physical rest serves the spiritual purpose.

### Sabbath Worship: Holy Convocation

God designed the Sabbath not only for private devotion but for corporate worship:

> _"Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation."_ (Leviticus 23:3)

**Convocation**: An assembly of people called together. The Sabbath is a day for God's people to gather in holy assembly.

This design continues into the New Testament: "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching" (Hebrews 10:25). Jesus Himself "came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day" (Luke 4:16).

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the heavenly sanctuary, the ark of God contains the Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath commandment at its heart (Revelation 11:19). The Sabbath is not merely an earthly institution—it reflects heavenly reality. When we honor the Sabbath, we align ourselves with heaven's government and acknowledge God's rightful authority as Creator and Redeemer.

In Christ's high priestly ministry, He is working to reproduce His character in His people—to write His law upon their hearts (Hebrews 8:10). The Sabbath, as a sign of sanctification, points us to this very work. Each Sabbath reminds us that we cannot make ourselves holy; we must rest in Christ's sanctifying power.

[DYK🔎] The Sabbath commandment is the only one that contains God's "seal"—His name ("the Lord"), His title ("that made"), and His territory ("heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is"). This identifies Him as the rightful authority behind the entire law.

## Practical Application

### For Those Discovering the Sabbath

If you are newly learning about God's holy day:

1. **Study prayerfully** — Ask God to reveal His will through His Word
2. **Observe gradually** — Begin preparing Friday afternoon; eliminate secular entertainment and labor
3. **Gather with believers** — Seek fellowship with Sabbathkeeping Christians
4. **Expect blessing** — God promises to honor those who honor His day (Isaiah 58:13-14)

### For Long-time Sabbathkeepers

Guard against formalism! The Sabbath is a living sign, not a dead ritual:

1. **Remember the Creator** — Let your thoughts dwell on God's creative works
2. **Receive sanctification** — Rest from self-effort; trust Christ's power to transform you
3. **Rejoice in redemption** — Recall your deliverance from sin's bondage
4. **Worship corporately** — Make faithful attendance at holy convocation a priority

### Warnings to Heed

> _"Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping His commandments."_ (Deuteronomy 8:11)

There is real danger of forgetting God. The world constantly presses upon us, demanding our time and attention. The Sabbath is God's gracious provision against this spiritual amnesia. Neglect it, and the knowledge of God fades. Keep it holy, and that saving knowledge is renewed week by week.

## Appeal

The Sabbath answers the great questions of human existence: _Where did I come from? Who is my God? Can I be made holy? Am I truly free?_

- **From creation**: You came from the hand of the living God.
- **Your God**: He is the Creator of heaven and earth—the only true God.
- **Your hope**: The same power that created worlds can sanctify your soul.
- **Your freedom**: Christ has broken the chains of sin's slavery.

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord."_ (Isaiah 58:13-14)

Will you accept God's invitation? Will you honor His memorial of creation, His sign of sanctification, His pledge of redemption? The Sabbath is not a burden—it is a delight. Come, and find rest for your soul in the arms of your Creator and Redeemer.
