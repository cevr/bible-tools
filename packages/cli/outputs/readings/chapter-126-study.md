### Q1. What is said of the heavy hearted, and the effect of cheering words upon such?

**“Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop; but a good word maketh it
glad." Prov. 12:25.**

**Answer:**

The Scriptures here reveal the profound connection between the mind and the
body, as well as the Christian’s duty to bear the burdens of others.

1.  **The Burden of Sin and Care:** "Heaviness" often signifies the crushing
    weight of guilt, anxiety, or discouragement. Just as a physical load causes
    the shoulders to stoop, a spiritual burden bows down the soul, hindering our
    walk with God. The enemy of souls seeks to press this weight upon us to hide
    the Father’s love.
2.  **The Ministry of Encouragement:** A "good word" is not merely flattery, but
    a word of truth and hope. The most powerful "good word" a believer can speak
    is the gospel—the good news of salvation. When we point a despondent soul to
    the promises of God, we are acting as agents of the Holy Spirit.
3.  **Christ Our Example:** Jesus did not break the bruised reed (Isaiah 42:3).
    His words were spirit and life (John 6:63). As His followers, we are called
    to lift up the hands which hang down (Hebrews 12:12) by speaking words of
    faith and courage.

- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest bore the
  names of the tribes upon his shoulders (Exodus 28:12). This illustrates how
  Christ, our High Priest, bears the weight of our cares and sins so that we do
  not have to be crushed by them.

**[ILL]** Imagine a man hiking up a steep mountain with a heavy pack of stones.
He is bent over, looking only at the dirt, unable to see the beautiful view or
the summit. A "good word" is like a friend who comes alongside, removes the
heavy pack, and points his eyes toward the peak, restoring his strength and his
vision.

### Q2. What is the influence of cheerfulness upon the sad and despondent?

**“A merry heart doeth good like a medicine; but a broken spirit drieth the
bones." Prov. 17:22.**

**Answer:**

Here the Bible anticipates the findings of modern science regarding the link
between spiritual peace and physical health.

1.  **The Health of the Soul:** A "merry heart" refers not to foolish levity or
    worldly frivolity, but to a spirit of holy trust and gratitude. When the
    heart is at peace with God through **Justification** (God's legal
    declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous), the mind is relieved of
    the stress of guilt.
    - _Definition:_ **Justification:** The act of God whereby He declares a
      sinner righteous based on the merits of Jesus Christ, received by faith
      alone (Romans 5:1).
2.  **A Broken Spirit:** A spirit that dwells on the dark side, that nourishes
    doubt and murmuring, actually destroys the physical vitality ("drieth the
    bones"). Despondency weakens the immune system and saps the strength needed
    to resist temptation.
3.  **Christian Physiology:** God desires His people to be whole. To cultivate
    cheerfulness is a duty we owe to God and to our own bodies (1 Corinthians
    6:19–20). Faith is a conqueror of fear and a promoter of health.

**[ILL]** Consider a plant kept in a dark, damp cellar; it becomes pale, weak,
and prone to disease. Contrast this with a plant in the sunshine; it is green,
robust, and fruitful. A cheerful, trusting heart is the sunshine of the soul,
bringing life to the whole being, while gloom is the cellar that invites decay.

### Q3. What did Job exclaim in a time of sore trouble, when well meaning friends came to him with words of reproach?

**“I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all." Job 16:2.**

**Answer:**

Job’s experience serves as a warning against a legalistic spirit in dealing with
the suffering of others.

1.  **Misunderstanding God’s Character:** Job’s friends believed that all
    suffering was a direct punishment for secret sin. They operated on a system
    of "works"—believing that if Job were truly righteous, he would be
    prosperous. They failed to understand the **Great Controversy** between
    Christ and Satan, wherein Satan often attacks the righteous to break their
    faith.
2.  **The Failure of Criticism:** Instead of offering sympathy, they offered
    theology and accusation. They poured vinegar into his wounds rather than
    oil.
3.  **True Comforters:** A true comforter does not assume the role of a judge.
    We must remember that "man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord
    looketh on the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).

**[ILL]** If a soldier is wounded on the battlefield, a "miserable comforter"
stands over him and lectures him on the tactical mistake he made to get shot. A
true friend kneels down, binds the wound, and carries him to safety. We are
called to be medics of grace, not critics of the law.

### Q4. What did he say would have been the case had their circumstances been reversed?

**“I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could
heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you: but I would strengthen
you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief." Job
16:4, 5.**

**Answer:**

Job contrasts the harshness of human nature with the law of love.

1.  **The Golden Rule:** Job expresses the spirit of the Golden Rule before
    Christ spoke it: "All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,
    do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12).
2.  **Sympathy over Judgment:** To "heap up words" is easy; to enter into
    another’s pain ("if your soul were in my soul's stead") requires the love of
    Christ. The Spirit of Christ leads us to strengthen the weak, not to crush
    them.
3.  **Assuaging Grief:** Our words should be like a soothing balm. This
    foreshadows the ministry of Jesus, who does not stand afar off, but is
    "touched with the feeling of our infirmities" (Hebrews 4:15).

**[ILL]** Two men stand on a riverbank watching a man drowning in the rapids.
One man shouts instructions and criticisms about swimming properly. The other
man throws a rope and pulls. It is easy to speak words of criticism from the
safety of the shore; it is Christlike to extend help to those in the deep waters
of affliction.

### Q5. Are not those who have suffered and been comforted of God, best able to comfort others?

**“Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation,
that we may be able to comfort them, which are in any trouble by the comfort
where- with we ourselves are comforted of God." 2 Cor. 1:3, 4.**

**Answer:**

God does not waste our suffering. He uses our trials to educate us in the school
of sympathy.

1.  **The Source of All Comfort:** All true comfort originates with the Father.
    The Holy Spirit is called the "Comforter" (John 14:16). When we receive His
    peace, we are filled with a resource to share.
2.  **Experience as Preparation:** We cannot effectively lead others where we
    have not been ourselves. Those who have passed through the fire of
    affliction and found Christ faithful are the most effective witnesses to
    those currently in the furnace.
3.  **The Cycle of Grace:** God comforts us not merely for our own ease, but to
    equip us for ministry. We are channels, not reservoirs. The grace we receive
    must flow out to others.

**[ILL]** A tour guide who has merely studied a map of a dangerous mountain can
give technical advice. But a guide who has climbed the mountain, weathered its
storms, and reached the summit can say, "Follow me, I know the way; I know where
the loose rocks are." Our trials make us experienced guides for others.

### Q6. What beautiful promise is written for the upright in heart?

**“Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart." Ps.
97:11.**

**Answer:**

This verse uses the metaphor of agriculture to describe the spiritual life.

1.  **Sowing and Reaping:** Light (truth and joy) is "sown." It may be hidden
    for a time, like a seed in dark soil, buried under trials or darkness. But
    because it is the seed of God, it must eventually spring forth into a
    harvest of gladness (Galatians 6:9).
2.  **The Condition:** The promise is for the "upright in heart." This refers to
    sincerity and surrender. God cannot plant His joy in a heart full of thorns
    (sin and worldly cares).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** The "righteous" here are not those who are
    sinless by nature, but those who have accepted the Righteousness of Christ.
    When we are right with God, joy is the natural fruit. "The work of
    righteousness shall be peace" (Isaiah 32:17).

**[ILL]** In the dead of winter, the fields look barren and cold. Yet, the
farmer knows the seed is there. He waits with patience. The Christian may go
through a "winter" of difficulty, but if the seed of faith is in the heart, the
"springtime" of gladness is guaranteed by God's promise.

### Q7. What should be the language of the heart that has experienced help from God?

**“Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou has put off my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness." Ps. 30:11.**

**Answer:**

This is the testimony of the born-again believer who realizes what God has done
for them.

1.  **Divine Transformation:** The text highlights God's action: _Thou_ hast
    turned; _Thou_ hast put off; _Thou_ hast girded. Conversion is the work of
    God, not the work of man.
2.  **Change of Raiment:** Sackcloth represents our own sorrow, sin, and
    attempts at penance. Gladness is the garment God provides.
    - _Sanctuary Connection:_ This mirrors Zechariah 3, where Joshua the High
      Priest (representing the sinner) stands in filthy garments. The command is
      given, "Take away the filthy garments from him... I will clothe thee with
      change of raiment" (Zechariah 3:4).
3.  **Gratitude:** The natural response to this exchange is praise. A gloomy
    Christian misrepresents the character of the God who saves.

**[ILL]** Imagine a beggar dressed in rags, invited to a royal banquet. The King
meets him at the door, removes the rags, and places a royal purple robe upon his
shoulders. It would be ungrateful for the beggar to sit at the table weeping
over his old rags. He should rejoice in the King’s gift.

### Q8. What should be the spirit of our service toward God?

**“Serve the Lord with gladness: come before His presence with singing." Ps.
100:2.**

**Answer:**

God desires service born of love, not forced labor.

1.  **Service and Liberty:** The Old Covenant of "do and live" breeds bondage
    and fear. The New Covenant, where God writes His law in the heart (Hebrews
    8:10), breeds liberty and gladness. We serve not _to be_ saved, but _because
    we are_ saved.
2.  **The Atmosphere of Heaven:** Heaven is a place of song and joy. When we
    serve God with gladness on earth, we are practicing the manners of our
    future home.
3.  **A Witness to the World:** A complaining, sour-faced Christian drives
    people away from the truth. A joyful servant makes the Master attractive.

**[ILL]** There is a vast difference between a slave who works in the field
because he fears the whip, and a son who works in the field because he loves his
father and wants to share in the harvest. God calls us sons and daughters, not
slaves.

### Q9. Mention a special cause for good cheer.

**“Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee." Matt. 9:2. "Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered." Rom. 4:7**

**Answer:**

The foundation of all true happiness is the assurance of salvation.

1.  **The Root of Sorrow:** The deepest cause of human unhappiness is the
    separation from God caused by sin (Isaiah 59:2). Guilt is a cancer to the
    soul.
2.  **The Cure:** Jesus speaks the words of **Justification**. He removes the
    guilt of the past.
    - _Definition:_ **Atonement:** The reconciliation of God and man through the
      sacrifice of Jesus. It means the barrier is removed.
3.  **Blessedness:** Paul quotes David (Rom 4:7) to show that true "blessedness"
    (happiness) comes not from wealth or health, but from knowing one's record
    in heaven is clean. The "covering" is the blood of Christ and His spotless
    righteousness.

**[ILL]** A man on death row may be given a delicious meal or a comfortable bed,
but he cannot be cheerful because execution awaits. But if the Governor sends a
full pardon, the man can be cheerful even on a hard cot and with bread and
water. Forgiveness changes everything.

### Q10. For what does Isaiah say he will greatly rejoice?

**“I will greatly rejoice in the Lord. My soul shall be joyful in my God; for He
hath clothed me with the garments of salvation; He hath covered me with the robe
of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride
adorneth herself with her jewels." Isa. 61:10.**

**Answer:**

This is one of the most glorious texts on **Righteousness by Faith** in all of
Scripture.

1.  **The Robe of Righteousness:** We have no righteousness of our own; our best
    works are as "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6). Christ provides what the law
    demands.
    - **Imputed Righteousness:** This is our title to heaven. It is Christ’s
      perfect life credited to our account. We are covered.
    - **Imparted Righteousness:** As we wear the robe, we are fitted for heaven.
      The Holy Spirit works within us to bring our character into harmony with
      the robe we wear. This is **Sanctification**.
    - _Definition:_ **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which
      the believer is made holy in character and life, empowered to obey God’s
      law (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
2.  **The Wedding Garment:** The imagery of the bride and bridegroom points to
    the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-9). The "garment" is the
    condition for entry (Matthew 22:11–12).
3.  **Joy in the Giver:** We do not rejoice in our own attainments, but "in the
    Lord." Our confidence is entirely in what He has done for us and in us.

**[ILL]** If a coal miner comes out of the pit, covered in black dust, he cannot
clean himself enough to enter a sterile operating room. He needs to be washed
and given a sterile gown by the doctor. We are the miner; Christ is the
physician who washes us and clothes us in His own purity.

### Q11. Should the Christian be joyful in God under adverse and trying circumstances?

**“Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from
their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the
Son of man's sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy; for behold, your
reward is great in heaven." Luke 6:22, 23.**

**Answer:**

Christian joy is independent of circumstances; it is based on our standing in
Christ.

1.  **The Badge of Discipleship:** Persecution and reproach are often the
    trademarks of God’s true people. "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus
    shall suffer persecution" (2 Timothy 3:12). Being treated like Jesus is an
    honor.
2.  **Separation:** The text speaks of being "separated" from company. As we
    approach the end of time, fidelity to God's law (specifically the Sabbath)
    may lead to social ostracism. We are to rejoice that our names, though cast
    out on earth, are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.
3.  **Future Focus:** Our joy is anchored in the "reward" (the inheritance) that
    is kept safe in heaven. The trials of this life are "light affliction"
    compared to the "eternal weight of glory" (2 Corinthians 4:17).

**[ILL]** Travelers on a stormy sea may be tossed about, but if they know their
ship is unsinkable and the harbor is near, they do not panic. They rejoice in
the certainty of their arrival despite the waves.

### Q12. What does the Saviour say to us?

**“These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the
world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the
world." John 16:33.**

**Answer:**

Christ gives us the secret of peace amidst conflict.

1.  **Two Realms:** "In the world" there is tribulation; "in Me" there is peace.
    The Christian lives in both realms simultaneously. Our bodies are in the
    world, but our faith is hid with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3).
2.  **The Victorious Captain:** Jesus says, "I have overcome." He met Satan on
    the battlefield of appetite (in the wilderness) and presumption, and finally
    at the cross, and He emerged the Victor.
3.  **Our Victory:** Because He overcame, we can overcome. "This is the victory
    that overcometh the world, even our faith" (1 John 5:4). We do not fight
    _for_ victory, but _from_ His victory.

**[ILL]** During a war, if the General defeats the enemy's main army, the
soldiers in the trenches can cheer even while skirmishes continue. They know the
war is essentially won. Christ has defeated Satan; we are simply holding the
ground He has won until He returns.

---

### Q13. What special cause for encouragement is given us by virtue of Christ's victory over the world?

**“To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I
also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne." Rev. 3:21.**

**Answer:**

This promise is the climax of the messages to the seven churches, specifically
addressed to Laodicea (the last church era).

1.  **The Call to Overcome:** Salvation is not for those who stay in their sins,
    but for those who are delivered _from_ them. Through the power of the
    indwelling Spirit, the believer is to overcome "even as I [Jesus] also
    overcame." This implies victory over sin is possible through divine grace.
2.  **Sanctuary Context:** Christ is currently on the Father's throne
    interceding. He invites us to join Him in His future reign. This points to
    the close of the **Investigative Judgment**, when the work of separating sin
    from the sinner is complete.
3.  **The High Destiny of Man:** God intends to restore humanity to a position
    higher than the angels—to sit on the throne with Christ. This incredible
    hope should cheer us in the darkest hour of struggle against temptation.

**[ILL]** A prince who is being trained to rule may undergo strict discipline
and hard lessons. But the promise of the crown and the responsibility of the
kingdom keeps him focused and encouraged. We are heirs of the King, in training
for our coronation.

---

### Q14. How constant should the Christian's rejoicing be?

**“Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice." Phil. 4:4.**

**Answer:**

The command is absolute and continuous.

1.  **Always:** Not just when things go well. Paul wrote these words from a
    prison cell in Rome. His joy was not in his freedom, but "in the Lord."
2.  **A Safeguard:** Rejoicing is a protection against temptation. A heart
    filled with the praise of God has little room for the complaints and doubts
    that Satan suggests. "The joy of the Lord is your strength" (Nehemiah 8:10).
3.  **The Fruit of the Spirit:** Joy is second only to love in the list of the
    Spirit's fruits (Galatians 5:22). It is the evidence that the Kingdom of God
    is established within the heart.

**[ILL]** The sun is always shining. Sometimes clouds come between us and the
sun, and we see shadows. But above the clouds, the sun never stops shining.
Faith allows the Christian to fly like an eagle above the clouds of circumstance
and live in the constant sunshine of God’s love.
