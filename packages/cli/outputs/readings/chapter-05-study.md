# Reading 5: Christ in All the Bible

## Introduction

The Bible is not merely a collection of ancient writings, moral teachings, or historical records—it is, from Genesis to Revelation, the revelation of one Person: Jesus Christ. Every page, whether we recognize it or not, testifies of Him. To miss Christ in Scripture is to miss the very heart of God's message to humanity. This study explores how the entire Bible—Old and New Testaments alike—centers upon the promised Redeemer, His life, death, resurrection, and coming kingdom.

## Core Truths

### The Scriptures Testify of Christ

Jesus Himself declared the purpose of all Scripture:

> _"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me."_ (John 5:39)

The Jews diligently studied the sacred writings, believing eternal life could be found in them. Yet Jesus revealed a startling truth: the Scriptures are not an end in themselves—they are a means to find _Him_. Every prophecy, every type, every narrative ultimately points to Christ.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "search" (_eraunaō_) means to examine closely, to investigate thoroughly—like a miner searching for precious ore. Jesus commands us to dig deep into Scripture, for there we discover the treasure of all treasures: Himself.

Philip understood this when he found Nathanael:

> _"We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."_ (John 1:45)

Moses, the prophets, the Psalms—all wrote of One who was to come. The entire Old Testament was a preparation for, and prophecy of, the Messiah.

### Christ Expounded in All the Scriptures

After His resurrection, Jesus walked with two disciples on the road to Emmaus. They were confused and sorrowful, unable to understand how their Master could have died. Notice His response:

> _"O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself."_ (Luke 24:25-27)

What a Bible study that must have been! Christ Himself, the Living Word, opened the written Word, showing how every part of Scripture—from Genesis through Malachi—spoke of Him.

[Q] **"But how can the Old Testament be about Christ when it was written centuries before He was born?"**

This is precisely the marvel of divine revelation. God, who sees the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10), inspired prophets to write of events they did not fully understand. Peter tells us the prophets _"searched diligently"_ concerning _"the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow"_ (1 Peter 1:10-11). The Holy Spirit revealed Christ to them, and they recorded what they saw—even when the full meaning remained veiled until Christ came.

## Deeper Truths

### The Scarlet Thread from Eden to Eternity

The first promise of redemption appears immediately after sin entered:

> _"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."_ (Genesis 3:15)

Here, in Eden's shadow, God promised that the "seed of the woman" would crush the serpent's head, though suffering a wound in the process. This is the _protevangelium_—the first gospel. Every subsequent revelation of Christ builds upon this foundation.

**The Promise to Abraham:**

> _"In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."_ (Genesis 22:18)

Paul explains who this "seed" is:

> _"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."_ (Galatians 3:16)

From one man's family, blessing would flow to all nations—through Christ, the true Seed of Abraham.

[ILL] Consider a river that begins as a small spring in the mountains. At first, it is barely a trickle, easily overlooked. But as it flows, other streams join it, and it grows wider and deeper until it becomes a mighty river that waters nations. So the revelation of Christ begins with a single promise in Eden—almost hidden among the thorns of the curse—yet it gathers strength through Abraham, Moses, David, and the prophets until it bursts forth in the fullness of time when _"God sent forth His Son, made of a woman"_ (Galatians 4:4).

### Christ in Israel's Wilderness Journey

God did not leave His people without a Saviour, even in the wilderness:

> _"Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared."_ (Exodus 23:20)

This was no ordinary angel. Paul reveals His identity:

> _"For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."_ (1 Corinthians 10:4)

The Rock that gave water, the Manna from heaven, the Pillar of cloud and fire—all were manifestations of Christ, the _"I AM"_ who led Israel through the desert. Long before Bethlehem, the pre-incarnate Son of God walked with His people.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "Angel" (_malak_) means "messenger." When Scripture speaks of "the Angel of the LORD" who bears the divine name and receives worship (Exodus 3:2-6; Joshua 5:13-15), this is understood to be the Son of God appearing before His incarnation—what theologians call a "Christophany."

### Prophecies of Christ's Life, Death, and Resurrection

The Old Testament provides astonishing detail about the Messiah's life:

**His Birthplace:**

> _"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be Ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting."_ (Micah 5:2)

Notice: the One born in Bethlehem would be _from everlasting_—not a mere man, but the eternal God made flesh.

**His Suffering and Death:**

Isaiah 53 stands as one of the most remarkable chapters in all Scripture—a detailed portrait of the suffering Messiah written 700 years before Christ:

- _"He is despised and rejected of men"_ (v. 3)
- _"Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows"_ (v. 4)
- _"He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities"_ (v. 5)
- _"He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter"_ (v. 7)
- _"He made His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death"_ (v. 9)

**The Price of Betrayal:**

> _"So they weighed for My price thirty pieces of silver."_ (Zechariah 11:12)

Precisely the sum Judas received for betraying his Master (Matthew 26:15).

**His Dying Words:**

One thousand years before Calvary, David wrote:

> _"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?"_ (Psalm 22:1)

> _"Into Thy hands I commit My spirit."_ (Psalm 31:5)

These very words fell from Jesus' lips as He hung upon the cross (Matthew 27:46; Luke 23:46). The Psalms recorded Christ's agony before it occurred.

**His Resurrection:**

> _"For Thou wilt not leave My soul in hell; neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption."_ (Psalm 16:10)

Peter applied this directly to Christ's resurrection: the Holy One would not remain in the grave nor experience decay (Acts 2:25-31).

[Q] **"Couldn't Jesus have simply arranged His life to fulfill these prophecies?"**

Some prophecies—like His birthplace, the method of execution (crucifixion was a Roman, not Jewish, practice), and the specific words of His enemies—were entirely beyond His control. Moreover, the sheer number and specificity of Messianic prophecies make coincidence mathematically impossible. One scholar calculated the probability of any one person fulfilling just eight major prophecies as 1 in 10^17 (one hundred quadrillion). Jesus fulfilled over 300 prophecies. Only divine foreknowledge can explain this.

### Christ's Kingdom and Second Coming

Daniel was shown the Messiah receiving His everlasting kingdom:

> _"One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days... And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away."_ (Daniel 7:13-14)

This prophecy has two applications: Christ's ascension to the Father's right hand (Acts 1:9; Hebrews 1:3) and His ultimate coronation when every knee shall bow (Philippians 2:10-11).

The Psalms also describe His return in glory:

> _"Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him."_ (Psalm 50:3-4)

> _"For He cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall He judge the world, and the people with equity."_ (Psalm 98:9)

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Christ as the Center of the Great Controversy

The battle between Christ and Satan began before this earth existed, but it has always centered on the Person and work of Christ. Satan's strategy throughout history has been to obscure, distort, or deny the truth about the Redeemer. When Scripture testifies of Christ—His deity, His sacrifice, His righteousness, His ministry—it exposes Satan's lies and reveals the character of God.

The serpent's head was bruised at Calvary (Genesis 3:15), yet the full crushing awaits the final judgment. Every Old Testament type and prophecy pointed forward to the cross; every New Testament teaching points back to it and forward to His coming kingdom.

### Christ in the Sanctuary

The entire sanctuary service testified of Christ:

- The **sacrificial lamb** represented _"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world"_ (John 1:29)
- The **high priest** foreshadowed Christ, our _"great high priest, that is passed into the heavens"_ (Hebrews 4:14)
- The **bread** on the table symbolized Christ, the _"bread of life"_ (John 6:35)
- The **light** of the candlestick represented Christ, _"the light of the world"_ (John 8:12)
- The **incense** ascending pictured Christ's intercession (Hebrews 7:25; Revelation 8:3-4)
- The **Most Holy Place** pointed to Christ's final work of atonement in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 9:11-12, 24)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "atonement" (_kaphar_) means "to cover" or "to reconcile." Every Day of Atonement service pointed forward to Christ's complete work of removing sin—not merely covering it, but blotting it out forever (Hebrews 9:26; Acts 3:19).

### Righteousness by Faith Throughout Scripture

From Genesis to Revelation, salvation has always been by grace through faith in the promised Redeemer:

- **Abel** offered a lamb _by faith_ (Hebrews 11:4; Genesis 4:4)
- **Abraham** _"believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness"_ (Romans 4:3; Genesis 15:6)
- **Moses** esteemed _"the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt"_ (Hebrews 11:26)

The Old Testament saints were saved by looking _forward_ to Christ; we are saved by looking _back_ to the same Saviour. The method has always been faith, and the object has always been Christ.

## Practical Application

Understanding that Christ fills all Scripture transforms how we read the Bible:

1. **Read expectantly.** In every chapter, ask: "Where is Christ here? What does this passage reveal about my Redeemer?"

2. **Study systematically.** Don't skip the Old Testament. The types, prophecies, and histories are rich with Christ—waiting to be discovered.

3. **Trust confidently.** The fulfilled prophecies of Scripture prove that God keeps His word. What He has promised regarding Christ's return and our salvation is as certain as what He has already accomplished.

4. **Share eagerly.** Like Philip, who found Nathanael with the joyful news, _"We have found Him!"_—share the Christ you have discovered in Scripture with others.

5. **Surrender completely.** The purpose of finding Christ in Scripture is not merely intellectual knowledge but personal relationship. Every truth about Christ calls us to deeper trust, fuller obedience, and complete surrender to Him.

[ILL] An art student once spent weeks studying a master painting, analyzing brush strokes, color composition, and historical context. But one day, the artist himself entered the gallery. Immediately, the student forgot his notes—he wanted only to know the master personally. So it should be with our Bible study. The Scripture is precious, but its ultimate purpose is to bring us face to face with Christ Himself.

## Appeal

> _"In the volume of the book it is written of Me."_ (Psalm 40:7; Hebrews 10:7)

Christ is the theme of all Scripture—its beginning, its center, and its glorious end. He is the Seed of the woman, the Angel of the covenant, the suffering Servant, the risen Lord, the coming King. The same Jesus who walked the Emmaus road longs to open His Word to you today, revealing Himself in every page.

Will you commit to searching the Scriptures with new eyes—seeking not merely information, but _Him_? Will you allow the Holy Spirit to show you Christ in all the Bible, until your heart burns within you as did those disciples of old? (Luke 24:32)

The Scriptures testify of Christ. May we, having found Him, never cease to seek Him more.
