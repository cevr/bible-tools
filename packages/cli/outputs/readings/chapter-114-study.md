# Reading 114: The Rich Man and Lazarus

## Introduction

The parable of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19–31 is one of the most misunderstood passages in Scripture, often used to teach that the dead are conscious and that punishment begins immediately at death. Yet when we let Scripture interpret Scripture, a far different picture emerges—one that harmonizes perfectly with the Bible's consistent teaching on death, judgment, and resurrection. Understanding this parable correctly reveals Christ's masterful use of figurative language to teach profound spiritual truths about hearing God's Word while opportunity remains.

## Core Truths

### The Parable's Setting and Characters

Christ presents two men whose earthly lives stand in stark contrast:

> _"There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores."_ (Luke 16:19–20)

The rich man lived in luxury while Lazarus suffered at his very doorstep, longing for crumbs from his table. Both men died—Lazarus "was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom," while the rich man was "buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments" (Luke 16:22–23).

[DYK🔎] The phrase "Abraham's bosom" was a Jewish expression meaning to be in close fellowship with Abraham—like reclining next to a dear friend at a feast. It was never meant literally, as Abraham's physical bosom could hardly contain all the righteous dead!

### The Rich Man's Requests

From his place of torment, the rich man made two requests:

1. **For himself**: _"Send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."_ (Luke 16:24)

2. **For his brothers**: _"I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment."_ (Luke 16:27–28)

Abraham's response to the second request reveals the parable's central lesson:

> _"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them... If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."_ (Luke 16:29, 31)

## Deeper Truths

### Evidence That This Is Figurative, Not Literal

Several elements in this parable demonstrate that Christ was using vivid imagery—not describing literal afterlife conditions:

**1. The Rich Man's Own Words Reveal Lazarus Was Dead**

When pleading for his brothers, the rich man said: _"If one went unto them **from the dead**, they will repent"_ (Luke 16:30). Abraham replied: _"Neither will they be persuaded, though one **rose from the dead**"_ (Luke 16:31).

Both speakers understood that Lazarus would need to **rise from the dead** to carry out this mission. This proves Lazarus was not alive and conscious in heaven but was dead in the grave.

**2. Physical Bodies in a Spirit Realm?**

The parable describes physical realities: tongues, fingers, water, flames, eyes. If this were literal, the dead would possess physical bodies in the intermediate state—contradicting Scripture's teaching that the resurrection body is received at Christ's coming (1 Corinthians 15:51–54).

**3. Conversation Across an Impassable Gulf?**

The rich man and Abraham carry on detailed conversation across a "great gulf fixed" (Luke 16:26). Would heaven truly be a place where the saved must hear the agonized cries of the lost for eternity?

[Q] **"But doesn't this parable prove the dead are conscious?"**

If taken literally, this parable would contradict numerous plain scriptures. Solomon declared: _"The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing"_ (Ecclesiastes 9:5). The psalmist wrote: _"The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence"_ (Psalm 115:17). David said: _"In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?"_ (Psalm 6:5). Christ Himself called death a "sleep" (John 11:11–14). We must interpret one difficult passage by many clear ones—not overturn clear teaching with a parable.

### The Literary Device: Personification

Christ used a well-known rhetorical figure called **personification**—representing inanimate things or future events as though they were present and animated. This was common in Scripture:

> _"For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it."_ (Habakkuk 2:11)

> _"The trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us."_ (Judges 9:10)

> _"The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."_ (Genesis 4:10)

> _"Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth."_ (James 5:4)

In none of these cases do we believe stones literally speak or blood has a voice. Similarly, Christ represented future realities—judgment and reward—as though already occurring, to teach His lesson more vividly.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "hell" in verse 23 is "Hades," meaning simply the grave or realm of the dead—not a place of fiery punishment. The actual lake of fire ("Gehenna") does not come until after the final judgment (Revelation 20:14–15).

### God Speaks of Future Things as Present

Paul reveals this principle directly:

> _"God, who quickeneth the dead, and **calleth those things which be not as though they were**."_ (Romans 4:17)

God frequently speaks of future events in present tense because, to His omniscient mind, they are as certain as if already accomplished. Christ used this same method in His parable.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### When Does Punishment Actually Occur?

Scripture is abundantly clear that judgment and punishment come **after** Christ's return—not at death:

> _"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to **reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished**."_ (2 Peter 2:9)

> _"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead **at his appearing and his kingdom**."_ (2 Timothy 4:1)

> _"Thou shalt be recompensed **at the resurrection of the just**."_ (Luke 14:14)

> _"And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall **gather together his elect**."_ (Matthew 24:31)

[ILL] Consider a courtroom. A prisoner awaiting trial is not punished before the verdict is rendered. He may be confined, but his sentence is determined only after evidence is heard and judgment pronounced. So the dead "sleep" in their graves, awaiting the great tribunal of God. Only after the judgment will sentences be executed—life eternal for the righteous, destruction for the wicked (Revelation 20:11–15).

### The Sanctuary Connection

The sanctuary service illuminates this truth beautifully. In the earthly sanctuary, the final disposition of sin occurred only on the Day of Atonement—after the daily services had transpired throughout the year. The High Priest entered the Most Holy Place to complete the work of atonement and cleansing.

So in the heavenly sanctuary, Christ ministers as our High Priest. The investigative judgment (Daniel 7:9–10; Revelation 14:7) determines the eternal destiny of all who have professed faith. Only after this judgment is complete—at Christ's second coming—do the righteous receive their reward and the wicked their punishment. No one is rewarded or punished prematurely; God's government operates with perfect justice and transparency before the universe.

### The Real Lesson: Hear God's Word Now

The parable's central message is profoundly practical: **The Scriptures are sufficient to bring men to repentance.**

> _"Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."_ (Luke 16:29)

The rich man believed a miracle—someone returning from the dead—would convert his brothers. But Abraham declared that if men reject Scripture, even a resurrection will not persuade them.

[DYK🔎] This very prophecy was fulfilled! Shortly after Christ spoke this parable, He raised another man named Lazarus from the dead (John 11). What was the result? The religious leaders sought to kill both Jesus **and** Lazarus (John 12:10)! And when Christ Himself rose from the dead, the chief priests bribed the soldiers to spread a lie (Matthew 28:11–15). Miracles do not convert hearts that refuse the plain testimony of Scripture.

## Practical Application

### Privilege and Responsibility

The rich man's sin was not merely his wealth but his **neglect**. Lazarus lay at his very gate, yet the rich man did nothing. We who have received abundant light from God's Word bear solemn responsibility to share it and to care for those in need around us.

**Questions for self-examination:**

- Do I truly value Scripture as sufficient for salvation and holy living?
- Am I waiting for some spectacular sign before fully surrendering to God?
- Who is "at my gate"—in need of practical help or the gospel message?

### The Sufficiency of Scripture

We live in an age fascinated with the supernatural—near-death experiences, spiritualism, messages supposedly from the departed. Yet God declares that His Word is sufficient. Moses and the prophets, fulfilled in Christ and expounded by the apostles, contain everything necessary for salvation.

> _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."_ (Isaiah 8:20)

[Q] **"What about all the accounts of people who died, went to heaven or hell, and came back?"**

The Bible knows nothing of such experiences as genuine revelations. Scripture teaches that the dead "sleep" until the resurrection (1 Thessalonians 4:13–17; 1 Corinthians 15:51–54). Any supposed communication from the dead is not what it claims to be. Satan, who deceived Eve in Eden, continues to deceive through spiritualism in its many forms. Our safety is in clinging to Scripture alone.

### Receiving and Obeying Light

The rich man, in torment, became concerned about his brothers' salvation. But his concern came too late. Today is the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2). The light we have must be received and obeyed now, while probation lingers.

## Appeal

> _"If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."_ (Luke 16:31)

Friend, God has given you His Word—"Moses and the prophets," fulfilled in Jesus Christ. This Word is a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your path (Psalm 119:105). It reveals the way of salvation, warns of coming judgment, and invites you to eternal life.

Do not wait for some additional sign. Do not seek voices from beyond the grave. Do not postpone your decision until it is too late. The Scripture you hold in your hands is God's appointed means of grace. Hear it. Believe it. Obey it.

Christ, who truly rose from the dead, invites you today:

> _"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."_ (Matthew 11:28)

Will you answer that call—not tomorrow, but now?
