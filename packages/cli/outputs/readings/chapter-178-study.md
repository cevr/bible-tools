# Reading 178: Home of the Saved

## Introduction

God created the earth with a glorious purpose—to be the eternal dwelling place of His children. Though sin temporarily transferred dominion to Satan, God's original plan has never been abandoned. Through Christ, the rightful Heir, the "first dominion" will be restored, and the meek shall inherit a new earth where righteousness dwells forever.

## Core Truths

### God's Original Purpose for Earth

The Creator did not make our world as a temporary experiment or cosmic accident. He formed it with deliberate, eternal intention:

> _"For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth and made it; He hath established it, He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited."_ (Isaiah 45:18)

The Hebrew word translated "in vain" is _tohu_—the same word used in Genesis 1:2 for "without form." God did not create the earth to remain empty or chaotic. He made it to be a home, filled with life and joy.

**Man's intended role** was not merely to occupy the earth, but to rule it:

> _"Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet."_ (Psalm 8:6; see also Genesis 1:26)

> _"The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's: but the earth hath He given to the children of men."_ (Psalm 115:16)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "dominion" (_radah_) implies benevolent rule—the kind of shepherding care that reflects God's own governance. Adam was to be God's vice-regent, caring for creation as God Himself would.

### Dominion Lost

Something tragic intervened between God's purpose and our present reality:

> _"Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that He put all in subjection under Him, He left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him."_ (Hebrews 2:8)

The apostle acknowledges a painful truth: man does not currently exercise the dominion God intended. What happened?

> _"For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage."_ (2 Peter 2:19)

When Adam and Eve yielded to the serpent's temptation, they surrendered more than their innocence—they handed over their inheritance. The one who overcame them became their master, and the dominion of earth passed into enemy hands.

**Evidence of Satan's claim** appears in Christ's temptation:

> _"And the devil, taking Him up into an high mountain, showed unto Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto Him, All this power will I give Thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it."_ (Luke 4:5-6)

[Q] **"Was Satan lying when he claimed the kingdoms of the world?"**

This is a sobering question. If Satan's claim were entirely false, it would have been no temptation at all. Christ did not dispute Satan's temporary possession—He disputed the means by which He should reclaim it. Satan offered a shortcut around the cross; Christ chose the path of suffering and death to legally recover what Adam lost. There is a sense in which Satan, through man's fall, became "the prince of this world" (John 12:31; 14:30). But his dominion is temporary, contested, and doomed.

## Deeper Truths

### The Promise of Restoration

God never abandoned His original plan. Through the prophet Micah, He declared that the "first dominion" would return:

> _"And thou, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem."_ (Micah 4:8)

The "tower of the flock" (_Migdal Eder_) is a prophetic title pointing to Christ, the Good Shepherd who watches over His flock. To Him—and through Him to His people—the original dominion will be restored.

**How is this restoration possible?** Only through Christ's victory over sin and death:

> _"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that He by the grace of God should taste death for every man."_ (Hebrews 2:9)

Notice the contrast: "we see not yet all things put under" man (verse 8), "but we see Jesus" (verse 9). What we cannot yet see fulfilled in humanity, we can already see accomplished in Christ. He has conquered! And His victory is our victory.

[ILL] Consider a kingdom captured by a usurper. The rightful prince is born in exile, grows to manhood, and single-handedly defeats the tyrant in battle. Though the kingdom's citizens have not yet been liberated, the decisive victory has been won. The prince now holds the legal right to all that was stolen. It remains only for him to return and claim his inheritance—and all who belong to him will share in his triumph. So Christ, through His death and resurrection, has legally reclaimed earth's dominion. We await only His return to receive our inheritance with Him.

### The Inheritance of the Meek

Christ pronounced a remarkable blessing:

> _"Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth."_ (Matthew 5:5)

This promise cannot be fulfilled in the present age. The psalmist observed:

> _"For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked... Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish."_ (Psalm 73:3, 7)

In this life, the meek often have the least of earthly goods. The proud, the grasping, and the ruthless seem to possess everything. But this apparent injustice is temporary:

> _"Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it."_ (Psalm 37:34)

[DYK🔎] The word "meek" (_praus_ in Greek) does not mean weak or passive. It describes strength under control—like a powerful horse that responds to its master's gentle touch. Moses was called the meekest man on earth (Numbers 12:3), yet he led a nation, confronted Pharaoh, and interceded boldly with God. The meek are those who have surrendered their will to God's will, trusting Him to defend their cause and secure their future.

### The Abrahamic Promise

God's promise to Abraham extended far beyond a small strip of land in the Middle East:

> _"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith."_ (Romans 4:13)

Abraham was promised the world! Yet in his lifetime, he received "none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on" (Acts 7:5). He lived as a pilgrim in the very land God had promised him:

> _"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God."_ (Hebrews 11:9-10)

Abraham understood that the ultimate fulfillment lay beyond this present age. He looked for a permanent city—not tents that could be folded and moved, but foundations that would never be shaken.

**Who is the "seed" of Abraham?**

> _"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."_ (Galatians 3:16)

And who are the heirs?

> _"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."_ (Galatians 3:29)

The inheritance is not for natural Israel alone, but for all who belong to Christ by faith. The ancient worthies "received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect" (Hebrews 11:39-40). We shall all receive the inheritance together, at Christ's return.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Legal Battle for Earth's Dominion

The great controversy between Christ and Satan centers, in part, on the question of rightful dominion. Satan claims earth by conquest; Christ reclaims it by redemption.

In the sanctuary service, we see this drama portrayed. The Day of Atonement was not merely about individual forgiveness—it was about cleansing the entire sanctuary and, ultimately, the land itself from the record and presence of sin. The scapegoat (Azazel) bore away the sins of the people into the wilderness, symbolizing Satan's final responsibility for all the evil he has caused (Leviticus 16:21-22).

Christ's present ministry in the heavenly sanctuary is preparing a people to receive the inheritance. As our High Priest, He is cleansing the sanctuary record and reproducing His character in His people. When this work is complete, He will return to claim His kingdom—and His people with it.

[Q] **"If the earth will be destroyed, how can it be our inheritance?"**

Peter explains:

> _"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."_ (2 Peter 3:10)

But destruction is not the end:

> _"Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."_ (2 Peter 3:13)

The fire purifies; it does not annihilate God's purpose. Just as the flood destroyed the antediluvian world yet preserved the earth itself, so the final fire will consume sin and sinners while preparing the earth for eternal habitation. God's plan remains unchanged—the earth will be inhabited by His people forever.

### The New Earth Described

Isaiah paints a picture of conditions in the restored earth:

> _"The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, saith the Lord."_ (Isaiah 65:25)

The curse that fell upon creation because of sin will be fully lifted. The enmity, violence, and death that now characterize the natural world will give way to peace and harmony. Even the serpent—the animal Satan used to deceive Eve—will no longer be an object of fear.

> _"And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."_ (Isaiah 35:10)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "everlasting joy upon their heads" pictures a crown or garland of joy—as if happiness itself becomes a visible adornment. In the new earth, joy is not occasional or fleeting; it is the permanent atmosphere of existence.

---

### The Extent of Christ's Kingdom

> _"He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth."_ (Psalm 72:8)

> _"And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him."_ (Daniel 7:27)

The "first dominion" that Adam lost will be restored to Christ and shared with His people. This is not a spiritual metaphor or a heavenly abstraction—it is the literal, physical earth renewed, with Christ as King and the redeemed as His co-regents.

## Practical Application

### Living as Heirs Today

If we are heirs of the world, how should we live now?

1. **Hold earthly possessions loosely.** Abraham dwelt in tents, looking for a city with foundations. We are pilgrims, not permanent residents of this present evil age. Our treasure is in heaven; our heart should be there too (Matthew 6:19-21).

2. **Cultivate meekness.** The meek shall inherit the earth—not the aggressive, the grasping, or the self-promoting. Surrender your will to God's will. Trust Him to vindicate you and secure your future. Respond to injustice with patience, knowing that God will make all things right.

3. **Live by faith, not sight.** Abraham never saw the fulfillment of the promise in his lifetime. Neither may we. But faith "is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Hebrews 11:1). We walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7).

4. **Belong to Christ.** The inheritance comes through Christ alone. "If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Union with Christ is not optional—it is the condition of inheritance. Abide in Him daily through prayer, study, and surrender.

5. **Look forward with joy.** The ransomed come to Zion with songs. Even now, we can live with "everlasting joy" in our hearts, knowing that sorrow and sighing will soon flee away forever.

## Appeal

> _"Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land."_ (Psalm 37:34)

Dear friend, God has not forgotten His promise. The same word that created the heavens and the earth, the same word that called Abraham and sustained him through a lifetime of pilgrimage, the same word that raised Jesus from the dead—that word guarantees your inheritance.

Satan may claim this world now. The wicked may prosper for a moment. But the meek shall inherit the earth. The first dominion shall return. And those who belong to Christ will reign with Him forever in a world where righteousness dwells.

Will you trust Him today? Will you surrender your earthly grasping, your anxious striving, your fear of loss—and rest in the promise of an inheritance that can never fade?

Jesus Christ has already won the victory. The title deed to earth is in His nail-pierced hands. And He offers it freely to all who will receive Him.

_"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."_ (Galatians 3:29)

Come, and claim your inheritance.
