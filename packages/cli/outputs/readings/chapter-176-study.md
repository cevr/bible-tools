# Reading 176: Modern Forms of Intemperance

## Introduction

The Christian's body is not his own—it is the temple of the Holy Spirit, purchased at infinite cost by the blood of Christ. While Scripture clearly condemns drunkenness, the call to purity extends far beyond alcohol to embrace every habit that defiles body or spirit. In these last days, as God prepares a people to stand before Him without spot, the question of what we put into our bodies becomes a matter of eternal significance.

## Core Truths

### The Divine Call to Purity

Paul's simple injunction to Timothy encapsulates the Christian standard: _"Keep thyself pure"_ (1 Timothy 5:22). This is not mere outward conformity, but a comprehensive purification that reaches to the depths of one's being.

The apostle expands this principle with earnest appeal:

> _"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."_ (2 Corinthians 7:1)

Notice the completeness of this command—**all** filthiness, both of **flesh** (physical habits) and **spirit** (mental and moral defilement). The Christian who desires to be wholly the Lord's cannot pick and choose which polluting influences to abandon.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "filthiness" (_molusmos_) refers to any stain or contamination that mars the original purity of a thing. It was used of pollution that made something unfit for sacred use—a fitting description of habits that unfit us for God's service.

### The Body as God's Temple

The solemn warning of 1 Corinthians 3:17 reveals how seriously God regards the care of our bodies:

> _"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."_

Under the old covenant, severe penalties attended any who profaned the sanctuary. The Levite who approached carelessly, the priest who offered strange fire—all learned that God's holy things must be treated with reverence. How much more should we reverence our own bodies, which serve as the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit!

> _"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."_ (1 Corinthians 6:19–20)

[Q] **"But doesn't God care more about the heart than about physical habits?"**

Indeed, God looks upon the heart—but the heart and body are inseparably connected. What we do to our bodies affects our minds, our spiritual perceptions, and our capacity to commune with God. The sanctuary itself illustrates this: the outer court (the body) led to the holy place (the mind and affections), and ultimately to the Most Holy Place (the deepest communion with God). Defilement at any stage hinders access to the divine presence. Christ cleanses the whole person—body, soul, and spirit (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

## Deeper Truths

### Separation from Defilement

> _"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you."_ (2 Corinthians 6:17)

God's people are called to be distinct from the world in their habits. The promise attached to this separation is precious: **"I will receive you."** The Father longs to draw near to His children, but defilement creates a barrier. Just as the high priest could not enter the Most Holy Place while ceremonially unclean, so polluting habits hinder our access to God's fullest blessing.

### The Testimony of Science Regarding Tobacco

While Scripture gives principles, modern science confirms their wisdom. Tobacco, unknown in biblical lands, emerged from the customs of pagan peoples who had no knowledge of the true God.

[DYK🔎] When Columbus discovered Cuba in 1492, his sailors reported seeing natives "puffing smoke from their mouths and noses" and described them as "smoking like devils." This heathen practice was later adopted by European society—a stark reminder of the apostle's words about following "the will of the Gentiles" (1 Peter 4:3).

The medical testimony is overwhelming: tobacco contains nicotine, one of the most rapidly fatal poisons known. Its effects touch nearly every organ system—the blood, heart, brain, nerves, and respiratory system all suffer injury. The gardener uses tobacco oil to kill noxious insects; the Hottentot uses it to slay serpents—and yet millions introduce this same poison into bodies designed to be temples of the Holy Spirit.

[ILL] Consider a king who built a magnificent palace for his beloved son, furnishing it with every comfort and beauty. How would that father feel if the son filled the palace with smoke, stained the walls, and poisoned the air until the dwelling became uninhabitable? Our bodies are the palace God has prepared for His Spirit. When we defile them with tobacco, we show contempt for the gift and grieve the Giver.

### The Subtler Dangers: Tea, Coffee, and Stimulants

Many who would never touch alcohol or tobacco freely partake of tea and coffee, supposing these to be harmless. Yet scientific investigation reveals that these common beverages contain harmful substances that undermine health.

- **Theine** (caffeine) belongs to the same class of poisons as strychnine
- **Tannin** interferes with digestion and irritates the stomach lining
- Even "moderate" use establishes a tolerance that masks accumulating harm

[DYK🔎] Dr. Bock of Leipzig attributed much of the "nervousness and peevishness" of modern times to tea and coffee consumption. The stimulant creates artificial energy, then leaves the user depleted—leading to irritability, anxiety, and digestive complaints that "react upon the brain."

[Q] **"But I only use these things moderately. Surely that's acceptable?"**

The argument for "moderate" use of harmful substances has been used to defend every intemperate practice. Yet the essential difference between liberal and moderate use of a poison is simply that one causes great harm and the other causes less. Would we counsel a friend to take only small doses of arsenic? Total abstinence from all substances that injure the body is the only position consistent with Scripture's call to purity and with glorifying God in our bodies.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Bodily Purity

The sanctuary message illuminates why God cares so deeply about what we put into our bodies. In the earthly tabernacle:

- **The outer court** represented the body—where sacrifices were offered and cleansing took place
- **The holy place** represented the mind and character being transformed through communion with God (the bread, lamp, and incense)
- **The Most Holy Place** represented the deepest union with God, where His law resided in the ark

Just as the sanctuary had to be cleansed of all defilement for the priest to minister effectively, so our bodies must be purified for the Holy Spirit to work unhindered. The investigative judgment now proceeding in heaven's sanctuary calls for a corresponding cleansing of God's people on earth—a cleansing that includes our physical habits (Daniel 8:14; 1 John 3:3).

### Righteousness by Faith and Victory Over Appetite

The appetite is one of Satan's most powerful weapons. In Eden, he tempted Eve through appetite; in the wilderness, he tempted Christ the same way. Every victory over appetite is a testimony to the power of Christ working in human weakness.

But here is the gospel's promise: we need not fight these battles in our own strength. Christ overcame every temptation "in the likeness of sinful flesh" (Romans 8:3), and His victory is ours by faith. When we surrender our habits—even deeply entrenched ones—to Jesus, He provides supernatural power to overcome.

> _"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."_ (Philippians 4:13)

This is not legalism but love responding to love. We abandon defiling habits not to earn salvation but because we have been "bought with a price" and long to honor the One who gave everything for us.

[ILL] A man enslaved to tobacco for forty years knelt in earnest prayer, confessing his bondage and claiming Christ's promise of deliverance. Rising from his knees, he felt no miraculous removal of desire—but he had committed himself to Christ. Day by day, moment by moment, he claimed the victory, and strength was given. What seemed impossible became reality through faith. So it may be with every soul who will trust wholly in the Saviour.

### The Hope That Purifies

The apostle John connects our hope of Christ's return with personal purification:

> _"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure."_ (1 John 3:2–3)

Those who truly expect to meet Jesus will not cling to habits that defile. The coming of Christ is not a future event disconnected from present living—it is the hope that transforms us **now**. If we would be like Him when He appears, we must be growing like Him today.

## Practical Application

### Steps to Freedom

1. **Acknowledge the problem honestly** before God. Confess any enslaving habit as sin against your body-temple (1 John 1:9).

2. **Claim Christ's victory** by faith. He overcame appetite in the wilderness; His strength is available to you (Hebrews 4:15–16).

3. **Remove temptation** from your environment. Do not test your willpower by keeping harmful substances within reach (Romans 13:14).

4. **Replace harmful habits** with healthful ones. Fill the void with prayer, Scripture study, physical activity, and wholesome refreshment.

5. **Seek support** from fellow believers. Accountability strengthens resolve (Ecclesiastes 4:9–10).

6. **Trust the process**. Victory may come gradually rather than instantly, but each day of faithfulness builds strength for the next.

### Questions for Self-Examination

- Do any of my physical habits hinder my communion with God?
- Am I glorifying God in what I eat and drink?
- Would I be comfortable if Jesus returned while I was engaged in this practice?
- Am I treating my body as a purchased possession belonging to Christ?

## Appeal

Beloved, the sacred pages assure us that into the heavenly city _"there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth"_ (Revelation 21:27). The purification that must take place before we enter those gates must begin now, in this life.

Perhaps you have struggled long with habits you know displease God. Perhaps you have tried and failed many times. Take courage! The One who calls you to purity is the One who provides the power. He does not ask you to overcome in your own strength—He asks only that you surrender fully to Him and trust His working.

> _"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:24)

Today, will you bring every habit—known and unknown—to the throne of grace? Will you ask the Great Physician to cleanse you from all filthiness of flesh and spirit? He waits with tender compassion to receive you, to heal you, and to prepare you for the kingdom where nothing that defiles shall ever enter.

_"Come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you."_ (2 Corinthians 6:17)
