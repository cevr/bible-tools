# Bible Study: The Last Nation Noticed in Prophecy

## Introduction

In the unfolding drama of Bible prophecy, God has not left His people in darkness concerning the movements of nations and the rise of religious powers. Revelation 13 presents one of the most significant prophetic timelines in Scripture—tracing the succession of persecuting powers from pagan Rome through papal Rome to a new power that would arise in the last days. This prophecy reveals that the United States of America, the great experiment in civil and religious liberty, has a prophetic role to play in earth's closing scenes—a role that should cause every sincere believer to watch, pray, and understand the times.

## Core Truths

### The Dragon: Pagan Rome as Satan's Agent

The prophecy opens with a vivid symbol: _"And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and, behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads"_ (Revelation 12:3).

This dragon is explicitly identified as Satan himself (Revelation 12:9), yet the symbol also represents the earthly power through which Satan worked at the time of Christ's birth. The dragon stood ready _"to devour her child as soon as it was born"_ (Revelation 12:4).

Who sought to destroy Christ at His birth? It was Herod, acting under the authority of **pagan Rome**. The slaughter of Bethlehem's children (Matthew 2:16) was carried out by Roman-appointed power. Thus the dragon represents Satan working through the Roman Empire.

[DYK🔎] The seven heads and ten horns appear on both the dragon (Revelation 12:3) and the sea beast (Revelation 13:1), indicating a transfer of power from one to the other—a succession of persecuting authorities under Satan's direction.

### The Sea Beast: Papal Rome Receives the Dragon's Seat

_"And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy"_ (Revelation 13:1).

This beast rises from the "sea"—prophetically representing populated areas, "peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues" (Revelation 17:15). It receives something remarkable from the dragon:

_"And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority"_ (Revelation 13:2).

Here is a direct transfer of power from pagan Rome to a new entity. History records that when Emperor Constantine moved his capital from Rome to Constantinople in 330 A.D., the city of Rome was gradually surrendered to the bishop of Rome. By 538 A.D., Emperor Justinian's decree established the pope as the "head of all the churches" and "corrector of heretics"—giving the papacy both the **seat** (Rome itself) and the **authority** (civil enforcement of religious decrees).

[DYK🔎] The word "blasphemy" on the beast's heads refers not to profanity but to specific biblical definitions: claiming to forgive sins (Mark 2:7) and claiming equality with God (John 10:33)—both characteristics of the papal system's claims for the priesthood and papacy.

### The Deadly Wound and Its Healing

_"And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast"_ (Revelation 13:3).

The prophecy declared that this power which had _"led into captivity"_ and _"killed with the sword"_ would itself experience the same (Revelation 13:10). This was fulfilled precisely in 1798 when French General Berthier entered Rome, abolished the papal government, proclaimed a republic, and took Pope Pius VI captive. The pope died in exile at Valence, France, on August 28, 1799.

Yet the prophecy also foretold that the deadly wound would be **healed**—and all the world would wonder after the beast. The gradual restoration of papal prestige and influence since 1798, culminating in modern times with world leaders seeking audience with Rome, demonstrates this healing process.

[Q] **"But isn't it unfair to identify a religious system as a prophetic beast?"**

The identification is not made from prejudice but from careful comparison of prophetic specification with historical fact. We speak not against sincere Catholics—many of whom love God—but against a **system** that has claimed divine prerogatives and persecuted dissenters. Jesus Himself identified religious leaders as "whitewashed tombs" when their systems contradicted God's word (Matthew 23:27). The prophecy is God's warning to His people, not an attack on individuals.

## Deeper Truths

### The Earth Beast: A New Power Arises

At the precise moment the papal power received its deadly wound (1798), John sees a remarkable new symbol:

_"And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon"_ (Revelation 13:11).

Notice the contrasts with the sea beast:

| Sea Beast (Papal Rome)                   | Earth Beast (New Power)                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Rises from the **sea** (populated areas) | Rises from the **earth** (relatively unpopulated) |
| Has **crowns** on its horns (monarchies) | Has **no crowns** (republican government)         |
| Receives power from the dragon           | Has **lamb-like** horns (Christian principles)    |
| Is ancient                               | Is **coming up** (youthful, emerging)             |

What nation was rising to prominence in a relatively unpopulated region around 1798, with no king, founded on Christian principles?

**The United States of America.**

In 1776, the Declaration of Independence had been signed. By 1798, the Constitution and Bill of Rights were established. The nation was "coming up" with unprecedented speed—from half a million square miles and three million people to become the most powerful nation on earth.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "coming up" (_anabainon_) is the same word used for a plant growing up out of the earth. It suggests quiet, peaceful emergence—exactly how the United States arose compared to the violent conquests that established European nations.

### The Two Horns Like a Lamb

_"He had two horns like a lamb"_ (Revelation 13:11).

Horns in prophecy represent power or kingdoms (Daniel 7:24; 8:20-21). **Lamb-like** horns suggest:

- **Youthfulness** (a lamb, not a mature ram)
- **Innocence** (gentle, not aggressive)
- **Christian principles** (Christ is the Lamb of God)

What are the two great principles upon which America was founded?

1. **Civil liberty** (Republicanism—government by the people)
2. **Religious liberty** (Protestantism—no state church, freedom of conscience)

These twin principles were revolutionary. For the first time in modern history, a nation declared that government had no right to dictate religious belief or practice. The First Amendment enshrined both principles: _"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."_

[ILL] Consider two pillars supporting a great temple. Remove one, and the structure becomes unstable. Remove both, and it collapses. Civil and religious liberty are the twin pillars of American freedom. When religious liberty is compromised—when church and state unite to enforce religious observances—both pillars crumble, and tyranny enters through the ruins.

### Speaking as a Dragon

Here is the solemn warning of prophecy:

_"And he spake as a dragon"_ (Revelation 13:11).

A nation "speaks" through its laws and legislative actions. Despite its lamb-like appearance, this power will ultimately speak with the dragon's voice—the voice of persecution, coercion, and religious intolerance.

What will this power say?

_"Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live"_ (Revelation 13:14).

An **image to the beast** would be a likeness of the papal system. What was the papacy? A **union of church and state**—religious dogma enforced by civil power. An image to the beast in America would therefore be:

- Religious organizations gaining control of civil government
- Civil law enforcing religious observances
- Penalties for those who refuse to comply

[Q] **"Could America really abandon its founding principles?"**

The prophecy declares it will happen. And we already see movements in this direction—religious coalitions seeking political power, calls for "Christian nationalism," and efforts to legislate morality by civil law. The lamb-like appearance remains, but the dragon voice grows louder.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Great Controversy in Symbols

This prophecy reveals the continuous thread of the great controversy:

1. **Satan** (the dragon) works through earthly powers
2. **Pagan Rome** (dragon phase) persecuted the early church
3. **Papal Rome** (sea beast) persecuted during the Dark Ages
4. **Apostate Protestantism** (earth beast/image) will persecute in the last days

The enemy changes his agents but never his methods. In every age, he seeks to:

- Unite religious and civil power
- Enforce false worship
- Persecute God's faithful remnant

### The Sanctuary Connection

The mark of the beast controversy centers on **worship**. In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ ministers before the ark containing God's law—including the Sabbath commandment, the sign of God's creative and redemptive authority.

The sea beast claims authority to change God's law (Daniel 7:25), substituting Sunday for the biblical Sabbath. The image to the beast will enforce this counterfeit worship. Thus the final conflict is over the same issue that has been central since Eden: **Will humanity worship according to God's command or according to human tradition?**

The investigative judgment, now proceeding in heaven's Most Holy Place, is preparing a people who keep _"the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"_ (Revelation 14:12). The mark of the beast crisis will reveal who truly belongs to God and who follows human authority.

### The Mark: A Test of Loyalty

_"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads"_ (Revelation 13:16).

The mark is received either in the **forehead** (intellectual assent, genuine belief) or the **hand** (outward conformity for convenience). Economic sanctions will pressure compliance:

_"And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name"_ (Revelation 13:17).

This is the denial of citizenship rights—the power to participate in commerce and society—for those who refuse to worship according to human decree.

[DYK🔎] The forehead and hand imagery connects directly to Deuteronomy 6:8, where God commanded His law to be as "frontlets between thine eyes" and "upon thine hand." The mark of the beast is a counterfeit of God's seal—a false sign of loyalty replacing true obedience to God's commandments.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for God's People Today

1. **Understand the times.** We are living in the period when the United States is transitioning from lamb-like to dragon-like. Current events should be watched prayerfully in light of prophecy.

2. **Appreciate religious liberty while we have it.** Freedom to worship according to conscience is a precious gift. Use this time to study, grow, and share the three angels' messages.

3. **Do not trust in human governments.** Even the best nations are prophesied to fail. Our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20).

4. **Prepare spiritually, not physically.** The preparation needed is not stockpiling supplies but building a character that cannot be shaken. Those who do not have victory over sin now will not stand in the crisis.

5. **Share the warning with love.** Like the Advent message itself, this prophecy must be proclaimed—not with harshness, but with earnest love for souls who need to understand what is coming.

[ILL] A lighthouse keeper does not apologize for shining the light toward dangerous rocks. His warning may seem alarming to those sailing carelessly, but it is motivated by genuine concern for their safety. So God's prophetic warnings are not given to frighten but to prepare. The rocks are real; the danger is certain. Blessed are those who heed the light.

### The Only Safe Position

_"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"_ (Revelation 14:12).

In the final crisis, two things will mark God's people:

1. **The commandments of God**—including the fourth, the Sabbath
2. **The faith of Jesus**—not merely faith _in_ Jesus, but the faith _of_ Jesus—His own faith living in the believer, enabling obedience from the heart

This is righteousness by faith in its practical reality. We cannot keep God's commandments by human effort. We cannot stand in the coming storm by our own strength. But Christ living in us, His righteousness both imputed and imparted, will enable His people to stand when all the world wonders after the beast.

## Appeal

_"And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues"_ (Revelation 18:4).

God has people in every denomination, in every nation, who love Him and seek to follow truth as they understand it. The prophecies of Revelation 13 are not given to condemn but to warn—to call honest hearts out of confusion and into the clear light of God's last message.

Dear friend, where do you stand? The image to the beast is forming. The dragon voice grows louder. But God still offers sanctuary in Christ. The Lamb who was slain still intercedes for you in heaven's Most Holy Place. His blood still cleanses. His Spirit still transforms.

Will you be among those who receive the seal of God—His law written in the heart, His Sabbath kept in loving obedience? Or will you drift with the current of popular religion toward the mark of the beast?

The choice is yours. But the time to choose is now. Tomorrow may find the door of mercy closed.

_"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches"_ (Revelation 2:29).
