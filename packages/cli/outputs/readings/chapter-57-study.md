# Bible Study: Our Lord's Great Prophecy

## Introduction

Jesus Christ, on the eve of His supreme sacrifice, spoke words of tender assurance to His troubled disciples: "I will come again" (John 14:3). This promise forms the golden thread running through all of Scripture's prophetic declarations. Yet our Lord did not leave His followers without landmarks by which to know when that glorious return draws near. In Matthew 24, He gave us a prophetic roadmap—signs in the heavens and on earth that would herald His coming. These signs have now been fulfilled in history, and we stand today in the generation that shall witness the consummation of all things.

## Core Truths

### The Certainty of Christ's Return

The promise of Christ's second coming rests not on speculation but on the word of our Saviour Himself:

> _"In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."_ (John 14:2, 3)

This is not a vague hope but a definite appointment. Jesus spoke these words to comfort hearts that would soon be pierced with grief at His crucifixion. The same lips that said, "It is finished" on Calvary, declared, "I will come again." Both promises are equally certain.

**Justification**: God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ's merits (Romans 3:24; 5:1).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "mansions" (_monai_) literally means "dwelling places" or "abiding rooms." Jesus uses the same root word in John 15:4 when He invites us to "abide" in Him. Heaven is not merely a destination—it is an eternal abiding with our Lord.

### The Disciples' Questions

When Christ foretold the destruction of Jerusalem's magnificent temple—so glorious that its stones gleamed white and gold in the sunlight—the disciples were astonished. Privately, they asked Him a threefold question:

> _"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?"_ (Matthew 24:3)

In His answer, Jesus blended prophecies concerning:

1. **The destruction of Jerusalem** (fulfilled in A.D. 70)
2. **The signs preceding His second advent**
3. **The end of the world**

This interweaving is characteristic of Bible prophecy, where near and distant events often appear together, like mountain peaks seen from a distance that seem close together but are actually separated by great valleys.

### The "Not Yet" of History

Jesus warned against premature excitement:

> _"Ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet."_ (Matthew 24:6)

Wars, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes are described as "the beginning of sorrows" (Matthew 24:8)—not the end itself, but birth pangs signaling that a new age is coming. The Greek word for "sorrows" (_ōdinōn_) is the same word used for labor pains. Just as a mother's pains intensify as delivery approaches, so these calamities increase in frequency and severity as the end draws near.

[Q] **"Haven't there always been wars and earthquakes? How can these be signs?"**

Indeed, such troubles have marked every age. But Jesus said these would be "the _beginning_ of sorrows"—implying an intensification. History confirms that the past two centuries have witnessed wars of unprecedented scale (two World Wars), famines affecting hundreds of millions, pestilences like the 1918 influenza pandemic, and earthquakes recorded with increasing frequency as monitoring technology has improved. The point is not that such events are new, but that they converge and intensify as the end approaches.

## Deeper Truths

### The Gospel to All the World

Before the end, one great work must be accomplished:

> _"And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come."_ (Matthew 24:14)

Notice carefully: the gospel is to be preached "for a witness"—not necessarily to convert every soul, but to give every nation an opportunity to hear and respond. This is the great unfinished work of the church.

[DYK🔎] The quotation from the _Christian Union_ (1878) is remarkable: even 150 years ago, observers recognized that the gospel was reaching the last strongholds of the unevangelized world. Today, through print, radio, television, and the internet, the message is penetrating regions once thought unreachable. Translation projects now aim to provide Scripture in every living language.

**Sanctification**: The ongoing work of God making the believer holy in character and life (1 Thessalonians 4:3; Hebrews 10:14–16).

This worldwide proclamation is not merely a human effort but the work of Christ through His people. As we surrender daily to His sanctifying grace, we become channels through which the gospel flows to others.

### The Abomination of Desolation and the Great Tribulation

Jesus directed His hearers to Daniel's prophecy:

> _"When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand)."_ (Matthew 24:15)

Luke's parallel passage clarifies this: "When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh" (Luke 21:20). This was fulfilled when Roman armies surrounded Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Christians who heeded Christ's warning fled to Pella and were preserved.

But the "great tribulation" that followed extended far beyond Jerusalem:

> _"For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be."_ (Matthew 24:21)

### The 1,260 Years of Papal Supremacy

Daniel's prophecy foretold that a persecuting power would "wear out the saints of the Most High" for "a time and times and the dividing of time" (Daniel 7:25). Revelation 12:6 interprets this as 1,260 days. Applying the prophetic principle of "each day for a year" (Ezekiel 4:6), we arrive at 1,260 literal years.

**Historicist interpretation**: The method of prophetic interpretation that sees prophecy fulfilled progressively through history, rather than entirely in the past (preterism) or entirely in the future (futurism).

This period of papal supremacy began in A.D. 538, when the last of the three Arian kingdoms opposing Rome fell, and the emperor Justinian's decree establishing the pope as "head of all the holy churches" could be fully enforced. It ended in 1798, when General Berthier of Napoleon's army took Pope Pius VI captive, and the papal government received a "deadly wound" (Revelation 13:3).

[ILL] Consider a traveler walking through a long, dark tunnel. For miles, there is no light—only the oppressive darkness of stone walls on every side. But at last, a faint glimmer appears ahead. The tunnel is ending. So it was for God's faithful people during the long centuries of persecution. The darkness seemed endless. But God had marked its limit: 1,260 years. And in His mercy, He shortened even those days, "for the elect's sake" (Matthew 24:22).

[DYK🔎] The Jesuit order, founded by Ignatius Loyola in 1540, became the chief instrument of persecution against Protestants. Yet even this order was dissolved by papal decree in 1773—twenty-five years before the prophetic period ended. From that point, open persecution of the saints ceased. God's word was exact: the tribulation ended "in those days," before 1798 (Mark 13:24).

## The Signs in the Heavens

Jesus declared that signs in the sun, moon, and stars would mark the approach of His coming:

> _"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven."_ (Matthew 24:29)

Mark's account specifies: "In those days, _after_ that tribulation" (Mark 13:24). This means the signs would occur within the 1,260-year period (before 1798), but after the persecution had ceased (after 1773). Let us examine the historical record.

### The Dark Day: May 19, 1780

Between 1773 and 1798, the sun was indeed darkened in a most remarkable manner:

> "The 19th day of May, 1780, was a remarkably dark day. Candles were lighted in many houses. The birds were silent, and disappeared. The fowls retired to roost. It was the general opinion that the day of judgment was at hand."—President Dwight, _Connecticut Historical Collections_

The darkness began about 10 a.m. and continued through the day. It was not an eclipse (the moon was full the day before). It was not caused by clouds (the sky was clear in many places). Scientists have proposed various explanations—forest fires, atmospheric phenomena—but none fully account for the extent and nature of the darkness.

> "The true cause of this remarkable phenomenon is not known."—Webster's Unabridged Dictionary

[Q] **"Why was this sign limited to New England? Shouldn't a sign of Christ's coming be worldwide?"**

God distributes His signs according to His wisdom. The Old World witnessed the rise and fall of prophetic kingdoms, the papal captivity of 1798, and the gathering of nations for Armageddon. The New World witnessed the Dark Day and the falling of the stars. Should those in one hemisphere reject the testimony of those in another? The Jews did not all witness Christ's miracles, yet they were accountable for the testimony given. Similarly, we are responsible for the evidence God has provided, wherever it has been manifested.

### The Dark Night: May 19–20, 1780

The night following the Dark Day was equally supernatural:

> "The night succeeding that day was of such pitchy darkness that in some instances horses could not be compelled to leave the stable when wanted for service."—Stone's _History of Beverly, Mass._

The moon had been full the previous night, yet it gave no light. Truly, "the moon shall not give her light" was fulfilled.

### The Falling of the Stars: November 13, 1833

> _"The stars shall fall from heaven."_ (Matthew 24:29)

On the night of November 13, 1833, the greatest meteor shower in recorded history swept across North America:

> "The whole heavens seemed in motion... It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had congregated at one point near the zenith, and were simultaneously shooting forth, with the velocity of lightning, to every part of the horizon."—_Christian Advocate and Journal_, Dec. 13, 1833

Astronomers estimate that at least 240,000 meteors fell per hour during the peak of the display. The account in Revelation describes it perfectly: "The stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind" (Revelation 6:13).

[DYK🔎] Many observers that night believed the end of the world had come. Prayer meetings spontaneously gathered. Skeptics fell on their knees. The next day, newspapers across America carried eyewitness reports. This was not a local event—it was witnessed from Canada to Mexico, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Christ's Return

**Atonement**: The work by which God and man are brought into oneness through Christ's sacrifice and priestly ministry (Leviticus 16; Romans 5:10–11).

Christ's promise, "I go to prepare a place for you... I will come again," connects His ascension to heaven with His return. What has He been doing during the intervening centuries? The sanctuary message reveals the answer:

- **Outer Court (Cross)**: Christ offered Himself as our sacrifice, providing justification through His blood.
- **Holy Place (Intercession)**: For centuries, Christ has been ministering in the heavenly sanctuary, applying the benefits of His sacrifice to penitent believers.
- **Most Holy Place (Judgment)**: Since 1844, at the close of the 2,300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14, Christ has been engaged in the investigative judgment—the work of determining who, among the professed people of God, are truly His.

The signs in the heavens (1780, 1833) came just before the transition to this final phase of Christ's ministry. They were heaven's announcement that the end was drawing near.

### The Great Controversy in the Signs

Satan has worked throughout history to obscure the meaning of these signs. Naturalistic explanations are offered for the Dark Day; the star-fall is dismissed as a meteor shower (which it was, but prophetically significant). Yet for those with eyes to see, the evidence is overwhelming. God spoke through nature at the time prophecy specified.

[ILL] A man sets his watch by a certain clock, trusting it to be accurate. When the clock strikes the hour, he acts accordingly. So God has given us a prophetic clock. When the sun darkened in 1780, precisely within the window Scripture specified, it was as though heaven's clock struck the hour. We may ignore it, but we cannot deny it.

### Righteousness by Faith and Readiness

The moral condition of the world at Christ's coming will mirror the days of Noah:

> _"As the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark."_ (Matthew 24:37, 38)

There is nothing sinful in eating, drinking, or marrying. The sin was in being so absorbed in these things that the people ignored Noah's warning. They "knew not until the flood came, and took them all away" (Matthew 24:39).

True readiness for Christ's coming is not mere intellectual assent to prophetic truth. It is a heart transformed by grace—Christ's righteousness both imputed (covering our past sins) and imparted (changing our present character). Only those who abide in Christ, drawing daily upon His power, will be "ready" when He appears.

> _"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."_ (Matthew 24:44)

[Q] **"If we cannot know the day and hour, why study the signs?"**

Jesus said we cannot know the "day and hour" (Matthew 24:36), but He also said, "When ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors" (Matthew 24:33). We cannot set a date, but we can recognize the season. The signs are given precisely so that we might not be caught unaware. To ignore them is to be like the evil servant who said, "My lord delayeth his coming" (Matthew 24:48)—and met a terrible end.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for Us Today

The signs Jesus foretold have been fulfilled:

- The great tribulation ended (by 1773)
- The sun was darkened (1780)
- The moon refused her light (1780)
- The stars fell (1833)

We live in the final generation—those who have "seen all these things" and may know that His coming "is near, even at the doors."

**This truth calls us to:**

1. **Watchfulness**: We are to live in a constant state of readiness, not carelessly absorbed in the pursuits of this world. "Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come" (Matthew 24:42).

2. **Faithfulness**: We are to be found doing our Master's work when He returns. The faithful servant is the one "whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing" (Matthew 24:46).

3. **Proclamation**: The gospel must go to all the world "for a witness." We are called to participate in this final work, by our means, our prayers, and our personal testimony.

4. **Surrender**: Only through daily connection with Christ—abiding in Him as the branch abides in the vine—can we be prepared for His appearing. Self-effort will fail. Human resolve will crumble. But "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27) is sufficient for every test.

## Appeal

> _"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away."_ (Matthew 24:35)

Dear friend, the mountains of prophetic evidence have been laid before us. The sun darkened. The moon withheld her light. The stars fell in sheets of fire. All within the exact window Scripture specified. And now, nearly two centuries later, we stand at the threshold of eternity.

The question is not whether these things have happened—history testifies that they have. The question is: What will _you_ do with this knowledge?

Will you be like those in Noah's day, who "knew not until the flood came"? Or will you be among those who hear the Master's "well done"?

Christ is preparing a place for you in the Father's house—a mansion, a dwelling, an eternal abiding with the One who loved you unto death. He longs for you to be there. He has done everything necessary to make it possible.

Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart. Surrender your life to Him. Let His righteousness cover you and transform you. Be found watching, working, waiting—and ready.

> _"Even so, come, Lord Jesus."_ (Revelation 22:20)
