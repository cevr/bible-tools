## Slide 1 – Chapter 46: A Great Prophetic Period

- **Topic:** The Longest Time Prophecy in the Bible
- **Theme:** The Mathematics of the Gospel and the Judgment
- **Focus:** Linking ancient history (Daniel) with the final ministry of Jesus
  (Hebrews) to reveal God’s plan for the eradication of sin.

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Time of Cleansing

- **Question:** At what time according to the prophecy of Daniel, was the
  sanctuary to be cleansed?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three
  hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Definitions (Days and Sanctuary)

- **The Central Pillar:** This verse is the foundation of the prophetic message
  for the last days.
- **The Days (Symbolic Time):**
  - In symbolic prophecy, a day represents a literal year.
  - Numbers 14:34 – “After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
    even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even
    forty years...”
  - Ezekiel 4:6 – “...I have appointed thee each day for a year.”
  - **Conclusion:** This period covers 2,300 literal years of history.
- **The Sanctuary:**
  - The earthly tabernacle was a "type" or model of the true Sanctuary in
    heaven.
  - Hebrews 8:1–2 – “...We have such an high priest, who is set on the right
    hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; A minister of the
    sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.”

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: The Cleansing (Investigative Judgment)

- **The Earthly Service:**
  - Sins were transferred to the sanctuary daily via blood.
  - Once a year (Day of Atonement/Yom Kippur), the High Priest entered the Most
    Holy Place to "cleanse" the sanctuary (Leviticus 16).
- **The Heavenly Reality:**
  - Daniel 8:14 predicts when Christ, our High Priest, would begin the final
    cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary.
  - **Investigative Judgment:** Christ reviews the lives of believers to
    distinguish true faith from false profession.
  - Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
    blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of
    the Lord.”

---

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Dusty Ledger:**
  - Imagine a ledger book where debts are recorded daily for a long time.
  - An auditor arrives, not to condemn the debtor who has a Sponsor, but to
    close the account.
  - With red ink, he validates that the debt is paid in full and "blots out" the
    pages.
- **Application:**
  - The "cleansing of the sanctuary" is the opening of heaven’s books.
  - It is the work of permanently erasing the record of sin for God’s friends
    before the end comes.

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Daniel’s Location

- **Question:** Where was Daniel when the vision of this chapter was given?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:2 – “And I saw the vision; and it came to pass, when I
  saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam;
  and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river Ulai.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: God’s Presence in Exile

- **Location:** Daniel was in Elam, a province of Babylon (and future Persian
  capital).
- **God is Not Limited:**
  - God reveals truth far from "holy ground" or temples.
  - He reaches His servants even in the center of a pagan empire.
- **Nature and Revelation:**
  - The vision occurred by a river.
  - Nature often serves as the backdrop for revelation, reminding us that the
    Creator of the world is the Controller of history.

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Ram

- **Question:** What first appeared to the prophet?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:3 – “Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold,
  there stood before the river a ram which had two horns.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **The Symbol:** A ram with two horns, one higher than the other.
- **Interpretation:**
  - We do not need to guess; the Bible interprets its own symbols later in the
    chapter.
  - This beast represents a mighty political power rising on the world stage.

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Rough Goat

- **Question:** What next appeared upon the scene?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:5–7 – “And as I was considering, behold a he goat came
  from the west... And he came to the ram that had two horns,... and smote the
  ram, and brake his two horns.”

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Clash of Nations:**
  - The goat attacks with speed ("touched not the ground").
  - Represents the collision of empires.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - History is not random; God foresaw the rise and fall of empires.
  - Behind army movements is a spiritual conflict between truth and error.
  - God orchestrates history to preserve a remnant and prepare for the Messiah.

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: Seeking Meaning

- **Question:** What happened after the prophet heard the time announced for the
  cleansing of the sanctuary?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:15 – “And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had
  seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before
  me as the appearance of a man.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Duty to Study:**
  - Daniel "sought for the meaning." Prophecy is to be understood, not just
    watched.
  - Matthew 24:15 – “When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,
    spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth,
    let him understand:).”
- **Spiritual Hunger:**
  - God answers those who hunger for truth.
  - Matthew 5:6 – “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
    righteousness: for they shall be filled.”

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Command to Explain

- **Question:** What command did Daniel hear given to this angel?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:16 – “And I heard a man's voice between the banks of
  Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the
  vision.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Speaker:** Likely Michael (Christ), as He has authority over angels.
- **Gabriel’s Role:**
  - A high-ranking angel who stands in God's presence (Luke 1:19).
  - Special messenger regarding the Messiah and prophecy.
- **Divine Will:**
  - It is God's will that His people understand the "time of the end."
  - The vision was not meant to remain a mystery.

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: The Time of the End

- **Question:** What were the first words that the angel then uttered before the
  prophet?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:17 – “I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said
  unto, me, Understand, a son of man; for at the time of the end shall be the
  vision.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points

- **Long-Range Prophecy:**
  - The 2300-day vision extends to "the time of the end."
  - It would not be fulfilled in Daniel’s day or during the Old Testament era.
- **Scope:** It stretches down the stream of time to the final era of human
  history.

---

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Symbols Explained

- **Question:** How did the angel then proceed to fulfill his mission to Daniel?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:20, 21 – “The ram which thou sawest having two horns
  are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points

- **The Bible Dictionary:** The angel explicitly identifies the symbols.
  - **The Ram:** Medo-Persia (Conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.). The two horns
    represent the dual monarchy (Medes and Persians).
  - **The Goat:** Greece (Under Alexander the Great).
- **Historicism:**
  - This confirms the Historicist method of interpretation.
  - Prophecy outlines a continuous timeline from Daniel’s day to the end.

---

## Slide 20 – Q9: The Sealed Vision

- **Question:** What part of the vision did the angel say was to be shut up, and
  why?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:26 – “And the vision of the evening and the morning
  which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for
  many days.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points

- **"Evening and Morning":** Refers back to the 2300 days (Daniel 8:14).
- **Shut Up:** The _time_ element was sealed because it concerned the distant
  future ("many days").
- **Evidence for Year-Day Principle:**
  - A literal 2300 days (approx. 6.5 years) is not "many days" in the context of
    nations.
  - 2300 _years_ fits the description of a long prophetic era sealed until the
    end times (Daniel 12:4).

---

## Slide 22 – Q10: Daniel’s Reaction

- **Question:** What did Daniel say about the vision?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:27 – “And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days;
  afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the
  vision, but none understood it.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points

- **Partial Understanding:**
  - Daniel understood the Ram and Goat (explained in verses 20-21).
  - He did _not_ understand the time (2300 days) involving the sanctuary's
    desolation.
- **Physical Impact:** The thought of long desolation for God’s house caused him
  illness.
- **Faithfulness:**
  - Despite anxiety, he "rose up, and did the king's business."
  - We must not use prophecy as an excuse to neglect practical duties.

---

## Slide 24 – Q11: Searching Scripture

- **Question:** Although Daniel said nothing of his astonishment at what he had
  seen, so that the king's courtiers did not perceive it, what did he do?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:1, 2 – “In the first year of Darius,... I Daniel
  understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came
  to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the
  desolations of Jerusalem.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points

- **Comparing Scripture:**
  - Daniel studied the prophecies of Jeremiah regarding the 70-year captivity.
  - Jeremiah 29:10 – “For thus saith the Lord, That after seventy years be
    accomplished at Babylon I will visit you...”
- **The Confusion:**
  - The 70 years were ending, but Gabriel had spoken of 2300 days.
  - Daniel feared the captivity was being extended due to sin.

---

## Slide 26 – Q12: Seeking God

- **Question:** In view of this, what did the prophet do?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:3 – “And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by
  prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Key Points

- **Intercessory Prayer:** Daniel did not demand answers; he humbled himself.
- **Conditions for Light:**
  - Fasting and sackcloth showed deep earnestness.
  - Psalm 25:14 – “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he
    will shew them his covenant.”
  - God reveals secrets to the humble.

---

## Slide 28 – Q13: Anxiety for the Sanctuary

- **Question:** What, in Daniel's prayer, showed that he was still anxious about
  the sanctuary question?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:17 – “Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy
  servant, and his supplications, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy sanctuary
  that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.”

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Link:** Daniel prays about the "desolate sanctuary"—the exact subject of
  Daniel 8.
- **"For the Lord's Sake":**
  - Daniel pleads based on God’s character, not human merit.
  - He identifies with the people: "We have sinned" (Daniel 9:5).
- **The Lesson:** In the judgment, the true saint relies wholly on the
  righteousness of Christ, not their own works.

---

## Slide 30 – Q14: The Answer Comes

- **Question:** How did the Lord regard his petition?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:21 – “Yea, while I was speaking in prayer, even the man
  Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly
  swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.”

---

## Slide 31 – Q14: Key Points

- **Swift Answer:** Heaven is responsive to the prayer of faith.
- **The Evening Oblation:**
  - Daniel observed the time of the sacrifice in his heart, even though the
    temple was destroyed.
  - **The Lens of the Cross:** Prophetic understanding is given in the context
    of the Atonement (the sacrifice). We understand prophecy best when viewing
    it through the Cross.

---

## Slide 32 – Q15: Consider the Vision

- **Question:** What did Gabriel tell Daniel?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:23 – “At the beginning of thy supplications the
  commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee; for thou art greatly
  beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.”

---

## Slide 33 – Q15: Key Points

- **"Consider the Vision":**
  - Refers to the vision of Daniel 8 (the 2300 days), which was the only part
    left unexplained.
  - Daniel 9 is the key that unlocks Daniel 8.
- **"Greatly Beloved":**
  - God reveals the future because He loves His people.
  - Fear is not the motive of prophecy; love is.

---

## Slide 34 – Q16: The Seventy Weeks

- **Question:** What application did Gabriel proceed to make of the vision?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:24 – “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and
  upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
  and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
  righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most
  Holy.”

---

## Slide 35 – Q16: Key Points

- **"Determined" (Cut Off):**
  - The 70 weeks (490 years) are "cut off" from the longer 2300-year period.
  - They are allotted to the Jewish nation ("thy people").
- **The Purpose (The Gospel):**
  - **Reconciliation:** Points to the Atonement.
  - **Everlasting Righteousness:** Jesus came to replace our "filthy rags"
    (Isaiah 64:6) with His perfect robe of righteousness.
  - He provides justification (imputed) and sanctification (imparted).

---

## Slide 36 – Q16: Illustration

- **The Measuring Tape:**
  - Imagine a measuring tape of 2300 inches.
  - You "cut off" the first 490 inches.
  - The 490 inches and the full tape must start at the **same point**.
- **Conclusion:** If we find the starting date of the 70 weeks, we have found
  the starting date of the 2300 days.

---

## Slide 37 – Q17: The Starting Date

- **Question:** When did the angel say that the seventy weeks (490 years) were
  to commence?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:25 – “Know therefore and understand, that from the
  going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
  Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three- score and two weeks; the
  street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.”

---

## Slide 38 – Q17: Key Points

- **The Event:** The "commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem."
- **The Timeline:**
  - 7 weeks (49 years) + 62 weeks (434 years) = **69 weeks (483 years)**.
  - This period reaches "unto the Messiah."
- **Messiah:** Means "The Anointed One" (Christ).

---

## Slide 39 – Q18: The Anointing

- **Question:** How was Jesus anointed?
- **Key Text:** Acts 10:38 – “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
  Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were
  oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”

---

## Slide 40 – Q19: The Baptism (27 A.D.)

- **Question:** At what time did Jesus receive the special anointing of the Holy
  Spirit?
- **Key Text:** Luke 3:21, 22 – “Now when all the people were baptized, it came
  to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,
  And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a
  voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art My beloved Son; in thee I am well
  pleased.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q19: Key Points

- **The Fulfillment:** The anointing occurred at Christ's baptism.
- **The Date:**
  - The 15th year of Tiberius Caesar (Luke 3:1).
  - Historically established as **Autumn, 27 A.D.**

---

## Slide 42 – Q20: Time Fulfilled

- **Question:** What did Jesus say shortly after this?
- **Key Text:** Luke 4:18 – “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
  anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor...”
  - _See also:_ Mark 1:15 – “And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom
    of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.”

---

## Slide 43 – Q20: Key Points

- **"The Time is Fulfilled":**
  - Which time? The 69 prophetic weeks of Daniel 9.
  - The Messiah appeared exactly on schedule.
- **Assurance:** If God was punctual regarding the First Advent, He will be
  punctual regarding the Judgment.

---

## Slide 44 – Q21: The Decree (457 B.C.)

- **Question:** When was a decree made to restore and build Jerusalem?
- **Key Text:** Ezra 7:6–8 – “...and there went up some of the children of
  Israel... unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. And he
  came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the
  king.”

---

## Slide 45 – Q21: The Mathematics

- **The Date:** The decree of Artaxerxes was issued in **457 B.C.**
- **Verification:**
  - From 457 B.C., count forward 69 weeks (483 years).
  - -457 + 483 = 26.
  - Add 1 year (because there is no year zero between B.C. and A.D.).
  - Result = **27 A.D.**
  - This perfectly matches the baptism of Jesus.

---

## Slide 46 – Q22: The Final Week

- **Question:** At the close of 483 years, in 27 A.D., one week, or seven years
  of the 490 yet remained. What was to be done in the midst of that week?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 9:27 – “And He shall confirm the covenant with many for
  one week: and in the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the
  oblation to cease.”

---

## Slide 47 – Q22: Key Points

- **The Midst of the Week:**
  - The "week" is 7 years (27 A.D. to 34 A.D.).
  - The "midst" (middle) is 3½ years after 27 A.D. = **Spring, 31 A.D.**
- **The Cross:**
  - In 31 A.D., Christ was crucified.
  - **Sacrifice Ceased:** The veil was torn (Matthew 27:51). The earthly
    sacrificial system ended because the True Lamb had died.
  - **Atonement:** This provided the legal justification for all believers.
- **Covenant Confirmed:**
  - The gospel went to the Jews until 34 A.D. (Stoning of Stephen, Acts 7).
  - Then it went to the Gentiles.

---

## Slide 48 – Q23: The 2300 Days End (1844)

- **Question:** And what did the angel say would then take place?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three
  hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

---

## Slide 49 – Q23: The Calculation

- **Start Date:** 457 B.C. (Same as the 70 weeks).
- **Duration:** 2300 years.
- **The Math:**
  - 2300 - 457 = 1843.
  - Add 1 year (no year zero) = **1844 A.D.**
- **The Event:**
  - Jesus entered the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.
  - The **Investigative Judgment** began (The anti-typical Day of Atonement).

---

## Slide 50 – Q23: Application (Sanctuary & Faith)

- **Court is in Session:**
  - Christ is examining the records to see who is abiding in Him.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot pass this judgment by our own works.
  - **Justification:** We claim His death for past sins (31 A.D.).
  - **Sanctification:** We claim His intercession for present victory (1844
    onwards).
- **The Call:**
  - We must cooperate with our High Priest to have sin blotted out of our lives.

---

## Slide 51 – Q23: Illustration

- **Afflicting the Soul:**
  - In the ancient service, while the Priest was in the Most Holy Place, the
    people did not party; they prayed and searched their hearts.
  - **Our Attitude:** We live in the solemn time of Judgment.
  - **Our Confidence:** We do not pray in fear, but in hope, knowing our Judge
    is also our Savior who paid our debt.
