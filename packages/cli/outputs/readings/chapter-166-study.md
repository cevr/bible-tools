### Q1. Where were the foundations of home laid?

**"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man
whom He had formed." Gen. 2:8.**

**Answer:**

The home is not a human invention; it is a divine institution. Its foundations
were laid in Eden, before sin entered the world, making it one of the two "twin
institutions" (along with the Sabbath) that have come down to us from before the
Fall.

1.  **God as the Architect:** The verse tells us that God Himself "planted" the
    garden and "put the man" there. God did not leave Adam to wander in the
    wilderness; He provided a sanctuary called home. This indicates that our
    domestic life is of intense interest to our Creator.
2.  **A Model of Heaven:** The Edenic home was a type, or symbol, of the
    heavenly home. Just as the earthly sanctuary was a pattern of the heavenly
    sanctuary (Hebrews 8:5), the Christian home is to be a "little heaven on
    earth," where the principles of God’s government—love, order, and
    service—reign supreme.
3.  **Environment and Character:** God placed man in a garden, surrounded by the
    beauty of nature, to uplift his thoughts. While we no longer live in Eden,
    the atmosphere we create in our homes—physically and spiritually—affects our
    character development.

- **Sanctification:** _The process of being made holy and restored to God’s
  image (1 Thessalonians 4:3)._ The home is the primary school for
  sanctification. It is where we learn patience, unselfishness, and love,
  fitting us for the society of angels.

**[ILL]** Imagine a master builder constructing a house. He lays the foundation
with the strongest materials to ensure stability. God laid the foundation of
human society—the family—in the perfect soil of Eden. If a builder’s foundation
is cracked, the whole building is unstable. Likewise, if we ignore God’s
original plan for the home (love, purity, and obedience to His law), the
structure of our society and our individual lives will crumble.

### Q2. In carrying out His perfect plan! what was still needed?

**"And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will
make him a help meet [or adapted] for him." Gen. 2:18.**

**Answer:**

Even in a perfect world, isolation was declared "not good." God designed
humanity for social connection, reflecting the social nature of the Godhead
("Let **us** make man," Genesis 1:26).

1.  **The Need for Companionship:** Solitude was the first thing God pronounced
    "not good." Man was created with a capacity to love and share that could not
    be satisfied by the animal creation; he needed an equal.
2.  **"Help Meet":** The term "help meet" (or helper comparable to him) implies
    a counterpart. She was not made from his head to rule over him, nor from his
    feet to be trampled upon, but from his side—near his heart—to be loved and
    protected. This union represents the perfect blending of lives in service to
    God.
3.  **A Type of Christ and the Church:** The marriage relation is the deepest
    earthly illustration of the union between Christ and His people.
    - **Justification:** _God declaring the sinner righteous through faith in
      Christ (Romans 5:1)._ Just as Adam accepted Eve as "bone of my bones"
      (Genesis 2:23), Christ accepts the repentant sinner, covering them with
      His righteousness and treating them as part of Himself (Ephesians 5:30).
    - This union requires a surrender of self. A happy home is impossible where
      "self" rules. It requires the "faith which worketh by love" (Galatians
      5:6).

**[ILL]** Consider the human body. The right hand and the left hand are
distinct, yet they are "meet" or suitable for one another. One does not compete
with the other; they wash each other, work together, and protect the body. If
one hand is injured, the other immediately comforts it. So it is in the godly
home: a partnership of mutual service, animated by the Spirit of Christ.

### Q3. Is the home complete without children?

**"Lo, children are a heritage of the Lord." Ps. 127:3. "Children's children are
the crown of old men, and the glory of children are their fathers." Prov.
17:6.**

**Answer:**

While God may have different plans for individual families, the general design
of the home includes the blessing of children. They are described not as a
burden or a hindrance to ambition, but as a "heritage" (an inheritance or gift)
from Jehovah.

1.  **A Sacred Trust:** Parents stand in the place of God to their children
    during their early years. This is a solemn responsibility. The character of
    the parents is the textbook the child reads every day.
2.  **The Family Altar:** The home with children becomes a training ground for
    heaven. As the father acts as the priest of the household, leading in
    morning and evening worship, he points his "heritage" to the Lamb of God.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith in Parenting:** Parents cannot change their
    children's hearts; only the Holy Spirit can.
    - Parents must first possess Christ’s righteousness themselves.
    - They then present their children to God in faith, claiming His promises
      for their salvation (Isaiah 49:25).
    - This distinguishes true discipline from mere behavior modification; we
      seek the transformation of the child's heart through the power of grace.

**[ILL]** A gardener may water the soil and prune the branches, but he cannot
make the seed grow; only God gives the life. Yet, if the gardener neglects the
plant, it will surely die or run wild. Children are the tender plants in the
Lord's garden. Parents are the under-gardeners, tasked with removing the weeds
(bad influences) and providing the sunshine of love, while trusting God to
produce the fruit of the Spirit in their lives.

### Q4. Does the happiness of home depend upon the abundance of things possessed?

**"A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth." Luke 12:15. "Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a
stalled ox and hatred therewith." Prov. 15:17.**

**Answer:**

The world teaches that happiness comes from accumulation—larger houses, finer
furniture, and wealth. The Bible teaches that happiness is a condition of the
heart, independent of external circumstances.

1.  **The Fallacy of Materialism:** Jesus warns against covetousness.
    Possessions bring care, anxiety, and often a false sense of security. They
    cannot heal a broken heart or forgive sin.
2.  **The Priority of Love:** Proverbs 15:17 contrasts a meager vegetarian meal
    ("dinner of herbs") with a luxurious feast ("stalled ox"). If the luxury
    comes with strife, the poverty with love is infinitely superior. Love is the
    atmosphere of heaven; without it, a palace is a prison.
3.  **Christ the Center:** The secret to a happy home is the presence of Jesus.
    - **The Bread of Life:** In the Sanctuary, the table of shewbread
      represented Christ as the sustenance of His people. If a family feeds on
      Christ—studying His Word and trusting His merits—they are spiritually
      rich, regardless of their bank account (Revelation 3:18).
    - True satisfaction comes from "seeking first the kingdom of God and His
      righteousness" (Matthew 6:33).

**[ILL]** Think of a beautiful lantern that is intricately carved and
gold-plated, but has no flame inside. It is cold and useless in the dark.
Compare it to a simple clay lamp that burns with a bright, warm flame. The
"flame" is the love of God in the heart. A home filled with expensive things but
lacking the warmth of Christ’s love is like the cold, golden lantern—dark and
cheerless.

### Q5. May a home be undesirable under some circumstances?

**"It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry
woman." Prov. 21:19.**

**Answer:**

Yes, a home can become a place of misery if the Spirit of Christ is absent.
While the verse specifically mentions a "contentious woman," the principle
applies to any member of the household—husband, wife, or children—who allows a
fretful, angry, or complaining spirit to rule.

1.  **The Ruin of Contentiousness:** Constant bickering, criticism, and anger
    destroy the "sanctuary" nature of the home. It drives peace away and makes
    the home a place people want to escape (dwelling in the "wilderness").
2.  **The Root of the Problem:** Contentions come from pride and the unrenewed
    heart (Proverbs 13:10). It is the "flesh" warring against the Spirit.
3.  **The Cure: A New Heart (Righteousness by Faith):**
    - We cannot fix a bad temper or a critical spirit by mere willpower. We need
      a change of nature.
    - **Imparted Righteousness:** _God giving us the power to obey and live
      victoriously (Philippians 2:13)._
    - The prayer of the struggling believer should be, "Lord, take my heart; for
      I cannot give it. It is Thy property. Keep it pure, for I cannot keep it
      for Thee" (_Christ's Object Lessons_).
    - When Christ dwells within, He replaces contention with peace, and anger
      with patience (Galatians 5:22-23).

**[ILL]** The Bible elsewhere compares a contentious spouse to a "continual
dropping in a very rainy day" (Proverbs 27:15). Imagine trying to sleep or work
in a house where the roof leaks, drip, drip, drip, constantly. It wears away
your patience and destroys your rest. An angry or nagging spirit is a "spiritual
leak" in the home. The only way to stop the leak is not just to catch the water
(manage the anger), but to repair the roof—to let God rebuild the character
through His grace.
