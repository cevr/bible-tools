# Reading 166: A Happy Home, and How to Make It

## Introduction

The home is God's first and most sacred institution—established before governments, churches, or any other human organization. In Eden, before sin entered, God created the ideal pattern for human happiness: a loving union between husband and wife in a garden prepared by His own hands. Understanding God's original design for the home reveals principles that can transform our families today into foretastes of heaven itself.

## Core Truths

### The Divine Origin of Home

The home did not evolve from human social development—it was **planted by God Himself** in the perfection of Eden.

> _"And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed."_ (Genesis 2:8)

Notice the tender care in this verse: God "planted" a garden, then "put" the man there. The Hebrew word for "put" (_nuach_) means to cause to rest, to settle in safety. God did not merely create Adam and leave him to fend for himself—He prepared a **place of rest, beauty, and purpose** before placing him there.

[DYK🔎] Eden means "delight" or "pleasure" in Hebrew. God's original plan for home was not mere survival but genuine happiness and fulfillment. The home was designed to be a place of delight, not duty alone.

### The Completion of Home Through Companionship

God surveyed all His creative works and declared them "very good" (Genesis 1:31)—except for one thing. Before the woman was created, something was "not good."

> _"And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."_ (Genesis 2:18)

The phrase "help meet" (_ezer kenegdo_) is rich with meaning:

- **Ezer** (help): This same word describes God Himself as Israel's helper (Psalm 33:20; 70:5). It implies strength, not inferiority.
- **Kenegdo** (meet/adapted): Literally "corresponding to him"—a counterpart, a complement, one who stands face-to-face as an equal.

**Marriage**: The covenant union between one man and one woman, designed by God for mutual companionship, support, and the blessing of children (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:4–6).

[Q] **"Doesn't 'help meet' suggest women are subordinate servants?"**

Not at all. The Hebrew reveals the opposite: _ezer_ is a word of strength and rescue. God did not create Eve to be Adam's servant but his counterpart—spiritually equal, uniquely suited to complete what he lacked alone. The home requires both masculine and feminine strengths working in loving unity.

### The Blessing of Children

> _"Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward."_ (Psalm 127:3)

> _"Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers."_ (Proverbs 17:6)

Children are described as a **heritage**—an inheritance, a treasure entrusted by God. They are also called a "reward," suggesting that faithful parents experience joy through their offspring. The intergenerational connection—grandchildren being the "crown" of grandparents—reveals God's design for families that extend blessing across generations.

[DYK🔎] In Hebrew culture, to be "crowned" meant to be honored and blessed. When Scripture calls grandchildren the "crown of old men," it pictures elderly believers surrounded by godly descendants as their greatest earthly honor—far surpassing wealth or reputation.

## Deeper Truths

### The True Source of Happiness

Our Lord spoke directly to the misconception that happiness depends on possessions:

> _"A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."_ (Luke 12:15)

This truth strikes at the root of much family unhappiness. We live in an age that measures success by accumulation—bigger houses, newer vehicles, more impressive possessions. Yet Christ declares that **life itself** does not consist in these things.

[ILL] Consider two homes: In one, fine furniture fills every room, the latest conveniences line the kitchen, and the children have every toy imaginable—yet harsh words echo through the halls, and family members retreat to separate screens in separate rooms. In another home, the furniture is worn, the meals simple, and the walls need painting—yet laughter fills the kitchen, prayers rise together at evening worship, and love binds each heart to the others. Which home is truly wealthy? The first is a house full of things but empty of joy; the second is a home full of treasure that thieves cannot steal.

Solomon, the wisest and wealthiest man of his age, confirmed this principle:

> _"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith."_ (Proverbs 15:17)

A simple meal of vegetables shared in love surpasses a feast prepared in bitterness. The "stalled ox" represents the finest food money could buy—grain-fed beef reserved for special occasions. Yet Solomon declares that **love transforms a humble table into a banquet**, while hatred poisons even the richest provisions.

### When Home Becomes a Wilderness

Scripture honestly addresses the reality that homes can become places of misery:

> _"It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman."_ (Proverbs 21:19)

[Q] **"Doesn't this verse unfairly single out women?"**

Scripture addresses the character of both men and women with equal honesty. Proverbs also warns against foolish men (Proverbs 14:17), angry fathers (Proverbs 22:24–25), and contentious people of either gender (Proverbs 26:21). This particular verse addresses men choosing wives, but the principle applies universally: **uncontrolled anger and habitual contention destroy the peace of home**, regardless of who exhibits them. A gentle, peaceable spirit is essential in every family member.

The startling comparison—preferring wilderness survival to life with a contentious spouse—reveals how deeply relational conflict wounds the soul. Physical hardship in solitude is more bearable than emotional warfare in one's own home.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Home as a Sanctuary

The pattern of the earthly sanctuary provides insight into God's design for the home:

- **The Outer Court** (sacrifice): Home requires daily self-denial. Each member must surrender selfish desires for the good of others. "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it" (Ephesians 5:25).

- **The Holy Place** (daily ministry): The bread of life (God's Word), the light of the candlestick (spiritual illumination), and the incense of prayer should be present daily in the Christian home. Family worship corresponds to the priest's daily ministry.

- **The Most Holy Place** (God's presence): The ultimate goal is for God Himself to dwell with the family. "Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it" (Psalm 127:1).

### The Great Controversy in the Home

Satan has targeted the home since Eden. His first successful temptation occurred within the first marriage, and ever since, he has worked to destroy family peace. The home is a battlefield in the great controversy:

- **Satan's tactics**: Busyness that crowds out worship, entertainment that corrupts values, selfishness that poisons relationships, anger that destroys trust
- **Christ's provision**: His righteousness to transform selfish hearts, His Spirit to produce the fruit of love, His grace sufficient for every family need

[DYK🔎] Ellen White observed that "one well-ordered, well-disciplined family tells more in behalf of Christianity than all the sermons that can be preached" (_The Adventist Home_, p. 32). A godly home is one of the most powerful witnesses for truth in the great controversy.

### Righteousness by Faith in Family Life

Here is the great secret of a happy home: **we cannot manufacture the love, patience, and gentleness required by human effort**. The fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23)—love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance—are not produced by determination but by abiding in Christ.

> _"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing."_ (John 15:5)

The husband who cannot control his temper, the wife who struggles with critical words, the children who resist obedience—all may find in Christ the power to be transformed. This is not suppression of wrong impulses but the creation of new impulses through the indwelling life of Jesus.

## Practical Application

### Building a Happy Home Today

**1. Establish Christ as the Foundation**
Without Christ at the center, the home rests on shifting sand. Begin and end each day with family worship—even a few verses and a prayer together invite heaven's blessing.

**2. Cultivate Love, Not Possessions**
Resist the cultural pressure to equate happiness with accumulation. Invest time and energy in relationships rather than things. A game played together, a meal shared without screens, a walk taken hand-in-hand—these build lasting treasure.

**3. Guard Against Contention**
_"A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up strife"_ (Proverbs 15:1). Commit to speaking gently, even when frustrated. Refuse to let anger simmer into bitterness. Seek reconciliation before the sun sets (Ephesians 4:26).

**4. Value Children as God's Heritage**
Do not view children as interruptions to your plans but as treasures entrusted to your care. The investment of time in training, teaching, and loving them yields eternal dividends.

**5. Seek Christ's Transforming Power**
Where you have failed—in patience, in kindness, in self-control—bring your failures to Jesus. He does not merely forgive; He transforms. By faith, receive His righteousness both imputed (covering your past failures) and imparted (enabling present victory).

## Appeal

> _"Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it."_ (Psalm 127:1)

Dear friend, God desires your home to be a little heaven on earth—a place of peace, love, and joy that reflects His character to a watching world. But this cannot be achieved by human effort alone. Only Christ, dwelling in each heart by faith, can produce the fruit that makes home truly happy.

Will you invite Him today to be the unseen Guest at every meal, the silent Listener to every conversation, the Head of your household? Will you surrender your temper, your tongue, your time to His transforming grace?

The Eden home was lost through sin, but the principles of Eden can be restored through Christ. And one day soon, the redeemed will dwell in homes that exceed Eden's beauty—homes in the earth made new, where sin will never enter and love will never fail.

Let us begin today to build our homes on the only foundation that will stand through eternity: Jesus Christ, the Lord of every happy home.
