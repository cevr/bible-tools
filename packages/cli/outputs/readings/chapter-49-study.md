# Bible Study: The Judgment

## Introduction

The judgment of God is one of the most solemn and yet most comforting truths in all of Scripture. Far from being an arbitrary or capricious event, the judgment reveals God's perfect justice, His transparent government, and His earnest desire that all should be saved. Through the judgment, God vindicates His character before the universe, demonstrates the fairness of every decision, and prepares a people to dwell eternally in His presence. This study traces the judgment through its various phases—investigative, millennial, and executive—showing how each phase fulfills God's eternal purpose of restoring righteousness to His creation.

## Core Truths

### The Universality of the Judgment

The judgment encompasses all moral beings in the universe. No one escapes its searching examination.

> "I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked" (Ecclesiastes 3:17).

> "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil" (Ecclesiastes 12:14).

Not only humanity but also fallen angels must answer before God's tribunal:

> "And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, He hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day" (Jude 6).

[DYK🔎] The phrase "every secret thing" in Ecclesiastes 12:14 uses the Hebrew word _kol_ (כֹּל), meaning "all" without exception. Nothing—not a hidden thought, a private word, or a concealed motive—lies outside the scope of God's perfect knowledge and righteous evaluation.

### The Books of Heaven

The judgment proceeds from records maintained with perfect accuracy in heaven. These books contain the complete history of every life.

> "The judgment was set, and the books were opened" (Daniel 7:10).

> "A book of remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name" (Malachi 3:16).

Angels record these deeds:

> "Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error" (Ecclesiastes 5:6).

[Q] **"If God is omniscient, why does He need books of record?"**

The books are not for God's benefit—He knows all things. Rather, they exist for the sake of the universe. In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, God's government must be shown to be just and transparent. The records allow all created beings—angels and redeemed humans alike—to examine the evidence and confirm that God has dealt fairly with every soul. As Paul wrote, "Let God be true, but every man a liar... that Thou mightest be justified in Thy sayings, and mightest overcome when Thou art judged" (Romans 3:4). God Himself submits His decisions to the scrutiny of His creatures, so that at last "every knee shall bow... and every tongue shall confess" that His ways are righteous (Philippians 2:10–11).

### The Investigative Judgment of the Righteous

Judgment begins with God's professed people—those whose names are written in the book of life.

> "For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?" (1 Peter 4:17).

This phase takes place in heaven before Christ's second coming. Daniel beheld this solemn scene:

> "I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool: His throne was like the fiery flame... the judgment was set, and the books were opened" (Daniel 7:9–10).

The "Ancient of days"—God the Father—presides. Myriads of angels minister before Him. And then:

> "One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought Him near before Him" (Daniel 7:13).

Christ enters the Father's presence not to earth but to the heavenly tribunal. His work there is to advocate for those who have chosen Him:

> "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels" (Revelation 3:5).

[ILL] Consider a courtroom where a defense attorney stands beside the accused. The evidence is brought forward—every word, every deed. But the attorney does not merely argue technicalities; He presents His own blood, His own perfect life, in place of the defendant's failures. "Father," He pleads, "this one trusted Me. Let My righteousness cover their sins." And because the accused has truly repented and remained faithful, the Judge declares, "Pardoned! The record is cleared." This is what Christ does for every true believer in the investigative judgment.

## Deeper Truths

### The Purpose of the Pre-Advent Judgment

Why must there be an investigative judgment before Christ returns? Because at His coming, there is no time for deliberation—everything happens instantaneously.

> "The dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump" (1 Corinthians 15:52).

When the dead are raised immortal in the very act of rising, their destiny must already have been determined. The investigative judgment answers the question: Who among the professed believers are "accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead"? (Luke 20:35). It separates true believers from false professors—not by arbitrary decree, but by examining the life record against the standard of God's law and the claims of Christ's blood.

> "Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man" (Luke 21:36).

### The Blotting Out of Sins

When believers confess their sins, they are forgiven:

> "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).

But the final blotting out of sins—their permanent removal from the records of heaven—occurs in the investigative judgment when it is determined that the believer has remained faithful unto the end.

> "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord" (Acts 3:19).

[DYK🔎] In the earthly sanctuary, the sins of Israel were symbolically transferred to the sanctuary throughout the year. On the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), those sins were finally removed—cleansed from the sanctuary and placed upon the scapegoat. This ceremony pointed forward to the investigative judgment, when Christ's heavenly sanctuary is cleansed and the sins of the righteous are blotted out forever. The scapegoat, which bore the sins into the wilderness, represents Satan, who will ultimately bear responsibility for having originated sin and tempted God's people.

### The Two Resurrections

Scripture clearly teaches two resurrections separated by one thousand years:

> "All that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation" (John 5:28–29).

> "The dead in Christ shall rise first" (1 Thessalonians 4:16).

> "And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus... and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection" (Revelation 20:4–5).

The first resurrection is for the righteous at Christ's second coming. The second resurrection, one thousand years later, is for the wicked.

[Q] **"Why must there be this long interval between the two resurrections?"**

The thousand years serve a vital purpose in God's plan. During this time, the redeemed in heaven participate in the judgment of the wicked and fallen angels (1 Corinthians 6:2–3). They examine the records, understand why certain individuals were lost, and see the complete justice of God's decisions. Every question about why a loved one was not saved will be answered. Every apparent inconsistency will be explained. When the thousand years end and sentence is executed, there will be no lingering doubts in the minds of the saved. They will have seen for themselves that God did everything possible to save every soul, and that the lost chose their own destruction.

### The Millennial Judgment

While the earth lies desolate and Satan is bound by circumstances—unable to tempt anyone because all are either in heaven or dead—the saints participate in a sacred work:

> "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them" (Revelation 20:4).

> "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?... Know ye not that we shall judge angels?" (1 Corinthians 6:2–3).

This is not about deciding who is saved or lost—that was settled in the investigative judgment. Rather, the saints review the cases of the wicked to determine the degree of their punishment, for Jesus taught that some will be "beaten with many stripes" and others "with few" (Luke 12:47–48). The same review includes the fallen angels, whose punishment will likewise be assigned.

Paul warned: "Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come" (1 Corinthians 4:5). Before Christ returns, we are not to pass final sentence on anyone. But afterward, reigning with Christ in the heavenly kingdom, the saints participate in this solemn review.

### The Executive Judgment

At the close of the thousand years, the wicked are raised in the second resurrection. Satan, now able to deceive again, gathers them for a final assault on the Holy City, which has descended from heaven.

> "And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city" (Revelation 20:9).

Then comes the executive judgment—the final sentence carried out:

> "And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God" (Revelation 19:15).

> "The Father... hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man" (John 5:26–27).

[ILL] The Son of man—the One who walked our dusty roads, wept at our graves, and died our death—is given authority to execute judgment. He who was judged unjustly by earthly courts now judges with perfect justice. He who was condemned as a criminal now condemns sin. And because He became one of us, no soul can claim that God does not understand. The Judge knows by experience every temptation, every struggle, every sorrow that humanity faces. His judgment is not cold and distant, but informed by infinite compassion.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and the Judgment

The investigative judgment is the antitype of the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). In the earthly sanctuary:

- **Daily ministry** (holy place): Sins were confessed and symbolically transferred to the sanctuary through the blood of the sacrifice.
- **Yearly cleansing** (most holy place): On the Day of Atonement, the high priest entered the most holy place to cleanse the sanctuary from the accumulated sins.

In the heavenly sanctuary:

- **Christ's daily ministry**: Since His ascension, Christ has applied His blood on behalf of repentant sinners, forgiving their sins.
- **Christ's final atonement**: Beginning in 1844 (see Daniel 8:14), Christ entered upon the final phase of His ministry in the most holy place—the investigative judgment—to blot out the sins of the righteous and prepare a people for His coming.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "cleanse" in Daniel 8:14 is _tsadaq_, meaning "to be made right" or "to be vindicated." The cleansing of the sanctuary is not merely about removing sins—it is about vindicating God's character and His people before the watching universe.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Judgment

Some fear that an investigative judgment teaches salvation by works. But the judgment actually demonstrates the power of righteousness by faith.

The judgment examines whether we have genuinely accepted Christ—whether His righteousness has been **imputed** to cover our guilt and **imparted** to transform our character. The evidence sought is not perfect human performance but genuine faith that works by love.

> "But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?" (James 2:20).

Living faith produces fruit. The judgment reveals whether our profession was genuine or merely nominal. Those found in Christ—those who by faith have allowed Him to live out His life in them—are accepted. Their sins are blotted out, and their names are retained in the book of life.

Ellen White wrote with clarity: "The work of the investigative judgment and the blotting out of sins is to be accomplished before the second advent of the Lord. Since the dead are to be judged out of the things written in the books, it is impossible that the sins of men should be blotted out until after the judgment at which their cases are to be investigated" (_The Great Controversy_, p. 485).

### The Announcement of the Judgment

The investigative judgment's commencement is announced to the world through the first angel's message:

> "Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters" (Revelation 14:7).

This message has been proclaimed since 1844, calling people to:

- **Fear God**: Reverence His authority
- **Give glory to Him**: Live in harmony with His character
- **Worship the Creator**: Keep His memorial of creation—the seventh-day Sabbath

The judgment message is not designed to frighten but to prepare. God wants a people ready to meet Him, cleansed from sin, clothed in Christ's righteousness, reflecting His character.

## Practical Application

### Live with Eternity in View

> "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad" (2 Corinthians 5:10).

Every thought, word, and action has eternal significance. Live each day as one who must give account—not with slavish fear, but with holy purpose.

### Confess All Known Sin

Since the investigative judgment examines whether we have repented of all our sins, we must be diligent in confession. Do not harbor unconfessed sin.

> "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy" (Proverbs 28:13).

Make it a daily practice to invite the Holy Spirit to search your heart (Psalm 139:23–24), and confess every sin He reveals.

### Trust Wholly in Christ

The judgment is not about earning salvation by works but about demonstrating that genuine faith has been exercised. Trust Christ completely—for pardon, for power to overcome, for victory over every besetting sin.

> "If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin" (1 John 1:7).

### Seek Character Transformation

The judgment reveals character. God desires not merely forgiven sinners but transformed saints—people who reflect His image.

> "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God" (2 Corinthians 7:1).

This is not accomplished by human effort but by abiding in Christ, allowing His life to flow through us (John 15:4–5).

### Watch and Pray

> "Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man" (Luke 21:36).

The judgment is ongoing. We know not when our name will be called. Maintain constant vigilance and unceasing prayer.

## Appeal

> "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels" (Revelation 3:5).

What a promise! Jesus Christ—the Son of God, our Advocate, our High Priest—stands ready to confess your name before the Father and the holy angels. He offers to cover you with His own spotless righteousness, to blot out your sins forever, to write your name indelibly in the book of life.

But He cannot do this against your will. He cannot confess the name of one who has not confessed Him. He cannot retain in the book of life one who has rejected His offered grace.

The judgment is not a threat—it is an invitation. It declares that God keeps perfect records, that justice will be done, that the righteous will be vindicated, and that Christ longs to save you to the uttermost.

Will you trust Him today? Will you surrender every sin, every habit, every cherished idol at His feet? Will you say, "Lord, I am Yours—cleanse me, fill me, keep me faithful unto the end"?

The hour of His judgment is come. The books are open. Your case will be called. And when it is, may the Advocate who knows your name speak those blessed words: "Father, this one is Mine. Let My blood cover their sins. Confess their name among the redeemed."

Come to Jesus now, while mercy lingers. He will in no wise cast you out.
