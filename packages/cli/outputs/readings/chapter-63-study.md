# Reading 63: Resurrection of the Just

## Introduction

Death stands as the great enemy of mankind—the inevitable consequence of sin that shadows every human life. Yet the gospel declares that this enemy shall not have the final word. Through Jesus Christ, God has provided a complete redemption that reaches even into the grave, promising to call forth His sleeping saints to immortal life. This study traces the biblical foundation for the resurrection hope, revealing how Christ's victory over death becomes ours.

## Core Truths

### The Origin and Universality of Death

The Scriptures trace death directly to humanity's fall into sin:

> _"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned."_ (Romans 5:12)

**Death** is not a natural part of God's original creation but an intruder—the wage of sin (Romans 6:23). Adam was created to live eternally, but his transgression opened the floodgate through which mortality swept over the entire human race.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "death" (_muth_) appears over 800 times in the Old Testament, underscoring how profoundly sin's consequence pervades human experience. Yet remarkably, the word "resurrection" (_anastasis_ in Greek) appears over 40 times in the New Testament—testimony to the shift from despair to hope that Christ brought.

### The Condition of the Dead

Scripture speaks plainly about the state of those who sleep in the grave:

> _"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."_ (Ecclesiastes 9:10)

The dead are not conscious beings floating in another realm. They rest in complete unconsciousness—a dreamless sleep awaiting the resurrection morning. The Bible consistently uses "sleep" as a metaphor for death precisely because sleep is temporary and unconscious (Psalm 13:3; Daniel 12:2; John 11:11-14).

[Q] **"But don't the righteous go immediately to heaven when they die?"**

This common belief, though comforting to many, finds no support in Scripture. Jesus Himself said, _"No man hath ascended up to heaven"_ (John 3:13). David, a man after God's own heart, _"is not ascended into the heavens"_ (Acts 2:34). If the righteous were already in heaven's glory, why would Paul say that without the resurrection, those _"fallen asleep in Christ are perished"_ (1 Corinthians 15:18)? The resurrection would be meaningless if souls already enjoyed eternal bliss. No—the dead await Christ's voice in the grave, and therein lies the preciousness of the resurrection hope.

## Deeper Truths

### God's Promise of Redemption from the Grave

Though death reigns as a consequence of sin, God has declared war against it:

> _"I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction."_ (Hosea 13:14)

Notice the intensity of God's language—He will _plague_ death and _destroy_ the grave. This is not passive acceptance but active conquest. The Hebrew word for "ransom" (_padah_) speaks of liberation through payment of a price—pointing forward to Christ's atoning sacrifice.

### Christ: The Source of Resurrection Life

The resurrection is possible only through Jesus Christ:

> _"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."_ (1 Corinthians 15:21-22)

Just as Adam's sin brought death to all who are connected to him by nature, so Christ's victory brings life to all who are connected to Him by faith. Jesus declared, _"I am the resurrection, and the life"_ (John 11:25). Life does not merely come _through_ Christ—He _is_ life itself.

[ILL] Consider a power outage that plunges an entire city into darkness. One man possesses the only generator capable of restoring light. Without him, all remain in darkness; through him, all may have light. So Christ alone possesses the power of endless life. Apart from Him, humanity lies in the darkness of death; through Him, the light of immortality shines into the grave.

### The Critical Importance of Christ's Resurrection

Paul makes an astonishing statement about what would be true if Christ had not risen:

> _"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished."_ (1 Corinthians 15:16-18)

Without Christ's resurrection:

- Our faith is empty and useless
- We remain unforgiven in our sins
- **Every believer who has died has perished forever**

This third point is devastating to the idea that souls go to heaven at death. If believers were already in glory, how could they "perish" simply because there was no resurrection? Paul's logic only makes sense if the dead are truly dead—unconscious in the grave—and dependent entirely upon the resurrection for eternal life.

[DYK🔎] Christ's resurrection was not merely resuscitation (like Lazarus, who died again) but transformation to immortal life. He became _"the firstfruits of them that slept"_ (1 Corinthians 15:20)—the first sheaf of the harvest, guaranteeing the full harvest to follow.

### Two Resurrections, One Thousand Years Apart

Scripture reveals two distinct resurrections:

> _"There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."_ (Acts 24:15)

> _"And they [the righteous] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection."_ (Revelation 20:4-5)

**The First Resurrection** (of the just):

- Occurs at Christ's second coming
- Includes all the righteous dead
- Called _"the resurrection of life"_ (John 5:29)
- Participants are _"blessed and holy"_ (Revelation 20:6)

**The Second Resurrection** (of the unjust):

- Occurs after the millennium
- Includes all the wicked dead
- Called _"the resurrection of damnation"_ (John 5:29)
- Ends in the second death

## The Glorious Transformation

### Awakening in Christ's Likeness

David expressed the believer's hope with profound simplicity:

> _"As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness."_ (Psalm 17:15)

Notice David's expectation—he would _awake_. He anticipated no conscious intermediate state but a glorious awakening to see God's face and bear His likeness.

### The Contrast Between Mortality and Immortality

Paul describes the stunning transformation:

> _"It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body."_ (1 Corinthians 15:42-44)

| **Present Body** | **Resurrection Body** |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Corruption       | Incorruption          |
| Dishonor         | Glory                 |
| Weakness         | Power                 |
| Natural          | Spiritual             |

A **spiritual body** is not an immaterial ghost but a body animated and empowered by the Spirit of God—real, tangible, yet free from the limitations of fallen flesh.

### Fashioned Like Christ's Glorious Body

> _"We look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body."_ (Philippians 3:20-21)

The resurrection body of the saints will be patterned after Christ's own glorified humanity. After His resurrection, Jesus could eat (Luke 24:42-43), be touched (John 20:27), and yet pass through closed doors (John 20:19). Such will be the marvelous nature of our transformed bodies.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "change" (_metaschematizo_) in Philippians 3:21 means to transform the outward form while maintaining essential identity. You will still be _you_—but glorified, perfected, immortalized.

### The Song of Victory

Isaiah prophesies the joyful response of the risen saints:

> _"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead."_ (Isaiah 26:19)

And Paul declares the triumphant cry:

> _"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"_ (1 Corinthians 15:55)

The grave cannot hold God's people. As dew revives the wilted herb, so God's life-giving power will revive those who sleep in the dust.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and the Resurrection

The resurrection hope connects directly to Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary:

- **The Outer Court** (altar of sacrifice): Christ's death on the cross secured the legal right to raise His people from the grave. _"I will ransom them from the power of the grave"_ (Hosea 13:14).

- **The Holy Place** (ongoing ministry): Christ's present intercession applies His merits to believers, preparing a people whose names remain in the book of life (Revelation 3:5).

- **The Most Holy Place** (investigative judgment): Before Christ returns to raise the dead, He conducts the judgment that determines who rises in the first resurrection and who must await the second. _"Thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just"_ (Luke 14:14).

The resurrection is thus the culmination of Christ's entire saving work—from sacrifice to priesthood to final judgment and return.

### Righteousness by Faith and Resurrection

Only those who are _"in Christ"_ will be made alive at the first resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:22). This is righteousness by faith in its fullest expression:

- We cannot earn resurrection by works—it is Christ's gift
- We receive it through faith, which unites us to Christ
- Those who _"die in the Lord"_ (Revelation 14:13) are covered by His righteousness and will rise when He calls

The resurrection is not reward for good behavior but the fruit of living union with Jesus. As the branch cannot live apart from the vine, we cannot have eternal life apart from Christ (John 15:4-5).

### The Destruction of Death—The Last Enemy

> _"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."_ (1 Corinthians 15:26)

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, death entered as sin's penalty. But God's plan does not merely manage death—it destroys it utterly. After the second resurrection and the lake of fire:

> _"The fearful, and unbelieving... shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."_ (Revelation 21:8)

The second death is the _final_ death—from which there is no resurrection. Death itself will be cast into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14), and _"there shall be no more death"_ (Revelation 21:4).

[Q] **"Isn't eternal torment in hell a worse fate than simply dying?"**

Scripture teaches that the wicked will be destroyed—consumed, not eternally preserved in torment. _"The wages of sin is death"_ (Romans 6:23), not endless life in misery. The fire is "everlasting" in its _results_ (the destruction is permanent), not its _duration_. Malachi 4:1-3 pictures the wicked as stubble burned to ashes under the feet of the righteous. God is not a torturer but a just and merciful Judge who ends sin and suffering forever.

## Practical Application

### Living in Light of the Resurrection

**1. Face death without fear.** The resurrection transforms death from a terrifying end into a brief sleep before eternal morning. _"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me"_ (Psalm 23:4).

**2. Grieve with hope.** We sorrow when loved ones die, but _"not as others which have no hope"_ (1 Thessalonians 4:13). The grave is not a permanent separation but a temporary parting.

**3. Live with urgency.** _"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might"_ (Ecclesiastes 9:10). There is no second chance after death—no purgatory, no reincarnation. Today is the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2).

**4. Maintain vital union with Christ.** Only those _"in Christ"_ will rise in the first resurrection. Abide in Him daily through prayer, His Word, and surrender to His will.

**5. Long for Christ's return.** The resurrection occurs when Jesus comes again. The early church lived in eager expectation, praying _"Maranatha"_—"Come, Lord!" (1 Corinthians 16:22). Let that same hope burn in our hearts.

[ILL] A farmer plants wheat in autumn, watching the seed seemingly die in the cold earth through winter. But he does not despair—he knows that spring will bring forth golden grain from what appeared to be death. So we lay our loved ones in the earth, knowing that the resurrection morning will bring forth an abundant harvest of glorified saints from what seemed to be utter loss.

## Appeal

> _"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."_ (Matthew 13:43)

Dear friend, the resurrection is not a distant doctrine but a living hope meant to transform how you live today. Christ has conquered the grave. He holds the keys of death and hell (Revelation 1:18). If you are united to Him by faith, not even death can separate you from His love (Romans 8:38-39).

Will you be among those who rise in the first resurrection—blessed, holy, awaking to behold Christ's face in righteousness? Or will you neglect so great salvation and face the second death?

The choice is before you now. Christ calls, _"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?"_ (John 11:25-26).

How will you answer?
