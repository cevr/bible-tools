# Bible Study: The Nature of God's Law

## Introduction

God's law stands as an eternal revelation of His unchanging character—holy, just, and good. Far from being a burden or an arbitrary set of rules, the law reflects the very nature of the One who gave it. Understanding the true nature of God's law is essential for every soul seeking salvation, for in it we discover both our need of a Saviour and the path to everlasting life.

## Core Truths

### One Lawgiver, One Law

The foundation of all moral authority rests in a single source:

> _"There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy."_ (James 4:12)

This truth carries profound implications. The God who gave the law is the same God who saves. He did not delegate law-making to another, nor did He create standards He Himself could not uphold. **The Lawgiver and the Saviour are one**—a truth that forever links obedience and salvation in proper relationship.

**Unchanging Character**: Because God's character never changes, His law cannot change:

> _"For I am the Lord, I change not."_ (Malachi 3:6)

> _"The works of His hands are verity and judgment; all His commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness."_ (Psalm 111:7, 8)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word translated "sure" in Psalm 111:7 is _ne'emanim_, meaning "faithful" or "trustworthy"—the same root from which we get "Amen." God's commandments are as reliable as His own "So be it."

### The Spiritual Nature of the Law

Paul reveals a truth that explains humanity's fundamental problem:

> _"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."_ (Romans 7:14)

Here lies the great divide. **The law is spiritual**—it originates from the Spirit of God and can only be truly kept by those who possess His Spirit. But the natural man is _carnal_—fleshly, earthly, unable in his own strength to meet heaven's standard.

This is not a defect in the law but a revelation of our condition. The law serves as a divine mirror, showing us what we truly are apart from Christ:

> _"And knowest His will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law."_ (Romans 2:18)

[Q] **"If the law is spiritual and I am carnal, isn't obedience impossible?"**

This is precisely the point! The law was never given to save us by our own efforts—it was given to show us our need of a Saviour. As Paul wrote, "By the law is the knowledge of sin" (Romans 3:20). The law diagnoses the disease; Christ provides the cure. But here is the gospel truth: what the law demands, grace supplies. Christ does not lower the standard—He lifts us to meet it through His indwelling Spirit (Romans 8:3-4).

## Deeper Truths

### The Law's Converting Power

While the law cannot save us by our own keeping of it, it plays an essential role in conversion:

> _"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple."_ (Psalm 19:7)

How does a law "convert"? By revealing God's perfect standard, the law:

1. **Awakens conscience** to sin's reality
2. **Strips away self-righteousness** and false security
3. **Drives the soul to Christ** for mercy and power
4. **Becomes a guide** for the converted life

The law is like a plumb line held against a crooked wall—it doesn't straighten the wall, but it reveals the crookedness and shows what "straight" truly looks like. The Holy Spirit then uses this revelation to lead us to the Master Builder who can make us straight.

### Christ and the Law

When a young man asked Jesus about eternal life, the Saviour's response was striking:

> _"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."_ (Matthew 19:17)

Did Jesus mean salvation by works? No—for the same Saviour declared:

> _"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."_ (Matthew 5:17)

> _"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."_ (Matthew 5:18)

**Understanding "Fulfil"**: This word requires careful study, for much confusion has arisen from it.

- **In prophecy**, "fulfil" means _to bring to pass_: "That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet" (Matthew 4:14).
- **With obligation**, "fulfil" means _to perform or act in accordance with_: "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2).

Christ fulfilled the law by:

- **Living it perfectly** in His humanity
- **Revealing its true spiritual depth** (Matthew 5:21-48)
- **Demonstrating it as a law of love**
- **Making it possible for us to keep through His Spirit**

[DYK🔎] The Greek word _plēroō_ (fulfil) literally means "to fill up" or "to make full." Christ filled the law to its fullest meaning—not emptying it of obligation but revealing its complete spiritual significance.

### The Danger of Human Tradition

Christ reserved some of His strongest rebukes for those who substituted human tradition for divine commandment:

> _"Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"_ (Matthew 15:3)

> _"Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition."_ (Matthew 15:6)

> _"But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."_ (Matthew 15:9)

The Pharisees appeared zealous for the law, yet they had actually nullified it by their additions and interpretations. They tithed mint and cummin while neglecting justice, mercy, and faith (Matthew 23:23).

[ILL] Consider a man who inherits a beautiful garden with clear instructions from his father: "Water the roses daily, prune the hedges seasonally, and keep the paths clear." But instead of following these simple instructions, he builds an elaborate fence around the garden so no one can enter, posts guards at every corner, and writes a thousand rules about how to approach the gate—all while the roses wither and the paths become overgrown. He has made his father's instructions "of none effect" by his traditions. So it is when human rules crowd out God's simple commands, and outward ceremony replaces heart obedience.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law in the Great Controversy

The law of God stands at the very center of the conflict between good and evil. Satan's original accusation was that God's law is arbitrary, unnecessary, and impossible to keep. By attacking the law, he attacks the character of the Lawgiver.

Christ came to vindicate the law:

> _"Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of Me,) to do Thy will, O God."_ (Hebrews 10:7)

In His life of perfect obedience, Jesus demonstrated that:

- **The law is not arbitrary**—it reflects God's loving character
- **The law is necessary**—it defines the principles of life and happiness
- **The law can be kept**—by humanity connected to divinity

### Righteousness That Exceeds

Christ set forth a startling standard:

> _"Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven."_ (Matthew 5:20)

The Pharisees' righteousness was:

- **External** rather than internal
- **Self-generated** rather than Christ-given
- **Letter-focused** rather than spirit-filled
- **Pride-producing** rather than humility-producing

The righteousness that exceeds is:

- **Heart obedience** flowing from love
- **Christ's righteousness** imputed and imparted
- **Spirit-empowered** rather than flesh-driven
- **Humble dependence** on divine grace

This is righteousness by faith—not a lower standard, but a higher one; not less obedience, but true obedience from a transformed heart.

### The Law as Judge

Scripture declares that the law will be the standard in the judgment:

> _"As many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law... in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ."_ (Romans 2:12, 16)

> _"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."_ (Romans 3:19)

The law will stop every mouth—no excuse, no self-justification will stand. All will be found guilty. This is not to condemn us eternally but to drive us to the only source of righteousness—Christ Jesus.

[Q] **"If everyone is found guilty by the law, what hope is there?"**

Blessed hope! The same law that condemns us points us to the Saviour. In the sanctuary service, the law was kept _inside_ the ark, beneath the mercy seat, where the blood was sprinkled. Justice and mercy meet at the cross. Those who have accepted Christ's sacrifice, confessed their sins, and allowed Him to write His law on their hearts will not face condemnation but vindication. The law that once condemned them now witnesses to their transformation.

## Practical Application

### Living Under the Law's Blessing

What does this mean for daily Christian living?

**1. See the law rightly**—not as an enemy but as a friend; not as a burden but as a guide; not as a means of salvation but as a revelation of the Saviour's character.

**2. Let the law do its work**—allow it to reveal your sin, humble your pride, and drive you daily to Christ for cleansing and power.

**3. Reject human substitutes**—test every tradition, every practice, every doctrine by the Word of God. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20).

**4. Aim for heart obedience**—not mere external conformity but genuine love for God expressed in willing obedience. "If ye love Me, keep My commandments" (John 14:15).

**5. Trust Christ for victory**—you cannot keep the law in your own strength. But "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13). What He commands, He enables.

### The Final Blessing

Those who, through Christ's grace, keep God's commandments receive the ultimate blessing:

> _"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."_ (Revelation 22:14)

Notice: it is not their commandment-keeping that _earns_ them the tree of life—it is their commandment-keeping that demonstrates they have _received_ Christ's life. The obedient are blessed because obedience is the fruit of a living connection with Jesus, the source of all life.

## Appeal

> _"Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."_ (Matthew 25:34)

Friend, God's law reveals His unchanging character of love. It shows us our sin and points us to the Saviour. It guides the converted soul and will be the standard in the judgment.

Have you allowed the law to do its work in your heart? Have you seen your need and fled to Christ? Are you daily surrendering to His Spirit, allowing Him to write His law on your heart and live His life through you?

The Lawgiver is also the Saviour. He who gave the commandments also gives the power to keep them. He who will judge by the law also offers full pardon and transforming grace to all who trust in Him.

Come to Him today. Accept His righteousness. Let His Spirit work in you "both to will and to do of His good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13). And one day, hear those blessed words: "Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you."
