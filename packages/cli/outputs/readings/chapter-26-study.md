# Reading 26: Consecration

## Introduction

Consecration is the act of setting oneself apart wholly for God's service and glory. In the Old Testament, priests were anointed and set apart for sacred ministry; in the New Testament, every believer is called to this same holy separation. True consecration is not mere religious sentiment—it is a complete surrender of all we have and are to Christ, that He might live His life through us and make us partakers of His divine nature.

## Core Truths

### A Royal Priesthood Called Out

In ancient Israel, Aaron and his sons were anointed and consecrated to minister before the Lord in the priest's office (Exodus 30:30). This was not a calling they chose for themselves—God set them apart for sacred service.

> _"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvellous light."_ (1 Peter 2:9)

Today, every believer is called to this same holy priesthood—not to offer animal sacrifices, but to offer themselves as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1). Peter reminds us that before this calling, we "were not a people, but are now the people of God" (1 Peter 2:10). We have been called out of the darkness of sin, ignorance, and worldliness into God's marvellous light.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "peculiar" (_peripoiēsis_) means "a purchased possession"—God's own special treasure. We are not merely set apart; we are **owned** by the One who bought us with His precious blood.

**Consecration**: The act of being set apart wholly for God's use and glory; to dedicate oneself unreservedly to His service (Psalm 4:3; Romans 12:1).

### The Public Commitment of Baptism

When one comes to Christ, the outward symbol of this inward consecration is baptism:

> _"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ."_ (Galatians 3:27)

Baptism is not merely a ritual—it is a public declaration that we have died to self and risen to walk in newness of life (Romans 6:3–4). We "put on" Christ as a garment, signifying that His righteousness now covers us and His character is to be reproduced in us.

## Deeper Truths

### The Cost of Discipleship

When Jesus invites weary souls to come to Him, He offers rest—but He also offers a yoke:

> _"Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart."_ (Matthew 11:28–29)

A yoke binds two together for labor. Christ invites us not merely to receive forgiveness, but to walk with Him, to learn of Him, to be transformed by daily fellowship with Him.

But this discipleship comes at a cost:

> _"If any man come to Me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple."_ (Luke 14:26)

> _"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple."_ (Luke 14:33)

[Q] **"Does Jesus really want us to hate our families?"**

Not at all. The Hebrew idiom behind "hate" means to love less by comparison. Christ is saying that our devotion to Him must be so supreme that all other loves—even the dearest earthly bonds—are secondary. When any relationship or possession stands between us and full surrender to Christ, it becomes an idol. True consecration means Christ occupies the throne of the heart, and everything else takes its proper place beneath Him.

[ILL] Consider a man who inherits a great estate. If he wishes to claim it, he must sign the deed—transferring legal ownership to himself. But if he refuses to sign, the estate remains beyond his reach. So it is with consecration: God offers us "exceeding great and precious promises" (2 Peter 1:4), but we must sign the deed of surrender. Until we give all to Him, we cannot receive all He offers.

### The World's Hatred and the Believer's Separation

Jesus warned that following Him would bring opposition—sometimes from those closest to us:

> _"A man's foes shall be they of his own household."_ (Matthew 10:36)

> _"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you."_ (John 15:19)

The world hates the consecrated Christian because his life is a living rebuke to worldliness. The light exposes the darkness. This should not surprise or discourage us—it is the very mark of genuine discipleship.

## Abiding in Christ: The Secret of Fruitfulness

### The Vine and the Branches

True consecration is not mere outward separation—it is inward union with Christ:

> _"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing."_ (John 15:5)

The branch does not struggle to produce fruit by its own effort. It simply **abides**—remaining connected to the vine, drawing sap and life from the source. So the consecrated believer does not manufacture holiness by self-effort; he receives Christ's life by faith, and fruit appears naturally.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "abide" (_menō_) means to remain, continue, dwell. It speaks of a settled, permanent relationship—not a fleeting visit, but a constant home. Christ invites us to make our permanent dwelling in Him.

### The Test of the Spirit

How may we know if our consecration is genuine?

> _"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His."_ (Romans 8:9)

> _"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance."_ (Galatians 5:22–23)

The evidence of true consecration is not religious fervor or emotional experience—it is **character transformation**. Where Christ dwells, His fruit appears. Love replaces selfishness; peace replaces anxiety; gentleness replaces harshness; self-control replaces indulgence.

### The Mind of Christ

> _"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who... made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant... He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death."_ (Philippians 2:5–8)

The fully consecrated believer has the **mind of Christ**—the mind of humility, service, and willing obedience. Christ "made Himself of no reputation." He who was equal with God took the lowest place that we might be lifted up. This is the pattern for all who would follow Him.

> _"He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked."_ (1 John 2:6)

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Consecration

In the sanctuary service, consecration was vividly illustrated. The priest could not serve until he was anointed with holy oil (Exodus 30:30)—a symbol of the Holy Spirit's indwelling. He must wash at the laver before entering the holy place (Exodus 30:19–21)—symbolizing cleansing from sin. Only then could he minister before God.

So today, we cannot serve acceptably until we are anointed by the Spirit, cleansed by the blood of Christ, and set apart for holy use. The sanctuary teaches that consecration is not optional—it is the **prerequisite** for spiritual ministry.

- **The Outer Court (Altar of Sacrifice)**: We come to Christ, laying our sins upon Him who died for us. This is justification—acceptance through His merits.
- **The Laver**: We are washed, cleansed, made ready for service.
- **The Holy Place**: Daily ministry—living in the light of God's Word, fed by the Bread of Life, offering the incense of prayer.
- **The Most Holy Place**: The deepest consecration—where nothing is withheld, where Christ's righteousness is fully imparted, where the believer is prepared for translation.

### Righteousness by Faith and Consecration

The call to consecration is not a call to human self-effort. We cannot make ourselves holy by willpower or religious discipline. The promises of God are given "that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust" (2 Peter 1:4).

**Partaking of the divine nature** is not human achievement—it is divine gift received by faith. We surrender; Christ transforms. We yield; He empowers. We abide; He produces fruit.

[Q] **"But doesn't this sound like works? Isn't salvation by grace alone?"**

Consecration is not the **cause** of salvation but the **response** to it. We are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8). But that saving grace transforms us. The branch that abides in the vine **will** bear fruit—not to earn acceptance, but because life flows from the Source. A consecrated life is the natural result of a living connection with Christ, not a human effort to earn God's favor.

## Practical Application

This truth calls us to:

1. **Acknowledge that we belong to God.** "Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's" (1 Corinthians 6:19–20). Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit—how we eat, drink, dress, speak, and live matters.

2. **Surrender all competing loyalties.** Is there any relationship, possession, ambition, or habit that stands between you and full surrender to Christ? He asks for **all**. "Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple" (Luke 14:33).

3. **Abide daily in Christ.** Consecration is not a one-time event but a daily, hourly dependence upon Christ. Each morning, place yourself anew upon the altar. Each moment, choose to remain connected to the Vine.

4. **Stand ready for service.** When God calls, the consecrated soul responds as Isaiah did: "Here am I; send me" (Isaiah 6:8). The eyes of the true servant are ever upon the Master's hand, watching for direction (Psalm 123:2).

5. **Expect opposition and rejoice in it.** If the world hates you, remember that it hated Christ first (John 15:18). Persecution is the badge of true discipleship.

[ILL] A servant in a great house does not fix his eyes on the guests, the decorations, or the feast. His eyes are upon his master's hand, watching for the slightest gesture—ready instantly to obey. So the consecrated Christian watches the hand of his Lord, ready at a moment's notice to go, to speak, to serve, to wait. This is the spirit of true consecration.

## Appeal

> _"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."_ (Romans 12:1)

Dear friend, have you made this full surrender? Have you placed **all** upon the altar—your plans, your possessions, your relationships, your very self? Christ gave all for you; He asks for all in return. This is not a hard demand—it is an invitation to the only life worth living.

The consecrated life is not a life of gloomy sacrifice—it is a life of joy, peace, and fruitfulness. The branch that abides in the vine is the branch that flourishes. The servant whose eyes are fixed upon the Master's hand is the servant who walks in perfect peace.

Will you say today, with Isaiah, "Here am I; send me"? Will you place your eyes upon the hand of your Lord, ready to do His will in all things?

Christ is waiting. The altar is ready. The anointing oil of the Spirit is prepared. Will you come?
