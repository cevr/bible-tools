### Q1. By what act were Aaron and his sons set apart for the priesthood?

"And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may
minister unto Me in the priest's office." Ex. 30:30.

**Answer:** In the earthly sanctuary service, which was a shadow of heavenly
things (Hebrews 8:5), God commanded that the priests be set apart through a
specific ceremony of washing and anointing.

1.  **The Meaning of Anointing:** In Scripture, oil is a symbol of the Holy
    Spirit. Just as the physical oil was poured upon Aaron, the Holy Spirit was
    poured out upon Christ (the Messiah, or "Anointed One") at His baptism (Acts
    10:38), and is promised to every believer today.
2.  **Consecration Defined:** To "consecrate" means to fill the hand or to set
    apart strictly for holy use. A consecrated person is no longer common
    property; they belong exclusively to God.
3.  **Sanctuary Application:** Before a priest could minister in the holy place,
    he had to be cleansed and anointed. Similarly, before we can serve God
    effectively, we must be washed by the blood of Christ (**Justification**)
    and anointed by His Spirit (**Sanctification**).

**[ILL]** Consider a cup in your kitchen. If it is used for drinking water, it
is useful. But if you take that same cup and use it to mix poison or hold trash,
it becomes unfit for its original purpose. Consecration is the act of taking a
vessel that has been misused by sin, washing it clean, and setting it on the
King’s table, saying, "This cup is now reserved only for the King’s wine."

### Q2. What are God's people now called?

"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar
people." 1 Peter 2:9.

**Answer:** The Levitical priesthood of the Old Testament was a type, but now,
under the New Covenant, all true believers are called to be priests.

- **A Royal Priesthood:** We are called "royal" because we belong to the King of
  kings, and "priests" because we have direct access to the Father through Jesus
  Christ (Hebrews 4:16). We no longer need a human mediator to confess our sins
  to; Christ is our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.
- **A Peculiar People:** In Old English, "peculiar" meant a special, private
  possession or treasure (like a "peculium"). God values His people as His
  supreme treasure on earth.
- **A Holy Nation:** Holiness is not merely a title; it is a condition of the
  heart. It means being separated from the customs and sins of the world and
  dedicated to the laws of God's kingdom.

---

### Q3. What were they before being a "chosen" people?

"Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God." 1 Peter
2:10.

**Answer:** This verse describes the mighty change involved in conversion.

1.  **The State of the Lost:** Before accepting Christ, we were "not a people."
    Sin isolates us. It separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2) and alienates us
    from the covenant of promise (Ephesians 2:12). Without God, humanity has no
    true identity and no eternal future.
2.  **The Power of Adoption:** When we accept Christ, we are adopted into the
    family of God. This is **Justification**—God declaring the repentant sinner
    to be His own child, righteous and accepted in the Beloved.
3.  **Identity Shift:** We move from being orphans of sin to being sons and
    daughters of the King. This change is immediate upon the exercise of saving
    faith.

---

### Q4. Out of what were they called?

"That ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of
darkness into His marvelous light." 1 Peter 2:9.

**Answer:** The call of the Gospel is a relocation of the soul.

- **From Darkness:** The Bible describes the world under Satan's influence as
  "darkness" (Colossians 1:13). This darkness represents ignorance of God's
  character, the confusion of sin, and the hopelessness of the grave.
- **Into Marvelous Light:** God is light (1 John 1:5). To be called into His
  light means to understand His truth, to see the beauty of His law, and to walk
  in the clarity of His presence.
- **The Purpose:** We are called out _so that_ we may "show forth" His praises.
  A consecrated life is a reflector, catching the rays of the Sun of
  Righteousness (Malachi 4:2) and beaming them into a dark world.

**[ILL]** Imagine a miner trapped in a deep, sunless cavern for years. Suddenly,
a rescuer breaks through and leads him up to the surface at noon. The contrast
is blinding and overwhelming. This is the experience of a soul when the light of
the "Three Angels' Messages"—the everlasting gospel—breaks upon the mind,
revealing Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary and His law of love.

---

### Q5. For whom are the godly consecrated?

"But know that the Lord has set apart him that is godly for Himself." Ps. 4:3.

**Answer:** Consecration is ultimately about ownership.

1.  **"For Himself":** God does not save us merely to keep us out of hell; He
    saves us because He loves us and wants us for His own. He desires to dwell
    in us (Exodus 25:8; Colossians 1:27).
2.  **Godliness:** To be "godly" means to be like God. This is the goal of
    **Sanctification**—the process by which the Holy Spirit restores the moral
    image of God in man.
3.  **Sanctuary Truth:** Just as the furniture in the temple was "set apart"
    exclusively for God's use, the believer's mind, body, and talents are to be
    reserved for God's glory. We are not to lend our influence to the enemy of
    souls.

---

### Q6. By what act does one publicly take on the Lord Jesus?

"For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." Gal.
3:27.

**Answer:** Baptism is the public ordination service of the believer.

- **Putting on Christ:** This phrase refers to the robe of Christ's
  righteousness.
  - _Imputed Righteousness:_ At baptism, we acknowledge that our own life is
    filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6) and we accept the perfect life of Jesus as our
    title to heaven.
  - _Death and Resurrection:_ Baptism represents going down into the grave
    (death to the old self) and rising to "newness of life" (Romans 6:4).
- **A Change of Uniform:** A soldier puts on a uniform to show which army he
  serves. By baptism, we publicly declare that we have defected from Satan's
  army and are now soldiers of the cross.

**Definitions:**

- **Justification:** God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is
  righteous because of Christ's merits (Romans 3:24).
- **Imputed Righteousness:** The credit of Christ's perfect life given to us.

### Q7. When one comes to Christ, what should he desire to do?

"Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart." Matt.
11:28, 29.

**Answer:** True rest is found not in inactivity, but in consecrated service.

1.  **The Yoke of Service:** A yoke is a tool used to couple two oxen together
    to pull a load. Jesus invites us to get in the yoke _with_ Him. He bears the
    heavy end of the burden; we simply walk in step with Him.
2.  **Learning of Him:** Consecration implies a teachable spirit. We cannot walk
    with Christ if we insist on going our own way. We must learn His meekness
    and lowliness.
3.  **Rest for the Soul:** The "heavy laden" are those burdened by the guilt of
    sin and the exhaustion of trying to earn salvation by works. Christ offers
    the rest of grace—trusting in His finished work while serving Him out of
    love.

**[ILL]** Watch two oxen plowing. If the younger ox fights the yoke, it chafes
its neck and becomes exhausted. If it yields to the lead ox, the work is
accomplished easily. When we fight God’s will, life is hard. When we surrender
to His yoke, we find that His "commandments are not grievous" (1 John 5:3).

---

### Q8. If one would come to Christ to be a learner or disciple of Him, what must he be willing to give up?

"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My
disciple." Luke 14:26.

**Answer:** This is a hard saying that reveals the absolute nature of
consecration.

- **The Meaning of "Hate":** Jesus is not commanding malice or anger. In Bible
  idiom, to "hate" often means "to love less" in comparison to something else
  (see Matthew 6:24). Our love for Christ must be so supreme that our earthly
  attachments seem like hate by comparison.
- **The First Commandment:** "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" (Exodus
  20:3). Even good things—family, reputation, life itself—become idols if they
  take the place of God.
- **Supreme Loyalty:** If a family member asks us to disobey a plain command of
  God (such as breaking the Sabbath or dishonesty), our loyalty to Christ must
  prevail.

---

### Q9. How emphatic does the Saviour, then, make the conditions of one's discipleship?

"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he
cannot be My disciple." Luke 14:33.

**Answer:** Christ claims the whole heart or none of it.

1.  **Forsaking All:** This does not necessarily mean we must sell every
    possession and live in poverty (though God may call some to that). It means
    we must renounce our _ownership_ of everything. We become stewards, not
    owners. Our money, time, and talents are held in trust for Him.
2.  **The Transaction of Grace:** We are not "buying" heaven by giving up our
    sins or possessions. Rather, we are emptying our hands of trash so that we
    may receive the gold of the kingdom.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot hold onto a known sin and hold onto
    Jesus at the same time. Faith involves a total surrender of the will. As
    long as we cling to "one pet sin," we cut off the channel of God's power.

**[ILL]** A child holds a sharp piece of broken glass, thinking it is a diamond.
The father offers a real diamond but says, "You must drop the glass to take
this." The child cannot have both. We must drop the world to take hold of
Christ.

---

### Q10. What does he say the acceptance of Christ will cause in some cases?

"I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against
her mother, and the daughter-in -law against her mother-in-law. And a man's foes
shall be they of his own household." Matt. 10:35, 36.

**Answer:** The Gospel brings peace to the heart, but often brings division to
the home.

- **The Inevitable Conflict:** Light and darkness cannot coexist in harmony.
  When one member of a family consecrates their life to God and begins to keep
  His commandments (such as the seventh-day Sabbath), it often irritates the
  conscience of those who do not wish to obey.
- **A Test of Faith:** This variance is a test. Will we love Jesus more than the
  approval of our closest relatives?
- **Endurance:** The consecrated Christian responds to this hostility not with
  anger, but with patience, prayer, and a consistent, loving life, hoping to win
  their loved ones to the truth (1 Peter 3:1).

---

### Q11. Why does all the world unite to hate the true Christian?

"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not
of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth
you." John 15:19.

**Answer:** There are two great kingdoms in conflict: the kingdom of Satan (the
world) and the kingdom of Christ.

- **The Spirit of the World:** The world operates on principles of
  self-exaltation, force, pride, and indulgence.
- **The Spirit of Christ:** The Christian operates on principles of
  self-sacrifice, service, humility, and obedience to God's law.
- **The Friction:** A holy life is a constant, silent rebuke to a sinful life.
  Because the consecrated person does not run with the world to the "same excess
  of riot" (1 Peter 4:4), the world feels condemned and reacts with hatred or
  ridicule. We must not be surprised by this; it is a badge of our discipleship.

---

### Q12. How closely does Christ unite His followers to Himself?

"I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the
same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing." John 15:5.

**Answer:** This is the core teaching of **Righteousness by Faith**.

1.  **Vital Connection:** A branch does not have life in itself. It only lives
    as long as it is connected to the vine. The moment the connection is broken,
    the branch withers.
2.  **Dependence:** "Without Me ye can do nothing." We cannot generate one
    righteous thought or perform one truly good deed apart from the indwelling
    life of Christ. We are not just weak without Him; we are helpless.
3.  **The Sap of the Spirit:** The Holy Spirit is the "sap" that flows from
    Christ (the Vine) into us (the branches), bringing life and producing fruit.

**[ILL]** A branch does not "try hard" to produce grapes. It does not grunt and
strain. It simply _abides_ (stays connected) to the vine, and the vine pushes
the life into it. So the Christian produces the fruit of obedience not by
legalistic straining, but by maintaining a living, daily connection with Jesus.

---

### Q13. If one does not bear the same fruit as Christ, what may be a safe conclusion?

"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His." Rom. 8:9.

**Answer:** Profession is nothing without possession.

- **The Test:** We may have our names on the church books, we may pay tithe, we
  may keep the Sabbath outwardly; but if the Spirit of Christ—the spirit of
  love, humility, and obedience—is not in us, we do not belong to Him.
- **The Warning:** This verse guards against "cheap grace" or the idea that we
  can be saved while continuing to live in willful sin. A changed life is the
  inevitable result of a saving union with Christ.

---

### Q14. But if one has the Spirit of Christ, what fruit will he bear?

"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." Gal. 5:22, 23.

**Answer:** These virtues are the definition of true Christian character.

1.  **Fruit, not Fruits:** The word is singular. It is one cluster of fruit. You
    cannot have true faith without temperance, or true peace without meekness.
    It is the wholeness of the character of God.
2.  **Sanctification:** This is **Imparted Righteousness**. It is Christ's own
    character being lived out in our flesh.
3.  **Against Such There is No Law:** The law of God condemns sin. But the law
    has no condemnation for these virtues because these virtues _are_ the
    keeping of the law. To love God and man is the fulfilling of the law (Romans
    13:10).

**Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God's grace by which He makes the
  believer holy in character and life, conforming them to the image of Christ (1
  Thessalonians 4:3).

---

### Q15. If one is really a consecrated learner of Christ, what mind will he have?

"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." Phil. 2:5.

**Answer:** Consecration involves the renovation of the mind.

- **The Mind of Christ:** The "mind" refers to the attitude, the disposition,
  and the governing purpose. We are to view the world, sin, and our neighbors
  exactly as Jesus views them.
- **Transformation:** "Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Romans
  12:2). The Holy Spirit writes the law of God not just on stone, but in our
  minds and hearts (Hebrews 8:10).

---

### Q16. What was the mind of Christ?

"But made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant,...
and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient
unto death." Phil. 2:7, 8.

**Answer:** The mind of Christ is defined by self-sacrificing love and perfect
obedience.

1.  **Self-Abnegation:** Lucifer fell because he said, "I will be like the Most
    High" (Isaiah 14:14). Christ redeems us by saying, "I will take the form of
    a servant." Consecration is the death of pride.
2.  **Obedience unto Death:** Jesus did not obey only when it was easy. He
    obeyed even when it cost Him His life.
3.  **Our Standard:** If we have the mind of Christ, we will not ask, "Is this
    convenient?" We will ask, "Is this God's will?" and we will obey regardless
    of the cost. This is the victory over sin that God promises to the believer.

---

### Q17. If one abides in Christ, how should he walk?

"He that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk, even as He
walked." 1 John 2:6.

**Answer:** The life of Jesus is the pattern for the life of the believer.

- **The Walk:** Walking implies daily progress and lifestyle.
- **As He Walked:** How did Jesus walk?
  - He kept His Father's commandments (John 15:10).
  - He went about doing good (Acts 10:38).
  - He lived in constant communion with Heaven.
- **The Implication:** It is impossible to claim we are "abiding" in Christ
  while willfully walking in disobedience to God's law. The two cannot coexist.
  If we are in Him, His life of obedience will flow through us.

---

### Q18. For what purpose have the promises of God been bestowed on the world?

"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these
ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that
is in the world through lust." 2 Peter 1:4.

**Answer:** Here is the secret of victory over sin.

1.  **The Power of the Promise:** God's Word possesses creative power. When we
    claim a promise (like "He is faithful... to cleanse us from all
    unrighteousness"), and believe it, the Spirit performs that very work in us.
2.  **Partakers of Divine Nature:** We are human, but through the Holy Spirit,
    we are connected to the Divine. This infusion of divine power enables us to
    do what human nature cannot do—overcome hereditary and cultivated tendencies
    to sin.
3.  **Escaping Corruption:** We do not fight sin merely by willpower; we escape
    it by being filled with a higher nature. Darkness is dispelled by the
    presence of light.

---

### Q19. Then what does one's body become?

"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
you, which ye have of God?" 1 Cor. 6:19.

**Answer:** The doctrine of the Sanctuary applies to the individual believer.

- **The Body Temple:** Just as the Shekinah glory dwelt in the Most Holy Place
  of the earthly sanctuary, the Holy Spirit desires to dwell in our minds and
  bodies.
- **Implications for Health:** If our body is God's temple, we must not defile
  it. This is the biblical basis for **Health Reform**. We should not put
  anything into this temple that destroys it or numbs the mind (alcohol,
  tobacco, unclean foods, harmful drugs), because a clouded mind cannot clearly
  hear the voice of God.

---

### Q20. In that case, to whom does one belong, and what is he to do?

"And ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God
in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's." 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.

**Answer:** We are God's property by creation and by redemption.

1.  **Bought with a Price:** That price was the precious blood of Christ (1
    Peter 1:18-19). The infinite cost paid for us at Calvary shows the infinite
    value God places on us.
2.  **Not Your Own:** Since we have been purchased, we have no right to do as we
    please with our bodies or our lives.
3.  **Glorify God:** To glorify God means to reveal His character. We are to
    represent Him in how we treat our bodies (health) and how we use our spirits
    (worship and intellect).

**Definition:**

- **Atonement:** The work by which God and man are brought back into oneness
  (at-one-ment) through Christ’s sacrifice and priestly ministry. It includes
  the price paid at the cross and the restoration of the believer to God's
  favor.

---

### Q21. When thus given to God, what position will one occupy?

"Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go
for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me." Isa. 6:8.

**Answer:** Consecration always leads to service.

- **The Sequence:** Notice that Isaiah first saw the glory of God, then saw his
  own sinfulness ("Woe is me"), was cleansed by the coal from the altar
  (Justification/Sanctification), and _then_ immediately offered himself for
  service.
- **"Here Am I":** The consecrated heart does not wait to be drafted; it
  volunteers. Whether the call is to a foreign mission field or to speak a word
  of encouragement to a neighbor, the consecrated person is ready.

---

### Q22. How does David express this willing frame of mind in the servant of God?

"Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the
eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord
our God, until that He have mercy upon us." Ps. 123:2.

**Answer:** This describes a state of attentive, continuous surrender.

1.  **Waiting on the Lord:** Just as a good servant watches the master's hand
    for the slightest signal of his will, the believer keeps their eyes fixed on
    Jesus (Hebrews 12:2).
2.  **Total Dependence:** We look to Him for our "daily bread," for our
    instructions, and for the mercy and grace to perform His will.
3.  **The Conclusion:** Consecration is not a one-time event; it is a
    moment-by-moment attitude of the heart that says, "Lord, what will You have
    me to do?" (Acts 9:6). It is living in the presence of the High Priest,
    ready to do His bidding.
