# Bible Study: Origin, History, and Destiny of Satan

## Introduction

The Bible reveals a startling truth: evil did not originate with humanity. Before Adam and Eve fell in Eden, rebellion had already broken out in the very courts of heaven. Understanding Satan's origin, fall, and ultimate destiny is essential for grasping the great controversy between Christ and Satan—the cosmic conflict behind all human history. This study traces the adversary's story from his exalted beginning to his appointed end, showing how God's justice and mercy work together to forever eliminate sin from the universe.

## Core Truths

### Angels Also Sinned

Scripture reveals that the human race was not the first to fall into sin:

> _"God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment."_ (2 Peter 2:4)

The word translated "hell" here is the Greek _tartaroo_, used only once in the New Testament. It refers not to a place of burning, but to a condition of restraint and darkness—a "prison" of limited sphere until the final judgment.

[DYK🔎] The "chains of darkness" are not literal chains but describe Satan's restriction to this dark world, cut off from the light and glory of heaven. He and his angels are confined to earth's atmosphere, awaiting their appointed doom (Jude 6; Revelation 12:9).

### The Names of the Adversary

The leader of the fallen angels bears several names, each revealing aspects of his character:

> _"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world."_ (Revelation 12:9)

- **Devil** (_diabolos_): "Slanderer" or "accuser"—he maligns God's character and accuses the brethren (Revelation 12:10)
- **Satan**: "Adversary" or "opponent"—he opposes God and His people
- **Dragon**: Symbol of ferocity and destructive power
- **Old Serpent**: Connecting him to Eden's temptation (Genesis 3:1)

> _"Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."_ (Matthew 25:41)

Note carefully: the everlasting fire was **prepared for the devil and his angels**, not for human beings. Those who perish in that fire do so only because they have allied themselves with Satan rather than with Christ.

### Satan's Original Position and Perfection

Before his fall, this being occupied the highest position any created being could hold:

> _"Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire."_ (Ezekiel 28:14)

> _"Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee."_ (Ezekiel 28:15)

[DYK🔎] The term "covering cherub" connects directly to the sanctuary. In the earthly tabernacle, two golden cherubim overshadowed the mercy seat upon the ark of the covenant (Exodus 25:18–22; Hebrews 9:3–5). This earthly sanctuary was a "pattern" of the heavenly temple (Hebrews 8:5; 9:23). Satan once stood in the immediate presence of God's throne, next to the very law of God contained in the ark!

### The Sanctuary Connection

The earthly sanctuary helps us understand Satan's original position and the magnitude of his fall:

> _"And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercy seat."_ (Hebrews 9:5)

> _"I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony."_ (Exodus 25:22)

> _"The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved."_ (Psalm 99:1)

The heavenly reality confirms this:

> _"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament."_ (Revelation 11:19)

Satan stood in the most sacred position in the universe—beside God's throne, near the ark containing God's holy law. His rebellion therefore struck at the very heart of God's government.

[ILL] Imagine a trusted advisor to a king—one who stands beside the throne, who hears every counsel, who basks in the king's favor above all others. Now imagine that same counselor secretly plotting to overthrow the throne, whispering lies about the king to every ear that will listen. Such was Satan's treachery—only infinitely worse, for his King was the eternal, loving God of the universe.

## Deeper Truths

### The Mystery of Iniquity

How did sin originate in a perfect being created by a perfect God? Scripture gives us glimpses but preserves a certain mystery:

> _"Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee."_ (Ezekiel 28:15)

The text says iniquity was "found" in him—it appeared where before there was none. God did not create evil; He created a free being who chose to rebel.

> _"By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire."_ (Ezekiel 28:16)

The word "merchandise" suggests trafficking—a spreading of disaffection, a trading in falsehood. Satan circulated his discontent among the angels until rebellion ripened into open war.

[Q] **"If God is all-powerful and all-knowing, why did He create a being He knew would rebel?"**

God could have created beings incapable of choosing evil—but such beings could never truly love. Love requires freedom, and freedom includes the possibility of its misuse. God considered it worthwhile to create beings capable of genuine love, even knowing some would abuse their freedom. The cross demonstrates how far God was willing to go to redeem the results of that freedom. Moreover, the universe will eventually see that God's way is the only way that leads to happiness, and rebellion will never arise again (Nahum 1:9).

### Satan's Fall from Heaven

Christ Himself testified to Satan's expulsion:

> _"And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven."_ (Luke 10:18)

This fall was not gradual but sudden and dramatic—"as lightning." When Satan's rebellion reached its full measure, heaven could no longer contain him.

> _"And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."_ (Revelation 12:9)

[DYK🔎] Revelation 12:4 suggests that Satan drew "the third part of the stars of heaven" with him in his rebellion. If "stars" here symbolize angels (as in Revelation 1:20), then one-third of heaven's angelic host joined the rebellion. The conflict in heaven involved a massive defection.

### Satan's Character Revealed

Since his fall, Satan's true nature has been fully manifested:

> _"He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning."_ (1 John 3:8)

> _"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it."_ (John 8:44)

Two essential characteristics define Satan:

1. **Murderer**—he brought death into the world through sin
2. **Liar**—he is the originator and father of all falsehood

The phrase "from the beginning" connects to creation's dawn:

> _"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."_ (Genesis 1:1)

Satan's rebellion and deception began at the earliest point of earth's history, when he approached Eve in Eden. He has never been in the truth since his fall.

### Satan's Assault on Christ

When God's Son came to redeem humanity, Satan focused all his malice upon Him:

> _"And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan."_ (Mark 1:12–13)

> _"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."_ (Hebrews 4:15)

Christ endured every category of temptation we face—and more. Where Adam fell in a perfect garden with every need supplied, Christ stood firm in a barren wilderness, weakened by forty days of fasting. His victory proves that through divine power, humanity can overcome.

[ILL] A skilled enemy general studies his opponent carefully before battle. Satan had observed humanity for four thousand years before Christ came. He knew every weakness, every successful strategy, every point where humans had failed. He brought the full force of his accumulated cunning against the Son of God—and was defeated. That same conquering Christ now offers His victory to every believing soul.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Cosmic Conflict

The great controversy between Christ and Satan forms the backdrop of all human history. Satan's initial accusations in heaven questioned God's character, His law, and His government:

- Is God truly loving, or is He arbitrary and severe?
- Is God's law necessary, or is it an unnecessary burden?
- Can created beings truly keep God's law, or is obedience impossible?

The plan of salvation answers each accusation:

- **The cross** reveals God's infinite love (John 3:16; Romans 5:8)
- **The law** is shown to be holy, just, and good—the transcript of God's character (Romans 7:12; Psalm 19:7)
- **Christ's life and the lives of His faithful followers** demonstrate that obedience is possible through divine grace (Philippians 4:13; Revelation 14:12)

### Satan's War Against the Church

> _"And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child."_ (Revelation 12:13)

The "woman" represents God's church throughout history. Satan, unable to destroy Christ directly, has turned his rage upon Christ's followers. The blood of countless martyrs testifies to this ongoing war.

> _"And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."_ (Revelation 12:17)

The "remnant"—God's last-day people—will face Satan's final fury. Why? Because they keep **the commandments of God** (including the seventh-day Sabbath) and have **the testimony of Jesus** (the spirit of prophecy; Revelation 19:10). Their faithfulness exposes Satan's lies and vindicates God's government.

### Satan's End-Time Deceptions

As the end approaches, Satan's deceptions intensify:

> _"And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do."_ (Revelation 13:14)

> _"For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty."_ (Revelation 16:14)

Miracles alone are no proof of truth! Satan can counterfeit supernatural signs. Only faithfulness to God's Word provides safety.

[Q] **"Why does God allow people to be deceived?"**

> _"Because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."_ (2 Thessalonians 2:10–12)

God does not arbitrarily send delusion. Those who persistently reject truth eventually lose the ability to recognize it. The "strong delusion" is the natural result of choosing falsehood over truth. God respects human choice, even when that choice leads to destruction.

### Satan's Final Rebellion and Doom

After the millennium, Satan will make one last attempt at conquest:

> _"And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea."_ (Revelation 20:7–8)

The wicked dead, raised in the second resurrection, will rally to Satan's banner. Surrounding the New Jerusalem, they will attempt to capture the city of God:

> _"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."_ (Revelation 20:9)

Satan's appointed end is total destruction:

> _"I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more."_ (Ezekiel 28:18–19)

[DYK🔎] Notice the completeness of Satan's destruction: he shall be brought "to ashes" and "never shalt thou be any more." This is not eternal torment but eternal destruction. The devil himself will cease to exist. The universe will be cleansed of sin and sinners forever.

## Practical Application

### Be Sober and Vigilant

> _"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: whom resist stedfast in the faith."_ (1 Peter 5:8–9)

This exhortation calls us to:

1. **Sobriety**—mental clarity and self-control; not intoxicated by the world's pleasures or dulled by carelessness
2. **Vigilance**—watchfulness; awareness of spiritual danger
3. **Resistance**—active opposition to temptation, standing firm in faith
4. **Steadfastness**—unwavering commitment to truth and right

### Know Your Enemy

Understanding Satan's origin and methods helps us resist him:

- He began with **self-exaltation**—beware of pride (Isaiah 14:13–14)
- He operates through **deception**—test everything by Scripture (Isaiah 8:20)
- He accuses and discourages—claim Christ's righteousness (Romans 8:1, 33–34)
- He tempts to sin—flee temptation and draw near to God (James 4:7–8)

### Trust in Christ's Victory

The same power by which Christ conquered Satan is available to us:

> _"For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil."_ (1 John 3:8)

> _"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death."_ (Revelation 12:11)

Victory comes through:

- **The blood of the Lamb**—Christ's sacrifice that cleanses from sin
- **The word of their testimony**—faithful witness to truth
- **Complete surrender**—loving God more than life itself

## Appeal

Satan's story began in heaven's highest glory and will end in ashes. His path of rebellion, pride, and deception leads only to destruction—for himself and for all who follow him.

But Christ's story, though it passed through the darkness of Calvary, ends in eternal triumph. He offers His victory to every soul who will receive it.

> _"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you."_ (James 4:7–8)

The great controversy is nearing its close. Every soul must choose a side. Satan offers only temporary pleasures ending in eternal loss. Christ offers a cross to bear now, but an eternal crown of life hereafter.

Where do you stand in this cosmic conflict? Have you enlisted under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel? Today, if you hear His voice, harden not your heart. The covering cherub who once stood by God's throne will soon be no more. But those who trust in Christ will stand with Him forever, when sin and sinners are no more, and the universe is once again at peace.
