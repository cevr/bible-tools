# Reading 36: The Sufferings of Christ

## Introduction

The cross of Calvary stands at the center of human history—the moment when infinite love met infinite suffering. Yet many Christians pass by the scenes of Christ's agony with mere intellectual acknowledgment, never pausing to grasp the depths of what our Saviour endured. To understand His sufferings is to understand the weight of sin, the character of God, and the price of our redemption. This study invites you to walk with Christ through His darkest hours, that your heart may be forever changed by what love has done.

## Core Truths

### Why Christ Came

The mission of Jesus was singular and clear: _"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners"_ (1 Timothy 1:15). He did not come to establish an earthly kingdom, reform political systems, or merely teach moral philosophy. He came to rescue a perishing race.

What moved the Father to send His Son into such suffering?

> "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." (John 3:16)

- **Love initiated the plan**—not our merit or worthiness
- **Love sustained the sacrifice**—through every blow and insult
- **Love completed the work**—even unto death

Paul emphasizes this motivation: _"God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us"_ (Romans 5:8). We were not lovable; we were loved. This is the gospel.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "gave" in John 3:16 (_didōmi_) implies a voluntary, intentional giving—not a reluctant surrender. The Father did not merely permit the Son to die; He actively gave Him as a gift of love to rebellious humanity.

### The Lamb Foretold

Seven centuries before Bethlehem, Isaiah painted the portrait of a suffering Messiah:

> "He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth." (Isaiah 53:7)

Notice the imagery: **a lamb**. This connects directly to the sanctuary service, where lambs were slain daily for sin. Every bleeding sacrifice pointed forward to this moment—when the true Lamb of God would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29).

Christ knew exactly what awaited Him. He told His disciples plainly:

> "Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. For He shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on; and they shall scourge Him, and put Him to death." (Luke 18:31–33)

He walked toward the cross with open eyes. This was no accident, no tragedy that caught heaven by surprise. It was the eternal plan of redemption unfolding in time.

## Deeper Truths

### Gethsemane: The Weight of a World's Sin

The physical torture of crucifixion, though terrible, was not the deepest suffering of Christ. His agony began in the Garden of Gethsemane, where something far worse than nails and thorns pressed upon His soul.

> "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with Me." (Matthew 26:38)

What caused this overwhelming sorrow? The sins of the world—your sins, my sins, the accumulated guilt of every human being who ever lived—were being laid upon the sinless Son of God. For the first time in eternity, Christ experienced the horror of sin's presence as His own.

> "And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground." (Luke 22:44)

[DYK🔎] The medical condition of sweating blood is called hematidrosis. It occurs under extreme psychological stress when capillaries in the sweat glands rupture. Luke, the physician-historian, recorded this detail with clinical precision—evidence that Christ's suffering was no mere emotional distress but a physical crisis of cosmic proportions.

His prayer reveals the essence of surrender:

> "O My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt." (Matthew 26:39)

The "cup" was the cup of God's wrath against sin (Jeremiah 25:15; Revelation 14:10). Christ shrank from it—not because of cowardice, but because His pure nature recoiled from contact with the vileness of sin. Yet He drank it to the dregs for us.

[ILL] Imagine a man of perfect health being told he must receive a transfusion of diseased blood to save his dying children. Every instinct cries out against it. His body rebels. Yet love overrules—and he extends his arm. So Christ, the Holy One, allowed the pollution of our sin to enter His spotless being, that we might receive His pure righteousness in exchange. This is the great exchange of the gospel.

### The Trail of Tears: From Garden to Cross

After Gethsemane, the Saviour was led through a series of indignities that reveal the depths of human cruelty—and the heights of divine patience.

**Betrayal by Judas** (Luke 22:47–48): One of His own disciples sold Him for thirty pieces of silver—the price of a common slave (Exodus 21:32). The kiss of friendship became the signal of treachery.

**Denial by Peter** (Luke 22:54–61): Three times the bold apostle denied even knowing Jesus. And when the rooster crowed, _"the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter"_—not with anger, but with sorrowful love. That look broke Peter's heart and began his restoration.

[Q] **"Why didn't Jesus defend Himself or call down angels to rescue Him?"**

He could have. He told Peter, _"Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?"_ (Matthew 26:53). But then how would Scripture be fulfilled? How would sinners be saved? Christ's silence was not weakness—it was the most powerful act of self-restraint in history. The Lion of Judah chose to become the Lamb.

**Mockery and beatings** (Luke 22:63–64): They blindfolded Him, struck His face, and taunted, "Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?" The Creator of the universe was spit upon by creatures made from the dust of the ground.

**Trial before Pilate and Herod** (Luke 23:1–11): Shuffled between political powers, Jesus stood accused before earthly judges—He who will one day judge all nations. Herod mocked Him, arrayed Him in a "gorgeous robe" as a joke, and sent Him back to Pilate.

**Scourging** (John 19:1): Roman scourging used a whip embedded with bone and metal. Victims often died from this alone. Isaiah had prophesied: _"I gave My back to the smiters"_ (Isaiah 50:6).

**Crown of thorns** (Matthew 27:29–30): Thorns were the curse of Eden (Genesis 3:18). In cruel irony, soldiers wove them into a crown and pressed them into His brow. The curse He came to remove was placed upon His head.

### Calvary: The Climax of Redemption

At Golgotha—"the place of the skull"—they offered Him vinegar mingled with gall, a narcotic mixture to dull pain. _"He would not drink"_ (Matthew 27:34). Christ chose to bear the full weight of suffering with unclouded mind.

As the nails pierced His hands and feet, His first words were not a curse but a prayer:

> "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." (Luke 23:34)

[DYK🔎] Crucifixion was reserved for the lowest criminals and non-citizens. A Roman citizen could not legally be crucified. Yet the King of heaven submitted to this "most cruel and disgusting penalty" (Cicero) to identify with the vilest of sinners.

The religious leaders taunted:

> "He saved others; Himself He cannot save." (Matthew 27:42)

They spoke truth without knowing it. He _could not_ save Himself **and** save us. Love held Him there, not nails.

From noon until three o'clock, darkness covered the land (Luke 23:44–45). In that darkness, something more terrible than physical death occurred: the Father turned His face away from the Sin-Bearer. Christ cried, _"My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?"_ (Matthew 27:46). This was the second death—the sinner's death—tasted by the sinless One.

Finally, with the work accomplished:

> "It is finished: and He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost." (John 19:30)

"Finished" (_tetelestai_) was a commercial term meaning "paid in full." The debt of sin was cancelled. The price was paid. Nothing remained to be added.

At that moment, _"the veil of the temple was rent in the midst"_ (Luke 23:45). The way into the Most Holy Place—the presence of God—was now open to all who come through Christ.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Character of God Revealed

The cross answers the great controversy's central question: What is God really like?

Satan had charged God with being arbitrary, severe, and unforgiving. The cross proves otherwise. Here we see:

- **Love** that gives everything
- **Justice** that cannot overlook sin
- **Mercy** that provides a substitute
- **Humility** that stoops to the lowest place

_"Hereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His life for us"_ (1 John 3:16). The cross is God's final argument against Satan's lies.

### The Sanctuary Unveiled

The earthly sanctuary was a shadow; Calvary was the substance.

- **The altar of burnt offering** (outer court): Christ's body broken for us
- **The laver**: His blood cleansing from all sin
- **The veil torn**: Access to God restored
- **The High Priest's sacrifice**: He offered Himself, once for all (Hebrews 9:26)

But the work did not end at the cross. The Lamb became the High Priest. He ascended to the heavenly sanctuary, where He now ministers His blood on our behalf (Hebrews 8:1–2; 9:24). The benefits of Calvary must be _applied_ as well as _provided_.

[Q] **"If Christ's sacrifice was 'finished,' why does He still need to minister in heaven?"**

The sacrifice was complete—nothing can be added to it. But the _application_ of that sacrifice continues. A debt may be paid in full, yet the debtor must still receive the receipt. Christ's heavenly ministry applies His merits to repentant sinners, cleanses the sanctuary of the record of confessed sins, and prepares a people to stand before a holy God. The cross made salvation _possible_; the high priestly ministry makes it _actual_ in individual lives.

### Righteousness by Faith at the Cross

At Calvary, we see both the impossibility of human self-salvation and the all-sufficiency of Christ.

- We contributed **nothing** to our redemption but the sin that made it necessary
- Christ provided **everything**: perfect obedience, atoning sacrifice, risen life
- We receive His righteousness **by faith alone**—trusting wholly in His merits

_"He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him"_ (2 Corinthians 5:21).

This exchange is the heart of the gospel. Our sin was imputed to Christ; His righteousness is imputed to us. And through the Holy Spirit, His character is _imparted_ to us as we behold Him by faith.

[ILL] A condemned criminal stands before the king. The sentence is death. But the king's own son steps forward: "Let his punishment fall on me." The son dies in the criminal's place, and the prisoner walks free—not because of anything he did, but solely because of what the son did for him. This is justification by faith: we stand acquitted because Another took our sentence.

## Practical Application

### Beholding Transforms

_"We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image"_ (2 Corinthians 3:18).

The sufferings of Christ are not merely historical facts to be memorized; they are spiritual realities to be contemplated. As we meditate upon the cross:

- **Pride melts** before such humility
- **Self-pity fades** before such suffering
- **Grudges dissolve** before such forgiveness
- **Coldness warms** before such love

Make it a daily practice to spend time at the cross. Read the passion narratives slowly. Ask the Holy Spirit to open your eyes. Let the scenes become vivid and personal. Christ did this _for you_.

### Living the Crucified Life

Paul declared, _"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me"_ (Galatians 2:20).

What does this mean practically?

1. **Death to self-will**: "Not as I will, but as Thou wilt" becomes our daily prayer
2. **Death to self-defense**: We no longer fight for our rights or reputation
3. **Death to self-indulgence**: The cross calls us to sacrifice, not comfort
4. **Life in Christ**: His resurrection power enables what our flesh cannot do

Victory over sin is not achieved by human effort but by continual surrender to the crucified and risen Saviour. We cannot save ourselves, but He can save us—fully, completely, eternally.

### The Cross and Future Trial

A time of trouble is coming upon the earth such as never was (Daniel 12:1). God's people will face persecution, deprivation, and death. How shall they endure?

By looking unto Jesus, _"the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame"_ (Hebrews 12:2).

If the Son of God could endure Gethsemane and Calvary for us, can we not endure our lesser trials for Him? His sufferings were redemptive; ours are merely disciplinary. His were infinite; ours are measured. His love carries us through.

## Appeal

> "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" (Romans 8:32)

Dear reader, if God gave His greatest Gift for you when you were His enemy, will He withhold any lesser blessing now that you are His child? The cross is the guarantee of every promise. The Saviour who died for you lives to save you completely.

Have you truly accepted this gift? Have you knelt at the foot of the cross and surrendered all?

If your heart has grown cold, return to Calvary. If your faith has weakened, look again upon the Lamb. If besetting sins still master you, bring them to the bleeding Saviour who breaks every chain.

_"It is finished."_ Your debt is paid. Your salvation is secured. Your Saviour calls.

Will you come?
