# Bible Study: The Seven Last Plagues

## Introduction

The seven last plagues represent the final outpouring of God's unmixed wrath upon a world that has rejected His mercy and persecuted His faithful people. These plagues are not arbitrary punishments but the just consequence of deliberate, final rejection of truth. Understanding this solemn subject should drive us to embrace the third angel's message while mercy still lingers, and to find our refuge in Christ before probation's door closes forever.

## Core Truths

### The Nature of God's Wrath

The book of Revelation reveals that God's wrath is contained in seven specific plagues:

> _"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God."_ (Revelation 15:1)

The phrase "filled up" indicates these plagues complete God's judgment upon sin. Unlike previous judgments throughout history, which were mixed with mercy and designed to lead to repentance, these plagues come "without mixture"—that is, without any tempering mercy (Revelation 14:10).

**[DYK🔎]** The Greek word translated "without mixture" (_akratos_) was used to describe undiluted wine. In ancient times, wine was typically mixed with water. To drink it _akratos_ meant to drink it at full strength—a picture of judgment no longer restrained by intercession.

### Upon Whom Do They Fall?

The first plague makes clear the target of divine wrath:

> _"And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image."_ (Revelation 16:2)

These plagues fall specifically upon those who have:

- **Worshipped the beast** (given supreme allegiance to an earthly power in place of God)
- **Worshipped his image** (supported systems that enforce false worship)
- **Received his mark** (chosen human tradition over God's commandments)

Revelation 13:8 reveals the scope: _"And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life."_ The plagues will therefore be nearly universal—falling on the vast majority who have rejected God's final message.

### Probation Closes Before the Plagues Begin

A critical truth emerges from Revelation 15:8:

> _"And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from His power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled."_

**[Q] Why does no one being able to enter the temple matter?**

Christ's intercessory ministry in the heavenly sanctuary is what sustains the offer of salvation. When the temple is filled with God's glory and "no man" can enter, it signifies that Christ's mediatorial work has ended. There is no longer a Priest ministering for sinners. This is why the wrath comes "without mixture"—the door of mercy has closed.

This closing happens _before_ the plagues fall, not at Christ's visible return. Revelation 22:11-12 confirms:

> _"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly."_

Notice the sequence: first comes the divine decree fixing every person's destiny ("let him be... still"), _then_ Christ says, "I come quickly." A period exists between the close of probation and Christ's visible appearing.

**[ILL]** Consider Noah and the ark. God did not leave the door open until the first raindrops fell, for then thousands who had mocked would have rushed in. Instead, _"the Lord shut him in"_ (Genesis 7:16) days before any visible sign of the flood appeared. Those outside could no longer change their situation, though the sky remained clear. So it will be again: probation will close while the world appears unchanged, and only afterward will the plagues reveal that mercy has departed.

## Deeper Truths

### The Seven Plagues in Sequence

Each plague serves a specific purpose in God's final judgment:

**First Plague: Grievous Sores** (Revelation 16:2)
A "noisome and grievous sore" falls upon beast-worshippers—physical suffering that marks outwardly what sin has done inwardly.

**Second Plague: Sea Becomes Blood** (Revelation 16:3)
_"The sea... became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea."_ The corruption of the waters brings death to marine life.

**Third Plague: Rivers and Fountains Become Blood** (Revelation 16:4-6)
Fresh water sources turn to blood, and heaven declares the justice of this judgment:

> _"For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy."_ (Revelation 16:6)

Those who intended to shed the blood of God's faithful people now receive blood for their drink. The retribution fits the crime.

**Fourth Plague: Scorching Heat** (Revelation 16:8-9)
The sun, which once gave gentle warmth, now scorches men with fire. Yet even in agony, _"they repented not to give Him glory"_—revealing that the character is fixed.

**Fifth Plague: Darkness on the Beast's Kingdom** (Revelation 16:10)
Darkness covers the seat (throne) of the beast. The kingdom that claimed to be the light of the world is shown to be in utter spiritual darkness.

**[DYK🔎]** This plague echoes the ninth plague upon Egypt (Exodus 10:21-23), where _"darkness which may be felt"_ covered the land, yet Israel had light in their dwellings. The plagues of Revelation follow a similar pattern to the Egyptian plagues—God is delivering His people from spiritual Egypt and Babylon.

**Sixth Plague: Euphrates Dried Up** (Revelation 16:12)
The great river Euphrates is dried up _"that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared."_ In prophetic symbolism, waters represent peoples (Revelation 17:15). The drying up suggests the withdrawal of support from spiritual Babylon, preparing for her final destruction and for Christ's coming as King of kings.

**Seventh Plague: "It Is Done"** (Revelation 16:17-21)
The final plague brings:

- A great voice from heaven's temple declaring, _"It is done"_
- Voices, thunders, and lightnings
- The greatest earthquake in human history
- Great hailstones, each "about the weight of a talent" (approximately 75-100 pounds)

> _"The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation; He shall mightily roar upon His habitation; He shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth."_ (Jeremiah 25:30)

### Protection of God's People

In the midst of worldwide calamity, a precious promise stands:

> _"A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling."_ (Psalm 91:7-10)

**[Q] Will God's people escape all suffering during this time?**

They will escape the _plagues_, which are judgments upon the wicked. But this will be Jacob's time of trouble (Jeremiah 30:7), when God's people face intense spiritual anguish and physical persecution. Yet Joel 3:16 promises:

> _"The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel."_

The same voice that brings terror to the wicked brings hope and strength to the righteous.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Close of Mediation and the Sanctuary

The sanctuary message illuminates why the plagues come "without mixture." In the earthly sanctuary, the Day of Atonement was preceded by a trumpet call (Leviticus 23:24) warning Israel to examine themselves. Those who did not "afflict their souls" and confess every sin were "cut off" from Israel (Leviticus 23:29).

In the heavenly antitype, Christ's ministry in the Most Holy Place since 1844 represents the great antitypical Day of Atonement. The three angels' messages are the trumpet call to prepare. When Christ completes His work of blotting out the sins of His people and cleansing the sanctuary, He lays aside His priestly garments and puts on the garments of vengeance (Isaiah 59:17; 63:1-4).

The cessation of Christ's intercession does not mean God's people are abandoned—their sins have been blotted out, their names retained in the book of life, their characters sealed. They have been made ready. But for those who have rejected the final message, no further provision remains.

### Why Final Rejection Brings Final Judgment

**[ILL]** A skilled physician offers healing to a dying man, who refuses the remedy year after year. Eventually, the disease progresses beyond any possible treatment. It is not that the physician has become cruel—it is that the patient has exhausted his opportunities. The physician's presence, which once offered hope, now can only witness the consequences of refusal. So it is with divine mercy: not that God changes, but that persistent rejection of light leaves no remedy.

The third angel's message (Revelation 14:9-12) warns against receiving the mark of the beast precisely because it leads to this irreversible end. The message is not a threat but a loving warning—God revealing the consequences so that none need fall under them.

### The Justice of Divine Retribution

Notice that heaven itself affirms the justice of these plagues:

> _"And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus."_ (Revelation 16:5)

> _"Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments."_ (Revelation 16:7)

God is not vindictive. The plagues demonstrate the natural and just consequences of sin when mercy no longer interposes. They reveal what sin would always produce if not restrained—and they vindicate God's character before the universe.

## Practical Application

### The Urgency of Preparation

To prepare the people for this terrible time, God sends the third angel's message _beforehand_. This message (Revelation 14:9-12) contains:

- A warning against false worship
- A revelation of God's final judgments
- A call to patient, commandment-keeping faith in Jesus

**[Q] How should I prepare for this time?**

1. **Receive Christ fully now**—not merely His forgiveness, but His indwelling life that writes His law upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10). The plagues will not touch those who have made the Lord their "habitation" (Psalm 91:9).

2. **Settle into truth**—The time is coming when character will be fixed. Now is the time to let God search our hearts, reveal every sin, and enable us to overcome through the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 12:11).

3. **Value present opportunities**—Amos warns of a coming "famine... of hearing the words of the Lord" (Amos 8:11-12). Those who now neglect the Word will seek it desperately when it is too late.

4. **Share the message**—Others need to hear the warning while mercy lingers. The three angels' messages are entrusted to God's people for the salvation of others.

### The Danger of Delay

Jesus' parable speaks directly to this danger:

> _"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are."_ (Luke 13:25)

The door will be shut while some are still knocking. They will _want_ to enter—but wanting will not be enough. Proverbs 1:24-26 records the heartbreaking divine response to those who waited too long:

> _"Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set at nought all My counsel, and would none of My reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh."_

This is not cruelty—it is the terrible language of exhausted mercy. God has done everything possible. The refusal was theirs.

## Appeal

> _"Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."_ (2 Corinthians 6:2)

Is not the third angel's message an important one for this generation? The closing question of our study presses upon us with solemn weight.

We live in the time when this message is sounding. The hour of God's judgment has come. The mark of the beast crisis lies ahead—not as distant prophecy but as approaching reality. What will your answer be when that test arrives?

The same Christ who will execute judgment now offers Himself as Saviour, Intercessor, and indwelling Lord. He can keep you from receiving the beast's mark—not by removing you from the test, but by so writing His law in your heart that no earthly power can move you from allegiance to Him.

Come to Jesus today. Make Him your refuge, your "habitation" (Psalm 91:9). Let Him search your heart, cleanse your sin, and seal you with His character. When the plagues fall and the world reels in anguish, you will find that:

> _"The Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel."_ (Joel 3:16)

Now, while mercy lingers, is the time to decide. Tomorrow may find the door forever shut.
