# Bible Study: Conversion—The Divine Turning

## Introduction

Conversion is the great turning point of human existence—the moment when a soul, dead in trespasses and sins, is brought to life by divine power and begins walking with God. Yet this "turning" is not merely a change of opinion or religious affiliation; it is a radical transformation of the entire being, wrought by the Holy Spirit, that makes a rebel into a child of God. Without this change, Jesus declared, no one can enter the kingdom of heaven.

## Core Truths

### The Absolute Necessity of Conversion

Christ spoke with utmost clarity: _"Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven"_ (Matthew 18:3).

This is not optional. It is not a higher stage for advanced Christians. **Every person who would be saved must experience conversion.**

The word itself means "a turning or change from one state to another." We see this principle throughout nature:

- Water is converted into ice
- Rough wilderness is converted into fruitful fields
- Raw materials are converted into useful goods

`[DYK🔎]` The Greek word translated "converted" in Matthew 18:3 is _strephō_, meaning "to turn around completely"—like a person walking one direction who stops, turns 180 degrees, and walks the opposite way. It describes not merely a slight adjustment, but a complete reversal of direction.

So it must be with man. Sin has perverted human nature from its original design. We are born walking away from God, loving what He hates, hating what He loves. Conversion is the divine turning that reverses this direction entirely.

### The Two Steps of Conversion

The apostle Paul summarized his entire ministry in these words: _"Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ"_ (Acts 20:21).

Here are the two essential steps:

1. **Repentance toward God**—turning from sin
2. **Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ**—turning to the Savior

These are not optional alternatives. Both are essential. Neither alone is sufficient. A man may feel sorry for sin yet never trust Christ. Another may claim faith in Christ while clinging to cherished sins. True conversion requires both.

## Deeper Truths

### What Repentance Really Means

Peter preached: _"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out"_ (Acts 3:19).

But what is this sin we must repent of? Scripture defines it with precision: _"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law"_ (1 John 3:4).

`[Q]` **"Which law is this? Aren't there many laws in the Bible?"**

James answers directly: _"For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law"_ (James 2:11). This is clearly the Ten Commandments—God's eternal moral law.

Sin, therefore, is not merely breaking human customs, violating social expectations, or making mistakes. **Sin is rebellion against the holy law of the holy God.**

### How the Law Produces Repentance

_"By the law is the knowledge of sin"_ (Romans 3:20).

The law cannot save us—it has no power to cleanse or transform. But it performs an essential work: it shows us our true condition. Like a mirror reveals dirt on the face, the law reveals sin in the soul.

Paul testified from personal experience: _"I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet"_ (Romans 7:7).

`[ILL]` Consider a man who enters a dark room where dirt has accumulated for years. He sees nothing amiss. But when brilliant light floods the room, every speck of dust, every cobweb, every stain is suddenly visible. Has the light created the dirt? No—it has revealed what was always there. So the law of God, shining into the darkened heart, reveals the sin that was present all along.

### Beyond Mere Conviction

Yet knowledge of sin, by itself, does not produce true repentance. Many know they are sinners yet remain unchanged.

_"For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death"_ (2 Corinthians 7:10).

**The sorrow of the world** is regret over consequences—sorrow that one was caught, that one must suffer, that sin didn't "work out." This leads to despair or hardened rebellion.

**Godly sorrow** is grief over having offended a holy and loving God. It breaks the heart, not because of punishment feared, but because of love wounded. This produces genuine change.

`[DYK🔎]` The Greek word for "repentance" is _metanoia_, literally meaning "a change of mind"—but in biblical usage it involves the entire being: intellect, emotions, and will. True repentance is not merely feeling bad; it is a fundamental reorientation of the whole person toward God.

### The Fruits of True Repentance

Genuine repentance produces visible results:

> _"Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit"_ (Ezekiel 18:30-31).

> _"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord"_ (Isaiah 55:7).

John the Baptist demanded: _"Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance"_ (Matthew 3:8)—fruits "answerable to amendment of life."

**True repentance includes:**

- **Forsaking** sinful actions ("his way")
- **Forsaking** sinful thoughts ("his thoughts")
- **Returning** to the Lord in surrender

Where these fruits are absent, we may question whether true repentance has occurred.

### Faith Toward Our Lord Jesus Christ

Repentance alone cannot save. The soul that turns from sin must turn to Someone. That Someone is Christ.

_"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life"_ (John 3:16).

Why believe in Christ? **Because of what He has done:**

_"Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures"_ (1 Corinthians 15:3).

`[Q]` **"Why is Christ's death necessary? Can't God simply forgive without sacrifice?"**

Sin is not merely a mistake to overlook—it is cosmic rebellion against the government of God. The law of God, reflecting His eternal character, declares that "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23). Either the sinner must die, or a Substitute must die in his place. Christ, the sinless Son of God, took our place. His death satisfies the claims of the law while opening the way of mercy. Without the cross, there could be no forgiveness—for God's justice and His mercy must both be maintained.

### Confession and Cleansing

Faith in Christ includes confession of sin:

> _"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"_ (1 John 1:9).

Notice the twofold promise:

1. **Forgiveness**—the guilt of sin removed
2. **Cleansing**—the stain of sin washed away

`[DYK🔎]` In the sanctuary service, the blood of the sacrifice was applied by the priest, not by the sinner. So in our salvation, we confess our sins, but Christ applies His blood to our hearts. We cannot cleanse ourselves; He alone can make us clean.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Death, Burial, and Resurrection with Christ

True conversion involves a spiritual death and resurrection:

> _"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin"_ (Romans 6:6).

> _"Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life"_ (Romans 6:4).

The "old man"—the sinful nature that loved sin—is crucified with Christ. Baptism symbolizes his burial. Rising from the water symbolizes resurrection to "newness of life."

`[Q]` **"Does this mean I will never be tempted again?"**

No—but the relationship to sin has fundamentally changed. _"How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"_ (Romans 6:2). A dead man does not respond to stimuli. When sin tempts, the converted soul recognizes it as a foreign invader, not a welcomed friend. Through Christ's indwelling power, victory is possible over every known sin.

### The Gift of the Holy Spirit

Every genuine conversion brings a miracle:

> _"Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost"_ (Acts 2:38).

**Every real conversion is a miracle of divine grace.** The same power that raised Christ from the dead raises the dead sinner to spiritual life.

_"Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His"_ (Romans 8:9).

Without the Holy Spirit, there is no Christianity—only outward profession. But where the Spirit dwells, there is divine sonship:

_"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God... The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God"_ (Romans 8:14, 16).

### The New Creation

The result of true conversion is nothing less than a new creation:

> _"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new"_ (2 Corinthians 5:17).

This is not reformation—the improvement of the old nature. This is regeneration—the creation of an entirely new nature.

`[ILL]` You cannot teach a caterpillar to fly. You may train it, discipline it, even threaten it—but it cannot fly because it lacks the nature of a butterfly. Only metamorphosis—complete transformation—can give it wings. So man cannot be trained into holiness. He must be transformed by divine power into a new creature.

### The Old Put Off, the New Put On

What characterizes the "old man" that must be put off?

> _"Anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds"_ (Colossians 3:8-9).

What characterizes the "new man" that must be put on?

> _"Bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another... And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness"_ (Colossians 3:12-14).

Notice the contrast:

| Old Man      | New Man                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Anger, wrath | Meekness, longsuffering |
| Malice       | Kindness, forgiveness   |
| Lying        | Truth                   |
| Selfishness  | Love (charity)          |

This transformation is not achieved by human effort but by the indwelling Christ. As we behold Him, we are "changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord" (2 Corinthians 3:18).

## Practical Application

### Heavenly Affections

The converted soul no longer finds satisfaction in earthly things:

> _"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth"_ (Colossians 3:1-2).

`[DYK🔎]` The phrase "set your affection" translates the Greek _phronéō_, meaning "to direct one's mind, to be intent upon." It is an act of the will, a deliberate choice to focus the heart's desires on heavenly realities rather than earthly attractions.

**Practically, this means:**

- **Prayer** becomes delight, not duty
- **Scripture** becomes food, not medicine reluctantly swallowed
- **Worship** becomes joy, not ritual
- **Service** becomes privilege, not burden
- **Holiness** becomes aspiration, not restriction

### The Life Hid with Christ

Paul describes the security and destiny of the converted soul:

> _"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory"_ (Colossians 3:3-4).

**Three precious truths:**

1. **We are dead**—to sin, to self, to the world's control
2. **Our life is hid with Christ in God**—secure, protected, beyond the enemy's reach
3. **When Christ appears, we appear with Him in glory**—the final consummation of conversion

### Testing Your Conversion

How may you know whether your conversion is genuine?

- Do you love what you once hated (holiness, truth, God's people)?
- Do you hate what you once loved (sin, worldliness, self-exaltation)?
- Does the Holy Spirit witness to your spirit that you are God's child?
- Are the fruits of the Spirit becoming evident in your life?
- Do your affections rise naturally to heavenly things?

If these marks are present—even imperfectly—take courage. God who began a good work in you will complete it (Philippians 1:6).

If these marks are absent, do not despair—but do not delay. Today, if you hear His voice, harden not your heart.

## Appeal

> _"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new"_ (2 Corinthians 5:17).

Dear friend, have you experienced this divine turning? Has the old life passed away? Are all things becoming new?

Perhaps you have heard the gospel many times. Perhaps you have even made professions of faith. But has conversion—true conversion—actually occurred in your soul?

God invites you today to turn—turn from every known sin, turn to Jesus Christ with all your heart. He promises to receive you, forgive you, cleanse you, fill you with His Spirit, and transform you into a new creation.

_"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon"_ (Isaiah 55:7).

Will you turn today? Will you let Christ work the miracle of conversion in your heart?

The choice is before you. The Savior waits. Heaven watches. **Now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.**
