# Reading 47: The Atonement in the Old Testament

## Introduction

The earthly sanctuary was not merely a tent of worship—it was God's visual
gospel, a divine classroom where every sacrifice, every piece of furniture, and
every priestly act pointed forward to Christ and His work of saving sinners. In
studying the ancient atonement services, we discover not dusty rituals but living
truth about how God reconciles fallen humanity to Himself. The sanctuary reveals
God's answer to the great problem of sin and shows us the complete plan of
redemption from first conviction to final cleansing.

## Core Truths

### The Foundation: Faith Before the Sanctuary Existed

Long before Moses built the tabernacle, the faithful worshipped God through
sacrifice. Abel, Abraham, Jacob—all offered animals as expressions of faith in a
coming Redeemer.

> _"By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by
> which he obtained witness that he was righteous."_ (Hebrews 11:4)

What made Abel's offering "more excellent"? Not the quality of the lamb, but the
**faith** behind it. Cain brought the fruit of his own labors—the work of his
hands. Abel brought a lamb, acknowledging that sin required the death of an
innocent substitute. Abel's offering pointed forward to the Lamb of God:

> _"Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold... but with
> the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:
> who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world."_ (1 Peter
> 1:18–20)

[DYK🔎] The plan of redemption through a sacrificial Lamb existed in God's heart
_before_ Adam sinned—even "before the foundation of the world." The sacrifice of
Christ was not an emergency backup plan, but the eternal purpose of the Godhead.

**Justification**: God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous
because of Christ's merits (Romans 3:24; 5:1). Abel "obtained witness that he
was righteous"—not by his works, but by faith in the promised Savior.

### The Sanctuary: God's Dwelling Among His People

After delivering Israel from Egypt, God commanded Moses:

> _"Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them."_ (Exodus 25:8)

This was no ordinary tent. God gave Moses exact specifications—a pattern shown
him in the mount (Exodus 25:40; Hebrews 8:5). Every detail carried meaning.

**The Two Apartments:**

The sanctuary was divided by a veil into two rooms (Exodus 26:33):

1. **The Holy Place** (first apartment)—containing:
   - The **golden candlestick** with seven lamps (Exodus 25:31–40)
   - The **table of showbread** (Exodus 25:23–30)
   - The **altar of incense** (Exodus 30:1–6)

2. **The Most Holy Place** (second apartment)—containing:
   - The **ark of the covenant** overlaid with gold
   - The **mercy seat** atop the ark
   - The **two cherubim** overshadowing the mercy seat
   - Inside the ark: **the tables of the covenant**—the Ten Commandments
     (Deuteronomy 10:4–5)

[DYK🔎] The mercy seat (Hebrew: _kapporeth_) comes from the root word meaning "to
cover" or "to atone." The very place where God met with His people was called
the "covering" or "place of atonement"—where divine justice and mercy met
together.

### The Problem: Sin and Its Wages

Why was all this elaborate system necessary? Because of sin.

> _"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the
> transgression of the law."_ (1 John 3:4)

> _"The wages of sin is death."_ (Romans 6:23)

The law of God—resting inside the ark beneath the mercy seat—defines what sin
is. When we break God's commandments, we incur the death penalty. The law
demands death. But above the law was the mercy seat, sprinkled with blood. Mercy
and justice meet at the cross—and both were illustrated in the sanctuary's Most
Holy Place.

### The Daily Service: Confession, Substitution, and Transfer

When a common Israelite sinned, what must he do?

> _"Then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without
> blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. And he shall lay his hand upon the
> head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering..."_ (Leviticus 4:27–29)

Notice the steps:

1. **Recognition** of sin (becoming aware of transgression)
2. **Bringing** a spotless animal to the sanctuary
3. **Laying hands** on the victim's head—confessing sin, transferring guilt
4. **Slaying** the animal with his own hand
5. **Blood applied** by the priest to the altar horns or sprinkled before the
   veil

[ILL] Imagine a man who has stolen from his neighbor. Conscience-stricken, he
brings a lamb to the sanctuary. Standing at the altar, he places both hands upon
the lamb's head and speaks aloud his sin. He feels the warm pulse of life
beneath his palms. Then, with trembling hand, he must himself draw the knife
across the lamb's throat. As the blood flows and the innocent creature dies, the
man understands viscerally: _my sin did this_. This is what my transgression
deserves. The lamb dies in my place.

**The blood was then applied** by the priest—either sprinkled before the veil or
placed on the horns of the altar (Leviticus 4:30). The sin, having been
confessed and symbolically transferred to the animal, was now carried by the
blood into the sanctuary. The sinner returned home forgiven, but **the sin was
now recorded** in the sanctuary.

> _"The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it; in the holy place shall it
> be eaten."_ (Leviticus 6:26)

By eating the sin offering (or by the blood being sprinkled), the priest bore
the sins of the people into the holy place. The sanctuary itself became, in a
sense, the repository of confessed sin—accumulating throughout the year until
the Day of Atonement.

## Deeper Truths

### The Yearly Service: Cleansing the Sanctuary

The daily services dealt with individual sins, providing forgiveness and peace
to the repentant sinner. But confessed sins had accumulated in the sanctuary all
year. Once annually, on the tenth day of the seventh month, came the solemn **Day
of Atonement**—_Yom Kippur_.

> _"For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you,
> that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord."_ (Leviticus 16:30)

**Atonement**: The work by which God and man are brought into oneness
(_at-one-ment_) through Christ's sacrifice and priestly ministry (Leviticus 16;
Romans 5:10–11).

[Q] **"If sins were forgiven in the daily service, why was the Day of Atonement
necessary?"**

Forgiveness and cleansing are related but distinct. The daily service brought
**forgiveness** to the penitent sinner—he went home at peace, his sin covered by
the substitute's blood. But the sin had not vanished; it had been _transferred_
to the sanctuary. The sanctuary bore the recorded sins of the people. On the Day
of Atonement, those sins were **finally removed**—the sanctuary was cleansed,
and the sin was placed where it belonged: upon the head of the originator of
sin.

### The Two Goats: The Lord's Goat and the Scapegoat

The ceremony of the Day of Atonement centered on two goats:

> _"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the
> other lot for the scapegoat."_ (Leviticus 16:8)

**The Lord's goat** was slain as a sin offering. Its blood was carried inside
the veil—into the Most Holy Place—and sprinkled upon the mercy seat:

> _"Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and
> bring his blood within the veil... and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and
> before the mercy seat."_ (Leviticus 16:15)

This blood atoned for and cleansed the sanctuary from all accumulated sins:

> _"And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the
> uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in
> all their sins."_ (Leviticus 16:16)

Only after the sanctuary was cleansed did the high priest deal with the
**scapegoat** (Hebrew: _Azazel_):

> _"And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and
> confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel... putting them
> upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away... into the wilderness. And
> the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited."_
> (Leviticus 16:21–22)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word _Azazel_ appears only in Leviticus 16 and has been
understood by Jewish and Christian scholars to be a name referring to an evil
being—the one ultimately responsible for tempting humanity to sin. The scapegoat
did not atone for sin (that was accomplished by the Lord's goat); rather, it
bore away the sins that had already been atoned for, carrying them back to their
originator.

### Christ in the Sanctuary Types

Every element pointed forward to Jesus:

| **Type**                    | **Antitype**                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spotless lamb               | Christ, the Lamb without blemish (1 Peter 1:19)            |
| Blood of the sacrifice      | Christ's blood shed on Calvary (Hebrews 9:12)              |
| Priest ministering blood    | Christ our High Priest in heaven (Hebrews 8:1–2)           |
| Daily service (forgiveness) | Justification—Christ's righteousness imputed               |
| Most Holy Place ministry    | Christ's final work of atonement and blotting out of sins  |
| Lord's goat (atonement)     | Christ's sacrifice, applied for final cleansing            |
| Scapegoat (Azazel)          | Satan, bearing responsibility for sins he caused           |
| Sanctuary cleansed          | Heaven's records cleared; God's people sealed and prepared |

[Q] **"Was atonement completed at the cross, or is it ongoing?"**

Scripture reveals both aspects. Christ's sacrifice on the cross was complete and
sufficient—"It is finished!" (John 19:30). Nothing can be added to His death. Yet
the _application_ of that sacrifice continues. The earthly high priest did not
complete his work merely by slaying the lamb; he then ministered the blood
within the sanctuary. So Christ, having died once for all, now ministers the
benefits of His sacrifice in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1–2; 9:24). The
daily service represents ongoing intercession and forgiveness; the yearly
service represents final cleansing, the blotting out of sins, and the
preparation of God's people for eternity.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law at the Center

What lay at the very heart of the sanctuary—inside the Most Holy Place, within
the ark, beneath the mercy seat where God's glory dwelt? **The Ten
Commandments** (Deuteronomy 10:4–5).

This placement reveals profound truth:

- God's law is the **foundation of His government**—eternal and unchangeable
- The mercy seat _rested upon_ the law—mercy does not abolish the law but
  satisfies its demands
- Access to God's presence required passing through _blood-stained
  apartments_—no one comes to the Father except through the sacrifice of Christ

The great controversy between Christ and Satan centers on God's law. Satan
claims it cannot be kept, that God asks the impossible. Christ came to "magnify
the law and make it honorable" (Isaiah 42:21), demonstrating in human flesh that
the law can be obeyed through divine power. The sanctuary teaches that God's
plan is not to abolish His law but to **write it in our hearts** (Hebrews
10:16)—the very purpose of the new covenant.

### The Transfer of Sin and Final Judgment

The sanctuary service illustrates the entire plan of salvation:

1. **Outer Court** (the cross)—Christ's death as our substitute; justification;
   sins forgiven
2. **Holy Place** (daily intercession)—Christ's ongoing ministry; sanctification;
   transformation by grace
3. **Most Holy Place** (Day of Atonement)—final judgment; blotting out of sins;
   Satan bearing ultimate responsibility

[ILL] Consider a courtroom where a criminal stands guilty. The judge pronounces
sentence: death. But another steps forward and says, "I will bear his penalty."
The substitute dies; the criminal goes free—**pardoned**. But the court records
still show the crime. Years later, a review of records takes place. The judge
examines each case: Was the pardon accepted? Did the pardoned man live in
gratitude and obedience, or did he return to crime? Based on this review, the
record is either sealed in righteousness or the pardon is revoked. When the
review is complete, the crimes of the faithful are permanently erased—and
responsibility for having tempted them is placed upon the tempter himself, who
is led away to destruction.

This illustrates the investigative judgment—the cleansing of the heavenly
sanctuary foreshadowed by the Day of Atonement. The sins of the righteous are
finally blotted out, and Satan, the originator of sin, ultimately bears
responsibility for the evil he has caused, though each person remains
accountable for their own choice to sin.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Sanctuary

The entire sanctuary system proclaims one message: **salvation is by grace
through faith, not by human works**.

- The sinner could not save himself—he needed a **substitute**
- The substitute must be **provided by God**—the sinner could not manufacture
  his own salvation
- Faith was essential—the offering was accepted only because it represented
  **Christ's sacrifice**
- The sinner's part was to **confess, believe, and receive**

Yet faith that saves is never alone. True faith produces obedience:

> _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments
> of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:12)

The sanctuary teaches that Christ's work is not merely to forgive sins but to
**cleanse from all unrighteousness** (1 John 1:9). The goal of atonement is a
people fully reconciled to God—not only pardoned but purified, not only forgiven
but transformed, not only declared righteous but _made_ righteous in character.

## Practical Application

### What the Sanctuary Teaches Us Today

**1. Sin is serious.** Every sacrifice reminded the worshipper that sin brings
death. We must never treat transgression lightly. The cross, foreshadowed by
every bleeding lamb, shows the infinite cost of redemption.

**2. Confession must be specific.** The Israelite laid hands on the lamb and
confessed his particular sin. General prayers—"forgive all my sins"—lack the
searching honesty God desires. Name your sins before God. Bring them to the
cross.

**3. We need a Substitute.** No human effort can atone for sin. Only Christ's
blood can cover our guilt. We must come to God not in our own righteousness but
clothed in Christ's merits.

**4. Christ is ministering for us now.** Jesus is not idle in heaven. He is our
High Priest, applying the benefits of His sacrifice to every believing soul
(Hebrews 7:25). We may come boldly to the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16).

**5. A final cleansing is taking place.** We live in the antitypical Day of
Atonement—the time when heaven's sanctuary is being cleansed and God's people
are being prepared for Christ's return. This is a time for deep heart-searching,
confession, and putting away of sin.

**6. The law remains central.** God's Ten Commandments—the very law that lay
inside the ark—remain the standard of righteousness. The sanctuary shows that
grace does not abolish the law but satisfies its demands through the blood of
Christ and empowers obedience through the Spirit.

**7. Satan will bear his responsibility.** Though we suffer from his temptations
and the world groans under his cruelty, the scapegoat ceremony assures us that
Satan will ultimately bear the weight of all the sin he has caused. Justice will
be done. Evil will not endure forever.

## Appeal

> _"For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you,
> that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord."_ (Leviticus 16:30)

Dear friend, the sanctuary was not merely an ancient institution—it is God's
invitation to you today. Christ, the true High Priest, stands ready to apply His
blood to your case. He offers not only pardon but cleansing, not only
forgiveness but power to overcome.

The Day of Atonement called Israel to "afflict their souls"—to engage in earnest
self-examination and repentance. We live in the great antitypical Day of
Atonement. Heaven's records are being reviewed. Christ's ministry in the Most
Holy Place is nearing completion.

Will you come to Him now? Will you confess your sins specifically, trusting in
His blood alone? Will you surrender your heart fully, allowing Him to write His
law within and prepare you for His coming?

The way into the holiest is open. The veil has been rent. Our great High Priest
bids us come boldly (Hebrews 10:19–22). Let us not delay. Let us not presume
upon mercy while clinging to sin. Let us enter in by faith, receive cleansing,
and stand complete in Him.

> _"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high
> priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the
> heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the
> Lord pitched, and not man."_ (Hebrews 8:1–2)

Christ is there—for you. Come to Him today.
