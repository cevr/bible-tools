## Slide 1 – Title: Submission – The Path to Victory

- **Study Topic:** The Biblical Principle of Submission
- **Key Themes:**
  - The Foundation of the Christian Life
  - Righteousness by Faith
  - The Restoration of Order
- **Goal:** Understanding how yielding to God brings victory over sin.

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Object of Submission

- **Question:** To whom do we owe unqualified submission?
- **Key Text:** James 4:7 – “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the
  devil, and he will flee from you.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **Absolute Authority:** The only Being owed absolute, unqualified submission
  is the Creator.
- **Nature of Submission:**
  - Yielding our will to His authority.
  - Surrendering independence to acknowledge His sovereignty.
- **Prerequisite for Victory:**
  - We cannot resist the devil while rebelling against God.
  - Submission places us under God’s protection.
- **Voluntary Love:** God desires submission born of love and trust, not force.
- **Sovereignty:** The supreme right of God to rule His creation (Psalm 103:19).

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Patient and the Surgeon**
- A patient on an operating table must submit completely to the surgeon.
- If the patient fights the anesthesia or grabs the surgeon's hand, the work
  cannot be done.
- **Lesson:** We must lie still in the hands of the Great Physician so He can
  cut away the cancer of sin.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Obligation to Submit

- **Question:** Why are we under obligation to submit to God?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 45:21-22 – “...there is no God else beside me; a just God
  and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the
  ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Creation & Redemption)

- **Two Mighty Pillars:** We belong to God by a double right.
- **1. Creation Rights:**
  - He made us and understands the human mechanism.
  - Only the Architect knows how to make humanity function correctly.
- **2. Redemption Rights:**
  - He is "a just God and a Saviour."
  - He bought us back from the slavery of sin with the blood of Christ (1
    Corinthians 6:20 – “For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in
    your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.”).
- **3. His Holy Character:**
  - God is the "Holy One."
  - His rule is righteousness, not tyranny.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Inventor and the Machine**
- An inventor has the right to write the instruction manual for his creation.
- If the machine breaks, it must be submitted to the maker for repair.
- **Lesson:** We are broken by sin; only our Maker can restore us to working
  order.

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Defining Submission

- **Question:** What constitutes submission to God?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 10:5 – “Casting down imaginations, and every high
  thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into
  captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Inward Surrender:** True submission is an act of the mind and will, not just
  outward behavior.
- **The Battleground:** The war is against "imaginations"—pride and
  self-righteousness that claim we don't need a Saviour.
- **Captivity to Christ (Righteousness by Faith):**
  - We do not fight sinful thoughts alone.
  - We bring thoughts to Christ and exchange our mind for His (Philippians 2:5).
- **Role of the Spirit:** We welcome the Spirit to dwell within; when Christ
  enters, the enemy is cast out.

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Besieged City**
- In ancient warfare, a defeated city would open its gates and surrender its
  strongholds to the conqueror.
- **Lesson:** We must open the gates of the mind to Jesus.
- We hand Him the keys to every room, even the secret closets we wish to hide.

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Condition of the Submissive

- **Question:** What will be the condition of one who is thus submissive to God?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 1:9 – “For this cause we also, since the day we heard
  it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with
  the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Spiritual Sight)

- **The Gateway to Sight:** A rebellious heart is blinded; a submissive heart
  sees.
- **Spiritual Understanding:**
  - Not just intellectual theology.
  - An experiential knowledge of God (John 17:3).
  - Entering the Sanctuary by faith to meet the High Priest.
- **Wisdom:** The practical ability to apply God’s law to daily life because it
  is written on the heart.

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Reflecting Lake**
- A lake with a turbulent surface cannot reflect the sky.
- Only when the wind ceases and the waters are still can it mirror the heavens.
- **Lesson:** Only in the calm of submission can the soul reflect the image of
  Christ.

---

## Slide 14 – Q5: God’s Will Defined

- **Question:** What is the will of God?
- **Key Texts:**
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification...”
  - 1 Peter 4:1-2 – “Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
    arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the
    flesh hath ceased from sin; That he no longer should live the rest of his
    time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **Sanctification:** The work of grace separating the believer from sin and
  dedicating them to God.
- **Ceasing from Sin:**
  - The Gospel promise is power over sin in the present, not just forgiveness
    for the past.
  - Dying to self (suffering in the flesh) breaks the power of sin.
- **God’s Will is Power:**
  - If God _wills_ our sanctification, He pledges His power to perform it (Jude
    24).

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Marble and the Sculptor**
- A block of marble submits to the chisel of the sculptor.
- The cutting is painful, but necessary to bring out the beautiful image.
- **Lesson:** Sanctification is God freeing the image of Christ from the rough
  stone of our nature.

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: Fulfilled Righteousness

- **Question:** What is fulfilled in us when we live not in the flesh?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be
  fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Imparted Righteousness)

- **The Law Fulfilled:** The law is not abolished; it is fulfilled _in_ the
  believer.
- **"In Us," Not "By Us":**
  - It is Christ’s righteousness, imparted by the Spirit.
  - We are saved _by_ Christ so the law may be fulfilled _in_ our character.
- **The Two Walks:**
  - _Flesh:_ Relying on human strength/desire.
  - _Spirit:_ Relying on the indwelling life of Christ (The New Covenant).
- **Imparted Righteousness:** Christ’s life formed within, resulting in natural
  obedience.

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **Taped Apples vs. Grafted Branch**
- Taping apples to a dead branch is works-righteousness; they will rot.
- Grafting a branch into a living tree allows sap to flow and produce fruit
  naturally.
- **Lesson:** Righteousness is the natural fruit of being united with Christ.

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: The Fruit of the Spirit

- **Question:** Then what is the course of one who is submissive to God?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Galatians 5:22-23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
    longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against
    such there is no law.”
  - 1 Peter 4:2 – “...live ... to the will of God.”
- **Key Points:**
  - Submission is active, not passive.
  - **Fruit vs. Works:** "Works" are manufactured by self; "Fruit" is grown by
    God.
  - **Harmony:** Walking in the Spirit means walking in harmony with the Ten
    Commandments ("Against such there is no law").

---

## Slide 21 – Q8: Total Subjection

- **Question:** What should we bring into subjection to God?
- **Key Texts:**
  - 1 Corinthians 9:27 – “But I keep under my body, and bring it into
    subjection...”
  - Romans 12:1 – “...present your bodies a living sacrifice...”
  - 1 Corinthians 6:20 – “...glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which
    are God's.”

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points (Body, Mind, Spirit)

- **The Body (Health Reform):**
  - Physical appetites must be controlled by sanctified reason.
  - The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.
- **The Mind:** Thoughts must be brought to Christ (2 Cor 10:5).
- **The Spirit:** Affections and worship belong to God.
- **A Living Sacrifice:** Unlike the dead animals of the ancient sanctuary, we
  climb onto the altar _alive_ to serve God.

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Rider and the Horse**
- A horse (the body/appetites) is strong and useful.
- If the horse takes the bit and runs wild, it destroys the rider.
- **Lesson:** The sanctified will must hold the reins to guide the body.

---

## Slide 24 – Q9: The Hardest Battle

- **Question:** Which member of the body requires the greatest exertion,
  together with the grace of God, to bring into submission?
- **Key Text:** James 3:8, 2 – “But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly
  evil, full of deadly poison.” ... “If any man offend not in word, the same is
  a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: Key Points (The Tongue)

- **The Indicator:** The tongue reveals the heart condition (Matt 12:34).
- **Human Inability:** "The tongue can no man tame." Willpower alone fails.
- **Divine Power:** Only a heart cleansed by Christ's blood can produce pure
  speech.
- **Mark of Maturity:** Victory over the tongue indicates the grace of God has
  conquered the whole soul.

---

## Slide 26 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Rudder and the Ship**
- James compares the tongue to a small rudder on a huge ship.
- Though small, it directs the entire vessel.
- **Lesson:** If the rudder is controlled by the Captain (Christ), the life
  reaches the safe harbor.

---

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Prayer of Submission

- **Question:** What is the prayer of one who is submissive to God?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 6:10 – “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as
  it is in heaven.”
- **Key Point:**
  - This is the prayer of Gethsemane ("Not my will, but thine").
  - It shifts focus from "God, give me what I want" to "God, make me what You
    want."

---

## Slide 28 – Q11: The Example of Christ

- **Question:** How was submission exemplified in the life of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 2:8 – “And being found in fashion as a man, he
  humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”
- **Additional Text:** Isaiah 53:7 – “He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,
  yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter...”

---

## Slide 29 – Q11: Key Points (The Sanctuary Lamb)

- **Active Obedience:** Jesus kept the Law perfectly, showing humanity connected
  to Divinity can obey.
- **Passive Obedience:** He submitted to injustice without retaliation, trusting
  the Father.
- **The Sanctuary:** As the Lamb of God, He submitted to the knife of justice to
  save us.
- **Our Example:** We look to Him as both Substitute and Pattern.

---

## Slide 30 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Path to Greatness**
- In God’s kingdom, the way up is down.
- Jesus descended from the Throne -> Manger -> Cross.
- Because He humbled Himself lowest, God exalted Him highest (Phil 2:9).

---

## Slide 31 – Q12 & Q13: Civil Authority

- **Question:** What is said about submission to worldly powers and authorities?
  Why are we required to do this?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Titus 3:1 – “Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to
    obey magistrates...”
  - Romans 13:1 – “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there
    is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q12 & Q13: Key Points

- **Model Citizens:** Christians should not be anarchists.
- **God of Order:** Government is ordained by God to restrain evil and protect
  rights (Romans 13:3-4).
- **Common Grace:** Even imperfect rulers help prevent chaos.
- **Motive:** We obey "for the Lord's sake."

---

## Slide 33 – Q14: The Limit of Authority

- **Question:** Does Peter mean that we should submit to the ordinances of men,
  even when these are contrary to the express command of God?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Acts 5:29 – “Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought
    to obey God rather than men.”
  - Acts 4:19 – “But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be
    right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points (God vs. Man)

- **The Hierarchy of Law:** Human law cannot override Divine Law (The Ten
  Commandments).
- **Conscience:**
  - If human law commands sin (or forbids obedience to God), we must
    respectfully decline.
  - This is not rebellion; it is supreme allegiance to the King of Kings.
- **Illustration:** A soldier must obey the King over a general if the general
  orders a crime.

---

## Slide 35 – Q15: A Biblical Example

- **Question:** What noted example have we of obedience or submission to God
  rather than man?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 3 (The Three Worthies).
- **Key Points:**
  - Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were loyal in civil matters.
  - When commanded to break the Second Commandment (Idolatry), they refused.
  - **Application:** This is the spirit of the Remnant who refuse the Mark of
    the Beast (Rev 14:12).

---

## Slide 36 – Q16: True Civil Submission

- **Question:** Then what is really meant by being subject to worldly rulers and
  ordinances of men?
- **Key Text:** Romans 13:9 – “...Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal...
  and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this
  saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”
- **Key Point:**
  - Civil laws usually align with the Second Table of the Law (duty to man).
  - By loving our neighbor and doing no harm, we fulfill the righteous
    requirement of civil law.

---

## Slide 37 – Q17: Mutual Submission

- **Question:** How do we stand related to one another with regard to
  submission?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 5:5 – “Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the
  elder. Yea, all of you, be subject one to another, and be clothed with
  humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.”
- **Key Points:**
  - Respect for experience (younger to elder).
  - Mutual service (subject one to another).
  - Destroying the spirit of rivalry.

---

## Slide 38 – Q18: The Reason for Humility

- **Question:** What seems to be the reason for this requirement?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 5:6 – “Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand
  of God, that he may exalt you in due time.”
- **Key Points:**
  - **Grace Flow:** Grace is like water; it flows to the lowest point.
  - **Pride:** God cannot help the proud because they feel no need.
  - **Exaltation:** God waits to exalt us until we are humble enough to handle
    it safely.

---

## Slide 39 – Q18: Illustration

- **The Fruitful Tree**
- A tree branch laden with heavy, good fruit always bows low.
- A branch that sticks straight up is usually barren.
- **Lesson:** Humility is the proof of spiritual fruitfulness.

---

## Slide 40 – Q19 & Q20: The Home Circle

- **Question:** What should be the attitude of a wife to her husband? What is
  this submission?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Colossians 3:18 – “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands...”
  - Titus 2:4-5 – “...love their husbands, to love their children... good,
    obedient to their own husbands...”

---

## Slide 41 – Q19 & Q20: Key Points

- **Divine Order:** God established roles to ensure harmony in the home.
- **Not Inequality:** Men and women are equal in Christ (Gal 3:28); this is
  functional submission for unity.
- **Character:** Characterized by love, loyalty, and care for the domestic
  circle.

---

## Slide 42 – Q21: Servant Leadership

- **Question:** Does this submission permit domination on the part of the
  husband?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Colossians 3:19 – “Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against
    them.”
  - Ephesians 5:25 – “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
    church, and gave himself for it.”

---

## Slide 43 – Q21: Key Points

- **No Tyranny:** Biblical headship is self-sacrificing love, never force.
- **The Christ Standard:**
  - How does Christ lead? By serving, dying for, and patiently guiding the
    church.
  - He never abuses or forces the will.
- **No Bitterness:** Harsh words forfeit the moral right to respect.

---

## Slide 44 – Q21: Illustration

- **Washing the Feet**
- Christ, the Head of the Church, washed the feet of His disciples.
- **Lesson:** A Christian husband leads by serving, protecting, and
  providing—not by barking orders.

---

## Slide 45 – Q22: The Boundary

- **Question:** How far should a wife submit to her husband?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:18 – “...as it is fit in the Lord.”
- **Key Point:**
  - "In the Lord" is the boundary.
  - A wife cannot submit if a husband demands she violate the Law of God or her
    conscience.
  - Her first duty is to her Saviour.

---

## Slide 46 – Q23: Children

- **Question:** In what should children be submissive to parents?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:20 – “Children, obey your parents in all things:
  for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.”
- **Key Points:**
  - Children learn God’s authority through parental authority.
  - Obedience pleases the Lord and reflects the Fifth Commandment.

---

## Slide 47 – Q24: Work and Service

- **Question:** What is said about the submission of servants to masters?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:22 – “Servants, obey in all things your masters
  according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness
  of heart, fearing God.”
- **Key Points:**
  - Applies to employees today.
  - **Integrity:** Working hard even when the boss isn't looking.
  - **Motive:** Viewing daily labor as service to Christ.
  - An Adventist should be the most reliable worker in the company.
