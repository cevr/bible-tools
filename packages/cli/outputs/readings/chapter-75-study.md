# Bible Study: Not Justified by the Law

## Introduction

One of the most misunderstood truths in Christianity is the relationship between God's law and salvation. Many stumble here—some believing the law saves them, others concluding that grace abolishes the law entirely. The apostle Paul, writing to the Romans, clarifies this vital matter with divine precision. Understanding this truth is essential for every soul seeking peace with God and victory over sin.

## Core Truths

### The Law Cannot Justify

Paul's declaration is absolute and unequivocal:

> _"Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight."_ (Romans 3:20)

The word "justified" means to be declared righteous—acquitted before God's throne of justice. Paul states that **no human being** can achieve this standing by keeping the law. This is not because the law is defective, but because we are. The law is a perfect mirror; it reveals dirt but cannot wash it away.

**Justification**: God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous, not because of their own works, but because Christ's perfect righteousness is credited to their account (Romans 4:5–6).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "justified" (_dikaioō_) is a courtroom term. It pictures a judge pronouncing a verdict of "not guilty." No amount of future good behavior can erase a criminal record—only a pardon from the sovereign authority can do that.

### The Law's True Purpose: Revealing Sin

If the law cannot save, what is its function?

> _"I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet."_ (Romans 7:7)

The law is God's diagnostic instrument. Just as a physician's examination reveals disease but does not cure it, so the law exposes our spiritual sickness without providing the remedy. Paul personally testifies that he would not have recognized the sin of covetousness in his heart without the tenth commandment shining its light there.

> _"By the law is the knowledge of sin."_ (Romans 3:20, last clause)

[ILL] Imagine a man who believes himself healthy walking into a doctor's office. The physician runs tests and discovers a deadly illness the patient never suspected. The tests did not create the disease—they revealed what was already present. So it is with God's law: it does not make us sinners; it shows us that we already are sinners, desperately needing the Great Physician.

### The Law Speaks to All the World

Some might argue that the law was only for Israel, and therefore Gentiles are exempt from its verdict. Paul anticipates this objection:

> _"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."_ (Romans 3:19)

The law's witness renders **the entire human race** accountable to God. Jew and Gentile alike stand condemned. Every excuse is silenced. Every mouth is stopped. The whole world stands guilty at heaven's bar.

[Q] **"But if I'm a Gentile, how can the Jewish law apply to me?"**

Paul addresses this throughout Romans. He shows that Gentiles who never received the written law still have its principles written on their hearts (Romans 2:14–15). God's moral law reflects His eternal character and applies to all created beings. The Ten Commandments are simply the written transcript of righteousness that governs the universe. None are exempt from its authority or its verdict.

### The Holiness of the Law

Despite what the law reveals about us, the problem is never with the law itself:

> _"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."_ (Romans 7:12)

Notice the fourfold description:

- **Holy**—set apart, belonging to God, reflecting His character
- **Just**—fair, equitable, demanding nothing unreasonable
- **Good**—beneficial, designed for our welfare and happiness

The law is a transcript of God's own character. To accuse the law of being harsh or unfair is to accuse God Himself. The law cannot be the problem; **we** are the problem. We have broken what is perfect, and no amount of future obedience can undo past transgression.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "law" (_torah_) means "instruction" or "teaching." God never intended His law to be a burden but a loving guide showing the path of life and blessing (Psalm 119:97, 105).

## Deeper Truths

### The Only Way of Justification

Since the law cannot justify, how can sinful humans ever be made right with God?

> _"Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."_ (Romans 3:24)

Here is the glorious gospel answer:

- **Freely** (_dōrean_)—without cost to us, as a gift
- **By His grace**—unmerited favor we could never earn
- **Through the redemption**—the ransom price paid
- **In Christ Jesus**—the only Savior, the only way

**Redemption**: The act of purchasing back what was lost. Christ paid the price of His own blood to buy us back from sin's slave market (1 Peter 1:18–19).

The law demanded perfect obedience; Christ rendered it. The law demanded death for transgression; Christ died in our place. What we could never do, He did for us. His righteousness is credited to our account the moment we believe.

This is **imputed righteousness**—Christ's perfect record placed to our account as though it were our own (2 Corinthians 5:21).

[ILL] A man owes a debt of ten million dollars. He has no means to pay—bankruptcy cannot discharge it, and labor cannot earn it. Then a wealthy friend steps forward and pays the entire sum. The debt is cancelled—not because the debtor earned the money, but because another paid it in his behalf. So Christ has paid our sin-debt in full. We receive the benefit by faith, not by works.

### Grace Does Not License Sin

Here arises a critical question that some have twisted into an excuse for continued transgression:

> _"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."_ (Romans 6:15)

Paul's response is emphatic: **God forbid!** (Greek: _mē genoito_—"may it never be!" the strongest negative in the Greek language).

Grace is not permission to sin; it is **power over sin**. To continue willfully in transgression while claiming grace is to misunderstand grace entirely. It is to trample upon the blood of Christ and count the covenant an unholy thing (Hebrews 10:29).

> _"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"_ (Romans 6:16)

We are always servants—the only question is, whose servants? We either serve sin, which leads to death, or we serve righteousness, which leads to life. Grace breaks the chains of sin's dominion and empowers us to serve a new Master.

[Q] **"If we're saved by grace and not by keeping the law, why does obedience matter?"**

Because true faith always produces obedience. James declares that "faith without works is dead" (James 2:26). Genuine conversion transforms the heart, creating a love for God's law rather than resentment toward it. The saved soul delights to do God's will because the law is written in the heart (Hebrews 8:10). Obedience is not the root of salvation but its fruit.

### Walking Free from Condemnation

Paul concludes this line of reasoning with a triumphant declaration:

> _"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:1)

**No condemnation!** The law's verdict of guilty is removed for those in Christ. But notice the condition: such persons "walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."

- **Walking after the flesh**: Living according to carnal desires, yielding to sin's impulses, self-directed life
- **Walking after the Spirit**: Living under the Holy Spirit's guidance, yielding to righteousness, Christ-directed life

This is **imparted righteousness**—Christ's character actually reproduced in the believer through the Holy Spirit's work (Galatians 2:20).

**Sanctification**: The ongoing work of God making the believer holy in character and life, transforming them into Christ's image (1 Thessalonians 4:3; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

Those who are truly justified will progressively become sanctified. The same grace that forgives also transforms. Christ not only saves us from the penalty of sin but from its power.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

This truth shines brilliantly in the sanctuary service. In the **outer court**, the sinner brought his sacrifice—acknowledging that the law had condemned him and that only the death of an innocent substitute could atone. The sinner could not save himself by good works after the sacrifice; he was saved by the blood.

But having been forgiven, did the Israelite leave free to sin again? By no means! He was to "go, and sin no more" (John 8:11). The **holy place** ministry—with its daily intercession, the bread of the Presence, and the candlestick's light—represented the ongoing work of grace in the believer's life: feeding on God's Word, walking in the Spirit's light, offering prayers through Christ.

In the **most holy place**, God's law rested inside the ark, beneath the mercy seat where blood was sprinkled. Here is the perfect picture: justice and mercy meet together; righteousness and peace kiss (Psalm 85:10). The law is not abolished—it remains at the very heart of God's throne. But mercy covers the transgressor who comes by faith in the blood.

### Satan's Two Deceptions

In the great controversy, Satan has employed two opposite deceptions regarding the law:

1. **Legalism**: Salvation by works—the belief that human effort can satisfy God's requirements. This produces either self-righteous pride or crushing despair.

2. **Antinomianism**: Lawless grace—the belief that because we are saved by grace, the law is abolished and obedience unnecessary. This produces careless sin under the guise of freedom.

Both errors are deadly. The truth lies in the balance Paul presents: **saved by grace alone, through faith alone, unto obedience**. The law cannot save us, but the saved will keep the law—not in their own strength, but through Christ who dwells within (Philippians 2:13; 4:13).

[DYK🔎] The word "antinomian" comes from Greek _anti_ (against) + _nomos_ (law). This heresy emerged early in church history and Paul combated it vigorously (Romans 6:1–2, 15; Galatians 5:13). True grace never leads to lawlessness.

---

### Righteousness by Faith in Summary

The complete gospel includes:

1. **The law reveals sin**—showing us our desperate need
2. **Grace provides justification**—declaring us righteous through Christ's merits
3. **The Spirit empowers sanctification**—transforming our characters into Christ's likeness
4. **Love motivates obedience**—we keep God's commandments not to be saved, but because we are saved

> _"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous."_ (1 John 5:3)

---

## Practical Application

This truth calls us to:

1. **Abandon all trust in self-effort**. Stop trying to earn God's favor by religious works. Come to Christ empty-handed, trusting wholly in His righteousness.

2. **Receive justification by faith today**. If you have never accepted Christ's free gift of salvation, do so now. Confess your sins, believe in His sacrifice, and accept His pardon (1 John 1:9; John 1:12).

3. **Walk in the Spirit daily**. Surrender each morning to Christ's control. Ask for the Holy Spirit's power to overcome temptation. Abide in Christ as the branch abides in the vine (John 15:4–5).

4. **Let love motivate your obedience**. Keep God's commandments not from fear of punishment or hope of reward, but from gratitude for what Christ has done and love for His character.

5. **Examine your life by God's law**. Use the Ten Commandments as a spiritual mirror (James 1:23–25). When sin is revealed, confess it immediately and claim Christ's cleansing power.

## Appeal

> _"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast."_ (Ephesians 2:8–9)

Dear friend, have you been struggling under the burden of trying to save yourself? Have you been trusting in your own works, your church membership, your good deeds? The law has done its work—it has shown you your sin. Now look to Jesus! He offers you freely what you could never earn: full, complete, perfect justification.

Or perhaps you have swung to the other extreme—claiming grace while continuing in known sin, believing it doesn't matter how you live. Hear Paul's urgent warning: such presumption proves you have never truly known saving grace. Those whom Christ justifies, He also sanctifies. Those whom He forgives, He also transforms.

Today, will you accept both the pardon and the power? Will you let Christ be your righteousness—both imputed and imparted? He stands ready to save you from sin's penalty and sin's power. Come to Him just as you are, and He will make you all that you ought to be.

> _"Who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."_ (Titus 2:14)
