## Slide 1 – Q1: The Mystery of Iniquity

- **Question:** What was already at work in the church in Paul's day?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:7 – “For the mystery of iniquity doth already
  work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Definition & Root)

- **Definition:**
  - The "mystery of iniquity" refers to the hidden working of Satan to overthrow
    God’s law while remaining within the church.
  - It is the counterfeit of the "mystery of godliness" (God manifested in the
    flesh).
  - Key Text: 1 Timothy 3:16 – “And without controversy great is the mystery of
    godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
    angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up
    into glory.”
- **Self-Exaltation:**
  - The "mystery of godliness" is Christ humbling Himself (Philippians 2:8 –
    “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
    obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”).
  - The "mystery of iniquity" is man exalting himself to take the place of God.
- **The Root:**
  - This spirit begins in the heart.
  - It substitutes human tradition for God's commandments.
  - It uses force or manipulation rather than the Holy Spirit.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Faith & Sanctuary)

- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - True righteousness comes only by faith in Christ, who writes His law
    internally.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
    Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
    and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall
    be to me a people.”
  - When the church loses the internal power of the Gospel (Christ in you), it
    seeks external political power.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the true sanctuary, the sinner relies on the sacrifice and the High
    Priest.
  - The "mystery of iniquity" shifts reliance to human priests and earthly
    systems, obscuring Christ’s work in heaven.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Leaven:**
  - Jesus warned of the "leaven of the Pharisees," which is hypocrisy (Luke 12:1
    – “In the mean time... he began to say unto his disciples first of all,
    Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.”).
  - **The Lesson:**
    - If a baker puts a drop of poison in the dough, it is hidden at first.
    - It looks and smells like bread, but the poison corrupts the whole lump.
    - The "mystery of iniquity" was spiritual poison introduced early, mixing
      the Gospel with human pride.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Warning of Internal Corruption

- **Question:** What class of men did he warn were to soon arise in the church?
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:29, 30 – “For I know this, that after my departing shall
  grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own
  selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after
  them.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Wolves & Perversions)

- **Wolves in Sheep's Clothing:**
  - A "wolf" is a leader who feeds _on_ the flock rather than feeding them.
  - They seek personal gain and prestige rather than the salvation of souls.
  - Ezekiel 34:2 – “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel... Woe
    be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the
    shepherds feed the flocks?”
- **"Of Your Own Selves":**
  - The most dangerous deception comes from within the church structure.
  - **Motivation:** To draw disciples _after them_.
  - They detach people from the Lamb of God and attach them to human intellect
    or organization.
- **Perverse Things:**
  - Any teaching that distorts God's character or lessens the authority of His
    law.

## Slide 7 – Q2: The Spirit of Antichrist

- **Replacement, Not Just Denial:**
  - The spirit of antichrist is a _replacement_ of Jesus.
  - When a leader steps between the soul and the Savior, demanding loyalty that
    belongs only to God, the seeds of the papacy are sown.
- **Key Text:**
  - John 1:29 – “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
    Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.”
  - True leaders point to the Lamb; false leaders point to themselves.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Coming Apostasy

- **Question:** What apostasy in the church was to develop before Christ would
  return the second time?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:3 – “Let no man deceive you by any means: for
  that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man
  of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Definitions)

- **Apostasy ("Falling Away"):**
  - Greek _apostasia_: A defection or revolt.
  - Not falling away from the _name_ Christian, but from the _truth_ of Christ.
- **Man of Sin:**
  - A system of lawlessness that attempts to change or annul the Law of God.
  - Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the most High... and
    think to change times and laws...”
- **Son of Perdition:**
  - This title is used for only one other person: Judas Iscariot.
  - John 17:12 – “While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name...
    and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might
    be fulfilled.”
  - **Significance:** This power is a _betrayer_ from the inner circle, kissing
    Christ while selling Him out.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Prophetic Sequence & Sanctuary

- **The Sequence:**
  1. The restraining power (pagan Rome) is removed.
  2. The "Man of Sin" (Papal Rome) takes his seat in the "temple of God" (the
     church).
  3. The Lord consumes this power at the Second Coming (2 Thessalonians 2:8).
- **Sanctuary Insight:**
  - By setting himself up in the "temple," this power obscures the view of the
    true Temple in heaven.
  - It diverts the eyes of men from the true Intercessor to human
    intermediaries.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Heathen Rites Adopted

- **Question:** How was this "falling away" from Bible truth shown?
- **Answer:** By the adoption of heathen rites and customs in the church.
- **Key Concept:** The "falling away" was a gradual compromise—blending pagan
  philosophy with Christian terminology.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Syncretism)

- **Syncretism (Mixing):**
  - To make Christianity acceptable to the heathen, leaders adopted pagan
    festivals and images, giving them Christian names.
  - **Images:** Veneration of images replaced pagan idol worship (violating the
    Second Commandment).
  - **Sunday:** The "day of the sun" was elevated to replace the biblical
    Sabbath.
- **Loss of Spiritual Power:**
  - When the church has the "power of godliness," the Spirit convicts hearts.
  - When the Spirit is lost, the church resorts to pageantry and sensory rituals
    to impress the people.
  - 2 Timothy 3:5 – “Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
    from such turn away.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Muddy Stream:**
  - If you have a glass of pure water and add a drop of sewage, it is no longer
    pure.
  - The early church tried to expand the "river of life" by digging channels
    into the stagnant pools of paganism.
  - **Result:** The volume of water increased (more members), but the purity was
    lost.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Character of Leadership

- **Question:** What came to be the character and work of many of the religious
  leaders?
- **Quote:** “Worldly-minded bishops, instead of caring for the salvation of
  their flocks, were often but too much inclined to travel about, and entangle
  themselves in worldly concerns.” (Neander, _General History of the Christian
  Religion and Church_)

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Shift in Focus)

- **True Ministry:**
  - The biblical elder feeds the flock and serves as an example, not for money
    or power.
  - 1 Peter 5:2 – “Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the
    oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre,
    but of a ready mind.”
- **Apostate Ministry:**
  - Leadership positions began to attract ambitious men seeking power rather
    than piety.
  - They became entangled in "worldly concerns"—politics and civil influence.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Sanctification vs. Status

- **God's Standard:**
  - Greatness is measured by service.
  - Mark 10:43 – “But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
    among you, shall be your minister.”
- **The Apostate Standard:**
  - Greatness measured by rank, titles, and proximity to the Emperor.
  - A leader focused on political maneuvering has little time to weep for souls
    or point sinners to the Lamb of God.

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Papacy Defined

- **Question:** What has been the special characteristic of the papacy?
- **Answer:** A union of church and state, or the religious power dominating the
  civil power to further its ends.
- **Defining the Papacy:**
  - It is the ecclesiastical system where the Bishop of Rome claims supreme
    authority over the church and (historically) the state.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Two Opposing Principles)

- **God's Government:**
  - Based on free will and love.
  - Revelation 22:17 – “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come... And whosoever
    will, let him take the water of life freely.”
- **Satan's Principle:**
  - Based on force and coercion (Church & State union).
  - If the heart cannot be convinced, the body is forced.
- **Spiritual Adultery:**
  - The church is the bride of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2).
  - Relying on the state for power is "fornication" (Revelation 17:2).

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **Oil and Water:**
  - The State deals with civil order using the sword (Romans 13:4).
  - The Church deals with the conscience using the Word of God (Ephesians 6:17).
  - **Lesson:**
    - Like oil and water, they have distinct functions.
    - Mixing them—using the sword to deal with conscience—creates a monster that
      destroys both liberty and true religion.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Formation of the Union

- **Question:** When was the union of church and state formed, from which the
  papacy gained its control over the civil powers?
- **Answer:** The foundation was laid for it during the reign of Constantine,
  A.D. 313-337, and it developed under his successors.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points (Constantine & Prophecy)

- **The Compromise:**
  - The Edict of Milan (A.D. 313) granted freedom, but the church soon sought
    _favor_.
  - Satan switched tactics from persecution (lion) to patronage (serpent).
  - Christianity became fashionable; many joined for political advancement
    without the new birth.
- **Prophetic Fulfillment:**
  - This prepared the way for the "dragon" (Pagan Rome) to give his authority to
    the "beast" (Papal Rome).
  - Revelation 13:2 – “...and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and
    great authority.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Government Patronage

- **Question:** How was this governmental patronage of the church shown under
  Constantine and later rulers?
- **Answer:** Immunities, privileges, and judicial functions for the clergy;
  gifts and financial support; finally, the exclusion of all except Catholic
  orthodoxy.

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Steps to Tyranny)

- **The Progression:**
  1. **Equality:** Christianity placed on par with paganism.
  2. **Privilege:** Clergy exempted from taxes; state paid church bills.
  3. **Exclusion:** Only "Catholic orthodoxy" remained legal; dissenters were
     punished.
- **The Result:**
  - **Distorted Atonement:** Focus shifted from the blood of Christ to the gold
    of the Empire.
  - **Persecution:** The church used the state's sword, becoming "drunken with
    the blood of the saints" (Revelation 17:6).

## Slide 24 – Q8: Application & Illustration

- **Righteousness by Faith Contrast:**
  - A church relying on the state admits it lacks the Spirit's power.
  - True believers trust in God, not the arm of flesh.
  - Jeremiah 17:5 – “Thus saith the Lord; Cursed be the man that trusteth in
    man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord.”
- **Illustration: The Crutch**
  - A healthy man walks on his own legs; a cripple needs a crutch.
  - In Acts, the church walked and leaped in the Spirit.
  - When paralyzed by compromise, she reached for the "crutch" of State Power to
    hold herself up.
