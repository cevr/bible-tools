# Bible Study: Biblical Election—God's Universal Invitation and Man's Response

## Introduction

Few doctrines have caused more confusion or spiritual anguish than the teaching of election and predestination. Many sincere seekers have wondered, "Has God already decided my eternal destiny? Is salvation truly available to me?" Scripture reveals a beautiful truth: God has indeed purposed salvation from eternity past, but His purpose was to save **all who would believe**—not an arbitrary selection of favored souls. Understanding biblical election brings assurance, not anxiety, to the earnest heart.

## Core Truths

### God's Eternal Purpose to Save

Before the foundation of the world, the Godhead determined to provide salvation for the human race. This was no afterthought or emergency response to sin:

> _"According as He hath chosen us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love."_ (Ephesians 1:4)

Notice carefully what was determined "before the foundation of the world":

- **The plan of salvation** through Christ was established
- **The character** of the saved was defined—"holy and without blemish"
- **The means** of salvation was fixed—"in Him" (Christ)

God did not predestine specific individuals to be saved or lost; He predestined that **whoever** meets the condition of faith and holiness through Christ would be saved.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "chosen" (eklegomai) is the same root from which we get "ekklesia" (church). God's "election" is His choosing of a **people characterized by faith**, not a predetermined list of names.

### God Desires All to Be Saved

Scripture leaves no room for the idea that God arbitrarily selects some for salvation while condemning others:

> _"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."_ (1 Timothy 2:4)

This is not merely a wish but an expression of God's revealed will. He has made provision for every soul:

- **"God so loved the world"** (John 3:16)—not merely the elect
- **"The Lord is... not willing that any should perish"** (2 Peter 3:9)
- **"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely"** (Revelation 22:17)

The invitation is universal; the response is individual.

### Our Part: Choice and Faith

While God initiates salvation, we must respond. This is not earning salvation by works but exercising the God-given power of choice:

> _"Choose you this day whom ye will serve."_ (Joshua 24:15)

> _"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."_ (Acts 16:31)

**Salvation requires:**

- **Faith in Christ**: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts 16:31)
- **Willingness**: "If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know" (John 7:17, RV)
- **Acceptance**: "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" (Revelation 22:17)

[ILL] Imagine a wealthy benefactor who establishes a fund to pay all debts for anyone in a certain city. He announces it publicly, sends personal invitations, and keeps his office open day and night. Yet some never come. Was the provision not made for them? Was the invitation insincere? No—they simply never believed or responded. So it is with God's salvation: the provision is universal, the invitation is earnest, but each person must come.

## Deeper Truths

### Understanding Predestination

> _"Being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who worketh all things after the counsel of His own will."_ (Ephesians 1:11)

**Predestination** (Greek: _proorizo_—to determine beforehand) refers to what God has predetermined about **the plan and character of salvation**, not about which specific individuals would accept or reject it.

God foreordained:

- That salvation would come through Christ alone
- That the saved would be "adopted as sons" (Ephesians 1:5)
- That the saved would be "holy and without blemish" (Ephesians 1:4)
- That believers would be "conformed to the image of His Son" (Romans 8:29)

[Q] **"But doesn't Romans 8:29 say God 'foreknew' certain individuals and predestined them specifically?"**

Let us read carefully: _"For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son"_ (Romans 8:29). God's foreknowledge is not His predetermination. He knows in advance who will respond to His grace—this is His omniscience. But His knowing does not cause our choosing. A weather forecaster may accurately predict rain, but his prediction does not cause the rain. God sees through time, but He does not override human freedom.

Furthermore, notice what He predestined: not who would believe, but that believers would be **"conformed to the image of His Son."** The destination is fixed; the travelers are those who choose to embark.

### The Difficult Case of Romans 9

> _"Therefore hath He mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He hardeneth."_ (Romans 9:18)

This verse, taken alone, seems to support arbitrary divine selection. But Scripture must interpret Scripture:

> _"With the merciful Thou wilt shew Thyself merciful; with an upright man Thou wilt shew Thyself upright; with the pure Thou wilt shew Thyself pure; and with the froward Thou wilt shew Thyself froward."_ (Psalm 18:25-26)

God's response to us reflects our response to Him. Pharaoh hardened his own heart repeatedly (Exodus 8:15, 32; 9:34) before God confirmed him in that hardening. God "wills" to show mercy to the merciful—that is, to those who respond to His grace with softened hearts.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "froward" (_iqqesh_) means twisted, perverse, or crooked. God's "showing Himself froward" to such people means He allows them to experience the natural consequences of their crooked ways—He does not arbitrarily make them crooked.

### Election Is Conditional

God's election operates on the principle of condition, not arbitrary selection:

- **Called according to His purpose**: _"To them that love God, to them who are the called according to His purpose"_ (Romans 8:28)—notice: "them that **love God**"
- **Holy and without blemish**: _"That we should be holy and without blemish before Him in love"_ (Ephesians 1:4)—the elect are characterized by holiness
- **The overcomers**: _"He that overcometh... I will not blot out his name"_ (Revelation 3:5)—names are retained based on overcoming

The condition is always faith working by love—not arbitrary divine favoritism.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Great Controversy and Human Freedom

At the heart of the great controversy between Christ and Satan is the question of God's character. Satan charged that God's law could not be obeyed, that His government was arbitrary, and that He demanded what He would not enable.

A doctrine of arbitrary election would vindicate Satan's charges. If God predestined some to be lost regardless of their choices, He could not be called loving or just. But the truth of biblical election reveals:

- **God's love**: He desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:4)
- **God's justice**: He judges based on response to light (Romans 2:12-16)
- **God's power**: He enables all who choose to overcome (Philippians 4:13)
- **Human responsibility**: We must make our calling and election "sure" (2 Peter 1:10)

### The Sanctuary and Assurance

The sanctuary message illuminates election beautifully:

**Outer Court (Cross)**: Christ died for **all**—_"He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world"_ (1 John 2:2). Universal provision.

**Holy Place (Daily Ministry)**: Christ intercedes for **all who come**—_"He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them"_ (Hebrews 7:25). Conditional application.

**Most Holy Place (Investigative Judgment)**: Names are retained for **those who overcome**—_"He that overcometh... I will not blot out his name out of the book of life"_ (Revelation 3:5). Final confirmation.

Our names can be written in heaven **now** (Luke 10:20). The question is whether they will remain there through faithfulness sustained by Christ's power.

### Righteousness by Faith and Election

Biblical election is inseparable from righteousness by faith:

- We cannot **elect ourselves** by works or merit
- We cannot **disqualify ourselves** from God's offer by past sins
- We **receive election** by faith in Christ's finished work
- We **maintain election** by abiding in Christ daily

> _"Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me."_ (John 15:4)

The same faith that brings us to Christ keeps us in Christ. Election is not a one-time event but an ongoing relationship of trust and surrender.

[ILL] Consider a man clinging to a life preserver in stormy seas. His holding on does not earn his rescue—the life preserver saves him. But if he releases his grip, he will drown. The life preserver remains available; the man must continue holding. So we must "hold fast" (Revelation 3:11) to Christ—not to earn salvation, but to continue receiving it.

## Practical Application

### Making Your Calling and Election Sure

> _"Wherefore... brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure."_ (2 Peter 1:10)

If election were arbitrary and irrevocable, this admonition would be meaningless. But because election is conditional upon continued faith and surrender, we must be diligent:

**Daily disciplines for assured election:**

1. **Study God's Word**: Know His promises and conditions (John 5:39)
2. **Pray without ceasing**: Maintain living connection with Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:17)
3. **Obey by faith**: Let Christ's life work obedience in you (Philippians 2:13)
4. **Confess and forsake sin**: Keep short accounts with God (1 John 1:9; Proverbs 28:13)
5. **Endure to the end**: Faithful perseverance is the evidence of genuine election (Matthew 24:13)

### Warnings Against Presumption

> _"Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown."_ (Revelation 3:11)

A crown is prepared, but it can be forfeited. This warning is incompatible with unconditional election:

- **Crowns can be lost**: "that no man take thy crown"
- **Names can be blotted out**: those who do not overcome (Revelation 3:5)
- **Endurance is required**: "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved" (Matthew 24:13)
- **Faithfulness unto death**: "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life" (Revelation 2:10)

This is not salvation by works but salvation through a **living relationship** with Christ that produces faithfulness as its fruit.

[Q] **"If I can lose my salvation, how can I ever have assurance?"**

Assurance comes not from believing you **cannot** fall but from knowing that **Christ will keep you** as long as you trust Him. _"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy"_ (Jude 24). The focus is not on your weakness but on His power. As long as you abide in Christ, you are secure. Doubt your own ability; never doubt His.

### Responding to God's Universal Invitation

> _"Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."_ (Revelation 22:17)

This is the final invitation of the Bible. It is not addressed to "the elect" but to "whosoever will." If you are reading these words, you are invited. The question is not whether God has chosen you—He has extended His choice to all. The question is whether you will choose Him.

**Today's response:**

- Will you **believe** on the Lord Jesus Christ?
- Will you **surrender** your will to His purpose?
- Will you **continue** in faith, abiding in Him daily?
- Will you **endure** to the end, holding fast what you have received?

## Appeal

> _"Choose you this day whom ye will serve."_ (Joshua 24:15)

God, in His infinite love, has provided salvation for you. Before the foundation of the world, He determined that if you would believe, you would be saved. He sent His Son to die for you. He sends His Spirit to draw you. He gives you this very moment to decide.

You are not excluded by divine decree. You are not predestined to be lost. The water of life flows freely, and you are invited to drink.

But you must **choose**. You must **come**. You must **believe** and **continue believing**. Election becomes yours the moment you surrender to Christ—and remains yours as long as you abide in Him.

Will you, today, make your calling and election sure? Will you give diligence to hold fast what Christ offers? The crown of life awaits the faithful. The book of life holds your name if you will keep it there through daily, living faith in Jesus.

> _"Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life."_ (Revelation 2:10)
