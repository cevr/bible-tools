## Slide 1 – Q1: Creation and the Sabbath

- Question: When and by what acts was the Sabbath made?
- Key Text: Genesis 2:2, 3 – “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He
  had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had
  made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it
  He had rested from all His work which God created and made.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Three Divine Acts

- The Sabbath was established before the entrance of sin.
- It is not a Jewish institution but a divine gift to the human race (Mark 2:27
  – “And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
  Sabbath:”).
- **1. God Rested:**
  - Not due to fatigue (Isaiah 40:28 – “...the Creator of the ends of the earth,
    fainteth not, neither is weary...”).
  - A rest of satisfaction and completion, just as Christ cried “It is finished”
    on the cross (John 19:30).
- **2. God Blessed:**
  - Endowed the day with the power to communicate life and well-being.
- **3. God Sanctified:**
  - To “sanctify” means to set apart for holy use.
  - God placed a distinction between the holy and the common (Ezekiel 22:26 –
    “Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they
    have put no difference between the holy and profane...”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- The Sabbath is the first lesson in Righteousness by Faith.
- Adam and Eve were created on the sixth day; their first full day was God’s
  Sabbath.
- They did not work to earn the Sabbath; they entered into a rest God had
  already prepared.
- **Justification:**
  - We rest in the finished work of Christ, just as Adam rested in the finished
    work of Creation (Hebrews 4:10 – “For he that is entered into his rest, he
    also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.”).
- **Sanctification:**
  - We allow God to make us holy, just as He made the day holy.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Father’s House:**
  - Imagine a wealthy father builds and fully furnishes a home for his child.
  - When the child arrives, he does not pick up a hammer to "finish" the house.
  - He simply enters and enjoys what the father has done.
- **Lesson:**
  - This is the Sabbath experience.
  - We rest in what God has done, rather than striving to save ourselves by our
    own works.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Weekly Cycle

- Question: What important division of time is marked off by the Sabbath?
- Answer: The Sabbath marks off **the week**.

## Slide 6 – Q2: God’s Fingerprint on Time

- Other time divisions are governed by heavenly bodies:
  - **The Year:** Earth’s orbit around the sun.
  - **The Month:** Moon’s orbit around the earth.
  - **The Day:** Earth’s rotation on its axis.
- The seven-day week has no astronomical basis.
- It stands solely on the authority of God’s Word and Creation history (Exodus
  20:11 – “For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that
  in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath
  day, and hallowed it.”).
- It is a memorial that God is the Sovereign of time.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Clock vs. The Cycle:**
  - If you find a clock keeping time, you know a man designed it.
  - But if you find a recurring cycle of seven days continuing for millennia
    without a star or planet to dictate it, you have found God’s fingerprint.
- **Lesson:**
  - The week is a monument to the Creator that no skeptic can explain away.

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Law at Sinai

- Question: Two thousand five hundred years after creation, the Sabbath was
  proclaimed, with the other moral commands, from Mount Sinai. Why did God say
  He had put His blessing upon that day?
- Key Text: Exodus 20:11 – “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the
  sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord
  blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **The Reason:** “For in six days the Lord made...”
  - The Sabbath is the seal of God’s authority.
  - It identifies the Lawgiver (Creator) and His territory (heaven and earth).
- **The Command:** “Remember.”
  - Implies the institution was already known but obscured by Egyptian bondage.
- **The Nature of the Law:**
  - The Ten Commandments are a transcript of God’s character (Psalm 119:172 –
    “My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are
    righteousness.”).
  - Since God does not change (Malachi 3:6), His moral law is immutable.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Sanctuary Connection

- **Earthly Sanctuary:**
  - The Ten Commandments were placed inside the Ark of the Covenant, beneath the
    Mercy Seat (Exodus 25:21).
- **Heavenly Sanctuary:**
  - John saw the “ark of his testament” in heaven (Revelation 11:19 – “And the
    temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark
    of his testament...”).
- **Lesson:**
  - The Sabbath lies at the heart of the law in the Most Holy Place, protected
    by God’s presence.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Destruction of Jerusalem

- Question: What befell the city of Jerusalem when it was captured by the king
  of Babylon?
- Key Text: 2 Chronicles 36:18, 19 – “And all the vessels of the house of God...
  he brought to Babylon. And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the
  wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **Total Destruction:**
  - The city was destroyed, the temple burned, and people taken captive.
- **Spiritual Reality:**
  - When God’s people remove themselves from His protection by disobedience,
    they are vulnerable.
- **Captivity:**
  - Spiritually, sin leads to captivity (Romans 7:23 – “...bringing me into
    captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.”).
- **Vessels Removed:**
  - Signified that the glory of God had departed because the covenant was
    broken.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Prophecy of Sabbath Breaking

- Question: Of what prophecy was this a fulfillment?
- Key Text: Jeremiah 17:27 – “But if ye will not hearken unto Me to hallow the
  Sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of
  Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof,
  and it shall not be quenched.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Specific Sin:** Jeremiah warned that Sabbath-breaking would lead to
  national ruin.
- **The Thermometer of Faith:**
  - The Sabbath tests loyalty.
  - Refusing to rest proved Israel did not trust God for their daily bread or
    security.
- **The Unquenchable Fire:**
  - A fire that cannot be put out until it has finished its work of destruction
    (Jude 7).

## Slide 15 – Q5: Application (Faith & Rebellion)

- Rejection of the Sabbath is a rejection of the sign of sanctification (Exodus
  31:13 – “...for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations;
  that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.”).
- It says, “I will manage my own life; I do not need God’s rest.”
- This is the spirit of self-righteousness.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Restoration and Revival

- Question: After the restoration of Israel from the Babylonian captivity, what
  was said to have been the reason of their punishment?
- Key Text: Nehemiah 13:17, 18 – “Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and
  said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath
  day? Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon
  us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the
  Sabbath.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- Nehemiah identified Sabbath profanation as the root cause of the Captivity.
- **True Revival:**
  - True Righteousness by Faith results in obedience.
  - Nehemiah closed the gates on the Sabbath (Nehemiah 13:19).
- **Grace and Law:**
  - Grace does not invalidate the law (Romans 3:31 – “Do we then make void the
    law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.”).

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Crash Survivor:**
  - If a man crashes his car because he ignored traffic lights, and a doctor
    heals him (grace), does he have the right to ignore the lights again?
  - No. His restoration obligates him to be even more careful.
- **Lesson:**
  - Since God graciously restored Israel, they should not return to the sin
    (Sabbath-breaking) that caused the crash.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Jesus and the Sabbath

- Question: How did Christ regard the Sabbath during His earthly ministry?
- Key Text: Luke 4:16 – “And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up;
  and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and
  stood up for to read.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points

- **"As His Custom Was":** It was His lifelong habit.
- **Magnifying the Law:**
  - Jesus rescued the Sabbath from burdensome traditions.
  - He taught it is "lawful to do well on the Sabbath days" (Matthew 12:12).
- **Imputed Righteousness:**
  - Jesus kept the law perfectly _for us_.
  - If He had broken the Sabbath, He would have been a sinner (1 John 3:4) and
    could not be our Savior.
  - His perfect Sabbath-keeping is part of the righteousness He offers us.

## Slide 21 – Q8: The Sabbath in the Future

- Question: How did He wish to have it regarded by His disciples at the siege of
  Jerusalem, nearly forty years after His death?
- Key Text: Matthew 24:20 – “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,
  neither on the Sabbath day.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: Key Points

- Jesus looked forward to the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70).
- **Enduring Validity:**
  - If the Sabbath were to be abolished at the cross, Jesus would not have asked
    them to pray about it 40 years later.
- **Practical Faith:**
  - He wanted them free from the hindrance of winter.
  - He wanted them free from the spiritual concern of fleeing on the holy day.
- **Conclusion:** The Sabbath remained sacred to Christ's church long after the
  Cross.

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Introduction of Sunday

- Question: What was the first effort of the Roman Church in behalf of the
  recognition of Sunday?
- Key Text: “In A.D. 196, Victor, Bishop of Rome, attempted to impose on all the
  churches the Roman custom of having Easter fall every year on Sunday.”
  (Bower's History of the Popes, vol.2, page 18)

## Slide 24 – Q9: Key Points

- The shift began by ecclesiastical authority, not divine command.
- **The Issue:** The celebration of Easter.
- **The Imposition:** Victor, Bishop of Rome, exerted authority to standardize a
  Sunday celebration.
- **The Seed of Popery:**
  - An early manifestation of the "mystery of iniquity" (2 Thessalonians 2:7).
  - Human tradition began to supersede the Word of God.

## Slide 25 – Q10: The Council of Nicaea

- Question: What was one of the principal reasons for convoking the Council of
  Nice?
- Key Text: “The question relating to the observance of Easter... was one of the
  principal reasons for convoking the Council of Nice...” (Boyle's Historical
  View of the Council of Nice, page 22)

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points

- **Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325):**
  - Called to unify the church and the empire.
  - Primary issue: Arian controversy (divinity of Christ).
  - Secondary major issue: The Easter question.
- **Motivation:**
  - Uniformity and political stability, rather than biblical fidelity.

## Slide 27 – Q11: The Easter Decision

- Question: How was the matter finally decided?
- Key Text: “Easter day was fixed on the Sunday immediately following the new
  moon which was nearest after the vernal equinox.” (Idem. page 23)
- **Key Points:**
  - The Council decreed the resurrection celebration must always be on
    **Sunday**.
  - This strengthened the prestige of Sunday.
  - It distanced the church from the biblical calendar used by the Jews.

## Slide 28 – Q12: Constantine’s Reasoning

- Question: In urging the observance of this decree on the churches, what reason
  did Constantine assign for it?
- Key Text: “Let us then have nothing in common with the most hostile rabble of
  the Jews.” (Idem, page 52)

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points

- Constantine’s reasoning was based on **anti-Semitism**, not Scripture.
- **Political:**
  - He wanted a Christianity distinct from the rebellious Jewish subjects.
- **Theological Error:**
  - The Sabbath was made for "man" (Mark 2:27), not just Jews.
  - Rejecting the Sabbath to spite the Jews meant rejecting a Creation
    ordinance.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Neighbor’s Fence:**
  - If a man hates his neighbor and burns down the fence the neighbor built, he
    feels separated from his enemy.
  - But if that fence was actually built by the King of the land, the man has
    not hurt the neighbor; he has insulted the King.
- **Lesson:**
  - In rejecting the Sabbath to spite the Jews, the church insulted the Creator.

## Slide 31 – Q13: The First Sunday Law

- Question: What had Constantine already done, in A.D. 321, to help forward
  Sunday to a place of prominence?
- Key Text: He issued an edict forcing "the judges and town people and the
  occupation of all trades" to rest on the "venerable day of the sun." (See
  Encyclopedia Britannica, art. Sunday)

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points

- **A.D. 321:** The first civil Sunday Law.
- **Pagan-Christian Synthesis:**
  - Called "the venerable day of the sun" (_dies solis_), not the "Sabbath of
    the Lord."
  - Constantine united pagan sun cults with Christianity.
- **State Power:**
  - The state began enforcing religious observance.
  - This violates the character of God, who desires free-will service.

## Slide 33 – Q14: The Claim of Authority

- Question: Eusebius was bishop of Caesarea... Who did he say had changed the
  obligations of the Sabbath to Sunday?
- Key Text: “All things whatsoever that it was duty to do on the Sabbath, these
  WE have transferred to the Lord's day.” (Eusebius's Commentary on the Psalms)

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points

- Eusebius openly admitted: **"WE have transferred."**
  - He did not claim God or the Apostles did it.
  - He claimed the prerogative for the church.
- **Prophecy Fulfilled:**
  - Daniel 7:25 – “And he shall speak great words against the most High... and
    think to change times and laws...”
- **The Authority Crisis:**
  - God says: "The seventh day."
  - The Church says: "We transferred it."
  - Righteousness by Faith means trusting God’s Word over human tradition.

## Slide 35 – Q15: Prohibition of the Sabbath

- Question: What did the Council of Laodicea decree in A.D. 364?
- Key Text: "The Council of Laodicea... first settled the observation of the
  Lord's day, and prohibited the keeping of the Jewish Sabbath under an
  anathema." (Dissertation on the Lord's Day Sabbath, pages 33, 34, 44)

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points

- By A.D. 364, the church moved from encouraging Sunday to **prohibiting the
  Sabbath**.
- **Anathema:**
  - Faithful believers keeping the Fourth Commandment were declared enemies of
    the church (cursed).
- **Persecution:**
  - Marks the development of the forcing power seen in Revelation 13.

## Slide 37 – Q16: Early Church Practice

- Question: But did the Christians of the early church keep the Sabbath?
- Key Text: “Down even to the fifth century, the observances of the Jewish
  Sabbath was continued in the Christian church.” (Coleman's Ancient
  Christianity Exemplified, chap. 26, sec. 2)

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points

- Yes, the Sabbath was kept for centuries.
- Despite apostasy in Rome and Alexandria, the broad body of Christians
  (especially in the East) rested on the Sabbath.
- God has always reserved a "remnant" who keep His commandments (Revelation
  14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
  commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”).

## Slide 39 – Q17: The Wilderness Church

- Question: What day was observed in the Dark Ages by some of the Waldenses?
- Key Text: "They kept the Sabbath day, observed the ordinance of baptism
  according to the primitive church, instructed their children in the articles
  of the Christian faith and the commandments of God." (Jones's Church History,
  vol. 2, chap. 5, sec. 4)

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points

- During the 1260 years of papal supremacy ("Dark Ages"), truth was hidden in
  the wilderness.
- The Waldenses (Vaudois) maintained the ancient faith.
- They rejected Rome's authority to change God's law.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - While earthly priests obscured the truth, these believers looked by faith to
    the heavenly sanctuary and the true Law of God.

## Slide 41 – Q18: Roman Catholic Admissions

- Question: What claim is now made by the Roman Church concerning the change of
  the Sabbath to Sunday?
- Key Text: “Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all
  modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the
  observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of
  Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural
  authority.” (Doctrinal Catechism)

## Slide 42 – Q18: Key Points

- Rome openly admits:
  1. There is **no Scriptural authority** for Sunday.
  2. The change is a mark of **ecclesiastical power**.
  3. Protestants keeping Sunday recognize the Church's authority over the Bible.
- **Application:**
  - To knowingly keep a man-made day is to pay homage to the power that changed
    it.
  - True faith submits solely to Christ.

## Slide 43 – Q19: The Reformers

- Question: Among the early Reformers, were there any who observed the seventh
  day?
- Key Text: “Carlstadt held to the divine authority of the Sabbath from the Old
  Testament.” (Life of Luther, page 402)

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points

- Yes, Dr. Andreas Carlstadt (colleague of Luther) argued for the Sabbath.
- Logic: If we reject the Pope and cling to the Bible, we must keep the Bible
  Sabbath.
- Anabaptists and others also saw this truth.
- The mainstream Reformation failed to advance this far, clinging to tradition.

## Slide 45 – Q20: Luther’s Admission

- Question: What did Luther say of Carlstadt's Sabbath views?
- Key Text: “Indeed, if Carlstadt were to write further about the Sabbath,
  Sunday would have to give way, and the Sabbath that is to say, Saturday must
  be kept holy.” (Luther, against the Celestial Prophets)

## Slide 46 – Q20: Key Points

- Luther admitted the logic: _Sola Scriptura_ leads to the Sabbath.
- **Repairing the Breach:**
  - The Reformation is a progressive work.
  - God calls us to "repair the breach" in His law (Isaiah 58:12).
- **Grace and Obedience:**
  - Saved by grace (Ephesians 2:8).
  - Faith leads to love and obedience (Romans 3:31).
  - Sabbath keeping is a sign we belong to the Creator.

## Slide 47 – Q20: Illustration & Appeal

- **The Soldier and the Flag:**
  - A soldier in enemy territory is commanded to drop his King’s flag and carry
    the enemy’s banner.
  - To a casual observer, it is "just cloth."
  - To the soldier, it is a question of allegiance.
- **Application:**
  - The Sabbath is God’s flag (Ezekiel 20:12 – “Moreover also I gave them my
    sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them...”).
  - Sunday is the banner of human tradition.
  - Which flag will you carry?
