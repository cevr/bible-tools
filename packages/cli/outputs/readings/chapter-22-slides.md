## Slide 1 – Title

- **Topic:** God’s Willingness to Forgive
- **Theme:** The Heart of the Gospel and the Sanctuary Message
- **Key Insight:** Forgiveness is not merely an administrative act; it is a
  transformative process.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The Blood of the Sacrifice (Justification).
  - The Power of the High Priest (Sanctification).

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: God’s Dealings with Sinners

- **Question:** In what way has God dealt with penitent sinners?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 103:10 – “He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor
  rewarded us according to our iniquities.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **Mercy Over Judgment:**
  - If God dealt with us strictly according to what we deserve, the result would
    be death.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- **The Substitute:**
  - God can spare the sinner because the penalty was laid upon Jesus Christ.
  - He bore the “reward” of our iniquities on the cross so we might receive
    mercy.
- **The Penitent Heart:**
  - This promise is for the penitent (sorrowful) sinner.
  - To the proud, the law condemns; to the broken heart, God reveals grace.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Debtor and the Benefactor:**
  - Imagine a man with a massive debt he cannot repay. Strict justice demands he
    be sold into servitude.
  - A wealthy benefactor pays the debt in full.
  - The creditor now deals with the debtor according to the payment made by the
    benefactor, not the debtor’s lack of funds.
  - **Lesson:** God deals with us according to Christ’s merit, not our own
    record.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Motivation for Forgiveness

- **Question:** Why has He dealt thus with men?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 103:11 – “For as the heaven is high above the earth, so
  great is His mercy toward them that fear Him.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points & Sanctuary Application

- **Infinite Measure:**
  - As the distance between heaven and earth is beyond calculation, so is God's
    mercy vast enough to cover every repented sin.
- **Reverence Required:**
  - The mercy is toward “them that fear Him”—not terror, but a holy reverence
    that hates sin.
- **The Sanctuary Type:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the "mercy seat" was placed _above_ the Ark of the
    Covenant (which contained the Ten Commandments).
  - **Lesson:** While the law is the standard of righteousness, God’s mercy
    (sprinkled with atoning blood) covers the transgressor who comes in faith.

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: God’s Readiness

- **Question:** What is God ready to do for all who call upon Him?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 86:5 – “For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive;
  and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Ready to Forgive:**
  - God does not need to be persuaded or begged to love us.
  - He stands "at the door," waiting for the sinner to knock.
- **Plenteous Mercy:**
  - His grace is not limited or scarce.
  - Romans 5:20 – “...But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.”
- **The Condition:**
  - The only requirement is to “call upon thee.” This implies recognizing our
    need and depending on His power.

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Reservoir and the Tap:**
  - A reservoir full of water stands ready to supply a city.
  - It does not need to be created; it only needs the tap to be opened.
  - **Lesson:** God’s mercy is the reservoir; our prayer of faith is the opening
    of the tap.

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Abraham’s Intercession

- **Question:** When Abraham asked God to spare Sodom if He should find ten
  righteous persons therein, what did the Lord say?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 18:32 – “And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and
  I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And He
  said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.”

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points

- **The Value of the Righteous:**
  - Righteousness (right doing by faith) has a preserving power in the world.
- **God’s Patience:**
  - God was willing to save the city for a tiny remnant.
  - Even when the city was destroyed, He first separated the righteous (Lot)
    from the wicked.
- **Intercession:**
  - Abraham acted as a mediator, foreshadowing Christ.
  - Hebrews 7:25 – “Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
    come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Prayer of Moses

- **Question:** What prayer did Moses offer in behalf of Israel?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 14:19 – “Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of this
  people according unto the greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast forgiven
  this people, from Egypt even until now.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **Appeal to Character:**
  - Moses does not argue that Israel deserves forgiveness.
  - He pleads based on the “greatness of Thy mercy.”
- **Consistent Forgiveness:**
  - He reminds God of His history of repeated pardon from Egypt onward.
- **Definition: Intercession:**
  - The act of pleading on behalf of another.
  - Christ does this for us by presenting the merits of His blood before the
    Father.

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Immediate Answer

- **Question:** What reply did the Lord immediately make?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 14:20 – “And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to
  Thy word.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points

- **Immediate Response:**
  - There was no hesitation. God answered the mediator instantly.
- **Power of Mediation:**
  - This demonstrates the efficacy of our High Priest’s work.
  - When Christ pleads His blood for a repentant sinner, the Father accepts the
    plea immediately.
  - There is no friction between the Father and the Son; they are one in the
    work of redemption.

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: David’s Confession

- **Question:** When David confessed his great sin, what did God do for him?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 32:5 – “I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity
  have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and
  Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Key Points

- **Stopping the Silence:**
  - Hidden sin destroys us. Psalm 32:3 – “When I kept silence, my bones waxed
    old through my roaring all the day long.”
- **Uncovering Sin:**
  - Humans hide sin; faith uncovers it.
  - Proverbs 28:13 – “He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
    confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.”
- **Immediate Release:**
  - The moment the confession was genuine (“I said, I will confess...”), the
    forgiveness was granted (“Thou forgavest”).

---

## Slide 18 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Festering Wound:**
  - A festering wound cannot heal if it is covered up and ignored.
  - It must be opened, cleaned, and exposed to the physician’s care.
  - **Lesson:** Confession is opening the wound of sin to the Great Physician so
    He can apply the healing balm of His blood.

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Confession and Cleansing

- **Question:** Does the lord forgive sins when they are confessed to Him?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 1:9 – “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
  forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”

---

## Slide 20 – Q8: Righteousness by Faith (Twofold Work)

- **1. Forgiveness (Justification):**
  - God removes the legal condemnation. He is “faithful and just” because Christ
    paid the penalty.
  - Definition: God declaring the sinner righteous because of Christ's merits
    (imputed righteousness).
- **2. Cleansing (Sanctification):**
  - God cleanses the heart from the defilement of sin. The goal is to remove
    “all unrighteousness.”
  - Definition: God making the sinner holy in character through the indwelling
    Spirit (imparted righteousness).
- **The Process:**
  - We must confess specific sins, agreeing with God about what separates us
    from Him.

---

## Slide 21 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Muddy Child:**
  - If a child falls in the mud, a loving parent does two things:
    1. Forgives the child for being careless (restores the relationship).
    2. Washes the mud off the child (restores cleanliness).
  - **Lesson:** God forgives the guilt _and_ washes away the stain of sin from
    our character.

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: Fullness of Pardon

- **Question:** How full is the Lord's forgiveness, when one fulfills the
  conditions?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 55:7 – “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the
  unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will
  have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points

- **Forsaking the Way (Action):**
  - Repentance is a change of direction; the lifestyle of sin is abandoned by
    grace.
- **Forsaking the Thoughts (Mind):**
  - True Righteousness by Faith involves the mind.
  - 2 Corinthians 10:5 – “Casting down imaginations... and bringing into
    captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.”
- **Abundant Pardon:**
  - God pardons “abundantly”—enough to cover the sin and restore the soul.
  - **Repentance:** A sorrow for sin and a turning away from it. It is a gift
    from God (Acts 5:31).

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: Proof of Willingness

- **Question:** In what special manner has God shown His willingness to forgive
  the sinner?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:8 – “But God commendeth His love toward us, in that,
  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”

---

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points

- **Preemptive Love:**
  - God did not wait for us to become righteous. He acted while we were “yet
    sinners” and enemies.
- **The Cost of Forgiveness:**
  - Forgiveness is free to us, but it cost Heaven everything.
  - In the sanctuary type, an animal died. In reality, the Son of God died.
  - This proves God’s love is self-sacrificing and unconditional.

---

## Slide 26 – Q11: Assurance of All Things

- **Question:** What does this wonderful manifestation on the part of God,
  vouchsafe to us?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:32 – “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him
  up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”

---

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Logic of Heaven:**
  - If God gave the greatest gift (His Son), He will certainly not withhold the
    lesser gifts needed for salvation.
- **“All Things”:**
  - Power to overcome sin.
  - The Holy Spirit.
  - Wisdom and daily grace.
- **Assurance:**
  - If He gave Jesus to die for you, He will give the Spirit to live in you.

---

## Slide 28 – Q12: The Reason for Delay

- **Question:** Why has such full provision been made?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 3:9 – “The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as
  some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that
  any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”

---

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points

- **God’s Will:**
  - It is not His will that any human be lost.
  - Matthew 25:41 – “Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart
    from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
    angels.”
- **The Purpose of Time:**
  - The delay of the Second Coming is mercy, giving time for the gospel to reach
    every heart.
- **Universal Call:**
  - Provision is made for all; the tragedy is rejecting the pardon already
    purchased.

---

## Slide 30 – Q13: The Prodigal Son Returns

- **Question:** When the prodigal son, in the parable, repented and turned
  toward home, what did his father do?
- **Key Text:** Luke 15:20 – “And he arose, and came to his father. But when he
  was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and
  fell on his neck, and kissed him.”

---

## Slide 31 – Q13: Key Points

- **God is Watching:**
  - The father saw the son “a great way off,” implying he watched daily.
- **God Runs:**
  - The father ran to the son. God is in a hurry to bridge the gap between sin
    and righteousness.
- **Acceptance Before Change:**
  - The father embraced him in his rags.
  - Acceptance comes first; the changing of the character follows the embrace.

---

## Slide 32 – Q14: The Robe and the Ring

- **Question:** Upon the son's asking to be made only a hired servant, what
  order was issued in behalf of the penitent one?
- **Key Text:** Luke 15:22-24 – “But the father said to his servants, Bring
  forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
  on his feet... For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and
  is found...”

---

## Slide 33 – Q14: Spiritual Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Servant vs. Son:**
  - The son wanted to work as a servant (legalism/debt).
  - The father restored him as a son (grace/relationship).
- **The Best Robe:**
  - Represents the **Righteousness of Christ** covering our filthy rags.
  - Zechariah 3:4 – “...Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee,
    and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.”
- **Shoes:**
  - Preparation to walk in newness of life (Ephesians 6:15).
- **Alive Again:**
  - Forgiveness is spiritual resurrection from the death of sin.

---

## Slide 34 – Q14: Illustration

- **Servant’s Wages vs. Son’s Love:**
  - We often come to God offering to work like servants to "pay Him back."
  - God refuses the payment, adopts us as children, clothes us in His character,
    and empowers us to serve Him out of love, not debt.

---

## Slide 35 – Q15: The Gift of the Spirit

- **Question:** Is God willing to do for His children as earthly parents are for
  theirs?
- **Key Text:** Luke 11:13 – “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good
  gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
  Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?”

---

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points

- **From Lesser to Greater:**
  - If flawed human parents feed their children, how much more does the perfect
    God of love desire to help us?
- **The Specific Gift:**
  - The promise is for the **Holy Spirit**.
  - The Spirit brings Christ’s presence and writes the law on the heart.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “...I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in
    their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
    people.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q16: The Certainty of Forgiveness

- **Question:** How many receive forgiveness from God?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:8 – “Everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that
  seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.”

---

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points

- **Universal Availability:**
  - “Everyone” includes the worst sinner, the backslider, and the
    self-righteous.
- **Active Faith:**
  - Asking, seeking, knocking. We must hunger for righteousness.
  - Matthew 5:6 – “Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
    righteousness: for they shall be filled.”
- **Certainty:**
  - It says “receiveth,” not “might receive.” We can claim this promise with
    confidence.

---

## Slide 39 – Q17: God Does Not Forget

- **Question:** Does the Lord forget the cries of those who call upon Him?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 49:15 – “Can a woman forget her sucking child?...Yea,
  they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.”

---

## Slide 40 – Q17: Key Points

- **Stronger than Nature:**
  - God’s love transcends the strongest human bond (a mother and nursing child).
- **Graven on His Hands:**
  - Isaiah 49:16 – “Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
    walls are continually before me.”
  - This points to the scars of the crucifixion.
  - When Christ looks at His hands in the sanctuary, He sees the price paid for
    you and remembers you.

---

## Slide 41 – Q17: Illustration

- **Unbreakable Cords:**
  - A mother might abandon her child in madness or sin.
  - But Christ, having paid the infinite price, has bound Himself to us.
  - Nothing can break this bond except our own persistent rejection of Him.
  - We are safe in His remembrance.
