# Bible Study: Justification by Faith

## Introduction

Justification by faith stands at the very heart of the gospel—the glorious truth that guilty sinners may be declared righteous before a holy God, not by their own works, but through faith in Jesus Christ. This doctrine answers humanity's deepest need: How can a sinner stand acquitted in the judgment of a just and holy God? The answer, revealed throughout Scripture, points us to Christ alone as "The Lord Our Righteousness."

## Core Truths

### The Universal Problem: No One Can Be Justified by Works

Scripture presents humanity's condition with unflinching honesty:

> _"And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified."_ (Psalm 143:2)

> _"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."_ (Romans 3:23)

**Justify**: To prove or show to be just; to pronounce free from guilt or blame; to declare righteous. When God justifies a sinner, He legally declares that person to be righteous—not because of what they have done, but because of what Christ has done for them.

The law cannot justify us because its purpose is diagnostic, not curative:

> _"For by the law is the knowledge of sin."_ (Romans 3:20)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "knowledge" in Romans 3:20 is _epignosis_, meaning full, experiential knowledge. The law doesn't merely inform us about sin in general—it exposes our own personal guilt before a holy God. Like a mirror, it reveals the problem but cannot wash away the stain.

### The Divine Solution: Justification by Grace Through Faith

Since we cannot justify ourselves, God provides what we desperately need:

> _"Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."_ (Romans 3:24)

Three magnificent truths emerge here:

1. **Freely** (Greek: _dorean_)—as a gift, without cost to us
2. **By His grace**—unmerited favor flowing from God's character of love
3. **Through the redemption**—the purchase price paid by Christ's blood

> _"By His knowledge shall My righteous servant justify many; for He shall bear their iniquities."_ (Isaiah 53:11)

Christ, the sinless One, bore our sins that we might receive His righteousness:

> _"For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him."_ (2 Corinthians 5:21)

[ILL] Imagine a prisoner standing before a judge, guilty beyond question. The evidence is overwhelming, the verdict certain: guilty. But suddenly, the judge's own son steps forward and says, "I will take his punishment. Let my innocence be credited to his account." The gavel falls—the prisoner is declared righteous, not because he earned it, but because another paid his debt. This is justification by faith.

## Deeper Truths

### Christ: The Lord Our Righteousness

Because Christ's righteousness becomes ours through faith, Scripture gives Him this glorious title:

> _"And this is His name whereby He shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness."_ (Jeremiah 23:6)

This righteousness is available to all who believe:

> _"Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference."_ (Romans 3:22)

Notice the two prepositions: righteousness is offered **unto all** (universal provision) and rests **upon all them that believe** (conditional reception). The gift is freely offered to all humanity, but it becomes effective only for those who receive it by faith.

[Q] **"If we are justified freely, doesn't that mean we can continue in sin?"**

Paul anticipated this very question. His answer is emphatic:

> _"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid."_ (Galatians 2:17)

Justification is not a license to sin but a deliverance from sin's dominion. The same grace that pardons also transforms. To claim Christ's righteousness while persisting in willful sin is to make Christ "the minister of sin"—an impossibility that Paul rejects with the strongest possible Greek expression: _me genoito_—"May it never be!"

### The Condition: Confession and Faith

How do we receive this justification?

> _"To declare, I say, at this time His righteousness: that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."_ (Romans 3:26)

> _"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."_ (1 John 1:9)

**Faith** (Greek: _pistis_): Not merely intellectual agreement, but complete trust and reliance upon Christ. Scripture defines it:

> _"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."_ (Hebrews 11:1)

Faith gives present reality ("substance") to future promises and provides inner conviction ("evidence") of spiritual realities beyond physical sight.

[DYK🔎] The word "substance" in Hebrews 11:1 is the Greek _hypostasis_, also translated "confidence" or "assurance." In ancient legal documents, this word was used for title deeds—proof of ownership. Faith is the title deed to heavenly promises, giving us present possession of future realities.

### Faith and Obedience: Inseparable Partners

Scripture never presents faith and obedience as competitors. True faith produces obedience; genuine obedience flows from faith:

> _"Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth... see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently."_ (1 Peter 1:22)

> _"And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."_ (Acts 15:9)

[Q] **"Doesn't justification by faith make God's law void?"**

Paul answers directly:

> _"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."_ (Romans 3:31)

Far from nullifying the law, faith establishes it on its proper foundation. The law reveals God's character and standard; faith connects us to the One who both fulfilled that standard perfectly and empowers us to walk in harmony with it. Justified believers don't keep the law to be saved—they keep it because they are saved, and the same Christ who pardoned them now lives within them.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Justification

The earthly sanctuary beautifully illustrated justification. When a repentant sinner brought a sacrifice to the altar in the outer court, confessing sins over the innocent victim, that animal died in the sinner's place. The sinner went home justified—not because of anything he had done, but because an innocent substitute bore his guilt.

This pointed forward to Christ's sacrifice on Calvary:

> _"Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past."_ (Romans 3:25)

**Propitiation**: A sacrifice that satisfies the demands of divine justice while demonstrating divine love. Christ's blood met both requirements perfectly—justice was upheld, and mercy was extended.

But justification involves more than the outer court. It connects us to Christ's ongoing ministry in the heavenly sanctuary, where His blood continues to cleanse and His intercession continually avails for those who come to God through Him (Hebrews 7:25).

### Righteousness Imputed and Imparted

God's plan includes both aspects of righteousness:

- **Imputed righteousness** (justification): Christ's perfect record credited to our account the moment we believe—a legal standing before God
- **Imparted righteousness** (sanctification): Christ's character progressively reproduced in our lives through the Holy Spirit—a moral transformation within

Both are received by faith. Both are gifts of grace. Neither can be earned. The first gives us a new standing; the second gives us a new nature. The first declares us righteous; the second makes us righteous. Together, they represent God's complete salvation—not merely forgiving sin but restoring the sinner to the image of God.

[ILL] Consider a filthy beggar adopted by a king. The moment of adoption gives him a new legal status—he is now a prince, heir to the kingdom. But the king doesn't leave him in rags. He clothes him in royal garments, educates him in royal ways, and transforms him into a true son in character as well as name. So God justifies us (new status) and sanctifies us (new character), and both are works of His grace received by faith.

## Practical Application

### Walking in Justification

Justified believers enjoy two precious gifts:

**Peace with God:**

> _"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (Romans 5:1)

**Fellowship with God and His people:**

> _"But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin."_ (1 John 1:7)

Notice that the blood "cleanseth" (present tense, continuous action) those who "walk" (present tense, continuous action) in the light. Justification is not merely a past event but a present reality maintained through ongoing faith and obedience.

This results in:

> _"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."_ (Philippians 4:7)

### The Just Shall Live by Faith

Scripture reveals a special characteristic of those awaiting Christ's return:

> _"For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him."_ (Hebrews 10:37, 38)

> _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:12)

The final generation—those who will see Jesus return—will be characterized by two inseparable qualities:

1. **Keeping the commandments of God** (obedience flowing from love)
2. **Having the faith of Jesus** (the same quality of trust Christ demonstrated)

This is not legalism wearing a faith disguise. It is genuine faith bearing its natural fruit. The commandments are kept not as a means of justification but as an evidence of it—not to earn salvation but because salvation has transformed the heart.

## Appeal

Dear friend, where do you stand today? Have you received this gift of justification by faith? Or are you still trying to establish your own righteousness?

> _"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?"_ (1 Corinthians 6:9)

The unrighteous cannot be saved—this is the sobering truth. But the glorious gospel declares that the unrighteous can be made righteous through faith in Christ! Right now, as you read these words, you may come to "The Lord Our Righteousness" and receive what you could never earn.

Confess your sins. He is faithful and just to forgive. Trust wholly in His merits. Let His righteousness—imputed and imparted—become yours. Then walk in the light, moment by moment, and experience the peace that passes all understanding.

The just shall live by faith. Will you live so today?

_"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (Romans 5:1)
