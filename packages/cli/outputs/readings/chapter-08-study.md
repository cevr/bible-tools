# Reading 8: Creation and Redemption

## Introduction

The opening verse of Scripture reveals a truth so profound that all Christian experience rests upon it: God is Creator. Yet this is far more than ancient history—it is the very foundation of our salvation. The same power that spoke worlds into existence is the power that transforms sinful hearts. Creation and redemption are not separate works of God; they are one continuous demonstration of divine love, both accomplished through Christ and memorialized in the Sabbath.

## Core Truths

### The Creator God Distinguished from All Others

_"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."_ (Genesis 1:1)

This majestic declaration establishes the most fundamental truth of Scripture: there is one God, and He is the source of all that exists. The Bible repeatedly draws a sharp contrast between the true God and every false deity based on this single criterion—creative power.

_"The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens."_ (Jeremiah 10:11)

**Creator**: One who brings into existence that which had no prior existence—not from pre-existing materials, but by the power of His word alone (Hebrews 11:3).

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "create" (_bara_) in Genesis 1:1 is used exclusively of God's activity in the Old Testament. Human beings can _make_ or _form_ things from existing materials, but only God can _bara_—call into existence out of nothing.

This truth mattered deeply to the apostles. When Paul stood before the philosophers of Athens, he began not with the cross, but with creation: _"God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands"_ (Acts 17:24). The Creator God cannot be confined to human systems or fashioned by human imagination.

### Christ: The Agent of Creation

_"All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made."_ (John 1:3)

Scripture reveals that the Father worked through the Son in bringing all things into existence. This is no secondary role—Christ is the active agent of creative power.

_"For by Him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by Him, and for Him: and He is before all things, and by Him all things consist."_ (Colossians 1:16-17)

Notice carefully: all things were created **by** Him, **for** Him, and are held together **in** Him. Christ is not merely the instrument of creation—He is its purpose and its sustaining power.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "by Him all things consist" (Colossians 1:17) uses the Greek word _synestēken_, meaning "to hold together" or "to cohere." Scientists today recognize that atoms should fly apart, yet some force holds matter together. Scripture reveals that force has a name: Jesus Christ.

## Deeper Truths

### Creation Power Is Redemption Power

Here we discover one of Scripture's most encouraging truths: **the same power that created the universe is the power that saves sinners**.

_"But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and He that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine."_ (Isaiah 43:1)

God identifies Himself to His people simultaneously as Creator and Redeemer. These are not separate offices—they are expressions of the same divine character and the same divine power.

David understood this connection when, broken by sin, he cried out:

_"Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me."_ (Psalm 51:10)

**Clean heart**: Not merely an improved heart or a reformed heart, but a _created_ heart—something brought into existence where only corruption existed before.

David did not ask God to _repair_ his heart. He knew that sin had so corrupted his nature that only an act of creation could restore him. He used the same word (_bara_) that describes God's original creative work in Genesis.

[Q] **"Isn't sanctification simply a gradual improvement of our natural character?"**

Scripture presents a more radical reality. Paul declares: _"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works"_ (Ephesians 2:10). The Greek word for "workmanship" (_poiēma_) gives us our English word "poem"—we are God's masterpiece, His creative work. Sanctification is not human improvement but divine re-creation. We do not polish the old nature; God creates something entirely new (2 Corinthians 5:17).

### Christ: Creator, Redeemer, and Head of the Church

Colossians 1 presents the most comprehensive statement of Christ's role in both creation and redemption:

_"And He is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the preeminence."_ (Colossians 1:18)

The One who created all things is the same One who leads the church. The One who sustains the universe is the same One who sustains every struggling believer. There is no separation between cosmic power and personal salvation.

[ILL] Consider a master artist who creates a magnificent painting. Years later, vandals damage the work—slashing the canvas, smearing the colors. Who is best qualified to restore it? Only the original artist truly knows what the painting was meant to be. Only his hand can bring it back to the original vision.

So it is with humanity. Sin has marred and defaced God's image in us. But the same Christ who created us in the beginning knows exactly what we were designed to be. He alone can restore the original masterpiece.

### The Keeping Power of the Creator

Scripture draws a remarkable parallel between God's sustaining power in nature and His keeping power in the believer's life.

_"Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth."_ (Isaiah 40:26)

**Not one faileth**: Among the countless billions of stars, not a single one strays from its course or fails to appear at the appointed time. God's power holds each one in its place.

If this is true of stars, what does it mean for you?

_"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy."_ (Jude 24)

The same power that keeps galaxies in orbit is available to keep you from falling into sin. The same voice that called light out of darkness can speak peace into your troubled heart. The same hand that shaped the mountains can mold your character into the image of Christ.

[DYK🔎] Astronomers estimate there are more than 200 billion trillion stars in the observable universe—and Isaiah says God "calleth them all by names." If He knows each star by name, how much more does He know you? (Matthew 10:30)

### The Exceeding Greatness of His Power

Paul prays that believers might understand the resources available to them:

_"That ye may know... what is the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead."_ (Ephesians 1:18-20)

**Exceeding greatness**: Paul piles up terms for power in this passage—_dynamis_ (inherent power), _energeia_ (effective working), _kratos_ (manifested strength), _ischus_ (might). He is straining language itself to convey the unlimited resources available to every believer.

This power is measured by the resurrection of Christ. The same energy that broke the bands of death and raised Jesus from the tomb is the power working in you to overcome sin. You are not left to struggle against temptation in your own strength. Creation power—resurrection power—is available to transform your life.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sabbath: Memorial of Creation, Sign of Redemption

The Sabbath stands as the perpetual link between creation and redemption:

_"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy... for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day."_ (Exodus 20:8, 11)

_"Moreover also I gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."_ (Ezekiel 20:12)

**Sanctify**: To make holy, to set apart from common use—the same creative power that made the world in six days is the power that makes sinners holy.

The Sabbath thus carries a double significance:

1. **Memorial of Creation**: We rest because God rested after creating
2. **Sign of Sanctification**: We rest because God is working in us what we cannot work in ourselves

When we keep Sabbath, we acknowledge both truths: God is our Creator, and God is our Redeemer. We cease from our own works and rest in His finished work—whether the finished work of creation or the finished work of salvation (Hebrews 4:9-10).

[Q] **"Why does it matter whether God created by speaking or through natural processes over millions of years?"**

The connection between creation and redemption answers this profoundly. If creation required millions of years of gradual development, then redemption must also be a gradual process of evolutionary improvement. But Scripture presents both as acts of divine power through the Word.

_"For He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast."_ (Psalm 33:9)

Just as God spoke worlds into existence instantaneously, so He speaks righteousness into the believing heart. The thief on the cross was not told to gradually improve over millions of years—he was promised Paradise that very day. The same Word that created light can create a clean heart in a moment.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ continues His creative-redemptive work. As our High Priest, He applies to believers the benefits of His sacrifice:

- **The Outer Court** (the cross): Christ's death provides the foundation for our new creation—without the shedding of blood, there is no remission (Hebrews 9:22)
- **The Holy Place** (daily ministry): Christ's ongoing intercession sustains our spiritual life, just as His power sustains the universe moment by moment
- **The Most Holy Place** (final atonement): Christ's work of blotting out sin completes the re-creation, preparing a people to stand faultless before God's glory

The sanctuary reveals that redemption is not merely forgiveness—it is restoration. God is not satisfied to merely pardon sinners; He re-creates them in the image of His Son.

### Why God Alone Is Worthy of Worship

_"Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for Thou hast created all things."_ (Revelation 4:11)

In the great controversy between good and evil, the question of worship is central. Satan desires the worship that belongs to God alone. The first angel's message calls humanity back to worship the Creator:

_"Fear God, and give glory to Him... and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."_ (Revelation 14:7)

This message uses creation language directly from the fourth commandment. In the final conflict, the Sabbath—memorial of creation—becomes the test of loyalty. Those who acknowledge God as Creator and Redeemer will honor His memorial; those who follow human traditions will worship the creature rather than the Creator (Romans 1:25).

## Practical Application

### Living by Creation Power

Understanding the connection between creation and redemption transforms how we approach the Christian life:

**1. Stop trying to create yourself.**
You cannot reform your own heart any more than you can create a star. Cease struggling in your own strength and surrender to the Creator's transforming power.

_"It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure."_ (Philippians 2:13)

**2. Trust the Word that speaks things into existence.**
The same Word that said "Let there be light" can speak victory into your life. When you read Scripture and claim its promises by faith, you are connecting with creative power.

**3. Rest in the finished work.**
As the Sabbath commemorates God's completed creation, so we rest in Christ's completed salvation. We do not work _for_ righteousness; we work _from_ righteousness already received.

**4. Expect transformation, not mere improvement.**
God does not tinker with the old nature—He creates new creatures. Whatever habit binds you, whatever sin besets you, the Creator can make all things new.

[ILL] A caterpillar does not become a butterfly by trying harder to fly. It must undergo metamorphosis—a complete transformation from within. So the believer is not improved by effort but transformed by the indwelling life of Christ. We cooperate with this process by surrendering, not by striving.

## Appeal

_"Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."_ (Jude 24-25)

The God who created the heavens is able to create in you a clean heart. The Christ who sustains the universe is able to keep you from falling. The same power that raised Jesus from the dead is available to raise you from spiritual death into newness of life.

Will you trust Him today? Not merely to forgive your sins, but to re-create you? Not merely to pardon the past, but to transform the present and secure the future?

The Creator Himself offers to be your Redeemer. The One who spoke worlds into existence speaks to you now: "Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine."

Come to Him. Rest in His finished work. Let His creative power do in you what you could never do for yourself. He who began a good work in you will complete it (Philippians 1:6)—for He is the Creator, and He finishes what He starts.
