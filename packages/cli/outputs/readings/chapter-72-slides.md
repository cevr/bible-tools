## Slide 1 – Introduction: The Question of Moral Law Before Sinai

- Did God hold men accountable to His moral law before the Ten Commandments were given at Sinai?
- Some suppose the law began with Moses, and the patriarchs lived without divine commandments.
- This study demonstrates from Scripture that God's moral law has always existed.
- Sin has always been the transgression of that law.
- Men in every age have been called to obedience through faith in the coming Redeemer.

---

## Slide 2 – Sin from the Beginning

- Theme: The existence of sin from the very beginning proves the law existed from the beginning.
- Key Text: 1 John 3:8 – "He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning."
- Sin did not originate with humanity, nor at Sinai, but with Satan himself.
- The very existence of sin presupposes a standard against which it is measured.

---

## Slide 3 – Sin Defined

- Key Text: 1 John 3:4 – "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."
- Sin is not merely failing to reach an ideal—it is rebellion against God's expressed will.
- Wherever sin exists, law must also exist.
- Key Text: Romans 4:15 – "Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression."

---

## Slide 4 – The Law Preceded Sinai

- Sin existed before Sinai (Genesis 4:7; 6:5; 13:13).
- Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4).
- Therefore, law existed before Sinai.
- If there was transgression from Adam to Moses, the law was in force throughout that period.
- The angels who rebelled with Satan were judged by God's law in heaven itself (2 Peter 2:4).

---

## Slide 5 – Cain and Abel: Murder and the Sixth Commandment

- Theme: God held Cain accountable for murder—centuries before Sinai.
- Key Text: Genesis 4:8 – "And Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
- Key Text: Genesis 4:10–11 – "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground... now art thou cursed from the earth."
- What law did Cain violate? "Thou shalt not kill" (Exodus 20:13).
- The commandment was known and binding, written on the conscience by the Creator.

---

## Slide 6 – The Root of Cain's Sin

- Key Text: 1 John 3:12 – "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."
- The difference between Cain and Abel was moral—one had a righteous character, the other did not.
- This distinction implies a standard of righteousness: God's law.
- Key Text: Genesis 4:7 – "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door."
- "Doing well" and "not doing well" are moral categories requiring a moral standard.

---

## Slide 7 – The Antediluvian World: Violence and the Law

- Theme: The flood was God's judgment upon sin—and judgment presupposes law.
- Key Text: Genesis 6:11 – "The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."
- Key Text: Genesis 6:13 – "The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."
- Violence violates the sixth commandment.
- Corruption before God implies idolatry and impurity—violations of the first, second, and seventh commandments.

---

## Slide 8 – Noah: A Preacher of Righteousness

- Key Text: Genesis 6:8 – "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord."
- Key Text: 2 Peter 2:5 – "And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness."
- What righteousness did Noah preach? The righteousness of God, always in harmony with His law.
- Key Text: Psalm 119:172 – "My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness."
- Righteousness is conformity to the will of God as expressed in His law.

---

## Slide 9 – Sodom: Unlawful Deeds

- Theme: The men of Sodom were judged for breaking God's law—centuries before Sinai.
- Key Text: Genesis 13:13 – "But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly."
- Key Text: 2 Peter 2:8 – "That righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds."
- Mark the word: unlawful. Their deeds were contrary to law—God's law.
- The seventh commandment and principles underlying it were binding and violated.

---

## Slide 10 – Joseph: Sin Against God

- Theme: Joseph recognized adultery as sin against God—before Sinai.
- Key Text: Genesis 39:9 – "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"
- Joseph knew God's law, though Moses had not yet received it on tables of stone.
- The law was written in his heart by faith.
- Adultery was not merely a social offense, but a violation of God's commandment.

---

## Slide 11 – The Amorites and the Nations of Canaan

- Theme: God judged heathen nations for breaking His law—proving His law was binding on all.
- Key Text: Genesis 15:16 – "In the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full."
- Key Text: 1 Kings 21:26 – "He did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites."
- Key Text: Leviticus 20:23 – "Ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them."

---

## Slide 12 – Just Judgment Requires Just Law

- If there was no law binding the nations, there could be no just ground for judgment.
- But God's judgments are always righteous.
- Key Text: Genesis 18:25 – "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
- Key Text: Psalm 19:9 – "The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."
- Idolatry and immorality were violations of commandments already in force.

---

## Slide 13 – The Law of God Is Eternal

- Theme: God's moral law is as eternal as God Himself.
- It is the transcript of His character, the expression of His will.
- It is the standard of righteousness for all intelligent beings—angelic and human—in all ages.
- Satan and his angels were judged by it in heaven (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6).
- Adam and Eve were judged by it in Eden (Genesis 3).
- The antediluvians, Sodomites, and Canaanites were all judged by it before Sinai.

---

## Slide 14 – The Ten Commandments at Sinai

- The Ten Commandments were not the creation of a new moral code.
- They were the formal, written proclamation of principles always in force.
- God wrote on stone what had long been written in the conscience of mankind.
- Key Text: Romans 2:14–15 – "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts."

---

## Slide 15 – Abraham: Obedience by Faith

- Theme: Abraham's faith produced obedience to God's commandments.
- Key Text: Genesis 26:5 – "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
- Abraham was not justified by his obedience; he was justified by faith.
- Key Text: Genesis 15:6 – "And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness."
- But his faith produced obedience—faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).

---

## Slide 16 – Righteousness by Faith Explained

- Justification (imputed righteousness): God counts the believing sinner as righteous because of Christ's merits.
- Key Text: Romans 4:5 – "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
- Sanctification (imparted righteousness): God works in the believer to produce actual conformity to His law.
- Key Text: Philippians 2:13 – "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."
- Abraham's life demonstrates that faith and obedience are inseparable.

---

## Slide 17 – Faith and Works United

- Key Text: James 2:26 – "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
- True faith in Christ always results in keeping God's commandments from the heart.
- Abraham kept God's commandments—not to earn favor, but because faith works by love.
- This is the very heart of righteousness by faith.

---

## Slide 18 – Who Are Abraham's Children?

- Theme: Abraham's true seed are those who walk in the footsteps of his faith.
- Key Text: John 8:39 – "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham."
- Key Text: Galatians 3:29 – "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
- The children of Abraham are not those with physical descent, but those with his faith.
- A faith that receives Christ's righteousness and produces loving obedience.

---

## Slide 19 – The Sanctuary in the Patriarchal Age

- Theme: From Eden onward, the way of approach to God was through sacrifice.
- From the gates of Eden, where God placed cherubim and a flaming sword (Genesis 3:24), to the altars of Abel, Noah, and Abraham—sacrifice pointed forward to the Lamb of God.
- Key Text: Hebrews 9:22 – "Without shedding of blood is no remission."
- The patriarchs looked forward in faith to the cross, where Christ would bear the penalty of the broken law.
- Key Text: 1 Peter 1:18–20 – "Ye were... redeemed... with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world."

---

## Slide 20 – Law and Grace United

- The law was never opposed to grace.
- The law revealed sin (Romans 3:20) and pointed men to the Redeemer.
- The sacrificial system taught that God would provide a substitute and a way of reconciliation.
- Atonement: The work by which God and man are reconciled, and sin is removed.
- Key Text: Leviticus 17:11 – "For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls."

---

## Slide 21 – Application: The Law Stands Over Us Today

- If God held the patriarchs accountable to His law, how much more are we accountable who have the full revelation of Jesus Christ?
- Key Text: Romans 2:13 – "For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
- This does not mean we are saved by works—but genuine faith produces a life that honors the law.
- Key Text: Psalm 119:97 – "O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day."

---

## Slide 22 – Application: The Possibility of Victory

- What was true for Abraham, Joseph, and Noah is true for us.
- Through faith in Christ, we may keep God's commandments—not in our own strength, but by Christ's indwelling life.
- Key Text: Galatians 2:20 – "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."
- Key Text: 1 John 5:4 – "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."

---

## Slide 23 – The Last-Day People of God

- Key Text: Revelation 14:12 – "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
- The last-day people of God will demonstrate that the law can be kept—not by human effort, but by Christ's power within.
- Faith and commandment-keeping are united in the final generation.

---

## Slide 24 – Illustration: Ignorance Is No Excuse

- A man stood before a judge, accused of stealing.
- His defense: "I did not know the law against theft was in force in this county. No one showed me the statute book."
- The judge replied: "Ignorance of the law is no excuse. The law is the law, whether you read the statute or not."
- "And in truth, you did know it was wrong—for your conscience condemned you even as you did it."
- So it was in the patriarchal age: the written tables had not yet been given, but the law was written in the conscience.

---

## Slide 25 – Appeal: What Will You Do with God's Law?

- The question is not whether the law existed before Sinai—Scripture is clear that it did.
- The question is: What will you do with the law of God today?
- Will you, like Cain, resist the Spirit's conviction and let sin master you?
- Or will you, like Abel, come to God by faith, offering the blood of the Lamb, and by grace walk in righteousness?

---

## Slide 26 – Appeal: Choose the Way of Life

- Will you, like the men of Sodom, continue in unlawful deeds until judgment falls?
- Or will you, like righteous Lot, be vexed with sin and cry out for deliverance?
- Will you, like the Amorites, fill up the cup of iniquity?
- Or will you, like Abraham, obey God's voice and keep His commandments—not to earn salvation, but because you love the God who saved you?

---

## Slide 27 – Closing Appeal: Heirs According to the Promise

- Key Text: Galatians 3:29 – "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
- Come to Christ. Receive His righteousness—both imputed and imparted.
- Let His law be written in your heart.
- By faith, walk in the footsteps of faithful Abraham.
- Key Text: Hebrews 11:10 – "For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God."
