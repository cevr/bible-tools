## Slide 1 – Q1: The Reign of Sin

- **Question:** How long has sin reigned?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:8 – “He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the
  Devil sinneth from the beginning.”

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Antiquity of Law

- **The Origin of Evil:**
  - Sin did not begin on earth, but with “the Devil” who sinned “from the
    beginning.”
- **Law in Heaven:**
  - Since sin is defined as the transgression of the law, God’s moral government
    must have existed before Satan fell.
  - **1 John 3:4** – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for
    sin is the transgression of the law.”
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - You cannot have a rebellion without a ruler, nor a transgression without a
    law.
  - The conflict began in heaven over God’s character and the justice of His
    law, then transferred to earth.

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Mutiny:**
  - Imagine a mutiny on a ship at sea.
  - The mutiny begins the moment the crew decides to reject the captain’s orders
    in their hearts, even before they physically throw the captain overboard.
- **The Application:**
  - Similarly, sin began in the heart of Lucifer when he rejected God’s law of
    love.
  - This occurred long before he tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

---

## Slide 4 – Q2: Angels and Rebellion

- **Question:** What others sinned with Satan?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 2:4 – “For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but
  cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be
  reserved unto judgment.”

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Law and Judgment

- **Angels Subject to Law:**
  - If angels can sin, they must be subject to a moral standard.
  - No created being is independent of the Creator’s will.
- **Sanctuary Connection – Judgment:**
  - The phrase “reserved unto judgment” points to the sanctuary message.
  - God has an appointed time to examine the lives of His creatures.
- **Certainty of Consequences:**
  - **Revelation 12:4** – “And his tail drew the third part of the stars of
    heaven, and did cast them to the earth...”
  - If God did not spare angels in His presence, He will not overlook willful
    sin in humanity.

---

## Slide 6 – Q3: Law and Transgression

- **Question:** Can there be sin where there is no law?
- **Key Text:** Romans 4:15 – “Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law
  is, there is no transgression.”

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Law in the Patriarchal Age

- **A Logical Impossibility:**
  - Paul establishes that one cannot be guilty of a crime if there is no law
    defining it.
- **Proof of the Law:**
  - Adam, Cain, and the people of Sodom were guilty of sin; therefore, the moral
    law existed long before Sinai.
- **The Mirror Function:**
  - The law reveals dirt (sin) like a mirror, but cannot wash it away.
  - **James 1:23** – “For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is
    like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass.”
- **Need for a Savior:**
  - Since the law existed and man broke it, the plan of salvation was needed
    immediately upon the fall of Adam.

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Speed Limit:**
  - If a driver speeds down a road with no posted limit and no traffic laws, a
    police officer cannot issue a valid ticket.
  - There is no transgression because there is no law.
- **The Valid Ticket:**
  - If the officer issues a valid ticket, it proves the law existed before the
    driver arrived.
  - Since God charged men with sin from Adam to Moses, the Law must have been
    active.

---

## Slide 9 – Q4: The First Death

- **Question:** How was the first death brought about?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 4:8 – “And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it
  came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his
  brother, and slew him.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Anger and Atonement

- **Violation of Law:**
  - The first death was murder, violating the principle of the Sixth
    Commandment.
  - **Exodus 20:13** – “Thou shalt not kill.”
- **Heart Murder:**
  - **Matthew 5:21–22** – “...whosoever is angry with his brother without a
    cause shall be in danger of the judgment...”
- **Rejection of the Atonement:**
  - Cain rejected the lamb (typifying Christ’s blood) and brought the fruit of
    his own works.
  - Persecution arises when those trusting in self-righteousness confront those
    resting in Christ’s righteousness.

---

## Slide 11 – Q5: Two Characters

- **Question:** What was the difference between the characters of the two men?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:12 – “Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew
  his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and
  his brother's righteous.”

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: Faith vs. Works

- **The Heart Condition:**
  - The difference was in the state of their hearts.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - **Hebrews 11:4** – “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent
    sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous...”
  - Abel was “righteous” because he looked by faith to the Lamb of God.
- **Two Classes:**
  - The Great Controversy divides humanity into two groups:
    1. Those who rely on Christ’s blood and obey God (Abel).
    2. Those who rely on self and rebel against God’s law (Cain).

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Defining Righteousness

- **What is Righteousness?**
  - It is doing what is right in God’s eyes.
- **Justification:**
  - Christ’s perfect life credited to the believer’s account.
- **Sanctification:**
  - Christ’s life lived out through the believer by the power of the Holy
    Spirit.
- **Key Insight:**
  - Abel’s obedience was the fruit of a heart reconciled to God.

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: Imputing Sin

- **Question:** Did the Lord impute sin to Cain for taking the life of his
  brother?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 4:7 – “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?
  and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door...”
- **Key Text:** Genesis 4:10 – “And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of
  thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Accountability and Imputation

- **Moral Accountability:**
  - God expected Cain to “do well,” implying Cain knew the standard of right and
    wrong.
- **The Beast at the Door:**
  - Sin is depicted as a beast waiting to devour; victory requires surrender to
    God.
- **Imputation defined:**
  - To “impute” is to charge to one’s account. God imputed guilt to Cain.
  - In the Gospel, God imputes righteousness to the believer.
  - **Romans 4:22** – “And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.”

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: Pre-Flood Condition

- **Question:** In what condition was mankind before the flood?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:11 – “The earth also was corrupt before God; and the
  earth was filled with violence.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Corruption and Depravity

- **Total Depravity:**
  - **Genesis 6:5** – “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the
    earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
    continually.”
- **Violence:**
  - When duty to God (Commandments 1–4) is broken, duty to man (Commandments
    5–10) collapses.
  - “Violence” is the violation of the rights of others.
- **Need for Sanctification:**
  - Humanity desperately needed a new heart, which the Spirit strove to give
    them, but they resisted.

---

## Slide 18 – Q8: God’s Purpose

- **Question:** What did God purpose to do with the people of that day?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:13 – “And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is
  come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,
  behold, I will destroy them with the earth.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Judgment and Cleansing

- **Limit of Divine Patience:**
  - **2 Peter 3:9** – “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise... but is
    longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all
    should come to repentance.”
  - Probation closes when men become settled in rebellion.
- **Sanctuary Type:**
  - The Flood was a type of the final destruction of sin.
  - Just as the sanctuary must be cleansed of recorded sins, the earth had to be
    cleansed of violent rebels.
- **Vindication:**
  - The destruction proved that God’s law cannot be trampled with impunity
    forever.

---

## Slide 20 – Q9: The Preacher

- **Question:** What was Noah called?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 2:5 – “And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the
  eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the
  world of the ungodly.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: Righteousness and Grace

- **Noah’s Message:**
  - Noah preached righteousness, which is obedience to God’s law.
  - **Psalm 119:172** – “...for all thy commandments are righteousness.”
- **Salvation by Grace:**
  - Noah “found grace in the eyes of the Lord” (Genesis 6:8).
  - He did not earn salvation by boat-building; he built the boat because he
    believed God.
- **Faith Works:**
  - **Hebrews 11:7** – “By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as
    yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house...”

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Lighthouse Keeper:**
  - Noah was like a lighthouse keeper in a storm.
  - He did not just shine the light (preach); he stood on the solid rock (faith
    in God).
  - The waves of popular opinion and mockery crashed around him, but he remained
    unmoved.
  - **Lesson:** It is possible to walk with God even in a wicked generation.

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: Sodom’s Destruction

- **Question:** Why did the Lord destroy Sodom?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 13:13 – “But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners
  before the Lord exceedingly.”
- **Key Text:** Genesis 19:13 – “For we will destroy this place, because the cry
  of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us
  to destroy it.”

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: The Nature of Sin

- **Specific Sins:**
  - They violated laws of purity and love.
  - **Jude 1:7** – “...giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
    strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of
    eternal fire.”
  - **Ezekiel 16:49** – “Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom,
    pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her
    daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.”
- **Sin is Personal:**
  - They were sinners “before the Lord.” All sin is an offense against the
    Creator’s character.

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: The Standard of Judgment

- **Question:** By what standard were their deeds weighed?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 2:7, 8 – “And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy
  conversation of the wicked: (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in
  seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their
  unlawful deeds;)”

---

## Slide 26 – Q11: Law and Imputation

- **“Unlawful Deeds”:**
  - Peter explicitly calls their actions “unlawful.”
  - This proves the Law existed in Lot’s day; you cannot have unlawful deeds
    without a law.
- **Imputed Righteousness:**
  - Despite Lot’s flaws, the Bible calls him “just” and “righteous.”
  - Lot was justified by faith; his heart was aligned with God, and he was
    distressed by the rebellion around him.

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Joseph’s Temptation

- **Question:** What did Joseph say when he was tempted on a certain point?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 39:9 – “...how then can I do this great wickedness, and
  sin against God?”

---

## Slide 28 – Q12: Victory Over Sin

- **Recognition of Law:**
  - Centuries before Sinai, Joseph knew that adultery was “great wickedness”
    (The 7th Commandment).
- **Sin Against God:**
  - Joseph understood that all sin is treason against God.
- **Application – Victory:**
  - Joseph illustrates the power of Righteousness by Faith.
  - He did not debate the temptation; he fled.
  - **Revelation 14:12** – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they
    that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Probation of Nations

- **Question:** What did God tell Abraham concerning the Amorites?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 15:16 – “But in the fourth generation they shall come
  hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.”

---

## Slide 30 – Q13: Full Cup of Iniquity

- **Probationary Time:**
  - God gave the Amorites over 400 years to turn from wickedness, showing His
    mercy.
- **The Limit:**
  - A nation’s “cup” is full when it completely rejects the light of conscience
    and truth.
- **National Judgment:**
  - Just as God judged the world by the Flood, He judges nations when they
    violate moral law.

---

## Slide 31 – Q14: Idolatry

- **Question:** Of what sin were they specially guilty?
- **Key Text:** 1 Kings 21:26 – “And he did very abominably in following idols,
  according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the
  children of Israel.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q14: Violation of the First Table

- **Abominations:**
  - The Amorites violated the first and second commandments (idolatry).
  - This involved horrific rites, including child sacrifice.
  - **Deuteronomy 12:31** – “...for every abomination to the Lord, which he
    hateth, have they done unto their gods...”
- **Universal Law:**
  - God cast out Gentiles for breaking these laws, proving the command to
    worship the true God applies to all humanity, not just Israel.

---

## Slide 33 – Q15: The Land Vomits Sin

- **Question:** Why did the Lord abhor the nations that occupied Canaan before
  Israel?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 20:23 – “And ye shall not walk in the manners of the
  nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and
  therefore I abhorred them.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q15: Moral Standards

- **Sin is Unnatural:**
  - **Leviticus 20:22** – “Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes... that the
    land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.”
  - Sin is a toxic substance that creation itself rejects.
  - **Romans 8:22** – “For we know that the whole creation groaneth and
    travaileth in pain together until now.”
- **No Double Standard:**
  - God has one moral standard for all mankind. If Israel committed the same
    sins, the land would vomit them out too.

---

## Slide 35 – Q16: Abraham’s Obedience

- **Question:** Why did God make His promise to the seed of Abraham?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 26:5 – “Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept
  my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”

---

## Slide 36 – Q16: Law and Covenant

- **Obedience Before Sinai:**
  - Hundreds of years before Moses, Abraham knew and kept God’s “commandments,
    statutes, and laws.”
- **Faith Establishes Law:**
  - Abraham is the father of the faithful.
  - **Romans 3:31** – “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid:
    yea, we establish the law.”
- **Sanctification Defined:**
  - The covenant of grace writes the law in the heart.
  - **Hebrews 8:10** – “...I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in
    their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a
    people.”

---

## Slide 37 – Q17: Works of Abraham

- **Question:** What will the children of Abraham do?
- **Key Text:** John 8:39 – “They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our
  father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the
  works of Abraham.”

---

## Slide 38 – Q17: True vs. Counterfeit

- **Spiritual Lineage:**
  - Lineage is demonstrated by character, not DNA.
  - Abraham obeyed God; the Pharisees sought to kill Jesus.
- **Children of the Devil:**
  - **John 8:44** – “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your
    father ye will do.”
- **Living Faith:**
  - We cannot claim to be saved by faith if we live in willful disobedience.
  - **James 2:17** – “Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being
    alone.”

---

## Slide 39 – Q18: Heirs of Promise

- **Question:** Who are the children of Abraham?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:29 – “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's
  seed, and heirs according to the promise.”

---

## Slide 40 – Q18: Conclusion

- **Union with Christ:**
  - We become children of Abraham by belonging to Christ.
  - His history becomes our history; His righteousness becomes our robe.
- **The Result:**
  - Being “Christ’s” gives us the title to heaven (Justification).
  - Living with Him imparts His character of obedience (Sanctification).
  - We obey God’s commandments not to _be_ saved, but because we _are_ saved.

---

## Slide 41 – Q18: Illustration

- **The Adopted Child:**
  - An adopted child takes on the legal name and inheritance of the father.
  - But more than that, a loving child grows to resemble the father the longer
    they live together.
  - We are heirs of the promise, growing into the likeness of Christ.
