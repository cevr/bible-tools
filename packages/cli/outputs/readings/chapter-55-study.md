# Bible Study: The Seven Seals

## Introduction

The seven seals of Revelation chapter 6 present a sweeping panorama of church history from apostolic times to the second coming of Christ. Unlike the seven trumpets, which symbolize wars and political upheavals, the seals reveal events of a religious nature—the spiritual condition of God's professed people through the ages. Understanding these symbols helps us recognize where we stand in earth's final hours and prepares us for the soon return of our Lord.

## Core Truths

### The Significance of Seven

The number seven in Scripture denotes completion or perfection. Thus, the seven seals embrace the _whole_ of religious history from Christ's ascension to the close of probation. This is God's complete revelation of the church's journey through time.

> _"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals..."_ (Revelation 6:1)

Notice who opens the seals—the **Lamb**. Only Christ, who was slain for our redemption, has the authority to unveil the mysteries of human history. This reminds us that all of history is under His sovereign control, even when events seem chaotic or evil appears to triumph.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "seal" (_sphragis_) was used for the wax impression that secured official documents. Only the authorized person could break the seal and reveal the contents. Christ alone is worthy to open these seals because He alone conquered sin and death (Revelation 5:5-9).

### The Four Horses: A Progressive Decline

The first four seals present horses of different colors, representing the changing spiritual condition of the church:

**First Seal: The White Horse (Apostolic Age)**

> _"A white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."_ (Revelation 6:2)

White symbolizes **purity**. This is the church in its apostolic glory—pure in doctrine, fervent in love, mighty in evangelism. The gospel went forth conquering hearts throughout the Roman world. Within one generation, Paul could write that the gospel had been "preached to every creature which is under heaven" (Colossians 1:23).

**Second Seal: The Red Horse (Era of Corruption)**

> _"There went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth."_ (Revelation 6:4)

Red symbolizes **bloodshed and compromise**. The church began seeking alliance with secular power. Worldliness crept in. The purity of the white horse gave way to internal strife and persecution. This period extends to the time of Constantine, when a complete union of church and state was effected.

[Q] **"Wasn't Constantine's conversion good for Christianity?"**

On the surface, Constantine's Edict of Milan (AD 313) ended official persecution. However, this union of church and state proved spiritually disastrous. When the church married the world, she lost her prophetic voice. Pagans flooded into the church without genuine conversion, bringing their customs and philosophies. The church traded spiritual power for political influence—a bargain that always impoverishes God's people.

**Third Seal: The Black Horse (Era of Spiritual Darkness)**

> _"A black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand."_ (Revelation 6:5)

Black symbolizes **spiritual darkness**. From Constantine to the establishment of papal supremacy in AD 538, gross errors multiplied: veneration of saints, prayers to the dead, belief in purgatory, and the elevation of tradition above Scripture. The balances suggest that spiritual truth was being "weighed out" sparingly—rationed to the people by a clergy that claimed exclusive authority to interpret God's Word.

**Fourth Seal: The Pale Horse (Era of Persecution)**

> _"Behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him."_ (Revelation 6:7-8)

The word "pale" translates the Greek _chloros_—the sickly, yellowish-green color of decaying plants. This represents the spiritual death and physical persecution inflicted by the apostate church from AD 538 onward. Conservative estimates suggest that between 50 and 100 million people perished for their faith during the Dark Ages.

[ILL] Consider a garden left untended. First, weeds appear among the flowers (compromise). Then the weeds multiply and choke out the light (darkness). Finally, the plants wither and die (death). So it was with the professed church of Christ. What began as slight departures from apostolic purity resulted in centuries of spiritual death.

## Deeper Truths

### The Fifth Seal: The Martyrs Remembered

> _"I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held."_ (Revelation 6:9)

The fifth seal marks a turning point. The Protestant Reformation exposed the true character of papal Rome, and suddenly the martyrs of previous centuries were seen in a new light. Those who had died as "heretics" were now recognized as faithful witnesses for truth.

[Q] **"Doesn't this verse prove that the souls of the dead are conscious in heaven?"**

The Bible consistently teaches that the dead "sleep" until the resurrection (Ecclesiastes 9:5-6; Psalm 146:4; John 11:11-14). Here, as in other passages, **personification** is used—things that are not are represented as though they were (Romans 4:17). Compare Genesis 4:10, where Abel's blood "cries" from the ground. The blood was not literally speaking; rather, it cried out figuratively for justice. Similarly, these martyrs symbolically cry for vindication.

The "white robes" given to them represent the **righteousness** now ascribed to them. During the Reformation, the world finally saw that these martyrs were not heretics but heroes of faith.

> _"It was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled."_ (Revelation 6:11)

Notice: they are told to **rest**—not rejoice in heaven's glory, but rest in their graves until the resurrection. More martyrs would yet fall before the end, and then all would be raised together to immortal glory.

### The Sixth Seal: Signs in Heaven and Earth

The sixth seal brings us to our own time with unmistakable signs:

**The Great Earthquake (November 1, 1755)**

> _"Lo, there was a great earthquake."_ (Revelation 6:12)

The Lisbon earthquake struck on All Saints' Day when churches were packed with worshippers. Within minutes, 90,000 people perished. The earthquake affected four million square miles—the most extensive in recorded history at that time.

[DYK🔎] The Lisbon earthquake generated a tsunami that reached the Caribbean, crossing the Atlantic Ocean. It was felt as far away as Finland and North Africa. Scientists today estimate its magnitude at 8.5-9.0 on the Richter scale.

**The Dark Day (May 19, 1780)**

> _"The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood."_ (Revelation 6:12)

Eyewitnesses across New England described an unnatural darkness that could not be explained by eclipse, smoke, or clouds. Animals behaved as if night had come. Many believed the Day of Judgment had arrived. That night, the moon appeared blood-red—exactly as prophesied.

Timothy Dwight, president of Yale College, recorded: "The darkness was such as to occasion farmers to leave their work in the field, and retire to their dwellings... Lights became necessary to the transaction of business within doors."

**The Falling Stars (November 13, 1833)**

> _"The stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."_ (Revelation 6:13)

The great meteoric shower of 1833 was observed throughout North America. Estimates suggest 200,000 meteors fell per hour at the peak. Remarkably, observers noted that the meteors radiated outward from a single point in the constellation Leo—"as from one tree"—precisely matching John's description.

[DYK🔎] A writer for the _Journal of Commerce_ observed: "Were I to hunt through nature for a simile, I could not find one so apt to illustrate the appearance of the heavens, as that which St. John uses in the prophecy." The falling stars did not descend gently like ripe fruit, but were "cast" like unripe figs torn violently from the branch.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

The seals reveal the unfolding of the great controversy between Christ and Satan as played out in church history. Just as the sanctuary services revealed God's plan of redemption, the seals reveal how that plan has been attacked and defended through the ages:

- The **white horse** represents the pure gospel going forth from the cross—the message of the outer court sacrifice proclaimed to the world
- The **corruption** of subsequent seals shows Satan's attempt to counterfeit and obscure the true sanctuary ministry
- The **martyrs under the altar** remind us that faithful witness often costs everything—the "altar" imagery connects to sacrifice
- The **signs in heaven** announce that Christ's ministry in the Most Holy Place (the investigative judgment, beginning in 1844) was imminent

### Where We Stand

> _"The heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places."_ (Revelation 6:14)

The signs in the sun, moon, and stars are now history. We stand between the last of the heavenly signs and the actual rolling back of the heavens at Christ's return. The next event in prophetic sequence is the glorious appearing of our Lord!

The sealing work of Revelation 7 (which occurs under the sixth seal) is now in progress. God is preparing a people who will stand in that great day—not in their own righteousness, but clothed in the white robes of Christ's righteousness.

### The Seventh Seal: Solemn Silence

> _"When He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."_ (Revelation 8:1)

When Christ returns, "all the holy angels" accompany Him (Matthew 25:31). If all heaven's inhabitants descend with Christ, silence naturally follows. Using prophetic time calculation (a day for a year, an hour being 1/24 of a prophetic day), half an hour equals approximately seven literal days—perhaps the time of the journey from heaven to earth and back.

This silence speaks of the solemnity of redemption completed. All the drama of the ages, all the conflict of the great controversy, comes to its appointed end. Heaven itself pauses in reverent awe.

## Practical Application

### What the Seals Teach Us

1. **History is under God's control.** Though evil has seemed to triumph through long centuries, the Lamb holds the scroll. Nothing has taken God by surprise. Every faithful witness is remembered.

2. **Compromise leads to corruption.** The progression from white to red to black to pale warns us against any alliance with worldliness. The church that seeks the world's approval loses her spiritual power.

3. **Faithfulness may cost everything.** The martyrs under the altar remind us that following Christ may lead to suffering. But "white robes" await all who are faithful unto death (Revelation 2:10).

4. **The signs have been fulfilled.** We are living in the brief interval before the final events. The earthquake, the dark day, the falling stars—these are not future events but past history, pointing to the nearness of Christ's return.

5. **Preparation is possible.** The sealing work of Revelation 7 shows that God will have a prepared people. Through Christ's righteousness imputed and imparted, we may stand in that day without fear.

[Q] **"How can I be among the sealed?"**

The seal of God is placed upon those who have surrendered fully to Christ and are keeping "the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12). This is not legalistic obedience but the fruit of righteousness by faith—Christ living His life in us. As we behold Him daily in His Word, we are "changed into the same image from glory to glory" (2 Corinthians 3:18).

## Appeal

> _"The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."_ (2 Peter 3:9)

The seven seals trace the path of God's people from apostolic purity through centuries of darkness to the blazing light of prophetic fulfillment in our own day. Every sign points to one reality: **Jesus is coming soon.**

Will you be among those who cry, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him" (Isaiah 25:9)? Or among those who call for rocks and mountains to hide them from His face?

The choice is yours today. Christ stands ready to clothe you in His righteousness, to seal you for eternity. Surrender fully to Him now, while mercy lingers, while the door of probation remains open.

_"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."_ (Revelation 22:20)
