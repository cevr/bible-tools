# Bible Study: The Love of God

## Introduction

The love of God stands as the foundation of all true religion and the source of every blessing we receive. This study explores the boundless, merciful, and everlasting nature of divine love—a love that pursued us when we were enemies, redeems us through the blood of Christ, and transforms us into channels of that same love to others. Understanding God's love is not merely theological knowledge; it is the key that unlocks victorious Christian living and eternal security.

## Core Truths

### God Delights in Mercy

The Scriptures reveal something extraordinary about the very nature of God—He finds pleasure in showing mercy:

> _"Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy."_ (Micah 7:18)

This is not a God who reluctantly forgives when pressured, but One who **delights** in mercy. The Hebrew word for "delight" here (_chaphets_) means to take pleasure in, to desire earnestly. Forgiveness is not a burden to God—it is His joy.

[DYK🔎] The rhetorical question "Who is a God like unto thee?" echoes the meaning of Micah's own name, which in Hebrew means "Who is like Yahweh?" The prophet's very identity testified to the incomparable mercy of God.

### His Mercies Are New Every Morning

> _"It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness."_ (Lamentations 3:22, 23)

These words were written by Jeremiah while weeping over the destruction of Jerusalem—a city judged for its sins. Yet even in the midst of divine judgment, the prophet recognized that God's mercy had restrained complete destruction. Every sunrise brings a fresh supply of divine compassion. We do not draw upon yesterday's grace for today's trials; God provides new mercies suited to each day's needs.

**Compassions**: Deep, tender feelings of love and pity, from a Hebrew root meaning "womb"—suggesting the protective, nurturing love a mother has for her child.

### God's Mercy Extends to All

> _"He giveth to all life, and breath, and all things."_ (Acts 17:25)

> _"He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."_ (Matthew 5:45)

God's love is not selective or exclusive. The same sun that warms the saint warms the sinner. The same rain that waters the believer's garden waters the unbeliever's field. This reveals a love that reaches beyond worthiness or merit—a love that seeks to draw all hearts to repentance through kindness (Romans 2:4).

## Deeper Truths

### Love That Pursued Us While We Were Enemies

How did humanity respond to such boundless love? With rebellion:

> _"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."_ (Romans 3:23)

Isaiah describes the condition more starkly: a sinful nation, laden with iniquity, children that are corrupters, the whole head sick, the whole heart faint (Isaiah 1:4-6). Yet here is the wonder of divine love—it was not deterred by our condition:

> _"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."_ (Romans 5:8)

The word "commendeth" means to demonstrate, to prove, to set forth. God did not merely speak of love—He proved it by sending His Son to die for those who hated Him.

> _"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_ (John 3:16)

[Q] **"But doesn't God's holiness require that He hate sinners?"**

God hates sin because of what it does to His children—it destroys them. But He loves the sinner with an everlasting love and provided, at infinite cost, a way of escape. A physician may hate a disease with intensity while deeply loving the patient suffering from it. God's hatred of sin and love for sinners are not contradictory; both flow from His perfect character.

### The Unity of the Father and the Son in Love

Some have imagined a stern Father who needed to be appeased by a merciful Son. Scripture demolishes this error:

> _"I and my Father are one."_ (John 10:30)

> _"Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me."_ (John 14:11)

The cross was not the Son overcoming the Father's reluctance—it was the Father and Son united in the same love, working together for our redemption. The Father gave the Son; the Son gave Himself. Their love is one love, flowing from one heart.

[ILL] Consider two mirrors facing each other, reflecting the same light infinitely between them. So the love of the Father and Son reflects back and forth eternally—the same love, the same purpose, the same heart beating for the salvation of humanity. When you see Jesus weeping over Jerusalem, you see the Father's heart. When you see Christ on the cross, you see what the Father was willing to sacrifice.

### Adopted as Sons and Daughters

Divine love does not merely rescue us from destruction—it brings us into the family:

> _"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God."_ (1 John 3:1)

The phrase "what manner of love" translates a Greek word (_potapēn_) meaning "of what country" or "of what strange sort." John is astonished—this love is so foreign to human experience, so otherworldly, that he can scarcely find words. We who were rebels are now children. We who were strangers are now heirs.

> _"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God... ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."_ (Romans 8:14-16)

**Abba**: An Aramaic term of intimate affection—the word a child would use for "Papa" or "Daddy." Through the Holy Spirit, we may approach the Creator of the universe with the tender familiarity of a beloved child.

[DYK🔎] Roman adoption law in Paul's day was remarkably thorough. An adopted son received all rights of inheritance, and his former life was legally erased—all debts cancelled, all obligations ended. He was, in the eyes of the law, born anew into the new family. Paul's readers would have understood the radical transformation implied in spiritual adoption.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Love Shed Abroad—The Holy Spirit's Work

> _"The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."_ (Romans 5:5)

This is the secret of Christian living. We cannot manufacture divine love by human effort. The same love that flows from God's throne must be poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. This is righteousness by faith in action—not striving to love, but receiving Christ's love and allowing it to flow through us.

In the sanctuary service, the golden candlestick in the holy place burned with oil—a symbol of the Holy Spirit (Zechariah 4:2-6). Without the Spirit's oil, there is no light. Without the Spirit's indwelling, there is no genuine love. The believer who abides in Christ through daily communion becomes a vessel through which divine love shines to others.

### Love Transformed into Action

If God's love truly dwells in us, it must overflow:

> _"Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."_ (1 John 4:11)

> _"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you."_ (John 15:12)

The standard is not human affection but Christ's love—a love that laid down its life. This is not mere sentiment; it is sacrificial action:

> _"Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."_ (1 John 3:16)

[Q] **"But how can I love those who have deeply wronged me?"**

You cannot—in your own strength. But the love of God shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Spirit can love even the unlovely. This is why daily surrender to Christ is essential. You must first receive before you can give. Come to the throne of grace each morning with empty hands and an open heart. Let Christ fill you with His love, and that love will enable you to love the unlovable—because it is His love, not yours, flowing through you.

### Loving Enemies—The Mark of God's Children

> _"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven."_ (Matthew 5:44, 45)

Loving those who love us is natural; even publicans do that. But loving enemies—this marks us as children of God, for this is precisely how God loved us. We were His enemies, and He loved us still (Romans 5:10). When we love our enemies, we demonstrate that we have truly partaken of the divine nature.

### Unearned, Unmerited Love

> _"Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us."_ (Titus 3:5)

> _"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ."_ (Ephesians 2:4, 5)

God did not wait until we became lovable to love us. He loved us "when we were dead in sins." Dead men cannot earn anything. This is pure grace—undeserved, unmerited, freely given. Our salvation rests not on our worthiness but on His love. This is the security of the believer: we are held not by the strength of our grip on God but by the strength of His grip on us.

### Love's Discipline

> _"As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent."_ (Revelation 3:19)

> _"For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."_ (Hebrews 12:6)

True love does not ignore faults that lead to destruction. A parent who truly loves a child will discipline that child for their good. God's chastening is not punishment in wrath but training in love—designed to remove the dross and refine the gold, to cut away the dead branches so the vine may bear more fruit. If we understand this, we will receive God's correction with gratitude rather than resentment.

[ILL] A gardener who loves his roses prunes them severely in winter. To the untrained eye, it looks destructive—beautiful branches cut away, the plant reduced to bare stumps. But the gardener knows that unpruned roses grow wild and weak, producing few blooms. The knife is wielded by love for the sake of future fruitfulness. So God's hand of discipline, though painful, shapes us for glory.

## Practical Application

### Confidence That God Will Provide

> _"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"_ (Romans 8:32)

If God gave His greatest gift—His own Son—will He withhold lesser things? This is the logic of love. We may approach God with confidence for every need, knowing that He who paid the infinite price for our redemption will certainly provide for our daily necessities.

### Trust Under His Wings

> _"How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings."_ (Psalm 36:7)

When we truly grasp God's love, trust becomes natural. Fear dissolves. Anxiety fades. We rest beneath the shadow of His wings like a chick safely sheltered beneath the mother hen.

### Nothing Can Separate Us

> _"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."_ (Romans 8:38, 39)

Paul exhausts language trying to describe the security of those who trust in God's love. He searches the universe—death, life, angels, demons, present, future, height, depth—and finds nothing capable of severing us from divine love. This is everlasting love (Jeremiah 31:3). It cannot be quenched, cannot be exhausted, cannot be overcome.

[DYK🔎] In Romans 8:38-39, Paul lists ten potential threats that might separate us from God's love. The number ten in Scripture often represents completeness (Ten Commandments, ten plagues, ten virgins). Paul is saying, in effect: "I have surveyed every possible threat—every category of danger—and found none capable of breaking God's love for you."

### Love as the Motive of All Service

> _"For the love of Christ constraineth us."_ (2 Corinthians 5:14)

The word "constraineth" means to hold together, to compel, to leave no other option. When Christ's love truly fills us, we are compelled to serve Him—not by duty alone, but by devotion. Fear may drive us for a season, but only love sustains. Religion without love becomes cold legalism; service without love becomes weary drudgery. But love transforms every act of obedience into joyful worship.

## Appeal

> _"Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood."_ (Revelation 1:5)

The saints of God through all eternity will sing of a love that pursued them when they fled, forgave them when they rebelled, adopted them when they were orphans, and held them when they stumbled. That same love reaches out to you today.

Have you fully surrendered to this love? Have you let it melt your heart, break down your resistance, and flow through you to others? The love of God is not merely a doctrine to believe—it is a life to live, a power to transform, a flame that burns away selfishness and ignites holy passion.

Christ loved you enough to die for you. Will you love Him enough to live for Him?

Come to Him today. Receive His love anew. Let His Spirit shed abroad in your heart that divine love which alone can make you victorious over sin and fit you for eternal life in His presence.

_"Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee."_ (Jeremiah 31:3)
