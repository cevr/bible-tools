# Reading 146: Missionary Work

## Introduction

Every follower of Christ has been entrusted with sacred responsibilities—talents, abilities, and opportunities to advance God's kingdom. This study explores the solemn truth that faithful service is not optional for the Christian, but the very essence of discipleship. Through the parable of the talents and related scriptures, we discover that God calls each believer to active participation in the work of saving souls, and that our eternal destiny is inseparably connected to how we respond to this divine commission.

## Core Truths

### Every Servant Has Been Given Work

The foundation of Christian service rests on this simple truth: Christ has given _"to every man his work"_ (Mark 13:34). This is not a suggestion but a divine assignment. When Jesus departed for heaven, He did not leave His servants idle—He entrusted them with His authority, His goods, and specific responsibilities.

> _"For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch."_ (Mark 13:34)

Notice the comprehensive nature of this calling:

- **Authority** was given to the servants
- **Work** was assigned to every man
- **Watchfulness** was commanded

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "authority" (exousia) in Mark 13:34 is the same word used when Jesus said _"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth"_ (Matthew 28:18). Christ shares His own authority with His servants for the work of the gospel!

### Talents Distributed According to Ability

Not only has Christ given work, but He has also provided the means to accomplish it:

> _"And unto one He gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey."_ (Matthew 25:15)

**Talents** represent everything God has entrusted to us for His service:

- Natural abilities and spiritual gifts
- Time, health, and strength
- Influence, relationships, and opportunities
- Material resources and knowledge of truth

The distribution is not equal, but it is equitable—_"according to his several ability."_ God never asks more of us than He has enabled us to give. The servant with two talents who doubles them receives the identical commendation as the one with five.

[Q] **"But I have so little to offer compared to others. What can I possibly do?"**

This is precisely the thinking that led to condemnation in the parable. The one-talent servant looked at his small portion and reasoned himself out of service entirely. Yet notice: he was not condemned for having only one talent, but for hiding what he had. God measures faithfulness, not results. The widow's two mites outweighed the rich men's abundance (Luke 21:1-4) because she gave all she had. Your "little" in God's hands becomes much.

### Who Are These Servants?

Scripture makes clear who bears this responsibility:

> _"For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods."_ (Matthew 25:14)

The servants are those who belong to Christ—_"his own servants."_ If you have named the name of Christ, if you claim citizenship in His kingdom, then you are among those entrusted with His goods. There is no class of passive Christians who may simply receive blessings without responsibility to share them.

## Deeper Truths

### The Fatal Error of the Unfaithful Servant

The parable presents a sobering contrast. While the faithful servants _"traded"_ with their talents—actively investing and multiplying them—one servant took a different course:

> _"But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money."_ (Matthew 25:18)

What motivated this tragic choice? The servant offered an excuse:

> _"And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine."_ (Matthew 25:25)

He claimed fear of his master's severity drove him to inaction. But the master's response exposes this excuse as a cover for something deeper:

> _"Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow; wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?"_ (Luke 19:22-23)

[ILL] Consider a child who says, "I was afraid Father would be angry if I broke the dish, so I never helped with the dishes at all." Does this fear prove love for the father? No—it reveals that the child cared more about avoiding consequences than about pleasing the father or helping the family. True love would have said, "I may fail, but I will try because I love my father and want to serve him."

The unfaithful servant's "fear" was not reverent awe but self-protective avoidance. If he truly believed his master was exacting, all the more reason to produce something—even the minimal return of bank interest! His excuse condemned him from his own mouth.

The real issues were:

- **Slothfulness**: Unwillingness to put forth effort
- **Wickedness**: A heart not aligned with the master's purposes
- **Selfishness**: Concern for self rather than the master's interests

### The Solemn Fate of Unfaithfulness

The consequences for the unprofitable servant are severe:

> _"And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."_ (Matthew 25:30)

This is not an arbitrary punishment but the natural result of a life lived apart from the master's service. Those who refuse to gather with Christ are scattering; those who will not work for Him are working against Him.

> _"He that is not with Me is against Me: and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth."_ (Luke 11:23)

There is no neutral ground. The branch that bears no fruit is taken away (John 15:2). Workers of iniquity—including those whose iniquity is simple neglect—will hear the dreadful words: _"I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me"_ (Luke 13:27).

[Q] **"Isn't salvation by grace through faith? How can works determine our destiny?"**

Salvation is indeed by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9), and we can never earn our standing before God. But genuine faith produces works as certainly as a living tree produces fruit. The absence of fruit reveals the absence of true spiritual life. James declares, _"Faith without works is dead"_ (James 2:26). We are not saved by works, but saving faith works. The unfaithful servant's failure to use his talent revealed he had no genuine connection to the master—he served himself, not his lord.

### The Joy Set Before the Faithful

In glorious contrast, the faithful servants hear these precious words:

> _"Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord."_ (Matthew 25:21)

What is this "joy of thy lord"? It is the same joy that sustained Christ through Calvary:

> _"Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."_ (Hebrews 12:2)

The joy set before Jesus was the redemption of lost humanity—seeing souls saved for eternity:

> _"He shall see the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied."_ (Isaiah 53:11)

When Christ beholds the redeemed, He will break forth in joyful singing:

> _"The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with joy: He will rest in His love, He will joy over thee with singing."_ (Zephaniah 3:17)

[DYK🔎] This is the only place in Scripture where God is described as singing! The Hebrew word for "joy" (yagil) suggests spinning around in exultation. The Almighty Creator will dance with delight over His redeemed people!

Paul understood this joy and longed to share in it:

> _"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? For ye are our glory and joy."_ (1 Thessalonians 2:19-20)

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Pathway to Joy: Death to Self

Here is a profound principle woven throughout Scripture: the joy of heaven comes only through the pathway of self-denial and sacrifice. Christ's joy came through enduring the cross. Our participation in that joy requires the same pathway:

> _"It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him."_ (2 Timothy 2:11-12)

This is the law of the kingdom—the great controversy principle that distinguishes Christ's government from Satan's. Satan's kingdom is built on self-exaltation; Christ's kingdom is built on self-giving love. The seed must fall into the ground and die to bring forth fruit (John 12:24). The life hoarded is the life lost; the life poured out for others is the life eternally preserved.

### Ambassadors for Christ

Every faithful worker occupies a position of tremendous dignity and responsibility:

> _"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."_ (2 Corinthians 5:20)

An **ambassador** represents the full authority of the one who sends him. When we speak Christ's message faithfully, it is as though God Himself were speaking through us. What a solemn privilege! What a sacred trust! The gospel message we carry has power to reconcile lost sinners to their Creator.

### The Constraining Motive

What should motivate our service? Not fear of punishment, not desire for reward, but something far higher:

> _"For the love of Christ constraineth us: because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead."_ (2 Corinthians 5:14)

The word "constraineth" (sunecho) means to press together, to compel, to leave no other option. When we truly understand that Christ died for all—including every soul we meet—we cannot remain silent. Love becomes the irresistible motivation that drives all genuine Christian service.

[ILL] A mother whose child has fallen into a well does not calculate the cost of rescue. She does not weigh whether it is convenient to help. Love compels her to action without hesitation. So the love of Christ, when truly felt, makes missionary work not a burden but an overflow of the heart.

### Connection to the Sanctuary

The parable of the talents connects directly to Christ's present ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. Our Lord has gone on a "far journey"—to heaven itself—to minister as our High Priest. Meanwhile, He has entrusted His servants with the work of proclaiming His message to the world.

In the daily service of the earthly sanctuary, the priests continually ministered on behalf of the people. So Christ, in the holy place of the heavenly sanctuary, ministers for us—and so we, as a kingdom of priests (1 Peter 2:9), minister to others in His name.

The investigative judgment now proceeding in the Most Holy Place examines the records of all who have professed faith. The question is not merely "Did they believe?" but "Did their faith produce fruit? Were they faithful with what was entrusted to them?" The talents buried and unused testify against the unfaithful servant.

## Practical Application

### Identifying Your Talents

Consider prayerfully:

- What abilities has God given you? (Teaching, hospitality, encouragement, practical helps, music, writing, speaking, listening)
- What resources are at your disposal? (Time, money, influence, relationships, knowledge of truth)
- What opportunities surround you? (Neighbors, coworkers, family members, strangers in need)

### Putting Talents to Work

Even the unfaithful servant could have done something minimal—depositing with the exchangers. Here are simple ways to begin:

- **Pray daily** for specific individuals by name
- **Share literature** that has blessed you
- **Invite someone** to a meal or Bible study
- **Send a message** of encouragement
- **Give financially** to support those called to full-time ministry
- **Offer practical help** to those in need

### Overcoming Fear

The unfaithful servant claimed fear as his excuse. If fear holds you back:

- Remember that God has given you authority with the work
- Trust that He who assigned the task will enable its completion
- Start small and watch God multiply your efforts
- Focus on faithfulness, not results—God is responsible for the harvest

### Living as Ambassadors

As Christ's representatives:

- Guard your words and conduct—you represent the King of heaven
- Speak His message, not your own opinions
- Plead with sinners as though God Himself were pleading through you
- Remember that reconciliation is your message—God is not angry but loving

## Appeal

> _"He that is not with Me is against Me: and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth."_ (Luke 11:23)

Dear friend, there is no middle ground in the great controversy. Today you are either gathering with Christ or scattering. Your talents—whatever they may be—are either invested for His kingdom or buried in the earth of neglect.

The Master will soon return from His far journey. What will He find you doing? Will you hear those blessed words, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant... enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"?

The love of Christ constrains us. He died for all. Every soul around you is precious to heaven—worth the infinite price of Calvary. Will you hide your talent in the earth while souls perish? Or will you arise, take your place in the ranks of faithful servants, and labor while it is still day?

Christ offers you the privilege of sharing His own joy—the joy of seeing souls redeemed for eternity. This joy comes only through the pathway of self-denial and loving service. Will you walk that path with Him?

Today, determine by God's grace to use every talent, every opportunity, every resource for His glory. The harvest is great, the laborers are few, and the Master is coming soon.

_"Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."_ (Revelation 22:12)
