## Slide 1 – Q1: The Figure of Death

- Question: By what figure does the Bible represent death?
- Key Text: 1 Thessalonians 4:13 – “But I would not have you to be ignorant,
  brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others
  which have no hope.”
- Additional Text: John 11:11 – “...Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that
  I may awake him out of sleep.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Death as Sleep)

- The Bible consistently describes death as a **sleep**, not merely as poetry,
  but as a precise theological description.
- **Unconsciousness:** Like a sleeping person, the dead are unaware of time or
  events; they are not suffering in hell nor floating in bliss.
- **Temporary:** Sleep implies an awakening. Death is a pause waiting for the
  resurrection morning.
- **The Christian’s Hope:** The world fears death as a dark abyss, but the
  Christian views it as a rest in Jesus.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Hardworking Laborer:**
  - Imagine a laborer who works hard all day under the hot sun.
  - In the evening, he lies down to sleep and knows nothing of the passing night
    or storms.
  - His next conscious moment is the morning sun.
- **The Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The Christian closes their eyes in death, resting from labor.
  - The very next instant (to their consciousness) is the face of Jesus on
    resurrection morning.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Location of the Dead

- Question: Where do the dead sleep?
- Key Text: Daniel 12:2 – “And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth
  shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting
  contempt.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Creation Reversed)

- **The Dust:** The dead sleep in the "dust of the earth."
- **Creation Reversed:**
  - Genesis 2:7 states God formed man of dust + breath of life = living soul.
  - Death reverses this: The breath (spirit) returns to God, and the body
    returns to dust (Ecclesiastes 12:7).
- **No Disembodied Existence:** The "soul" ceases to function when the dust and
  breath separate.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Sanctuary & Illustration

- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, blood was shed in the "outer court" (earth).
  - We live and die here in the outer court while Christ ministers in the
    heavenly sanctuary.
  - We wait in the dust until He completes His atonement.
- **Illustration – The Wooden Box:**
  - A box is made of wood + nails.
  - If you pull the nails out and set the wood aside, the "box" is gone. It does
    not go to "box heaven."
  - The box only exists again when the maker reassembles the materials.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Duration of Sleep

- Question: How long will they sleep there?
- Key Text: Job 14:12 – “So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be
  no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Timing & Faith)

- **Till the Heavens be No More:** The dead do not rise immediately; they wait
  for a specific cosmic event.
- **The Second Coming:** This event corresponds to the heavens departing as a
  scroll (Revelation 6:14).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Our salvation depends entirely on Christ, not our own power to live on.
  - We rest in the grave, trusting solely that His righteousness has covered us
    and He will return for us.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Bank Vault:**
  - A deposit in a bank vault remains there until the owner comes to claim it.
  - The deposit does not move itself.
  - We are God’s "jewels" (Malachi 3:17), kept safe in the grave until the Owner
    returns to claim His treasure.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Great Change

- Question: What must take place before Job could expect to awake?
- Key Text: Job 14:14 – “If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my
  appointed time will wait, till my change come.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Judgment & Transformation)

- **The Change:** This refers to the resurrection transformation from mortality
  to immortality (1 Corinthians 15:51–52).
- **The Appointed Time:** God has a set time for the resurrection; it is not
  haphazard.
- **Sanctuary Connection (Investigative Judgment):**
  - While Job waits in the grave, his record is examined in the heavenly
    sanctuary (Daniel 7:9–10).
  - God vindicates the character of His saints before the universe prior to
    raising them.

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Waiting Place

- Question: Where does he wait?
- Key Text: Job 17:13 – “If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed
  in the darkness.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (The Grave)

- **A House of Darkness:** The grave (_Sheol_) is described as a bed in
  darkness, not a palace of light or a pit of fire.
- **Universal Destination:** In the Old Testament, this is the realm where both
  righteous and wicked wait for judgment.
- **Comfort:** For the weary pilgrim, this "darkness" is a place of undisturbed
  rest, free from the pain and toil of life.

## Slide 14 – Q6: Knowledge of the Living

- Question: While in this condition, what does one know of those he has left
  behind?
- Key Text: Job 14:21 – “His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they
  are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points (Merciful Ignorance)

- **Disconnected:** The dead are completely disconnected from earthly events.
- **Mercy of God:** If a righteous parent were in heaven watching their children
  suffer or sin on earth, heaven would not be a place of joy.
- **Against Spiritualism:**
  - Since the dead "know not" what happens on earth, any spirit claiming to be a
    dead relative is a deception (Isaiah 8:19–20).

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **God's Anesthesia:**
  - If you are under deep anesthesia for surgery, you are unaware of the music
    playing or family weeping nearby.
  - You are "safe" from the trauma because you are unconscious.
  - Death is God’s anesthesia against the suffering of history until He heals
    the universe.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Thoughts at Death

- Question: What becomes of man's thoughts at death?
- Key Text: Psalm 146:4 – “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in
  that very day his thoughts perish.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (The Mind)

- **Thoughts Perish:** When the biological mechanism stops, the mental process
  stops.
- **No Thinking Without the Body:** The Bible connects the mind with the living
  organism.
- **"Spirit" (_Ruach_):** This word means breath or life energy. It is the power
  that animates the body, not a conscious entity that thinks apart from the
  body.
- **Identity Preserved:** Though thoughts cease, our character is preserved in
  God's memory.

## Slide 19 – Q8: Consciousness of the Dead

- Question: Do the dead know anything?
- Key Text: Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die: but the
  dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of
  them is forgotten.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Probation)

- **Total Unconsciousness:** "The dead know not anything." There is no conscious
  soul hovering nearby.
- **The Importance of "Now":**
  - We have a time of probation _now_.
  - Sanctification is the work of a lifetime; character cannot be developed in
    the grave.
- **Application:** We must lay hold of Christ's righteousness today. "Today if
  ye will hear his voice..." (Hebrews 3:15).

## Slide 21 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Broken Computer:**
  - A computer needs both hardware and electricity to work.
  - The electricity (breath) may exist in the wall, and the hardware (dust) sits
    on the desk.
  - But until they are combined, no "computing" (thinking) happens.

## Slide 22 – Q9: Participation in Earthly Things

- Question: What part, if any, do they take in earthly things?
- Key Text: Ecclesiastes 9:6 – “Also their love, and their hatred, and their
  envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in any
  thing that is done under the sun.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Emotions & Safety)

- **Emotions Cease:** Love, hatred, and envy are functions of the mind; they
  perish when thoughts perish.
- **No "Hauntings":** The dead do not return to help loved ones or seek revenge.
- **Protection:** Satan's first lie was "Ye shall not surely die" (Genesis 3:4).
  Understanding the state of the dead protects us from spiritism and lying
  wonders.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Praising the Lord

- Question: What does the psalmist say about the dead praising the Lord?
- Key Text: Psalm 115:17 – “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go
  down into silence.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Key Points (Silence)

- **Not in Heaven:** If the righteous were in heaven, they would be praising God
  (Revelation 19:1).
- **The Grave is Silent:** The fact that they "praise not" proves they are in
  the silence of the grave.
- **God's Glory:** God is glorified by the truth of the Resurrection, not by the
  false doctrine of immediate reward.

## Slide 26 – Q11: Knowing God in Death

- Question: How much does one know of God when dead?
- Key Text: Psalm 6:5 – “For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the
  grave who shall give thee thanks?”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Key Points (God Remembers)

- **Suspended Relationship:** On the human side, the relationship is suspended
  because of unconsciousness.
- **God Remembers Us:**
  - While the dead do not remember God, God remembers them.
  - **Sanctuary Connection:** We are engraved on the palms of His hands (Isaiah
    49:16) and represented by our High Priest, even while we sleep in the dust.

## Slide 28 – Q12: Is David in Heaven?

- Question: But are not the righteous dead in heaven?
- Key Text: Acts 2:34 – “For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he
  saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand...”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Key Points (Peter's Argument)

- **Peter's Testimony:** In Acts 2, Peter argues that David is dead and buried
  to prove the resurrection prophecy applied to Jesus.
- **The Implication:** If David were already in heaven, Peter’s argument
  regarding the resurrection would fail.
- **Exceptions:** Elijah and Moses are special "types" of the coming kingdom,
  but the majority of saints (like David) sleep until the Second Coming.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Victory Banquet:**
  - Guests do not enter a victory banquet one by one weeks early.
  - They wait until the victory is won and the doors open for everyone at once.
  - Hebrews 11:39–40: The heroes of faith wait, "that they without us should not
    be made perfect." We enter glory together.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Enabling Praise

- Question: If the dead cannot praise God, what must take place to enable them
  to do so?
- Key Text: Isaiah 26:19 – “Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body
  shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust...”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Key Points (Resurrection Power)

- **Awake and Sing:** The song of praise begins only _after_ the awakening.
- **Union with Christ:** "Together with my dead body" implies our union with
  Christ. His resurrection is the guarantee of ours.
- **The Earth Yields:** The grave cannot hold its prey when the Author of Life
  commands it to open.

## Slide 33 – Q14: David's Satisfaction

- Question: What was the only thing with which David would be satisfied?
- Key Text: Psalm 17:15 – “As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I
  shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.”

## Slide 34 – Q14: Key Points (Righteousness & Likeness)

- **Beholding in Righteousness:** Only those clothed in Christ’s righteousness
  can behold God’s face and live.
- **When I Awake:** Satisfaction comes at the awakening, not at the moment of
  death.
- **Restored Image:** To awake with "thy likeness" means the restoration of
  God's image in man is complete—character is sealed, and the body is glorified.

## Slide 35 – Q15: Consequence of No Resurrection

- Question: If there should never be an awakening of the dead, what would be the
  result?
- Key Text: 1 Corinthians 15:16-18 – “For if the dead rise not... Then they also
  which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”

## Slide 36 – Q15: Key Points (Victory Over Death)

- **Necessity of Resurrection:** If the soul went to heaven at death,
  resurrection would be unnecessary. Paul says without it, the dead have
  "perished."
- **Vain Faith:** The Christian faith rests on the bodily resurrection. If there
  is no resurrection, sin and death have won.
- **Victory:** But Christ _is_ risen! Death is not permanent annihilation, but a
  sleep from which He will wake us.

## Slide 37 – Q16: The Time of Resurrection

- Question: When does the resurrection of the righteous take place?
- Key Text: 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord himself shall descend from
  heaven with a shout... and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”

## Slide 38 – Q16: Key Points (The Second Coming)

- **The Sequence:**
  1. The Lord descends.
  2. The Trumpet sounds.
  3. The dead in Christ rise _first_.
- **Sanctuary Climax:** Christ ends His priestly ministry, puts on Kingly robes,
  and comes to gather His subjects.
- **Blessed Hope:** We do not sorrow as those with no hope; we know we will meet
  the Lord and our loved ones in the air.

## Slide 39 – Q16: Illustration

- **Time Compression:**
  - The sleep of death mercifully shortens the wait.
  - Adam has been dead nearly 6,000 years, yet to him, it is but a moment.
  - He closes his eyes on a world of sin and opens them immediately to the face
    of the "Seed of the woman."
  - The next tick of the clock for the dead is the Trumpet of God.
