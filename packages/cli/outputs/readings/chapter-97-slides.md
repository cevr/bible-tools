## Slide 1 – Q1: The Bondage of Israel

- **Question:** In what words does the Bible describe the bondage of Israel in
  Egypt?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 2:23 – “And the children of Israel sighed by reason of
  the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the
  bondage.”
- **Additional Text:** James 5:4 – “Behold, the hire of the labourers who have
  reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the
  cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of
  sabaoth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Sin and Deliverance)

- **A Spiritual Type:** Israel’s history is a “grand type” of humanity’s
  spiritual condition.
- **The Hardship of Sin:**
  - Just as Pharaoh afflicted Israel (Exodus 1:11), sin imposes a crushing
    weight on the conscience.
  - The service of Satan promises pleasure but pays in misery and death (Romans
    6:23).
- **The Cry for Deliverance:**
  - Freedom begins with realizing our hopeless condition.
  - Before justification, one must realize they are condemned.
- **God’s Justice:**
  - God takes note of social injustice and oppression (James 5:1–4).
  - He is the defender of the weak.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Quicksand:**
  - A man stuck in quicksand cannot pull himself out by his own hair.
  - The more he struggles, the deeper he sinks.
  - He requires a savior standing on solid ground.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The sinner cannot free himself from the “bondage of corruption” (Romans
    8:21).
  - He must cry out to the Deliverer.

---

## Slide 4 – Q2: God Hears the Cry

- **Question:** Who heard their cries for help?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 2:24 – “God heard their groaning, and God remembered His
  covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Covenant and Sanctuary)

- **The Covenant Defined:**
  - A solemn, binding agreement.
  - Refers to the _Everlasting Covenant_ made with the patriarchs (Genesis
    12:3).
- **The Basis of Salvation:**
  - God did not save Israel because they were righteous (they were often
    idolatrous in Egypt).
  - He saved them because He “remembered His covenant.”
  - **Grace:** Salvation rests on God’s promise and character, not human merit.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Prayers ascend like incense to God.
  - In the sanctuary, the altar of incense represents Christ’s intercession
    mingling with our prayers (Revelation 8:3–4).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Mother’s Ear:**
  - If a child is lost in a crowd and cries out, many hear a noise.
  - Only the mother distinguishes the voice of her own child.
- **The Lesson:**
  - God hears the groaning of the sinner not as a distant Judge.
  - He hears as a Father remembering His promise to save.

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Commission of Moses

- **Question:** What did God tell Moses to do?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 3:9, 10 – “Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children
  of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the
  Egyptians oppress them. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh,
  that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Christ Our Deliverer)

- **The Divine Initiative:**
  - God says: “I have seen,” “I have heard,” and “I will send.”
  - The plan of salvation originated in God’s heart before the foundation of the
    world.
- **Moses as a Type of Christ:**
  - Moses left the palace to identify with his suffering brethren (Hebrews
    11:24–25).
  - Christ left heaven to become one with humanity (Philippians 2:5–8).
- **The Purpose:**
  - God brought them _out_ to bring them _in_ to the Promised Land.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Lifeguard:**
  - A lifeguard does not jump into a stormy sea just to swim alongside a
    drowning man.
  - He jumps in to seize him and bring him to shore.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Christ came to “seek and to save that which was lost” (Luke 19:10).

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Law and Redemption

- **Question:** In giving His law to His people, how did God describe Himself?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 20:2 – “I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee
  out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Law and Gospel)

- **Redemption Precedes Obedience:**
  - God saved them _first_ by grace, _then_ gave the law.
  - We do not obey to _be_ saved; we obey because we _are_ saved.
- **The Motive for Obedience:**
  - “If ye love me, keep my commandments” (John 14:15).
- **Law of Liberty:**
  - The Ten Commandments describe the character of the God who frees us.
  - Sin is bondage; obedience (through Christ’s power) is freedom.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Train:**
  - A train is only free to run effectively when it stays on the tracks.
  - If it “liberates” itself from the tracks, it becomes a wreck.
- **The Lesson:**
  - God’s law provides the tracks for human happiness and true freedom.

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Protection Against Slavery

- **Question:** What did God do to protect Israel against slavery?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 15:15 – “And thou shalt remember that thou wast a
  bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I
  command thee this thing to day.”
- **Additional Text:** Exodus 22:21 – “Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor
  oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Empathy and Provision)

- **The Principle of Empathy:**
  - Kindness is based on shared experience: “For ye know the heart of a
    stranger” (Exodus 23:9).
- **Practical Righteousness:**
  - Masters had to supply freed servants “liberally” (Deuteronomy 15:14).
  - **Imparted Righteousness:** God does not just declare us free
    (Justification); He equips us with grace to live successfully
    (Sanctification).
- **The Comfort of God:**
  - We comfort others with the comfort we have received (2 Corinthians 1:2–4).

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Rescued Neighbor:**
  - A man rescued from a burning building will not stand idly by while his
    neighbor’s house burns.
  - The memory of his own rescue compels him to act.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Remembering our deliverance from sin leads us to lift up the fallen.

---

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Sabbath and Freedom

- **Question:** What was one of the reasons that Israel should keep the Sabbath?
- **Key Text:** Deuteronomy 5:15 – “And remember that thou wast a servant in the
  land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a
  mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded
  thee to keep the Sabbath day.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points (Rest and Sanctification)

- **A Dual Memorial:**
  - The Sabbath commemorates Creation (Exodus 20:11) and Redemption (Deuteronomy
    5:15).
- **Sign of Sanctification:**
  - “...that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you” (Exodus
    31:13).
  - Sanctification is the process of being made holy and free from sin’s power.
- **Rest from Works:**
  - In Egypt, labor was endless.
  - The Sabbath signifies ceasing from our own works for salvation and resting
    in Christ (Hebrews 4:9–10).

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Slave’s Time:**
  - A slave has no control over his time; the master owns every hour.
- **The Lesson:**
  - By giving the Sabbath, God declared Israel free.
  - “You are no longer slaves; you have the privilege of time with the King.”

---

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Jubilee

- **Question:** What proclamation was made every fifty years?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 25:10 – “And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and
  proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
  shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his
  possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Atonement and Restoration)

- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The Jubilee trumpet sounded _only_ on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 25:9).
  - **Theological Meaning:** Liberty is based on Atonement.
  - When the High Priest completed the cleansing (judgment type), the people
    were free.
- **Total Restoration:**
  - Debts canceled, slaves freed, land returned.
  - Points to the **Earth Made New** and deliverance from the “bondage of
    corruption” (Romans 8:21).

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Cancelled Debt:**
  - Imagine a man hopeless, having lost his home and freedom to debt.
  - A trumpet sounds: the ledger is burned, the deed returned, and chains struck
    off.
- **The Lesson:**
  - This is the Jubilee—a picture of what Christ does for the sinner.

---

## Slide 22 – Q8: Consequences of Oppression

- **Question:** Because Israel failed to do this, became oppressive and forsook
  the Sabbath, what did God do?
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 34:17 – “Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ye have not
  harkened unto Me, in proclaiming liberty... behold, I proclaim a liberty for
  you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine...”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Reciprocity and Apostasy)

- **The Law of Reciprocity:**
  - “With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged” (Matthew 7:2).
  - Refusing to free others shows we have not received God's spirit of freedom.
- **Consequences of Apostasy:**
  - God did not arbitrarily destroy them; they removed themselves from His
    protection.
  - They chose the “liberty” to sin, and received the “liberty” of the sword.
- **The Babylon Connection:**
  - Because they rejected the Sabbath rest, the land kept Sabbath while they
    were captive in Babylon (2 Chronicles 36:21).

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Diver:**
  - If a diver cuts his air hose to be “free” from the tube, he finds only the
    freedom to drown.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Israel cut their connection to God’s law and found only destruction.

---

## Slide 25 – Q9: False Worship

- **Question:** What fault did the God of heaven find with Israel's religious
  gatherings?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:3, 4 – “Behold, in the day of your fast ye find
  pleasure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye fast for strife and debate,
  and to smite with the fist of wickedness.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points (Formalism vs. Power)

- **Formalism:**
  - They performed rituals (fasting, looking sad) but their characters remained
    harsh and greedy.
- **Sanctification is Practical:**
  - True religion affects how we treat employees and neighbors.
  - God rejects a “form of godliness” that denies the power thereof (2 Timothy
    3:5).
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Satan delights in religious rituals performed with a hateful spirit, as it
    misrepresents God’s character.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Painted Fire:**
  - A painted fire gives no heat.
  - A painted banquet satisfies no hunger.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Outward religion without the warmth of love and justice is dead.

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: The True Fast

- **Question:** What does God set forth as the fast acceptable to Him?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 58:6 – “Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose
  the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed
  go free, and that ye break every yoke?”

## Slide 29 – Q10: Key Points (Ministry and Fruit)

- **Spiritual Liberation:**
  - “To loose the bands of wickedness.”
  - The Gospel work involves freeing minds from error and sin.
- **Physical Ministry:**
  - Dealing bread to the hungry; covering the naked.
  - This is the mandate for medical missionary work and welfare ministry.
- **Righteousness by Faith in Action:**
  - These works do not buy salvation.
  - They are the inevitable _fruit_ of a heart where Christ dwells and the law
    is written (Hebrews 8:10).

## Slide 30 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Fruit Tree:**
  - An apple tree does not bear apples to prove it is an apple tree.
  - It bears fruit because of the life sap flowing through it.
- **The Lesson:**
  - A Christian does good works because the life of Jesus flows through them.

---

## Slide 31 – Q11: Christ’s Mission

- **Question:** Why did Christ come to this world?
- **Key Text:** Luke 4:18 – “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath
  anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the
  brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives...”

## Slide 32 – Q11: Key Points (The Anointed One)

- **Messiah/Christ:**
  - Means “The Anointed One.”
  - Christ is our High Priest, anointed to minister salvation.
- **Fourfold Ministry:**
  - _Preach:_ Good news to the destitute.
  - _Heal:_ Restoration of the brokenhearted.
  - _Deliver:_ Freedom from Satan and bad habits.
  - _Restore Sight:_ Opening eyes to truth.
- **The “Bruised”:**
  - Christ came to restore the bruised reed, not break it (Isaiah 42:3).

## Slide 33 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Warden vs. The Liberator:**
  - A prison warden keeps people in.
  - A liberator breaks them out.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Satan is the warden; Christ is the Liberator holding the keys of death
    (Revelation 1:18).

---

## Slide 34 – Q12: The Servant of Sin

- **Question:** In what condition are those who commit sin?
- **Key Text:** John 8:34 – “Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.”

## Slide 35 – Q12: Key Points (Slavery of the Will)

- **Nature of Bondage:**
  - “Servant” (Greek _doulos_) means slave.
  - The sinner believes he is free, but obeys a cruel master (the carnal
    nature).
- **Inability of the Will:**
  - Repeated sin enslaves the will.
  - “How to perform that which is good I find not” (Romans 7:18).
- **The Need for a New Master:**
  - We cannot just stop serving sin; we must become servants to God (Romans
    6:22).

## Slide 36 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Addict:**
  - An addict claims he is free to take the drug.
  - When he tries to _stop_, he discovers the chains he forged himself.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Every sin is a link in a chain we cannot break on our own.

---

## Slide 37 – Q13: The Name of Jesus

- **Question:** Why was Christ's name to be called “Jesus”?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 1:21 – “And thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall
  save His people from their sins.”

## Slide 38 – Q13: Key Points (Victory Over Sin)

- **Meaning:** Jesus (Yeshua) means “Jehovah is Salvation.”
- **Saved FROM, not IN:**
  - Christ does not save us _in_ our sins.
  - He saves from the _penalty_ (Justification).
  - He saves from the _power_ (Sanctification).
- **Victory is Promised:**
  - The Gospel is the power of God to break the dominion of sin (Romans 1:16).

## Slide 39 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Physician:**
  - A doctor who "saves" a patient from cancer removes the cancer.
  - He does not leave the cancer and simply ignore it.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Jesus is the Great Physician who removes the cancer of sin from the soul.

---

- **Key Text:** James 1:15 – “When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin.”
- **Additional Text:** Romans 7:7 – “I had not known lust, except the law had
  said, Thou shalt not covet.”

## Slide 41 – Q14: Key Points (The Heart and Law)

- **The Heart of the Matter:**
  - Sin begins in the mind; **Lust** (covetousness) is the seed.
- **Function of the Law:**
  - The Tenth Commandment probes the thoughts and intents of the heart.
  - God requires purity in the “inward parts” (Psalm 51:6).
- **Sanctuary Sequence:**
  - _Courtyard:_ The act committed.
  - _Holy Place:_ The thought formed.
  - To be truly free, the heart (Holy Place) must be cleansed.

## Slide 42 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Weed:**
  - Cutting the top off a weed leaves the root to grow back.
- **The Lesson:**
  - External reformation (changing habits) is not enough.
  - Christ must dig out the root of sin through regeneration.

  equality of human rights?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 19:18 – “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

## Slide 44 – Q15: Key Points (The Royal Law)

- **The Royal Law:**
  - James 2:8 calls this the “royal law.”
  - It destroys caste, racism, and slavery, placing all equal before God.
- **Self-Preservation Standard:**
  - We naturally look after our own needs.
  - The Bible commands we extend that same care to everyone else.
- **The End of Selfishness:**
  - Fulfilled only by the love of God shed abroad in our hearts (Romans 5:5).

## Slide 45 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Body:**

---

## Slide 46 – Q16: The Rule of Life

- **Question:** What rule of life has Christ Himself given to guide us in such
  unselfish living?

  do ye even so to them.”

## Slide 47 – Q16: Key Points (The Golden Rule)

- **Positive Action:**
  - Jesus did not say, “Don’t do what hurts.”
  - He said, “DO unto others.” It requires active kindness.
- **The Test of Conduct:**
  - In any situation, ask: “If our positions were reversed, how would I want to
    be treated?”
- **Law and Prophets:**
  - This principle summarizes Old Testament ethical teaching.

## Slide 48 – Q16: Illustration

- **Reversed Roles:**
  - If you were hungry, you would want food.
  - If you were accused, you would want a fair hearing.
- **The Lesson:**

---

## Slide 52 – Q18: Genuine Freedom

- **Question:** Who, alone, then, is able to give to men genuine freedom?
- **Key Text:** John 8:36 – “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall
  be free indeed.”

## Slide 53 – Q18: Key Points (True Liberty)

  - Christ invited and reasoned, but never forced.
- **Love vs. Force:**
  - God’s government is based on love.
  - Force is the principle of Satan’s kingdom.
- **The Time of Probation:**

- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 3:17 – “Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the
  Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”

## Slide 62 – Q21: Key Points (Internal Liberty)

- **The Work of the Spirit:**
  - Brings liberty from condemnation and the power of sin.
- **The New Covenant:**
  - The Spirit writes the law on the heart (giving life), contrasting with the
    letter alone (which kills).
- **Voluntary Obedience:**
  - Obedience becomes a delight, not drudgery.
  - We obey because we love God, not just to avoid punishment.

## Slide 63 – Q21: Illustration

- **Question:** What kind of worship can alone be acceptable to God?
- **Key Text:** John 4:24 – “God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must
  worship Him in spirit and in truth.”

## Slide 65 – Q22: Key Points (Spirit and Truth)

- **In Spirit:**
  - Worship must spring from a heart renewed by the Holy Spirit.
  - Not just forms or buildings, but the engagement of the heart.
- **In Truth:**
  - Worship must be grounded in God’s revealed Word.
  - Sincerity alone is not enough; we need the Truth.
- **The Balance:**
  - Spirit without Truth = Fanaticism.
  - Truth without Spirit = Formalism.

## Slide 66 – Q22: Illustration

- **The Living Body:**
  - A body needs a skeleton (Structure/Truth) and breath (Spirit).
  - Skeleton without breath is a corpse.
  - Breath without a body is a ghost.
- **The Lesson:**
  - True worship requires Bible truth animated by the life of the Spirit.
