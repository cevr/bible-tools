## Slide 1 – Title Slide

- **Sanctification and Present Truth**
- A Bible Study on Holiness, History, and the Final Message
- “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: Sanctification by Truth

- **Question:** By what are men sanctified?
- **Key Text:** John 17:17 – “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is
  truth.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Process of Transformation

- **The Source of Holiness:**
  - We cannot sanctify ourselves by human effort. Holiness is imparted as we
    receive God's Word.
  - 1 Thessalonians 2:13 – “For this cause also thank we God without ceasing,
    because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received
    it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which
    effectually worketh also in you that believe.”
- **The Role of Truth:**
  - Truth liberates the mind and purifies the affections.
  - John 8:32 – “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
    free.”

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: A Progressive Work

- **Progressive Growth:**
  - Sanctification is not the work of a moment; it is the work of a lifetime.
  - It is the ongoing work of grace setting the believer apart for holy use.
- **Definition:**
  - Sanctification results in obedience to God's law through the Holy Spirit.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: God’s Will for Humanity

- **Question:** Would God have all men come to the knowledge of the truth?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 2:4 – “Who will have all men to be saved, and to come
  unto the knowledge of the truth.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Knowledge and Salvation

- **The Divine Will:**
  - God does not predestinate any soul to be lost. He desires all to come to
    repentance.
  - 2 Peter 3:9 – “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
    count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
    should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”
- **Linked to Truth:**
  - We cannot be saved in willful ignorance.
  - Salvation requires embracing the truth as it is in Jesus, for sin is a lie.

---

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Agency of Sanctification

- **Question:** After receiving a knowledge of the truth, what must one do to be
  sanctified?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:13 – “But we are bound to give thanks alway to
  God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
  chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
  truth.”

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Two Essential Elements

- **1. Sanctification of the Spirit:**
  - The Spirit convinces of sin and righteousness (John 16:8) and empowers the
    will.
- **2. Belief of the Truth:**
  - This is a “faith that works by love.”
  - Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
    thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”
- **Application: Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We are chosen not by merit, but through the Spirit’s work and faith in
    Christ.
  - The Spirit imparts Christ's righteousness, making truth a living reality.

---

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Goal of Election

- **Question:** And what is necessary besides believing it?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:2 – “Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the
  Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of
  the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.”

---

## Slide 10 – Q4: Faith and Obedience

- **The Fruit of Faith:**
  - Faith is the root; obedience is the fruit.
  - Faith without works is dead.
  - James 2:20 – “But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
    dead?”
- **The Power to Obey:**
  - Obedience is not legalism; it is the result of the Spirit writing the law on
    the heart.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
    Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
    and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall
    be to me a people.”

---

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Blueprint and the Building**
  - A blueprint is necessary to build a house, but holding the blueprint does
    not build the walls.
  - You must follow the blueprint to construct the building.
  - **Lesson:** Knowing Bible truth is the blueprint for a holy life, but
    "obedience" is the actual building of that life through the power of the
    Spirit.

---

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Effect of Obedience

- **Question:** What effect does obedience to the truth have?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:22 – “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying
  the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye
  love one another with a pure heart fervently.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q5: Purification and the Sanctuary

- **Practical Purity:**
  - Obeying the truth through the Spirit washes away the defilement of sin.
  - 1 John 1:7 – “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
    fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth
    us from all sin.”
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Just as the earthly sanctuary was cleansed on the Day of Atonement, our
    "soul temples" must be cleansed.
  - We must be purified of the love and practice of sin before Christ returns.

---

## Slide 14 – Q6: Acceptable Worship

- **Question:** How must worship be rendered to God, that it may be acceptable?
- **Key Text:** John 4:24 – “God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must
  worship him in spirit and in truth.”

---

## Slide 15 – Q6: Spirit and Truth

- **In Spirit:**
  - Worship must spring from a renewed heart, sincere and alive.
  - Avoids cold formalism.
- **In Truth:**
  - Worship must align with God's revealed will in Scripture.
  - Zeal without knowledge is dangerous (Romans 10:2 – “For I bear them record
    that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.”).
- **Balance:**
  - We cannot worship "in truth" while violating Commandments (like the
    Sabbath).
  - We cannot worship "in spirit" while harboring pride or sin.

---

## Slide 16 – Q7: The Value of Truth

- **Question:** How should the truth ever be cherished?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 23:23 – “Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom,
  and instruction, and understanding.”

---

## Slide 17 – Q7: Buying and Selling

- **Buying the Truth:**
  - We "pay" by sacrificing pride, opinions, and popularity.
  - We count all things loss for Christ.
  - Philippians 3:8 – “Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
    excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord...”
- **Selling It Not:**
  - Never compromise truth for gain, status, or peace.
  - To "sell" truth is to abandon conscience for temporary advantage.

---

## Slide 18 – Q7: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Cure for the Disease**
  - Imagine a man finding a rare herb that cures a deadly disease.
  - He travels far and climbs mountains to get it ("buys it").
  - Once obtained, no amount of money would tempt him to trade it away ("sell
    it").
  - **Lesson:** Without it, he dies. The truth is the cure for the soul; it is
    too valuable to sell.

---

## Slide 19 – Q8: Present Truth Defined

- **Question:** Is there in the Bible what may be called "present truth"?
- **Key Text:** 2 Peter 1:12 – “Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you
  always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established
  in the present truth.”

---

## Slide 20 – Q8: Timeliness and Testing

- **Timeliness:**
  - "Present Truth" is God’s specific message for a specific generation.
  - God sends warnings adapted to the crises of the age.
- **Testing Truths:**
  - Accepting general truths of the past is easy.
  - The test of faith is accepting the truth that requires action _now_.
  - It prepares God's people for the next event in salvation history.

---

## Slide 21 – Q9: Noah’s Present Truth

- **Question:** What was the special message to be proclaimed in Noah's day?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 6:13, 14 – “And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh
  is come before me... Make thee an ark of gopher wood...”

---

## Slide 22 – Q9: The Message of the Ark

- **Warning and Provision:**
  - Warning: Judgment (The Flood).
  - Provision: Escape (The Ark).
- **Specific Belief Required:**
  - Believing in God generally was not enough.
  - They had to believe the specific warning and enter the Ark to be saved.

---

## Slide 23 – Q10: Faith in Action

- **Question:** Did Noah build the ark? and why?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 11:7 – “By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not
  seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by
  the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which
  is by faith.”

---

## Slide 24 – Q10: Righteousness by Faith

- **Heir of Righteousness:**
  - Noah’s boat-building was not legalism; it was faith in action.
  - He is called an "heir of righteousness which is by faith."
- **Faith Works:**
  - Had Noah claimed faith but refused to build, he would have drowned.
  - True faith always produces action corresponding to the message.

---

## Slide 25 – Q11: The Remnant

- **Question:** How many were saved in the ark?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 3:20 – “The long-suffering of God waited in the days of
  Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were
  saved by water.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q11: The Minority Report

- **The Lesson:**
  - Only eight people were saved.
  - The majority is often wrong regarding present truth.
- **The Little Flock:**
  - We cannot judge truth by popularity.
  - Luke 12:32 – “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
    to give you the kingdom.”

---

## Slide 27 – Q12: Jonah’s Message

- **Question:** What special message was given to Jonah for the people of
  Nineveh?
- **Key Text:** Jonah 3:4 – “And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's
  journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
  overthrown.”
- **The Point:**
  - A time-bound warning calling for immediate repentance.

---

## Slide 28 – Q13: Averted Judgment

- **Question:** What saved the people from the predicted overthrow?
- **Key Text:** Jonah 3:5, 10 – “So the people of Nineveh believed God... And
  God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of
  the evil, that He had said He would do unto them; and He did it not.”

---

## Slide 29 – Q13: Belief and Action

- **Two Saving Factors:**
  1.  **Belief:** They "believed God."
  2.  **Action:** They "turned from their evil way."
- **Mercy Over Judgment:**
  - Acceptance of the "present truth" (the warning) produced a change in
    behavior.
  - God desires mercy; His threats are conditional on our response.

---

## Slide 30 – Q14: John the Baptist’s Mission

- **Question:** What was the special mission of John the Baptist?
- **Key Text:** John 1:6-7 – “There was a man sent from God, whose name was
  John. The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men
  through him might believe.”
- **The Point:**
  - To identify the Messiah and prepare hearts to receive Him.

---

## Slide 31 – Q15: Preparing the Way

- **Question:** What answer did he return to those who asked him about his
  mission?
- **Key Text:** John 1:23 – “He said, I am the voice of one crying in the
  wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.”

---

## Slide 32 – Q15: Straightening the Path

- **Fulfillment of Prophecy:**
  - John quoted Isaiah 40:3 to identify his work.
- **Preparation:**
  - "Making straight the way" meant calling people to repentance.
  - Present truth is always a preparing message.
  - John prepared for the First Advent; we must prepare for the Second.

---

## Slide 33 – Q16: Rejecting the Messenger

- **Question:** John's baptism was something new and startling to his
  generation. What did those do for themselves who rejected his doctrine?
- **Key Text:** Luke 7:30 – “But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel
  of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.”

---

## Slide 34 – Q16: The Cost of Rejection

- **Rejecting Counsel:**
  - By rejecting God's messenger (John) and his message (baptism), they rejected
    God's counsel.
- **Blindness:**
  - Rejecting the _forerunner_ left them unprepared for the _King_.
  - Turning away from present truth blinds spiritual eyesight to greater truths.

---

## Slide 35 – Q17: Justifying God

- **Question:** And what did those do who were baptized of John?
- **Key Text:** Luke 7:29 – “And all the people that heard him, and the
  publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.”
- **Meaning:**
  - They declared God was right and they were wrong (repentance).
  - They submitted to the requirements of the gospel.

---

## Slide 36 – Q18: The Tragedy of Rejection

- **Question:** Did the reputed people of God receive Christ when He came?
- **Key Text:** John 1:11 – “He came unto his own, and his own received him
  not.”
- **The Lesson:**
  - Membership in the visible church is no guarantee of salvation.
  - Those holding the prophecies failed to recognize the fulfillment.

---

## Slide 37 – Q19: Past Truth vs. Present Truth

- **Question:** What reason did they give for not doing so?
- **Key Text:** John 9:29 – “We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this
  fellow, we know not from whence he is.”

---

## Slide 38 – Q19: The Trap of Tradition

- **The Excuse:**
  - They used _past_ truth (Moses) to reject _present_ truth (Jesus).
- **Satan's Strategy:**
  - Use established tradition and the memory of past leaders to prevent
    advancement in light.
  - God is always leading His people forward.

---

## Slide 39 – Q20: Self-Deception

- **Question:** What did the people say when Christ referred to how their
  fathers slew the prophets?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 23:30 – “And say, If we had been in the days of our
  fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
  prophets.”
- **The Lesson:**
  - It is easy to honor dead prophets who do not rebuke our current sins.
  - It is much harder to accept the living message God sends _now_.

---

## Slide 40 – Q21: The Result of Blindness

- **Question:** What was the result of the Jews' not accepting Christ?
- **Key Text:** Luke 19:41-42 – “...If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in
  this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid
  from thine eyes.”

---

## Slide 41 – Q21: Missing the Day of Visitation

- **"This Thy Day":**
  - They had a specific "present truth" moment.
  - Because they let it pass, truth became "hid from their eyes."
- **Judgment:**
  - Rejection led to the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70).
  - This is a type of the final destruction at the end of the world.

---

## Slide 42 – Q22: The Message for Today

- **Question:** Is there to be a special message and work for the last
  generation?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:44-45 – “Therefore be ye also ready... Who then is a
  faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household,
  to give them meat in due season?”

---

## Slide 43 – Q22: Meat in Due Season

- **Last Days Message:**
  - Just as with Noah and John, God has a message for the time just before
    Christ returns.
- **Spiritual Food:**
  - "Meat in due season" is the specific doctrine needed to prepare a people for
    the Second Coming.

---

## Slide 44 – Q23: The Faithful Servant

- **Question:** What is pronounced upon those who are found doing such work?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 24:46 – “Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he
  cometh shall find so doing.”
- **The Calling:**
  - A special blessing rests on those awake, watching, and spreading the
    warning.

---

## Slide 45 – Q24: The Third Angel’s Message

- **Question:** What will be the burden of that proclamation?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are
  they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

---

## Slide 46 – Q24: Three Distinct Characteristics

- **1. Patience:**
  - Enduring faith amidst persecution and delay.
- **2. Keep the Commandments of God:**
  - A restoration of obedience to all ten commandments (including the Sabbath).
- **3. The Faith of Jesus:**
  - Not just faith _in_ Him, but the quality of faith _of_ Jesus.
  - This is **Righteousness by Faith**—trusting His power to keep the law in us.

---

## Slide 47 – Q24: Application – The Sanctuary

- **The Heavenly Ark:**
  - Revelation 11:19 opens the temple in heaven, revealing the Ark of His
    Testament.
- **Final Atonement:**
  - The final message directs the world to the Most Holy Place.
  - We look to the interceding High Priest and the Law He writes on our hearts.

---

## Slide 48 – Q25: Urgent Proclamation

- **Question:** How earnestly is this work to be prosecuted?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:23 – “And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into
  the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in; that my house may be
  filled.”

---

## Slide 49 – Q25: The Final Call

- **"Compel Them":**
  - Not force, but the compelling power of love, logic, and the Word.
  - implies intense earnestness because the time is short.
- **Global Mission:**
  - God is holding back the winds of strife until the message goes to every
    nation (Revelation 14:6).

---

## Slide 50 – Q25: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Breaking Dam**
  - If a dam is about to break and flood a town, you do not whisper the warning.
  - You run, shout, knock on doors, and "compel" people to flee to high ground.
  - **Lesson:** This is the spirit of the present truth message for this
    generation. We must warn the world before the end comes.
