# Bible Study: The Importance of Obedience

## Introduction

Obedience to God's word is not merely a matter of outward compliance—it is the very language of love and faith. Throughout Scripture, God reveals that He values sincere, heart-deep obedience above all religious ceremony, and that partial obedience is, in His sight, no obedience at all. This study examines why obedience matters so profoundly, what happens when we compromise God's clear commands, and how we may become genuine "doers of the word" through Christ's enabling power.

## Core Truths

### Obedience Surpasses Sacrifice

> _"Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams."_ (1 Samuel 15:22)

This declaration came from the lips of the prophet Samuel to King Saul, who had just offered what he thought was a noble sacrifice—but with animals he had been commanded to destroy. God's response cuts to the heart of true religion:

- **Religious ritual without obedience is worthless.** Saul multiplied sacrifices while violating the plain command of God. Heaven was not impressed.
- **Obedience is the highest form of worship.** It acknowledges God's authority, wisdom, and love. Sacrifice can be self-serving; obedience is self-surrendering.
- **Listening ("hearkening") is inseparable from doing.** True hearing leads to action (James 1:22).

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "obey" in this passage is _shama_, which means both "to hear" and "to obey." In the biblical mind, hearing God's voice without obeying it was inconceivable—the two were one act.

### The Gravity of Rebellion and Stubbornness

> _"For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry."_ (1 Samuel 15:23)

God equates disobedience with two of the gravest sins known in Israel:

- **Rebellion = Witchcraft.** Witchcraft sought to manipulate spiritual forces outside of God's will. Rebellion does the same—it places self-will above God's revealed will, seeking to control outcomes on our own terms.
- **Stubbornness = Idolatry.** The stubborn heart has enthroned self as god. It worships its own opinions, preferences, and comforts above the word of the Lord.

[Q] **"Isn't this comparison too harsh? Saul was just trying to offer a better sacrifice."**

The severity of God's response reveals a principle often missed: _the spirit behind disobedience is the same spirit that drives occultism and idolatry_—independence from God. Saul's outward act appeared religious, even commendable. But his heart was trusting his own judgment over God's explicit command. This is the essence of sin (Isaiah 53:6). God looks upon the heart (1 Samuel 16:7), and He saw in Saul's "sacrifice" the seeds of witchcraft and idolatry—self-will masquerading as worship.

### The Danger of Excuses

> _"I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice."_ (1 Samuel 15:24)

Saul's excuse is tragically common:

- **"I feared the people."** The fear of man became greater than the fear of God.
- **"I obeyed their voice."** He exchanged obedience to God for obedience to public opinion.

[ILL] Consider a soldier who disobeys his commander's orders because his comrades wanted a different plan. When he stands before the court-martial, will his excuse—"I feared my friends and obeyed their voice"—be accepted? How much less shall such excuses stand before the Judge of all the earth!

The Bible warns: _"The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe."_ (Proverbs 29:25)

## Deeper Truths

### God's Word Must Not Be Altered

> _"Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you."_ (Deuteronomy 4:2)

This command, given at the threshold of the Promised Land, establishes a principle for all time:

- **Adding to God's word** substitutes human tradition for divine authority.
- **Diminishing from God's word** removes what God considers essential.
- **Both are forbidden** because both distort the character and will of God.

[DYK🔎] This same warning bookends Scripture. In the last chapter of the Bible, Jesus declares: _"If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life."_ (Revelation 22:18–19)

### The Man of God and the Lying Prophet

One of the most sobering narratives on obedience appears in 1 Kings 13. A nameless prophet from Judah was sent to Bethel with a direct, personal command from God:

> _"For so was it charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest."_ (1 Kings 13:9)

The prophet faithfully refused King Jeroboam's invitation (v. 7–8). But then came a subtler test:

> _"He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him."_ (1 Kings 13:18)

The man of God yielded. He believed a man's word over the word God had given him directly. The result was swift and fatal: a lion slew him on the road, and his body never came to the tomb of his fathers (1 Kings 13:21–24).

**Lessons from this tragedy:**

1. **No subsequent "revelation" can contradict God's prior command.** God does not contradict Himself. If a message contradicts what God has clearly spoken, it is not from God—regardless of the messenger's credentials (Galatians 1:8; Isaiah 8:20).

2. **Personal accountability cannot be transferred.** The man of God could not blame the old prophet at the judgment. He knew what God had said to _him_.

3. **Familiarity and religious position do not guarantee truth.** The deceiver was an old prophet—experienced, respected, perhaps even well-meaning. But his word was a lie.

4. **Obedience must be to God's word, not to human opinion about God's word.**

[Q] **"But how can we know which voice to trust when spiritual authorities disagree?"**

This is why personal knowledge of Scripture is essential. The Bereans were "more noble" because they _"searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so"_ (Acts 17:11). Every claim—even from prophets, pastors, or angels—must be tested by the written word of God. _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."_ (Isaiah 8:20)

### Nadab and Abihu: Strange Fire

> _"And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them."_ (Leviticus 10:1–2)

The priests were to take fire only from the altar of burnt offering—fire kindled by God Himself (Leviticus 9:24; 16:12). Nadab and Abihu substituted common fire, perhaps thinking it made no difference.

**Why did this matter so much?**

- **The sanctuary was a model of heavenly realities.** Every element pointed to Christ and the plan of salvation. To alter the pattern was to distort the gospel itself.
- **The fire from the altar represented God's acceptance of the sacrifice**—ultimately, Christ's atoning death. To bring "strange fire" was to suggest that man could approach God on his own terms, apart from the divinely appointed way.
- **The severity of the judgment was proportional to the privilege of the priests.** They had witnessed God's glory; their light was great, and so was their responsibility (Luke 12:48).

[DYK🔎] Jewish tradition suggests that Nadab and Abihu may have been under the influence of wine, which would explain why God immediately afterward commanded priests not to drink wine when entering the tabernacle (Leviticus 10:8–9). Intoxicants dull the conscience and make disobedience seem reasonable.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Heart of the Conflict

The Great Controversy between Christ and Satan is, at its core, a controversy over _authority_—whose word shall govern the universe. Satan rebelled because he desired to exalt his will above God's (Isaiah 14:13–14). He tempted Eve by casting doubt on God's word: _"Yea, hath God said?"_ (Genesis 3:1).

Every act of disobedience echoes that original rebellion. Every act of obedience is a vote for God's government, a declaration that His wisdom is trustworthy and His love is safe.

- **Obedience is the test of loyalty in the Great Controversy.**
- **Partial obedience sides with the enemy,** for it says, "God, I will follow You—but only so far."
- **Obedience from the heart, enabled by Christ, is the fruit of genuine faith.**

### Sanctuary Connections

The sanctuary services teach us that God has appointed _one way_ of approach to Himself—through the sacrifice and ministry of Christ:

- **Outer Court (Altar of Burnt Offering):** We come only through the blood of the Lamb. No "strange sacrifice" will do.
- **Holy Place (Golden Altar of Incense):** Our prayers ascend through Christ's mediation. We cannot bring "strange fire"—human merit, self-righteousness, or invented worship.
- **Most Holy Place:** In the final judgment, Christ examines whether His people have truly allowed His law to be written in their hearts (Hebrews 10:16). Obedience is not the _ground_ of salvation, but it is the _evidence_ of genuine faith.

The sanctuary teaches that obedience is not an arbitrary test—it is the natural response to redemption. Those who truly understand what Christ has done _want_ to obey, for love constrains them (2 Corinthians 5:14).

### Righteousness by Faith and Obedience

[Q] **"If we are saved by grace through faith, why does obedience matter so much?"**

This is the question Paul anticipated: _"Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid."_ (Romans 6:1–2)

Righteousness by faith does not make obedience optional—it makes obedience _possible_. Before conversion, the carnal mind _"is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be"_ (Romans 8:7). But when Christ dwells in the heart by faith:

- **His righteousness is imputed** (credited to our account—justification).
- **His righteousness is imparted** (worked out in our lives—sanctification).
- **His law is written in our hearts** (Hebrews 8:10).
- **We are enabled to "keep the commandments of God" by His indwelling power** (Revelation 14:12; Philippians 2:13).

Obedience is not earning salvation; it is the _fruit_ of salvation. A tree does not produce fruit in order to become a tree; it produces fruit because it _is_ a tree. So the believer obeys, not to become righteous, but because Christ's righteousness is being formed within.

[ILL] A drowning man is rescued by a lifeguard and brought safely to shore. Once on land, he does not pay for his rescue—it was free. But his gratitude moves him to live differently: he learns to swim, he warns others of the danger, he honors the one who saved him. So it is with the saved sinner. We obey, not to earn life, but because Christ has given it freely—and love compels us to follow Him.

## Practical Application

### Examine Yourself

- **Is there any command of God I am knowingly neglecting?** Saul kept most of the command—but partial obedience was counted as rebellion.
- **Am I following human voices over God's plain word?** The man of God fell because he believed a man rather than the direct command he had received.
- **Am I offering "strange fire"—substituting human invention for God's appointed way?**

### Test All Things by Scripture

- _"Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:21)
- _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."_ (Isaiah 8:20)

No tradition, no teacher, no experience can override the plain word of God. The Bereans are our model.

### Build on the Rock

> _"Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock."_ (Matthew 7:24)

Christ draws a sharp distinction:

- **The wise man hears and obeys.** His house stands through every storm.
- **The foolish man hears but does not obey.** His house falls, and great is the fall.

The difference is not in _hearing_—both heard. The difference is in _doing_. _"Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."_ (James 1:22)

### The Fourth Commandment as a Test

As the original note in this study suggests, the Sabbath commandment stands as a particular test of obedience in these last days. The precept is plain: _"The seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God."_ (Exodus 20:10)

Millions have heard this command but have followed tradition instead of Scripture. Yet in the judgment, how shall any excuse stand when the word reads so clearly? God does not say one thing and mean another.

[Q] **"But surely God understands—so many sincere Christians keep Sunday."**

Sincerity is precious, but it cannot turn error into truth. Saul was sincere; Nadab and Abihu were sincere; the man of God was sincere when he believed the old prophet. God is merciful to those who walk in all the light they have—but when greater light comes, greater accountability follows (John 9:41; Acts 17:30). Those who see the truth of the Sabbath and refuse to obey will not be guiltless.

## Appeal

> _"Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven."_ (Matthew 7:21)

Dear reader, it is not enough to call Jesus "Lord" with the lips while the life contradicts His word. Heaven is looking for doers of the word—not in their own strength, but through the power of Christ who works in them _"both to will and to do of His good pleasure"_ (Philippians 2:13).

The great controversy will soon close. Every soul will have decided whose voice to obey—God's or the world's. May we be among those who, by faith, receive the enabling grace of Christ and keep the commandments of God from a heart transformed by love.

_"If ye love Me, keep My commandments."_ (John 14:15)

Will you, today, surrender every known disobedience to Jesus Christ? Will you ask Him for the power to obey—not in legalistic fear, but in loving trust? He who calls you is faithful, and He will do it (1 Thessalonians 5:24).
