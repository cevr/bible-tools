# Reading 169: Promises for the Children

## Introduction

God's heart tenderly embraces the young. Throughout Scripture, He extends
specific promises to children who honor their parents and seek His wisdom. These
promises reveal that the kingdom of heaven is not reserved for adults
alone—children may come to Jesus now, receive His blessing, and walk the path
that leads to eternal life.

## Core Truths

### The First Commandment with Promise

Among the Ten Commandments, one stands unique—it carries an explicit promise
attached to its faithful observance:

> _"Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land
> which the Lord thy God giveth thee."_ (Exodus 20:12)

Paul, writing to the Ephesian believers, highlights this distinction:

> _"Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise."_
> (Ephesians 6:2)

**Honour**: To give weight, respect, and value to someone—treating parents as
worthy of esteem and obedience (Exodus 20:12).

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "honour" (_kabed_) comes from a root meaning "to be
heavy" or "weighty." To honor parents means to treat them as having weight and
significance in our lives—the opposite of treating them lightly or dismissively.

This commandment bridges the first four commandments (our duty to God) and the
last five (our duty to fellow humans). The family is God's first institution,
and how children relate to parents often reflects how they will relate to their
heavenly Father.

### The Promise of Divine Teaching

God does not merely give children commands—He offers Himself as their Teacher:

> _"Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord."_
> (Psalm 34:11)

Here is a beautiful invitation. The Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth,
stoops down to instruct the young. He promises that if children will simply
_come_ and _listen_, He will personally teach them the most valuable knowledge
in the universe.

[Q] **"What exactly is 'the fear of the Lord'? Does God want children to be
afraid of Him?"**

Not at all! The fear of the Lord is not terror but reverent trust and
obedience—the kind of respect a loving child feels toward a good father:

> _"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have
> all they that do his commandments."_ (Psalm 111:10)

True wisdom begins when we recognize who God is and respond with humble
obedience. This "fear" produces not cowering but confidence, not anxiety but
assurance. It is the foundation upon which all genuine understanding is built.

## Deeper Truths

### The Value of a Wise Child

The world often measures worth by age, wealth, or position. God's economy
operates differently:

> _"Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no
> more be admonished."_ (Ecclesiastes 4:13)

[ILL] Consider two trees in an orchard. One is ancient, gnarled, and impressive
in size—but it has grown bitter and bears no fruit, refusing the gardener's
pruning. The other is young, slender, and seemingly insignificant—yet it bends
willingly to the gardener's hand and produces sweet fruit. Which tree has
greater value to the owner? So it is with hearts: a humble, teachable child
possesses more true wealth than a proud king who rejects correction.

**Admonished**: To be warned, corrected, or counseled—the willingness to receive
guidance from God and others (Ecclesiastes 4:13).

The foolish king's great sin is that he "will no more be admonished"—he has
closed his ears to counsel. But the wise child remains teachable, and this
quality makes even poverty no barrier to blessing.

### Christ's Special Love for Children

The Saviour Himself demonstrated heaven's regard for the young:

> _"Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is
> the kingdom of heaven."_ (Matthew 19:14)

When the disciples thought the Master too busy or important for children, Jesus
corrected them immediately. Children are not interruptions to His
work—welcoming them _is_ His work.

> _"And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them."_
> (Mark 10:16)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "blessed" here (_kateulogeo_) is an intensified form,
meaning He blessed them fervently, earnestly, and repeatedly. Jesus did not
offer the children a quick, formal blessing—He poured out heaven's benediction
upon them with deep affection.

Picture this scene: the Creator of the universe, with work-worn carpenter's
hands, lifting children into His arms. The One who spoke worlds into existence
now speaks words of blessing over the little ones. What dignity this confers
upon every child!

### Access to the Same Blessing Today

Children today need not feel that Christ's blessing was only for those who lived
in Palestine long ago. The same blessing is available now:

> _"And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall
> receive."_ (Matthew 21:22)

Jesus invites children—and all who come with childlike faith—to ask and receive.
The arms that held children in Galilee still reach out through prayer. The voice
that blessed them still speaks words of peace to believing hearts.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Path from Promise to Paradise

The promises to children form a beautiful progression—a pathway from earth to
heaven:

1. **Honour parents** → Long life and blessing in this world
2. **Hearken to God** → Divine wisdom and understanding
3. **Come to Jesus** → Personal blessing and belonging to His kingdom
4. **Ask in believing prayer** → Access to all heaven's resources
5. **Keep His commandments** → Entrance to eternal life

This culminates in the final promise:

> _"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the
> tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."_ (Revelation
> 22:14)

[Q] **"But can children really keep God's commandments? Aren't they too young to
understand such things?"**

God never asks us to do what He will not enable us to accomplish. The same Jesus
who blessed children offers His own strength to help them obey. This is not
about perfect performance in human strength—it is about trusting Jesus, who
promises to write His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). Even a child who trusts
Christ can, by His grace, walk in loving obedience.

### Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the priests ministered daily for all Israel—including
the children. The sacrificial system taught young and old alike that sin
separates us from God, but blood atones. Today, Jesus ministers in the heavenly
sanctuary as our High Priest, interceding for children as readily as for adults.
When a child prays, that prayer ascends to the throne of grace where Christ
presents it before the Father (Hebrews 4:14-16).

The tree of life, mentioned in Revelation 22:14, once stood in Eden's
sanctuary-garden. Sin barred humanity from its fruit. But through Christ's
atoning work—the true Lamb slain from the foundation of the world—access is
restored. The child who honors parents, fears God, and trusts in Jesus is
walking the path that leads back to Paradise.

## Practical Application

### For Children

**Begin each day with prayer.** Talk to Jesus as you would to your kindest
friend. Ask Him for wisdom, for help to obey your parents cheerfully, and for
power to do what is right.

**Honour your parents in practical ways:**

- Obey promptly and respectfully
- Speak kindly, even when correcting seems unfair
- Help without being asked
- Remember that honouring parents is honouring God

**Stay teachable.** The wise child receives correction gladly. When you are
admonished, listen carefully rather than making excuses. This humble attitude is
precious to God.

**Come to Jesus daily.** He is never too busy for you. He longs to take you in
His arms of love and bless you.

### For Parents and Teachers

Teach children that God has made specific promises _for them_. These are not
adult concepts scaled down—they are heaven's direct address to young hearts.
Help them memorize these promises as anchors for their faith.

Never forbid children from coming to Christ or suggest they must wait until they
are older to truly know Him. Jesus rebuked the disciples for this very attitude.

## Appeal

Dear young friend, God has not forgotten you. He has filled His Word with
promises addressed specifically to you. He invites you to come, to listen, to
learn, and to receive His blessing.

The same Jesus who took children in His arms in Judea reaches out to you today.
Will you come to Him? Will you honour your parents, fear the Lord, and trust
wholly in Christ? The path is clear—it leads through obedient faith to the tree
of life and the gates of the eternal city.

> _"Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the
> tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."_ (Revelation
> 22:14)

Heaven awaits those who begin the journey now. Young or old, the invitation
stands: Come unto Jesus. He will teach you, bless you, and keep you until that
glorious day when you enter through the gates into the city of God.
