# Reading 9: The Attributes of God

## Introduction

Who is God? What is He like? These questions have occupied the minds of philosophers and seekers throughout human history, yet the answer lies not in human speculation but in divine revelation. Scripture draws back the veil to show us a God whose character is perfect in holiness, boundless in mercy, and unchanging through all eternity. Most remarkably, these very attributes are shared fully by Jesus Christ—revealing the profound unity of the Godhead and giving us confidence that when we see Jesus, we see the Father (John 14:9).

## Core Truths

### The Holiness and Righteousness of God

In Christ's most intimate prayer before Gethsemane, He addressed His Father with two profound titles:

> _"Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me."_ (John 17:11)

> _"O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee."_ (John 17:25)

**Holiness** means God is utterly separate from sin—pure, set apart, morally perfect. **Righteousness** speaks of His character as always doing what is right, just, and true. These are not merely abstract qualities; they define the very essence of who God is.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "holy" (_qadosh_) appears over 600 times in the Old Testament. Its root meaning is "to cut" or "to separate"—indicating that God is completely distinct from all that is common, impure, or sinful.

### Christ Shares These Divine Attributes

The same holiness and righteousness belong to Christ:

> _"Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."_ (Acts 2:27)

> _"By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities."_ (Isaiah 53:11)

Peter, quoting David's prophecy, identified Jesus as "the Holy One" whose body would not see decay. Isaiah proclaimed Him as the "righteous servant" who would bear our sins. Here is a mystery of infinite love: the Holy One became sin for us (2 Corinthians 5:21), the Righteous One bore the penalty of the unrighteous (1 Peter 3:18).

## Deeper Truths

### The Goodness and Mercy of God

When Moses asked to see God's glory, the Lord revealed His character:

> _"The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth."_ (Exodus 34:6)

This is God's own self-description—not power, not wrath, but **mercy, grace, patience, goodness, and truth**. This is what God considers His glory.

> _"The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy."_ (Psalm 103:8)

> _"But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth."_ (Psalm 86:15)

[Q] **"If God is so merciful, why does He permit suffering and judgment?"**

God's mercy is not indifference to sin—it is patience that gives opportunity for repentance (2 Peter 3:9). His longsuffering delays judgment, giving every soul time to turn from destruction. Yet His righteousness requires that unrepented sin ultimately meet its consequence. Mercy and justice meet perfectly at the cross, where God "might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" (Romans 3:26).

### Christ: The Embodiment of God's Goodness

What was the nature of Christ's earthly ministry?

> _"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him."_ (Acts 10:38)

Christ's life was the visible demonstration of the Father's goodness. Every healing, every act of compassion, every word of hope declared: **this is what God is like**. The Father's heart beats with the same mercy Christ showed to the woman caught in adultery, the same compassion He extended to the leper, the same patience He gave to doubting Thomas.

[ILL] A child who has never met his father may have strange ideas about him—perhaps imagining him as harsh or distant. But when he finally meets him and finds kindness, patience, and love, all false pictures vanish. So it was with humanity. Satan had painted God as arbitrary and severe. But when Jesus came, doing good and healing all oppressed by the devil, the true character of the Father was revealed. "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (John 14:9).

### God's Faithfulness and Truth

> _"Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations."_ (Deuteronomy 7:9)

**Faithfulness** means God keeps His word—always. Every promise He makes, He fulfills. His covenant with His people stretches across "a thousand generations"—an expression of perpetuity.

And Christ declared:

> _"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."_ (John 14:6)

Christ did not merely speak truth; He **is** truth. In Him, every promise of God finds its "Yea" and "Amen" (2 Corinthians 1:20). He is the faithful and true witness (Revelation 3:14), the embodiment of all that is reliable and trustworthy.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "truth" (_emeth_) comes from the same root as "Amen"—meaning firm, established, reliable. When we say "Amen" at the end of a prayer, we are affirming that God is trustworthy to fulfill what has been asked.

### The Wisdom and Justice of God

> _"Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom."_ (Job 36:5)

God's wisdom is not mere knowledge but perfect understanding applied rightly in every situation. He sees the end from the beginning and works all things according to the counsel of His will (Ephesians 1:11).

Even as a child, Christ demonstrated this divine attribute:

> _"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him."_ (Luke 2:40)

And His justice is proclaimed in the most emphatic terms:

> _"He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he."_ (Deuteronomy 32:4)

**Perfect**—without flaw. **Just**—rendering to each their due. **Right**—always morally correct. These qualities assure us that the final judgment will be utterly fair, completely transparent, and infinitely wise.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Unchanging God

> _"Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end."_ (Psalm 102:25-27)

Creation itself will grow old and be changed. Stars will burn out; the heavens will be rolled together as a scroll (Isaiah 34:4). But God remains **the same**—His character never shifts, His promises never fail, His love never diminishes.

[DYK🔎] The book of Hebrews quotes this very passage and applies it directly to Christ (Hebrews 1:10-12), demonstrating that Jesus shares the Father's eternal, unchanging nature.

This immutability is our anchor in the great controversy between good and evil. Satan has charged that God's law is arbitrary and changeable, that His requirements are unjust. But the unchanging character of God proves that His law—which is a reflection of His character—is eternal, righteous, and good (Romans 7:12).

### The Mystery Beyond Our Finding

> _"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!"_ (Romans 11:33)

Can man ever fully comprehend God? Never. His wisdom is inexhaustible, His ways unfathomable. We will spend eternity learning more of His character, and still there will be infinite depths to explore.

[Q] **"If we cannot fully understand God, how can we trust Him?"**

We trust Him not because we comprehend all His ways, but because we have seen His character revealed in Christ. A child does not understand all his father's decisions, yet trusts him because he knows his father's heart. So with us—we have seen the Father's heart at Calvary. That is enough to trust Him with the things we cannot yet understand.

### The Sanctuary and God's Character

In the earthly sanctuary, God's attributes were continually displayed:

- **Holiness**: The Most Holy Place, where only the high priest could enter once a year, declared God's unapproachable purity
- **Mercy**: The mercy seat, where blood was sprinkled, showed that God provides a way of forgiveness
- **Justice**: The ark beneath the mercy seat contained the law—broken by sinners, yet covered by atoning blood
- **Faithfulness**: The continual services, morning and evening, demonstrated God's unceasing provision for His people

In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ now ministers these same attributes. His righteousness covers our guilt; His holiness purifies our characters; His mercy intercedes for our weaknesses; His faithfulness sustains us until the work is complete.

## Practical Application

### How Should These Truths Change Us?

1. **Confidence in Prayer**: We approach a holy God, yet one who is merciful, gracious, and longsuffering. We need not fear rejection, for Christ has opened the way (Hebrews 4:16).

2. **Trust in Trials**: God's faithfulness extends to a thousand generations. Whatever promise He has made to you, He will keep. "He is faithful that promised" (Hebrews 10:23).

3. **Surrender in Judgment**: His justice is perfect; His ways are right. We can trust His decisions even when we do not understand them. The same God who showed mercy at Calvary will show mercy at the judgment seat.

4. **Transformation of Character**: Beholding these attributes, we are changed into the same image (2 Corinthians 3:18). As we contemplate His holiness, we become holy. As we receive His mercy, we become merciful. As we rest in His faithfulness, we become faithful.

[ILL] Consider how a bride prepares for her wedding day. She studies every detail of her beloved—his preferences, his character, his ways—that she might be suited to him. So the church, the bride of Christ, is to study the character of her Lord, that she might reflect His image and be ready when He comes. "Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure" (1 John 3:3).

## Appeal

> _"O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!"_ (Romans 11:33)

We cannot search out God to perfection—but we can know Him in Christ. And knowing Him is eternal life (John 17:3).

Will you surrender today to this holy, righteous, merciful, faithful, wise, and just God? He invites you not to understand all His ways, but to trust His heart. The same attributes that seem too lofty to reach have come down to us in Jesus. In Christ, holiness bends low to lift the sinner. In Christ, justice and mercy embrace at the cross. In Christ, the unsearchable God makes Himself known.

"Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee" (Job 22:21).
