# Reading 157: The Danger of Covetousness

## Introduction

Covetousness is a sin that masquerades as prudence, disguises itself as ambition, and hides behind the mask of "common sense." Yet Scripture unmasks it as nothing less than idolatry—a rival god that demands our devotion while promising security it can never deliver. In this study, we will examine why this seemingly respectable sin poses such grave danger to the soul, and discover how the spirit of sacrifice frees us from its grip.

## Core Truths

### What Is Covetousness?

**Covetousness** is an inordinate, excessive desire to obtain and possess—a grasping after things that consumes the heart and displaces God from His rightful throne.

Jesus warned plainly:

> _"Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."_ (Luke 12:15)

Notice the double caution: "take heed" and "beware." Christ speaks as one warning of a concealed danger—a trap that catches the unwary. The covetous person may appear successful, even blessed, while inwardly their soul starves.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "covetousness" (_pleonexia_) literally means "a desire to have more"—not merely more than one needs, but more than others have. It is essentially competitive greed, a restless craving that can never be satisfied.

### The Parable of the Rich Fool

Christ illustrated this danger through a prosperous farmer whose barns overflowed:

> _"And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry."_ (Luke 12:18, 19)

Count the personal pronouns: "I... my... I... my... my... I... my... my." This man's universe had shrunk to a population of one. His harvest was not seen as a trust from God but as personal achievement for personal enjoyment.

God's verdict was swift and devastating:

> _"Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?"_ (Luke 12:20)

The application reaches across the centuries:

> _"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."_ (Luke 12:21)

[ILL] Consider a child who receives a gift from a loving parent, then runs to his room, locks the door, and refuses to share with his siblings or even thank the giver. We would call such behavior ungrateful and selfish. Yet how often do we treat God's blessings precisely this way—hoarding what He has given, forgetting the Giver, and ignoring those in need around us?

## Deeper Truths

### Covetousness Is Idolatry

Paul makes a startling declaration:

> _"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry."_ (Colossians 3:5)

This is not mere rhetoric. Covetousness is idolatry because it places something other than God at the center of our trust, our hope, and our affection. The covetous heart says, "If I have enough money, enough possessions, enough security—then I will be safe, then I will be happy." This is precisely what the pagan says of his idol.

[Q] **"But isn't it wise to save and plan for the future? Doesn't Scripture commend the ant for storing provisions?"**

Indeed, Scripture does commend prudent stewardship (Proverbs 6:6-8). The difference lies in the heart. Prudence trusts God while wisely managing His resources; covetousness trusts wealth while giving God lip service. Prudence holds possessions with an open hand, ready to give; covetousness clutches them with a closed fist, anxious to keep. The rich fool's sin was not his prosperity but his self-centered hoarding: "I will bestow all my fruits" with no thought of God, neighbor, or eternity.

### The Wages of Covetousness

Scripture warns of the dire consequences:

> _"For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience."_ (Colossians 3:6)

> _"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."_ (1 Timothy 6:9)

The desire for riches is pictured as a trap that ensnares, a weight that drowns. How many promising lives have been shipwrecked on this hidden reef!

[DYK🔎] The word "perdition" (_apoleia_) means utter destruction or ruin. Paul uses the same word to describe the fate of the "son of perdition" (2 Thessalonians 2:3). Covetousness does not merely harm—it destroys.

### Judas: A Solemn Warning

No example is more tragic than Judas Iscariot:

> _"And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray Him unto them. And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money."_ (Mark 14:10, 11)

Here was a man who walked with Christ, witnessed His miracles, heard His teaching—yet sold his Lord for thirty pieces of silver. Covetousness, cherished in the heart, will eventually betray even the most sacred trust.

[Q] **"How could someone so close to Jesus fall so far?"**

Judas' fall did not happen suddenly. He had been pilfering from the treasury for months (John 12:6). Each small compromise hardened his heart until he could commit the ultimate betrayal. This is the insidious nature of covetousness: it grows by what it feeds upon, each indulgence making the next easier, until the conscience is seared and the soul is lost.

### God's Attitude Toward Covetousness

Scripture is unambiguous:

> _"For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth."_ (Psalm 10:3)

The world applauds the acquisitive, celebrates the wealthy, honors those who "make it." But God sees what man cannot see—the shriveled soul behind the prosperous exterior—and He abhors it. This is why covetous persons are disqualified from spiritual leadership:

> _"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness."_ (Exodus 18:21)

A leader who loves money will eventually serve money. And no man can serve two masters (Matthew 6:24).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Root of Rebellion

Covetousness lies at the very heart of the great controversy between Christ and Satan. What was Lucifer's original sin but coveting God's position?

> _"For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the most High."_ (Isaiah 14:13, 14)

And what was the serpent's temptation to Eve?

> _"Ye shall be as gods."_ (Genesis 3:5)

The desire to have more, to be more, to exalt self above God's appointed station—this is the essence of sin. Every act of covetousness is a participation in Satan's rebellion, a grasping after what God has not given, a distrust of His wisdom and love.

### Stewardship Versus Ownership

The antidote to covetousness is recognizing the truth about ownership:

> _"The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith the Lord of hosts."_ (Haggai 2:8)

We are not owners but stewards—managers of Another's property. The wealthy man does not possess more; he merely has more to account for. Jesus taught:

> _"Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."_ (Luke 16:9)

[DYK🔎] "Mammon" is an Aramaic word meaning wealth or riches, often personified as a false god. Jesus speaks of "unrighteous mammon" because wealth in this fallen world is tainted by sin—gained unfairly, distributed unjustly. The Christian's task is to convert this earthly resource into heavenly currency by using it for God's glory and the blessing of others.

### The Sanctuary and Self-Surrender

In the earthly sanctuary, the offerings brought to God represented the worshiper's acknowledgment that all belonged to the Lord. The firstfruits, the tithes, the freewill offerings—each was a confession: "I am not my own. All I have comes from Thee and returns to Thee."

At the brazen altar in the outer court, the sacrifice was wholly consumed. Nothing was held back. This points to Christ, who "gave Himself for us" (Galatians 2:20), and to our own experience of complete surrender.

In Christ's heavenly ministry, He intercedes for us as we struggle against sin, including the sin of covetousness. The same Christ who overturned the money-changers' tables in the earthly temple (John 2:15) desires to cleanse our hearts of every idol. He invites us into the Most Holy Place experience—a thorough examination of the heart, a removal of every cherished sin, a preparation for the final sealing of God's people.

## A Last-Day Warning

Paul specifically warned that covetousness would characterize the last days:

> _"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud."_ (2 Timothy 3:1, 2)

James gives a vivid picture:

> _"Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days."_ (James 5:3)

[ILL] Rust does not form overnight. It requires neglect, exposure to corrosive elements, and the passage of time. So it is with hoarded wealth: what seems like security slowly corrodes the soul. And in the final judgment, that very rust will testify against those who trusted in treasure rather than in the living God.

We live in an age of unprecedented materialism. Never before have so many possessed so much while still craving more. The advertising industry spends billions to create dissatisfaction, to convince us that happiness lies in the next purchase. Against this relentless pressure, Christ's words ring with urgent relevance: "Take heed, and beware."

## Practical Application

### The Cure: Generosity

The opposite of covetousness is not poverty but generosity. Paul instructs:

> _"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate."_ (1 Timothy 6:17, 18)

Notice the balance: God "giveth us richly all things to enjoy"—blessings are meant to be received with thanksgiving. But they are also meant to flow through us to others. The covetous heart dams the stream; the generous heart channels it to thirsty souls.

> _"It is more blessed to give than to receive."_ (Acts 20:35)

This is not mere sentiment but spiritual law. Giving breaks the power of possessions over us. Each act of generosity loosens covetousness's grip and strengthens faith in God's provision.

[Q] **"But I barely have enough for myself. How can I give?"**

The widow's two mites were "more than they all" in Christ's estimation (Luke 21:3). God measures giving not by the amount but by the sacrifice. Start where you are. The faithful steward of little becomes steward of much (Luke 16:10). And God has promised:

> _"My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus."_ (Philippians 4:19)

### Examining Our Hearts

Ask yourself:

- Do I think about money and possessions more than about God and His kingdom?
- Does the thought of giving bring joy or reluctance?
- Am I anxious about financial security, or do I trust my Father's care?
- Do I compare my possessions with others' and feel envious or superior?
- Would I be willing to give up anything God asked me to surrender?

### Victory Through Christ

If the Holy Spirit has convicted you of covetousness, know this: Christ has provided full deliverance. In His strength, every sin can be overcome—not by human effort but by His indwelling life.

> _"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."_ (Philippians 4:13)

Confess the sin specifically. Ask Christ to replace the love of money with love for Him. Commit to regular, sacrificial giving as a discipline of faith. And when temptation returns—as it will—flee to Christ in prayer and claim His victory.

## Appeal

> _"Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."_ (Psalm 50:5)

When Christ returns, He will gather to Himself a people characterized by sacrifice. These are they who have learned the joy of giving, who have discovered that "a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."

Heaven gave its choicest Treasure to redeem us:

> _"Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold... but with the precious blood of Christ."_ (1 Peter 1:18, 19)

Can we who have received such a gift cling to our possessions as though they were our own? Can we hoard what belongs to Another?

> _"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together."_ (Romans 8:17)

To be joint heirs with Christ means to share His spirit—the spirit that gave all for others, that held nothing back, that counted the salvation of sinners worth any sacrifice.

Friend, what holds your heart today? Is there some possession, some desire for wealth, some fear of want that stands between you and complete surrender to God? Bring it to Christ now. Let Him break the chains of covetousness and fill you with the freedom of holy generosity. In giving, you will discover that you cannot outgive God—and that the treasures laid up in heaven are infinitely richer than any earthly store.
