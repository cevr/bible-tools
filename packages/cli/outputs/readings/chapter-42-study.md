### Chapter 42: The Kingdoms of Grace and Glory

This study explores the two great phases of Christ’s kingdom: the **Kingdom of
Grace** (established in the hearts of believers now through the gospel) and the
**Kingdom of Glory** (to be established literally at the Second Coming).
Understanding the distinction between these two prevents confusion regarding
prophecy and highlights the importance of our present probationary time.

### Q1. Give the promise which our Saviour made to the "little flock."

> "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the
> kingdom." Luke 12:32.

**Answer:**

In this tender assurance, Jesus addresses His followers as a "little flock,"
acknowledging that true believers may often feel small in number or marginalized
by the world. Yet, He reveals the heart of the Father toward them.

- **The Nature of Salvation:** The kingdom is a gift ("give you"), not something
  earned by human merit. This creates the foundation for **Justification**
  (being declared righteous by God). We do not seize the kingdom; we receive it
  by faith.
- **The Father’s Attitude:** It is God’s "good pleasure." He is not reluctant to
  save; He delights in restoring His children.
- **The Security of the Believer:** The command "fear not" suggests that despite
  the trials of this life, the outcome is secure for those who remain in Christ.

**[ILL]** A wealthy king decides to adopt a street orphan. The orphan does not
need to pay the king or conquer the castle to become a prince. He simply needs
to accept the adoption papers. The kingdom becomes his because it is the king's
pleasure to give it, not because the orphan earned it.

### Q2. To what throne are we exhorted to come to find mercy?

> “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain
> mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." Heb. 4:16.

**Answer:**

The Apostle Paul directs our eyes to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ now
ministers.

- **The Throne of Grace:** This represents the **Kingdom of Grace**. It is the
  spiritual reign of God in the heart of the believer _now_. Because Jesus died
  as our sacrifice and lives as our High Priest, the throne of judgment has
  become a throne of favor for the penitent.
- **Mercy and Grace Defined:**
  - **Mercy:** Not receiving the punishment we deserve (forgiveness for past
    sins).
  - **Grace:** Receiving the power and favor we do not deserve (power to obey in
    the future).
- **Boldness:** We come boldly not because we are worthy, but because our High
  Priest (Jesus) is worthy.
- **"Time of Need":** This implies we still struggle with temptation. The "grace
  to help" is the power of **Sanctification**—the impartation of Christ's life
  to overcome sin (1 Corinthians 10:13).

**[ILL]** Imagine a courtroom where the judge is also your older brother who has
paid your fine. You do not approach the bench trembling with terror; you
approach with humble confidence, knowing the Judge desires your freedom, not
your condemnation.

---

### Q3. To what other kingdom do the Scriptures call our attention?

> “When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with
> Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory." Matt. 25:31.

**Answer:**

While the Throne of Grace is for the present time of probation, the Scriptures
point forward to the **Kingdom of Glory**.

- **A Future Event:** This kingdom is inaugurated at the Second Coming ("When
  the Son of man shall come").
- **A Visible Reality:** The Kingdom of Grace is invisible (in the heart); the
  Kingdom of Glory will be visible, literal, and universal (Revelation 1:7).
- **The Change of Throne:** Currently, Jesus sits on the Father's throne as
  Intercessor. In the future, He sits on "the throne of His glory" as King of
  Kings to execute judgment and reward the saints.

---

### Q4. By what are men saved from sin?

> ” For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is
> the gift of God." Eph. 2:8 (Rom. 6:23).

**Answer:**

This is the cornerstone of the Gospel and the entry point into the Kingdom of
Grace.

- **The Source:** Salvation is "by grace"—God's unmerited love and power.
- **The Instrument:** It is "through faith." Faith is not the _savior_; faith is
  merely the hand that grasps the gift of Christ.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot generate righteousness ourselves (Isaiah 64:6).
  - **Imputed Righteousness:** Christ's perfect past life covers our past sins
    (Justification).
  - **Imparted Righteousness:** Christ's present life is given to us for
    obedience (Sanctification).
- **The Gift:** Eternal life is a gift, whereas death is the "wages" or earnings
  of sin (Romans 6:23).

**[ILL]** If a man is drowning, he cannot save himself by swimming harder if he
is already going under. A lifeguard throws him a rope. The rope is the "grace."
Holding onto the rope is "faith." The man is saved by the rope, but he must hold
on. He cannot boast, "I saved myself by my strong grip"; he can only thank the
lifeguard.

### Q5. In the parable of the wheat and tares, what does the good seed represent?

> “The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but
> the tares are the children of the wicked one," Matt. 13:38.

**Answer:**

In the present age (the Kingdom of Grace), good and evil coexist.

- **Children of the Kingdom:** These are those who have the law of God written
  in their hearts (Hebrews 8:10). They are "born again" of the Spirit.
- **Character, Not Location:** The distinction is not merely being inside a
  church building, but having a transformed character. The "good seed" bears
  fruit—the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23).
- **Coexistence:** God allows the wheat and tares to grow together until the
  harvest (judgment), showing His patience, giving time for tares to potentially
  become wheat through the miracle of conversion.

---

### Q6. Who sows the tares?

> “The enemy that sowed them is the Devil." Matt. 13:39.

**Answer:**

- **The Origin of Evil:** God is not the author of sin or confusion. False
  doctrines and unrepentant characters ("tares") are the work of Satan.
- **The Counterfeit:** Tares (likely darnel) look exactly like wheat in the
  early stages. Only when the fruit (grain) matures is the difference obvious.
  Satan specializes in counterfeits that look like Christianity but lack the
  power of godliness (2 Timothy 3:5).
- **The Great Controversy:** The world is a battlefield where Satan actively
  works to sabotage God's harvest by planting error and hypocrisy among the
  truth.

---

### Q7. To whom did God entrust His kingdom?

> ” And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them
> have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
> the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
> creepeth upon the earth." Gen. 1:26.

**Answer:**

- **The First Dominion:** Originally, Adam was established as the ruler of this
  world, under God. The Kingdom of Glory was intended to be established in Eden.
- **The Image of God:** Man was made to reflect God’s character of love and
  justice. His dominion was to be a benevolent rule, not a tyranny.
- **Lost by Sin:** When Adam yielded to Satan, he surrendered this dominion.
  Satan became the "prince of this world" (John 12:31). The plan of salvation is
  the plan to restore this lost dominion (Micah 4:8).

---

### Q8. When Christ sent out His disciples, what did He tell them to preach?

> “And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick." Luke
> 9:2.

**Answer:**

- **The Dual Ministry:** Christ’s commission combined teaching (doctrine) and
  healing (practical medical missionary work). The Kingdom of God affects the
  whole person—body, mind, and spirit.
- **Restoration:** The preaching of the kingdom warns men of judgment and
  invites them to restoration. Healing the sick illustrated the power of the
  King to reverse the curse of sin.

---

### Q9. In carrying out their commission, what did they preach?

> ” And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and
> healing everywhere." Luke 9:6.

**Answer:**

- **The Kingdom is the Gospel:** To preach the "Kingdom of God" (v. 2) is to
  preach "the gospel" (v. 6).
- **Definition of Gospel:** The "Good News" that the King has come to deliver
  His people from the tyranny of sin and Satan (Romans 1:16).
- **The Kingdom of Grace:** By accepting the Gospel, believers enter the Kingdom
  of Grace now. They are translated from the power of darkness into the kingdom
  of His dear Son (Colossians 1:13).

---

### Q10. After the loss of the first kingdom, what promise did God make to Israel, if they would obey Him?

> “Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye
> shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all the earth is
> Mine. And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation." Ex.
> 19:5-6.

**Answer:**

- **A Conditional Covenant:** The promise was based on the condition: "If ye
  will obey." God cannot establish a kingdom of peace with rebellious subjects.
- **Kingdom of Priests:** Israel was meant to be God’s demonstration to the
  world. As priests, they were to teach the nations about the true God.
- **Peculiar Treasure:** God desired a people whose character was distinct from
  the heathen nations—a people who kept His law and reflected His holiness.

**[ILL]** A lighthouse is built to shine. If the lighthouse keeper covers the
light or lets it go out, the lighthouse fails its purpose. Israel was called to
be the world's lighthouse.

### Q11. After the children of Israel were settled in Canaan, what did they request of Samuel the prophet?

> “Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king
> to judge us like all the nations." 1 Sam. 8:5.

**Answer:**

- **Conformity to the World:** Their motivation was "to be like all the
  nations." This is the root of apostasy—God’s people desiring to imitate the
  methods and structures of the secular world.
- **Loss of Vision:** They looked at the failure of Samuel’s sons (human
  leadership) and sought a political solution (a king) rather than a spiritual
  solution (repentance and return to God).

---

### Q12. Upon taking the matter to God, what instruction did Samuel receive?

> “And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all
> that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have
> rejected Me, that I should not reign over them." 1 Sam. 8:7.

**Answer:**

- **The Real Rejection:** God identified the core issue: they were rejecting the
  **Theocracy** (God’s direct rule). They wanted a visible king rather than the
  invisible King of Glory.
- **God's Permissive Will:** God allowed them to have a king, though it was not
  His perfect will. He often allows us to experience the consequences of our own
  choices so we might learn the folly of trusting in man.

---

### Q13. Notwithstanding the perverseness of Israel, what did the lord promise to David their king?

> "Thy seed will I establish forever, and build up thy throne to all
> generations." Ps. 89:4.

**Answer:**

- **The Davidic Covenant:** Despite Israel’s failure, God made a covenant with
  David (the second king, a man after God’s own heart).
- **The Eternal Throne:** This promise looked beyond the earthly monarchy to the
  Messiah. God promised that the line of David would eventually produce a King
  who would reign forever—linking the earthly lineage to the heavenly plan.

---

### Q14. Through whom was the throne of David to be perpetuated?

> “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall
> be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The
> mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of
> His government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David."
> Isa. 9:6-7.

**Answer:**

- **The Messiah:** Isaiah identifies the "seed" as a divine-human person.
- **Divinity Revealed:** He is a child born (humanity) yet "The mighty God"
  (divinity).
- **Nature of His Government:** It is a government of "peace." This connects to
  the Kingdom of Grace (peace with God now) and the Kingdom of Glory (peace on
  earth later).

---

### Q15. Who is this seed of David, the heir to his throne?

> “Thou shalt. .bring forth a son, and shalt call His name Jesus. He shall be
> great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give
> unto Him the throne of His father David." Luke 1:31, 32.

**Answer:**

- **Jesus of Nazareth:** The angel Gabriel explicitly applies the prophecies of
  Isaiah and Psalm 89 to Jesus.
- **The Throne of David:** While Jesus did not sit on a literal throne in
  Jerusalem during His first advent, He is the rightful heir. He conquered sin
  and death to reclaim the dominion Adam lost and the throne David typified.

---

### Q16. While the kingdom was still held by the Jewish kings, what prediction was made concerning the kingdom?

> “And thou, profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity
> shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off
> the crown." Eze. 21:25, 26.

**Answer:**

- **The End of the Earthly Theocracy:** This prophecy was directed at Zedekiah,
  the last king of Judah.
- **Suspension of the Crown:** Because of persistent rebellion and the breaking
  of the covenant, the visible kingdom of God on earth was to be removed. The
  "diadem" (crown) was taken away, and the people went into Babylonian
  captivity.

---

### Q17. After the crown was taken from the Jewish king, and that kingdom had become tributary to the Babylonians, what more was predicted concerning it?

> “I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until He
> come whose right it is; and I will give it Him." Eze. 21:27.

**Answer:**

- **Three Overturnings:** This is a remarkable historicist prophecy. After
  Babylon (the first kingdom), the dominion would be overturned three times:
  1.  Babylon to Medo-Persia.
  2.  Medo-Persia to Greece.
  3.  Greece to Rome.
- **"It Shall Be No More":** There would never again be a permanent,
  God-ordained King of the line of David reigning on earth _until_ Christ
  returns.
- **"Until He Come":** The crown is held in reserve for Jesus, "whose right it
  is." He has the right by birth (line of David) and by conquest (victory at the
  cross).

---

### Q18. Christ did not take that throne when on earth. Did He assume it when ascending to heaven, or did He occupy the Father's throne, with Him?

> “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I
> also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne." Rev. 3:21.

**Answer:**

- **Two Thrones Distinguished:** Jesus clarifies that He is currently sitting on
  the **Father's Throne**. This is the throne of universal dominion and
  intercession.
- **His Own Throne:** There is a future throne called "My throne" (Christ's
  specific throne as the King of Glory/Davidic Heir), which He shares with the
  saints _after_ the conquest of sin is complete.
- **Current Ministry:** Jesus is currently functioning as High Priest in the
  heavenly sanctuary, mediating the Kingdom of Grace from the Father's throne.

---

### Q19. What is He doing at the Father's right hand?

> “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine
> enemies thy footstool." "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a
> priest forever after the order of Melchizedek." Ps. 110:1, 4; Heb. 10:12, 13.

**Answer:**

- **The "Until":** Jesus sits at the right hand _expecting_ (waiting) until His
  enemies are made His footstool. This is the period of the Gospel dispensation.
- **Priest-King:** Like Melchizedek (who was both King of Salem and Priest of
  God), Christ combines the offices. He is reigning over the church spiritually
  while ministering His blood for the cleansing of sins.
- **Investigative Judgment:** Before He returns to destroy the "enemies," there
  is a work of judgment (Daniel 7:9-14) to determine who are the subjects of the
  kingdom and who are the enemies.

---

### Q20. When His priestly work is finished, what will Christ do?

> ” Then cometh the end, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God,
> even the Father." 1 Cor. 15:24.

**Answer:**

- **The Close of Probation:** When the work of the Gospel is finished, and every
  case is decided, Christ concludes His mediation.
- **Consummation:** The Kingdom of Grace (the work of saving men) ends because
  the number of the redeemed is made up. He presents the finished product—a
  redeemed humanity—to the Father, vindicating God's character.

---

### Q21. When He comes to earth, on whose throne will He sit?

> “When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with
> Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory." Matt. 25:31 (Rev.
> 11:15).

**Answer:**

- **The Kingdom of Glory Begins:** At the Second Coming, Jesus shifts from the
  position of Priest/Intercessor to King of Kings.
- **The Throne of His Glory:** He now exercises full executive power to raise
  the dead, translate the living saints, and destroy sin. The prayer "Thy
  Kingdom come" is finally answered in its literal sense.

---

### Q22. Then what will He say to the redeemed?

> “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
> foundation of the world." Matt. 25:34.

**Answer:**

- **Inheritance:** We do not buy the kingdom; we inherit it as joint-heirs with
  Christ (Romans 8:17).
- **Prepared for You:** God's original plan in Eden was never abandoned. The
  "First Dominion" is restored. God created the earth to be inhabited by holy,
  happy beings, and His purpose will be fulfilled.
- **The Invitation:** "Come." This is the sweet voice of the Shepherd welcoming
  His flock home.

**[ILL]** A family loses their ancestral home to a dishonest foreclosure
(Satan's usurpation). The eldest son (Jesus) goes away, works hard, pays the
debt, and fights the legal battle to reclaim the deed. Finally, He calls the
family together, opens the door, and says, "Come in. The home is ours again."

---

### Q23. How will the saints appear after reaching that kingdom?

> “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their
> Father." Matt. 13:43.

**Answer:**

- **Glorification:** This is the final step of salvation.
  1.  **Justification:** Saved from the penalty of sin (Kingdom of Grace).
  2.  **Sanctification:** Saved from the power of sin (Kingdom of Grace).
  3.  **Glorification:** Saved from the presence of sin and its effects (Kingdom
      of Glory).
- **Shining as the Sun:** The saints will reflect the image of Jesus fully. The
  corruption of the mortal body is changed into immortality (1 Corinthians
  15:51-54). We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is (1 John 3:2).
