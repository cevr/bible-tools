# Reading 42: The Kingdoms of Grace and Glory

## Introduction

Scripture reveals two distinct yet connected kingdoms in God's plan of redemption—the kingdom of grace, where Christ ministers now as our High Priest, and the kingdom of glory, which He will establish at His second coming. Understanding these two phases of God's kingdom illuminates our present experience and future hope, showing how heaven's throne room activity directly relates to our daily Christian walk.

## Core Truths

### The Promise of the Kingdom

Our Saviour gave a remarkable promise to His faithful followers:

> _"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."_ (Luke 12:32)

Notice the tenderness here. Christ calls His people a "little flock"—small, vulnerable, seemingly insignificant in the world's eyes. Yet the Father takes **pleasure** in giving them a kingdom! This is not reluctant charity but joyful generosity from the heart of God.

**[DYK🔎]** The Greek word for "good pleasure" (_eudokeō_) expresses delight and purposeful will. The same word describes the Father's attitude toward Christ at His baptism: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (Matthew 3:17). God delights in giving His kingdom to His children with the same affection He has for His own Son.

### Two Thrones, Two Kingdoms

Scripture presents two distinct thrones that reveal two phases of God's kingdom:

**The Throne of Grace** (Present):

> _"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."_ (Hebrews 4:16)

**The Throne of Glory** (Future):

> _"When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory."_ (Matthew 25:31)

The throne of grace operates **now**, offering mercy and help. The throne of glory will be established at Christ's **return**, bringing final judgment and reward.

### Salvation by Grace Through Faith

> _"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God."_ (Ephesians 2:8)

**Grace**: God's unmerited favor and enabling power, freely given to sinners who deserve only death (Romans 6:23).

**Faith**: The hand that receives what grace offers—trusting wholly in Christ's merits rather than our own works.

This truth lies at the heart of the kingdom of grace. We cannot earn entrance; we receive it as a gift through faith in Jesus Christ.

## Deeper Truths

### The Lost Dominion and God's Recovery Plan

**Original Dominion Given to Man:**

> _"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth."_ (Genesis 1:26)

God entrusted this world's kingdom to humanity. Adam was earth's rightful ruler under God—a king-priest over creation. But when Adam sinned, he forfeited that dominion to Satan, who became "the prince of this world" (John 12:31).

**[Q] "If God gave dominion to man, how did Satan become ruler of this world?"**

When Adam yielded to Satan's temptation, he surrendered his allegiance—and with it, his dominion. Satan gained control not by divine appointment but by conquest through deception. Yet God immediately set in motion a plan to recover what was lost. The "seed of the woman" would crush the serpent's head (Genesis 3:15). Christ came to reclaim the kingdom Adam forfeited.

### The Kingdom of Priests

After Israel's deliverance from Egypt, God offered them a special position:

> _"Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people: for all the earth is Mine. And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation."_ (Exodus 19:5–6)

God's plan was for Israel to be a **kingdom of priests**—every citizen a minister of reconciliation to the nations. This was not mere national privilege; it was missionary calling. Through obedient Israel, all earth would know the true God.

**[ILL]** Consider a lighthouse on a rocky coast. Its purpose is not to admire its own light but to guide ships safely to harbor. So God designed Israel—and now His church—to shine His truth into the darkness, guiding wandering souls to salvation's shore.

### Israel's Tragic Rejection

Sadly, Israel rejected God's direct reign:

> _"Make us a king to judge us like all the nations."_ (1 Samuel 8:5)

God's response reveals the true nature of their request:

> _"They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them."_ (1 Samuel 8:7)

Wanting a king "like all the nations" was not merely political preference—it was **spiritual rebellion**. They wanted visible, human leadership rather than invisible, divine sovereignty. Yet even in their rejection, God worked to accomplish His purposes.

### The Davidic Covenant and Christ

Despite Israel's failures, God made an unconditional promise to David:

> _"Thy seed will I establish forever, and build up thy throne to all generations."_ (Psalm 89:4)

This promise found its ultimate fulfillment in Christ:

> _"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David."_ (Isaiah 9:6–7)

The angel Gabriel confirmed this to Mary:

> _"Thou shalt...bring forth a son, and shalt call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David."_ (Luke 1:31–32)

**[DYK🔎]** The name "Jesus" (Greek _Iēsous_) is the equivalent of the Hebrew "Joshua," meaning "Yahweh saves" or "Yahweh is salvation." Every time we speak His name, we proclaim that salvation belongs to the Lord.

### The Overturned Throne

Before Christ could receive David's throne, it had to pass through judgment. Through Ezekiel, God pronounced sentence on Judah's last king:

> _"And thou, profane, wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown."_ (Ezekiel 21:25–26)

Then came the remarkable prophecy:

> _"I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until He come whose right it is; and I will give it Him."_ (Ezekiel 21:27)

Three overturnings would occur—Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece would successively dominate Israel—"until He come whose right it is." The throne of David would remain vacant until the rightful Heir claimed it.

**[Q] "Did Christ take David's throne when He came to earth?"**

No. Christ clearly stated, "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36). He came first as Saviour, not as conquering King. He would take David's throne only after completing His work as Priest.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Christ's Present Position: Priest, Not King of Earth

Where is Christ now? Scripture is explicit:

> _"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne."_ (Revelation 3:21)

Christ sits on the **Father's throne** in heaven—not yet on His own throne of glory. This distinction is crucial.

What is He doing there?

> _"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool... Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."_ (Psalm 110:1, 4)

Christ ministers as our **High Priest** in the heavenly sanctuary. He is not idle on the Father's throne; He is actively interceding for His people, applying the merits of His sacrifice to every repentant sinner.

**Sanctuary Connection:**

In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest ministered daily in the holy place—trimming lamps, burning incense, presenting showbread. This represented Christ's continual work for us: illuminating our minds through His Spirit, presenting our prayers before God, and providing the Bread of Life for our souls.

But the high priest also entered the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement for the final cleansing of the sanctuary and the final disposition of sin. This typified Christ's closing work in the heavenly Most Holy Place—the investigative judgment preceding His return.

The kingdom of grace operates during this priestly ministry. Every day, the throne of grace remains accessible:

> _"Let us therefore come **boldly** unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."_ (Hebrews 4:16)

We may come **boldly**—not presumptively, but with confidence rooted in Christ's perfect sacrifice and living intercession. The kingdom of grace invites all who will come.

### The Gospel and the Kingdom

When Christ sent His disciples, He gave them a dual commission:

> _"He sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick."_ (Luke 9:2)

How did they fulfill this?

> _"They departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere."_ (Luke 9:6)

Notice the interchange: they were sent to preach **the kingdom** and went preaching **the gospel**. The kingdom message **is** the gospel message. To preach salvation by grace through faith is to preach the kingdom of grace now open to all who believe.

**[ILL]** A farmer sowing seed does not merely scatter grain; he plants a future harvest. When we share the gospel, we are not simply telling people facts—we are sowing kingdom seed. The good seed are "the children of the kingdom" (Matthew 13:38). Every genuine conversion is a new citizen of Christ's realm.

### The Great Controversy in the Kingdom

The parable of the wheat and tares reveals the cosmic conflict:

> _"The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one."_ (Matthew 13:38)

> _"The enemy that sowed them is the Devil."_ (Matthew 13:39)

Satan actively works to corrupt the kingdom. He cannot prevent Christ from sowing good seed, so he sows counterfeit believers—tares that resemble wheat but bear no genuine fruit. This explains the mixed condition of the visible church. True and false grow together until the harvest.

But the enemy's work is temporary. When Christ takes His throne of glory, the separation will be final and complete.

## The Kingdom of Glory

### When Christ Finishes His Priestly Work

> _"Then cometh the end, when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father."_ (1 Corinthians 15:24)

When Christ's intercession concludes, probation closes. He lays aside His priestly garments and assumes His kingly robes. The kingdom of grace gives way to the kingdom of glory.

### The Glorious Return

> _"When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory."_ (Matthew 25:31)

At last, Christ takes His rightful throne—not the Father's throne in heaven, but **His own throne of glory** as King of kings. The usurper is cast out. The rightful Heir reclaims what Adam lost.

### The Inheritance of the Saints

To the redeemed, Christ will speak the most wonderful words:

> _"Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."_ (Matthew 25:34)

**[DYK🔎]** The word "inherit" (_klēronomeō_) implies receiving as a rightful heir, not earning by labor. Children do not work to inherit from their parents—they receive because of relationship. So the saints receive the kingdom because they are children of God through faith in Christ.

### The Glorified Saints

> _"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father."_ (Matthew 13:43)

What a transformation! Those who walked in darkness now radiate the light of God's glory. The image of God, marred by sin, is fully restored. The children of the kingdom reflect the character of their King.

## Practical Application

### Living as Kingdom Citizens Now

If we are citizens of God's kingdom, our lives should reflect that citizenship:

1. **Come boldly to the throne of grace.** Do not let guilt or discouragement keep you from Christ's presence. The throne of grace exists precisely for sinners who need mercy and help. Come daily—come hourly—come in every time of need.

2. **Receive grace through faith.** Stop trying to earn what God freely gives. Salvation is "not of yourselves: it is the gift of God." Faith receives; it does not achieve. Trust Christ's merits, not your own.

3. **Live as a royal priest.** You are called to a "kingdom of priests" (1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6). Your life is a ministry. Every interaction is an opportunity to mediate God's grace to others.

4. **Do not be surprised by tares.** Counterfeit Christians have always grown alongside genuine believers. Do not be discouraged by hypocrisy in the church. Focus on being wheat yourself—fruitful, genuine, rooted in Christ.

5. **Keep your eyes on the throne of glory.** This present kingdom of grace is leading somewhere. One day, the priestly work will conclude, and the King will come. Live in constant readiness for that blessed hope.

### The Two Thrones and Victory Over Sin

Here we see the practical power of righteousness by faith. At the throne of grace, we receive not only **pardon** for past sin (justification) but also **power** over present temptation (sanctification). Grace is not merely forgiveness—it is "help in time of need."

When temptation presses, we need not fall. The throne of grace is open. Christ, our High Priest, understands our weakness (Hebrews 4:15). He offers strength for every battle, wisdom for every decision, comfort for every sorrow.

The goal of the kingdom of grace is to prepare a people for the kingdom of glory—not merely forgiven people, but transformed people who "shine forth as the sun."

## Appeal

> _"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."_ (Luke 12:32)

Dear friend, which throne will you approach today? The throne of grace stands open now. Mercy awaits. Help is available. Your High Priest intercedes for you at this very moment.

But the kingdom of grace will not last forever. A day is coming when the throne of glory will be set, and every case will be decided. Those who have received grace will inherit glory. Those who have rejected grace will face judgment.

Will you come boldly today? Will you receive by faith what you cannot earn by works? Will you live as a citizen of heaven, preparing for the day when Christ calls you to "inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world"?

The Father's good pleasure is to give you the kingdom. Will you receive it?
