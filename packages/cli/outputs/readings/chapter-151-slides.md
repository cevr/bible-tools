## Slide 1 – Q1: The Requirement of Vows

- Question: Does God require that we shall fulfill our promises?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 23:21 – “When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy
  God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require
  it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Nature of Vows)

- **A Solemn Act:** A vow is a voluntary, serious promise made to God to perform
  service, abstain from behavior, or offer a gift (Leviticus 27:2 – “Speak unto
  the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular
  vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy estimation.”).
- **God’s Nature:** God requires us to keep vows because He is a God of truth.
  - Deuteronomy 32:4 – “He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways
    are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.”
- **Sin of Omission:** Failing to keep a promise is classified as sin.
  - James 4:17 – “Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
    him it is sin.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Empowerment to Obey:** God’s biddings are His enablings.
- **The Source of Strength:** If God requires a vow, He supplies the grace to
  fulfill it. We do not vow in our own strength, but in dependence upon Christ.
  - Philippians 2:13 – “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to
    do of his good pleasure.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Cheque:**
  - If you write a cheque, your signature is your bond.
  - If the account is empty, the signature is worthless.
  - When we vow to God, we sign our name to a promise.
  - The "funds" to keep that promise must come from the Bank of Heaven—the
    indwelling power of the Holy Spirit.
  - We must not sign checks we do not intend to cash through faith in Christ.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Partial Fulfillment

- Question: Does a partial fulfillment meet His requirements?
- Key Text: Numbers 30:2 – “If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath
  to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
  according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Integrity & Sanctuary)

- **Integrity of the Soul:** A broken vow fractures the conscience. Partial
  obedience is actually disobedience.
- **Example of Ananias:** We must not keep back part of the price while
  pretending to give the whole (Acts 5:1–4).
- **The Pattern of Christ:** Jesus fulfilled the Father's will perfectly, not
  partially.
  - John 17:4 – “I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
    which thou gavest me to do.”
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the sacrifice had to be whole and without blemish.
  - God desires a whole heart and complete surrender (Deuteronomy 6:5 – “And
    thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
    soul, and with all thy might.”).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Parachute:**
  - If a skydiver packs a parachute but leaves out a few cords, it is not
    "mostly good"—it is useless.
  - In matters of the covenant with God, "almost" saved is "wholly" lost.
  - God desires a complete transaction, not a halfway measure.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Why God is Particular

- Question: Why is God so very particular about promises?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 23:23 – “That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt
  keep and perform; even a free will offering, according as thou hast vowed unto
  the Lord thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Character & Sanctification)

- **God’s Nature is Faithfulness:** We are to model our character after His.
  - Hebrews 10:23 – “Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without
    wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)”
- **Sanctification:** This is the process of being restored to God's image. A
  sanctified Christian must be faithful because God is faithful.
  - Colossians 3:10 – “And have put on the new man, which is renewed in
    knowledge after the image of him that created him.”
- **Mouth and Heart:** A careless tongue indicates a careless heart.
  - Matthew 12:34 – “O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
    things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Reflection:**
  - A calm, clear lake reflects the sky perfectly.
  - If the water is muddy or turbulent, the image is distorted.
  - God wants our lives to be clear in truth so the world sees His faithfulness
    reflected in our promises.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Foolishness of Slackness

- Question: What does He call those who are slack in paying their vows?
- Key Text: Ecclesiastes 5:4 – “When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to
  pay it; for He hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (Delay & Judgment)

- **Danger of Delay:** Procrastination hardens the heart. When the Spirit
  prompts, we must act before the impression fades.
- **Definition of a Fool:** Someone who is morally deficient and disregards
  God's authority.
  - Psalm 14:1 – “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
    corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.”
- **The Judgment:** Broken vows remain on Heaven's record books until repented
  of.
  - Matthew 12:36 – “But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall
    speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Unpaid Bill:**
  - A man who buys on credit but continually delays payment eventually loses his
    good name.
  - It is foolish to think the merchant has forgotten.
  - To delay payment of vows is to treat God as if He is forgetful or
    irrelevant.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Excuses and Errors

- Question: Will God excuse vows that are made without duly considering whether
  or not we can perform them?
- Key Text: Ecclesiastes 5:5, 6 – “Better is it that thou shouldest not vow,
  than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy
  flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error:
  wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine
  hands?”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Rash Vows)

- **Heavenly Witnesses:** We act in the presence of angels; we cannot simply
  say, "I didn't mean it."
- **Rashness vs. Principle:** True religion is not emotional impulse but settled
  principle.
- **Peter’s Example:** Peter vowed in his own strength and failed.
  - John 13:37 – “Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I
    will lay down my life for thy sake.”
- **The Remedy:** Confess the rashness to God and seek His grace to find a
  resolution that honors Him.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Wedding Vow:**
  - A spouse cannot say years later, "It was just an error," to dissolve the
    marriage covenant.
  - Our vows to God (baptism, service, stewardship) are covenant vows.
  - We must treat them with the gravity of a marriage contract.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Results of Faithfulness

- Question: What will God do for us, if we are faithful in fulfilling our
  promises?
- Key Text: Psalm 50:14, 15 – “Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows
  unto the Most High: And call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver
  thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Prayer & Faith)

- **The Cycle of Blessing:** We obey/pay vows -> We call in trouble -> He
  delivers -> We glorify Him.
- **Confidence in Prayer:** Faithfulness clears the channel to the Sanctuary
  above.
  - Psalm 66:18 – “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Fulfilling vows does not _earn_ deliverance; it is
  the condition of heart that allows us to _receive_ it. We pay vows because we
  have already received grace.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Open Pipe:**
  - Prayer is like water flowing through a pipe.
  - Debris (broken promises, unconfessed sin) clogs the pipe.
  - Paying our vows clears the debris, allowing the water of God's blessing to
    flow freely again.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Considering Before Vowing

- Question: Is it wise to consider beforehand whether we are able to perform our
  vows?
- Key Text: Proverbs 20:25 – “It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which
  is holy, and after vows to make inquiry.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points (Counting the Cost)

- **"Devouring the Holy":** Taking something dedicated to God and using it for
  self.
- **Order of Operations:** Do not act first and think later.
- **Sanctified Reason:** A vow should be a deliberate act of the will,
  surrendered to the Holy Spirit, not a result of peer pressure.
- **Counting the Cost:**
  - Luke 14:28 – “For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
    first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?”

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **Buying on Impulse:**
  - Buying expensive items without checking the bank balance leads to debt.
  - In spiritual life, impulse vowing is a "snare."
  - We must examine our hearts and resources in the light of God's Spirit so our
    "Yes" may be "Yes."

## Slide 23 – Q8: Is it Better Not to Vow?

- Question: Is it not better not to vow?
- Key Text: Psalm 76:11 – “Vow, and pay unto the Lord your God: let all that be
  round about Him bring presents unto Him that ought to be feared.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points (Necessity of Commitment)

- **Command:** The text says, "Vow, and pay."
- **Covenant Relationship:** The Christian life begins with the baptismal vow. A
  life without commitment is a life without direction.
  - Jeremiah 31:33 – “But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the
    house of Israel... I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in
    their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.”
- **Dependence on Christ:** We vow _in Christ_, relying on His strength, not our
  own.
  - Philippians 4:13 – “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
    me.”

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Anchor:**
  - A ship carries an anchor to keep it from drifting onto rocks during a storm.
  - A vow to God is a spiritual anchor.
  - When temptation comes, the memory of our solemn promise helps hold us steady
    in the truth.

## Slide 26 – Q9: Jacob’s Vow

- Question: What did Jacob do after the Lord had appeared unto him?
- Key Text: Genesis 28:20–22 – “And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be
  with me... then shall the Lord be my God... and of all that thou shalt give me
  I will surely give the tenth unto thee.”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points (Response to Grace)

- **Context:** Jacob vowed in response to the vision of the ladder (a symbol of
  Christ).
- **Elements of the Vow:**
  1.  **Relationship:** "The Lord shall be my God."
  2.  **Worship:** Establishing God's house (Bethel).
  3.  **Tithing:** "I will surely give the tenth."
- **Stewardship:** Jacob recognized God as the owner of all things long before
  the Levitical law was written.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Junior Partner:**
  - A wealthy owner funds a young man's journey and success.
  - The young man promises to return 10% of profits to the firm.
  - This isn't buying favor; it is acknowledging who owns the capital.

## Slide 29 – Q10: God Remembers Vows

- Question: Did the Lord forget Jacob's vow?
- Key Text: Genesis 31:11–13 – “And the angel of God spake unto me... I am the
  God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow
  unto Me...”

## Slide 30 – Q10: Key Points (Divine Memory)

- **God Tracks Commitments:** Even when we are distracted by life, God
  remembers.
- **"God of Bethel":** God identified Himself by the place where the vow was
  made. He values our commitments.
- **Call to Return:** God used the memory of the vow to call Jacob out of a
  difficult situation and back to the Promised Land.

## Slide 31 – Q11: Jacob’s Fulfillment

- Question: And did Jacob keep his promise?
- Key Text: Genesis 35:2, 3 – “Then Jacob said unto his household... Put away
  the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:
  And let us arise, and go up to Bethel...”

## Slide 32 – Q11: Key Points (Cleansing & Revival)

- **Preparation for Worship:** Before paying the vow, idols had to be buried and
  garments changed.
- **Sanctuary Lesson:** One must be cleansed before approaching the altar. We
  cannot bring vows to God while clinging to "strange gods."
- **Family Revival:** Jacob’s faithfulness in keeping the vow led to the
  spiritual revival of his entire household.

## Slide 33 – Q11: Illustration

- **Clean Hands:**
  - You would not present a gift to a King with mud-covered hands.
  - Jacob understood that the "mud" of idolatry had to be washed away.
  - Repentance prepares us to serve God acceptably.

## Slide 34 – Q12: Quality of Vows

- Question: Is the Lord particular as to what we vow to Him?
- Key Text: Malachi 1:14 – “But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock
  a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a
  great King, saith the Lord of hosts...”

## Slide 35 – Q12: Key Points (The Great King)

- **God’s Majesty:** He is the "Lord of Hosts." Offering second-best is an
  insult to His dignity.
- **The Deceiver:** Promising a healthy offering but swapping it for a sick one
  is hypocrisy.
- **Type of Christ:** The sacrifice represented Jesus, the Lamb "without
  blemish."
  - 1 Peter 1:19 – “But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
    blemish and without spot.”
  - Offering a corrupt sacrifice distorted the representation of Christ.

## Slide 36 – Q13: What Poor Vows Betray

- Question: What does such a vow betray in him who brings the offering?
  Contempt.
- Key Text: Malachi 1:8 – “And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not
  evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy
  governor; will he be pleased with thee...?”

## Slide 37 – Q13: Key Points (The Heart Issue)

- **The Human Standard:** We wouldn't give "leftovers" to a human dignitary; why
  give them to God?
- **Heart Condition:** The issue was a lack of love; they viewed service as a
  "weariness" (Malachi 1:13).
- **Firstfruits:** God deserves the best of our time, energy, and means.
  - Proverbs 3:9 – “Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits
    of all thine increase.”

## Slide 38 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Leftover Meal:**
  - Serving a guest of honor scraps from a previous meal is an insult.
  - We often give the world our best energy and God the scraps.
  - Love dictates we give our best to the One we love most.

## Slide 39 – Q14: God’s Right to the Best

- Question: For what other reason has God a right to demand the best? He gives
  everything.
- Key Text: Hosea 2:8 – “For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine,
  and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold.”

## Slide 40 – Q14: Key Points (Source of All)

- **Stewardship:** We are managers, not owners.
  - Haggai 2:8 – “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of
    hosts.”
- **Ingratitude:** Israel used God's gifts to serve idols. We must not use
  God-given health and intellect to serve the world.
- **Acknowledgment:** Vows and tithes are our tangible acknowledgment that God
  is our Provider.

## Slide 41 – Q15: Ownership

- Question: To whom do we belong?
- Key Text: 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20 – “What! know ye not that your body is the
  temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you... and ye are not your own? For ye
  are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body...”

## Slide 42 – Q15: Key Points (Redemption & Sanctuary)

- **Bought with a Price:** We belong to God by Creation and Redemption (the
  blood of Jesus).
  - 1 Peter 1:18-19 – “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
    corruptible things... But with the precious blood of Christ...”
- **The Temple:** Our bodies are the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit, dedicated to
  holy use.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Sanctification is yielding our members to the true
  Owner.
  - Romans 6:13 – “Neither yield ye your members as instruments of
    unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God...”

## Slide 43 – Q15: Illustration

- **The Purchase:**
  - If you buy a house, you have the right to decide how it is decorated and who
    lives there.
  - Christ has purchased the "house" of our humanity.
  - He has the right to cast out sin and inhabit us through His Spirit.

## Slide 44 – Q16: Inducement for Faithfulness

- Question: What inducement does the Lord hold out to those who desire to comply
  strictly with His requirements?
- Key Text: Malachi 3:10, 11 – “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse...
  and prove Me now herewith... if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and
  pour you out a blessing...”

## Slide 45 – Q16: Key Points (Blessing & Protection)

- **The Storehouse:** Represents the treasury for supporting the Gospel work.
- **Windows of Heaven:** A promise of abundant blessing—spiritual power and
  material sustenance.
- **Rebuking the Devourer:** God promises to intervene against forces that
  deplete our resources.
- **Spiritual Blessing:** The greatest blessing is the outpouring of the Spirit
  and the peace of God.

## Slide 46 – Q17: Faith Amidst Adversity

- Question: If God should not grant us prosperity, what should we do?
- Key Text: Habakkuk 3:17, 18 – “Although the fig tree shall not blossom... and
  the fields shall yield no meat... Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy
  in the God of my salvation.”

## Slide 47 – Q17: Key Points (The Ultimate Vow)

- **True Faith:** Loving God for _who He is_, not just for _what He gives_.
  - Job 1:9 – “Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for
    nought?”
- **God of Salvation:** When material streams dry up, the Fountain of Salvation
  (Jesus) remains.
- **Steadfastness:** The Christian vows to follow the Lamb anywhere.
  - Revelation 14:4 – “These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
    goeth.”

## Slide 48 – Q17: Illustration

- **The Marriage Covenant:**
  - A vow includes "for richer, for poorer."
  - If a spouse only stays during the "richer" times, they are not a true
    partner.
  - God calls us to trust Him even when the fig tree does not blossom, knowing
    He works all for our good (Romans 8:28).
