# Reading 50: The First Angel's Message

## Introduction

In the closing chapters of earth's history, God sends a final, urgent appeal to humanity through three angels bearing heaven's last messages of mercy. The first of these messages announces the arrival of a solemn hour—"the hour of His judgment is come"—and calls all people to worship the Creator. This study traces the biblical foundation for this prophetic proclamation, revealing how God faithfully prepared His people for the final events and how this message remains urgent for us today.

## Core Truths

### God Has Appointed a Day of Judgment

The judgment is not a vague, uncertain future event. Scripture declares with absolute certainty that God has fixed a definite time:

> _"Because He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom He hath ordained."_ (Acts 17:31)

**Judgment**: God's examination and evaluation of every human life, determining eternal destiny based on one's response to Christ and His truth (Ecclesiastes 12:14; 2 Corinthians 5:10).

This truth teaches us that:

- God is orderly and purposeful in all His works
- History is moving toward a divine climax
- Every soul must give account to the Creator

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "appointed" (_histēmi_) carries the sense of establishing something firmly and immovably. God has set this day with the same certainty with which He set the sun and moon in their courses.

### God Reveals His Plans to His Servants

The Almighty does not act in secret, leaving humanity unprepared:

> _"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets."_ (Amos 3:7)

This principle runs throughout Scripture. God warned Noah of the flood, Abraham of Sodom's destruction, and Joseph of the coming famine. Before every major divine intervention, heaven sends warning through faithful messengers.

[Q] **"If God is loving, why would He judge the world?"**

Judgment is actually an expression of God's love and justice. Without judgment, sin would go uncorrected, the wicked would forever oppress the righteous, and questions about God's character would remain unanswered. The judgment vindicates those who have trusted in Christ while demonstrating to the universe that God has dealt fairly with every soul. It is mercy's last appeal before mercy's door closes (Psalm 96:10-13; Revelation 15:3-4).

## The Threefold Message of Revelation 14

### The First Angel: The Everlasting Gospel and the Judgment Hour

> _"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."_ (Revelation 14:6-7)

Notice the essential elements of this message:

1. **The everlasting gospel**—the good news that sinners can be saved through faith in Christ, unchanged from Eden to eternity
2. **Fear God**—reverence, awe, and holy respect for the Almighty
3. **Give glory to Him**—reflect His character in our lives (1 Corinthians 10:31)
4. **The hour of His judgment is come**—not future, but present tense—_has arrived_
5. **Worship Him that made**—a direct call to honor the Creator, echoing the fourth commandment (Exodus 20:8-11)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "made heaven, and earth, and the sea" directly echoes the Sabbath commandment's language, identifying the Creator of the Sabbath as the One to be worshipped. In an age of evolution and secular humanism, this call to worship the Creator is remarkably relevant.

### The Three Angels Work in Succession

The first angel does not complete his work alone:

> _"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen... And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image..."_ (Revelation 14:8-10)

These three messages form one complete, final warning to the world. They cannot be separated—each builds upon the previous, preparing a people to stand faithful in the final crisis.

### The Result: Harvest and the Coming of Christ

> _"And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle."_ (Revelation 14:14)

> _"For the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe."_ (Revelation 14:15)

The three angels' messages prepare a harvest. Jesus said, _"The harvest is the end of the world"_ (Matthew 13:39). Those who receive these messages are gathered as wheat into Christ's kingdom; those who reject them face an altogether different harvest.

## Deeper Truths

### The Mighty Angel and the Little Book (Revelation 10)

John beholds a scene of extraordinary significance:

> _"And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: and he had in his hand a little book open."_ (Revelation 10:1-2)

This angel bears unmistakable marks of divine authority—the rainbow recalls God's covenant, the glory of the sun points to divine majesty, and the posture—one foot on sea, one on land—indicates a message of worldwide scope.

The critical detail is the **little book open**. This book was once sealed but is now opened.

### The Unsealing of Daniel

Which book of Scripture was specifically commanded to be sealed until "the time of the end"?

> _"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."_ (Daniel 12:4)

Daniel's prophecies, particularly the time prophecies of Daniel 8 and 9, were sealed until the appointed hour. The unsealing of this book corresponds with the "time of the end"—a period when the prophecies would be understood and proclaimed.

[DYK🔎] The expression "run to and fro" uses the Hebrew word _shut_, describing the diligent searching of Scripture. "Knowledge shall be increased" refers specifically to understanding of these very prophecies. History records that in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Christians worldwide began intensely studying Daniel's time prophecies—independent of one another, across multiple continents and denominations.

### The 2300 Days and the Cleansing of the Sanctuary

The angel's proclamation that "there should be time no longer" (Revelation 10:6) does not mean the end of all time, but rather the conclusion of prophetic time—the longest time prophecy would reach its fulfillment.

> _"And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."_ (Daniel 8:14)

**Sanctuary cleansing**: In the earthly type, this was the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), when the high priest entered the Most Holy Place to cleanse the sanctuary from the accumulated record of confessed sins. In the heavenly antitype, this represents the investigative judgment—Christ's final work of atonement before His return.

Daniel himself witnessed this judgment scene:

> _"I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit... thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened."_ (Daniel 7:9-10)

This judgment opened while the "little horn" (papal Rome) was still speaking great words on earth (Daniel 7:11), indicating it occurs before Christ's second coming—a pre-advent, investigative judgment.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

The first angel's message is inseparable from the sanctuary truth. The announcement "the hour of His judgment is come" points directly to Christ's ministry in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary.

In the earthly sanctuary:

- **Outer court**: The sacrifice of the lamb (representing Calvary—justification)
- **Holy place**: Daily ministry of the priest (representing Christ's ongoing intercession—sanctification)
- **Most Holy Place**: The Day of Atonement, judgment, final cleansing (representing the investigative judgment and the blotting out of sins—glorification and sealing)

The first angel announces that we have entered the antitypical Day of Atonement. This is the most solemn period in earth's history—a time when every case is being decided for eternity.

[ILL] On Israel's Day of Atonement, the trumpet sounded throughout the land. All labor ceased. The people gathered in solemn assembly, afflicting their souls and examining their hearts while the high priest ministered within the veil. No one knew when the high priest would emerge—but when he did, the fate of every soul had been determined. So it is today. Christ ministers in the Most Holy Place; the investigative judgment is underway. We know not when He will lay aside His priestly garments and come as King. This is no time for spiritual carelessness.

### God Permits Disappointment to Test Faith

The study notes reveal a profound principle: God permitted His people to misunderstand the nature of the event to occur in 1844. They expected Christ to return; instead, He began His final work of judgment in the heavenly sanctuary.

This was not the first time God's people experienced such disappointment:

- The disciples expected Jesus to establish an earthly kingdom (Acts 1:6; Luke 24:19-21)
- Israel expected a short journey to Canaan but wandered forty years
- Elijah expected all Israel to repent after Carmel but fled in discouragement

[Q] **"Doesn't the 1844 disappointment prove the Adventist movement was in error?"**

No more than the disciples' disappointment proved Jesus was not the Messiah. The disciples fulfilled Zechariah 9:9 by their hosannas, even while misunderstanding Christ's mission. Their disappointment came not from error in the prophecy, but in their understanding of its fulfillment. Similarly, the Millerites correctly identified the time (the 2300 days ending in 1844) but misunderstood the event. The sanctuary was indeed "cleansed"—not the earth by fire, but the heavenly sanctuary through the commencement of the investigative judgment.

God tests faith through disappointment. Those who trust His word more than their understanding emerge stronger. Those who demand that God fulfill their expectations fall away.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Judgment Message

How can sinners face the judgment with confidence?

> _"For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him."_ (2 Corinthians 5:21)

The first angel's message includes the "everlasting gospel." This gospel is not merely pardon for past sins but the power of God to transform the believer into the image of Christ. Through faith:

- Christ's righteousness is **imputed** (counted as ours)—we stand justified before the judgment bar
- Christ's righteousness is **imparted** (worked into our character)—we are being sanctified, prepared to stand before a holy God
- Christ's life within enables victory over every known sin

The judgment holds no terror for those who are abiding in Christ. Their names are covered by His blood, their characters are being transformed by His grace, and they welcome His coming as their redemption.

## Practical Application

### What Does This Message Mean for Us Today?

1. **We live in the judgment hour.** Every day, eternal destinies are being decided. This should impress us with the solemnity of our time and the urgency of preparation.

2. **We are called to worship the Creator.** In an age of evolution, materialism, and false worship, the Sabbath stands as a sign of loyalty to the Creator God. Revelation 14:7 echoes the fourth commandment precisely because the final controversy centers on worship.

3. **We must proclaim this message.** The angel flies in the midst of heaven, visible to all. God's people are His messengers, commissioned to give this warning to "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."

4. **We need not fear the judgment.** Those who are in Christ have an Advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1). The judgment is good news for God's people—it vindicates their faith, clears their names, and prepares the way for their eternal reward.

5. **We must live with eternal perspective.** The harvest is ripening. The three angels complete their work, and then the Son of man appears on the cloud. Is your life reflecting the urgency of this hour?

## Appeal

> _"Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."_ (Revelation 14:7)

The first angel's message is sounding now. It has been proclaimed since 1844, and soon the harvest will be complete. The question for each of us is simply this: Have you responded to heaven's final appeal?

Christ, our great High Priest, still ministers in the Most Holy Place. His blood still avails for every repentant sinner. But the work of intercession will not continue forever. One day—perhaps soon—He will rise from His mediatorial throne, remove His priestly garments, and come as King of kings and Lord of lords.

Will you, today, surrender fully to Christ? Will you accept not only His pardon but His transforming power? Will you let Him prepare you to stand in the judgment and to welcome Him at His appearing?

_"He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."_ (Revelation 22:20)
