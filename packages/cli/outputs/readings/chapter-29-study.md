### Q1. Does it make any difference what a man believes, if he is only sincere?

**“God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of
the Spirit and belief of the truth." 2 Thess. 2:13 (Joshua 24:14).**

**Answer:** Many today hold the opinion that it matters little what a person
believes, provided they are sincere in that belief. However, the Scriptures
present a different view. Salvation is here linked directly to two agencies: the
**Sanctification of the Spirit** and the **belief of the truth**.

1.  **The Function of Truth:** The Holy Spirit works through the truth to
    sanctify the believer. If a man sincerely believes a lie (for example, that
    the law of God is abolished, or that he can be saved while cherishing sin),
    the Holy Spirit cannot use that error to produce a Christ-like character.
    Truth is the mold into which the heart must be cast.
2.  **Sincerity is Not Enough:** Saul of Tarsus was strictly sincere when he
    persecuted the church, believing he was doing God service (Acts 26:9–11).
    Yet, he was fighting against the Savior. Sincerity in error may lead a man
    to destruction; only sincerity in the truth leads to safety.
3.  **The Connection to Righteousness:** We are chosen to salvation through
    "sanctification."
    - _Definition:_ **Sanctification** is the ongoing work of God’s grace by
      which the believer is set apart from sin and made holy in character and
      conduct (1 Thessalonians 4:3).
    - This process requires the **belief of the truth** because false doctrines
      regarding God's character or His law will inevitably lead to defects in
      our own character. We become like the god we worship.

**[ILL]** Imagine a sincere traveler who wishes to go to New York. He arrives at
the train station and sincerely believes that a train heading south will take
him there. He boards the train with full assurance and a peaceful heart. Does
his sincerity change the direction of the train? No. Despite his honest
feelings, he will end up far from his destination. Sincerity cannot convert
error into truth.

### Q2. How may we determine the truthfulness of any doctrine?

**“Prove all things," hold fast that which is good." 1 Thess. 5:21 (Isa.
8:20).**

**Answer:** God does not ask us to accept distinct doctrines blindly. He invites
us to "prove" (test) all things. The standard for this testing is found in
Isaiah 8:20: _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to
this word, it is because there is no light in them."_

1.  **The Standard of Judgment:** Just as a yardstick measures length, the Bible
    measures truth. Any teaching, manifestation, or feeling must be compared
    with the **Law of God** (the Ten Commandments) and the **Testimony** of the
    prophets (the inspired Scriptures).
2.  **Harmony of Scripture:** A true doctrine will not contradict any portion of
    the Bible. It must harmonize with the "law and the prophets." If a teaching
    minimizes the law of God or contradicts the plain "Thus saith the Lord," it
    must be rejected, no matter how popular or pleasant it may seem.
3.  **The Spirit of Prophecy:** In the last days, God's remnant people are
    identified by keeping the commandments of God and having the "testimony of
    Jesus," which is the "spirit of prophecy" (Revelation 12:17; 19:10). True
    doctrine will always align with the established testimony of God's Spirit.

**[ILL]** In banking, tellers are trained to identify counterfeit bills not by
studying the thousands of fake variations, but by studying the genuine bill so
thoroughly that they instantly recognize an imperfect copy. The Bible is our
genuine currency. If we study it thoroughly, we will instantly detect the
counterfeit doctrines of the enemy.

### Q3. Upon what foundation should every religious tenet rest?

**“And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
Himself being the chief corner stone." Eph. 2:20 (1 Cor. 3:11).**

**Answer:** The Christian faith is not an invention of the New Testament church,
nor is it based on human philosophy.

1.  **A Unified Foundation:** The foundation consists of the **Apostles** (New
    Testament) and the **Prophets** (Old Testament). This teaches us that the
    Bible is one unified book. We cannot discard the Old Testament and claim to
    stand on the New, for the apostles built upon the prophets.
2.  **Christ the Cornerstone:** A cornerstone aligns the entire building.
    - _Definition:_ **Atonement** refers to the work of Christ in reconciling
      God and man.
    - All true doctrine centers on Christ—His deity, His atoning death, His
      resurrection, and His high priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
      Any doctrine that shifts focus away from Christ’s work—whether to human
      saints, traditions, or works of the flesh—is a sandy foundation (Matthew
      7:26–27).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Because Christ is the foundation, our standing
    before God rests entirely on Him. We are not built on our own merits, but on
    the merits of the Chief Cornerstone.

**[ILL]** If a builder tries to erect a skyscraper without a foundation, or on a
foundation of shifting mud, the higher he builds, the more dangerous the
structure becomes. So it is with religion; high emotional experiences or complex
theological systems are dangerous if they do not rest squarely on the "Rock,"
which is Christ and His Word.

### Q4. What is mentioned first in the list of those things for which all Scripture is profitable?

**“All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine." 2 Tim. 3:16.**

**Answer:** Before Scripture is profitable for reproof, correction, or
instruction in righteousness, it is profitable for **doctrine**.

1.  **The Priority of Teaching:** "Doctrine" simply means "teaching." Before a
    man can be "instructed in righteousness" (sanctification), he must know the
    definitions of right and wrong, the character of God, and the plan of
    salvation. These are doctrines.
2.  **The Basis of Experience:** Many claim they want "Christ, not doctrine,"
    but this is a false dichotomy. The doctrine tells us who Christ is. Without
    sound doctrine, we may be worshipping "another Jesus" whom the apostles did
    not preach (2 Corinthians 11:4).
3.  **Preparation for Good Works:** Verse 17 tells us the result of this
    doctrine: _"That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all
    good works."_ True doctrine is the equipment necessary for a righteous life.

**[ILL]** A medical student must spend years studying the "doctrine" of anatomy
and medicine before he can practice surgery. If he skips the books and tries to
"just experience" surgery, he will kill the patient. Similarly, the Christian
life requires the knowledge of God's will (doctrine) to practice righteousness
safely and effectively.

### Q5. What advice is given to Timothy while preparing for the gospel ministry?

**“Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine." "Take
heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them." 1 Tim. 4:13, 16.**

**Answer:** Paul gives Timothy a dual command: Watch your life ("thyself") and
watch your teaching ("the doctrine").

1.  **Balance of Life and Truth:** A minister—or any believer—must have both a
    holy life and pure truth.
    - Truth without a holy life is hypocrisy.
    - A "good life" with false doctrine is deceptive.
2.  **Salvation Involved:** Paul says, _"for in doing this thou shalt both save
    thyself, and them that hear thee."_ This implies that negligence in doctrine
    endangers salvation.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Note the order: "Take heed unto _thyself_." We
    must experience the transforming power of Christ in our own hearts before we
    can effectively share the doctrine with others. The truth must be an
    indwelling reality, not just a theory.

### Q6. What remarkable charge is given him relative to his public work?

**“I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall
judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom, preach the word;
be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long
suffering and doctrine." 2 Tim. 4:1, 2.**

**Answer:** This is one of the most solemn charges in the Bible, framed by the
reality of the coming Judgment.

1.  **The Context of Judgment:** The charge is given in view of Christ judging
    "the quick [living] and the dead."
    - _Definition:_ **The Investigative Judgment** is the phase of Christ’s
      ministry in the heavenly sanctuary where He examines the lives of His
      people before the Second Coming (Daniel 7:9–10).
    - Because we must face this judgment, the preaching of the unadulterated
      Word is a matter of life and death.
2.  **Preach the Word:** The command is not to preach politics, philosophy, or
    comedy, but **the Word**. This is the only sword that can cut through the
    callousness of the human heart (Hebrews 4:12).
3.  **Methods:** The preacher must reprove and rebuke, but he must do so with
    _"all longsuffering."_ This reflects the character of Christ—firm in
    principle yet tender with the sinner.

---

### Q7. Why is this duty so imperative?

**“For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after
their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and
they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto
fables." 2 Tim. 4:3, 4.**

**Answer:** We are living in the very time Paul predicted. The duty to preach
truth is imperative because there is a natural human tendency to reject it in
favor of comfortable errors.

1.  **Itching Ears:** Men do not want to hear that they must overcome sin, take
    up their cross, and obey God's law. They want a religion that allows them to
    keep their "lusts" (worldly desires) while promising them heaven. They
    desire "smooth things" (Isaiah 30:10).
2.  **Turning to Fables:** When men reject the truth (such as the biblical
    account of Creation, the Sabbath, or the non-immortality of the soul), they
    do not stop believing; they start believing **fables**. Examples include
    evolution, spiritualism, or the idea that God is too "loving" to judge sin.
3.  **The Great Controversy:** This highlights the battle between Christ (the
    Truth) and Satan (the father of lies). To compromise doctrine is to
    surrender ground to the enemy.

**[ILL]** A diabetic patient may hate the "doctrine" that sugar is bad for him.
He may fire his doctor and find a "quack" who tells him, "Eat all the candy you
want; you are healthy!" The patient feels happier listening to the quack, but
his condition worsens. So it is with those who heap up teachers to validate
their sins.

### Q8. How was Titus instructed to teach? And in what was he to be a pattern?

**“But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine." "In all things
showing thyself a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing uncorruptness,
gravity, sincerity." Titus 2:1, 7.**

**Answer:** Titus was called to exhibit the inseparable union between faith and
works.

1.  **Uncorruptness and Gravity:** The handling of God's Word is not a light or
    trifling matter. It requires "gravity" (seriousness/dignity). Jokes and
    theatrics have no place in the presentation of eternal truths.
2.  **A Pattern of Good Works:**
    - _Definition:_ **Justification** makes us righteous by imputation;
      **Sanctification** makes us righteous by impartation.
    - Titus was to show that sound doctrine leads to a "pattern of good works."
      The world judges the doctrine by the man. If we claim to have the "truth"
      but are impatient, dishonest, or worldly, we slander the doctrine we
      profess.
3.  **Sound Doctrine:** The phrase implies that doctrine can be "sick" or
    "unsound." Healthy doctrine produces spiritual health; corrupt doctrine
    produces spiritual disease.

---

### Q9. What is the power of sound doctrine?

**“Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by
sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers." Titus 1:9.**

**Answer:** Sound doctrine possesses a convincing power that human logic lacks.

1.  **Convincing the Gainsayers:** A "gainsayer" is one who contradicts or
    opposes the truth. The only weapon powerful enough to silence opposition and
    reach the conscience is the "faithful word."
2.  **Holding Fast:** Victory requires stability. The believer must "hold fast"
    to the truth. We cannot lift others out of the quicksand of error if we are
    not standing firmly on the rock of truth ourselves.
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** In the heavenly sanctuary, the High Priest uses
    the blood and the incense. On earth, His ambassadors use the Word. It is the
    instrument of the Spirit to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and
    judgment (John 16:8).

---

### Q10. What danger attends false teaching?

**“Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past
already; and overthrow the faith of some." 2 Tim. 2:18.**

**Answer:** False teaching is not merely an intellectual mistake; it is a
spiritual catastrophe that "overthrows faith."

1.  **The Specific Error:** In Paul's day, some taught the "spiritualized" view
    that the resurrection was only symbolic and had already happened. This
    destroyed the blessed hope of the literal return of Christ and the physical
    restoration of believers.
2.  **The Result:** Faith was overthrown. When the pillars of truth are knocked
    down, the house of faith collapses. If there is no future resurrection,
    there is no victory over death, and "we are of all men most miserable" (1
    Corinthians 15:19).
3.  **Application:** Today, errors regarding the law of God or the nature of sin
    are equally dangerous. If we are taught that we cannot overcome sin, our
    faith in Jesus as a complete Savior is overthrown.

**[ILL]** If a navigator relies on a compass that is slightly magnetized to
point off-center, the ship may run aground on rocks. The error in the compass
leads to the shipwreck of the vessel. False doctrine leads to the shipwreck of
the soul (1 Timothy 1:19).

### Q11. Who are the disciples of Jesus? And what gracious work is wrought for them?

**“If ye continue in My word, then are ye My disciples indeed; and ye shall know
the truth, and the truth shall make you free." John 8:31, 32.**

**Answer:** Discipleship is defined by continuity in the Word, and the result is
absolute freedom.

1.  **Continuing:** It is not enough to accept the truth once. We must _abide_
    in it. This suggests a daily, living connection with Christ through His
    Word.
2.  **Freedom from What?** Contextually, Jesus explains in verse 34: _"Whosoever
    committeth sin is the servant of sin."_ Therefore, the truth makes us free
    from the **power and slavery of sin**.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** The Gospel does not just forgive the past
    (Justification); it liberates the present (Sanctification). The truths of
    the Bible—that Christ is our High Priest, that He dwells in us, that His
    grace is sufficient—break the chains of habit and addiction.

**[ILL]** A man imprisoned in a dungeon may be physically strong, but he is
trapped. If someone slides a map under the door showing a secret exit, the
_truth_ of that map, if believed and acted upon, sets him free. The Bible is the
map showing the way out of the prison house of sin.

---

### Q12. Through what are they to be sanctified?

**“Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth." John 17:17.**

**Answer:** This is the heart of the matter. Sanctification—the process of
becoming holy and fitted for heaven—is accomplished through the agency of
**truth**.

1.  **The Agent of Change:** The Holy Spirit uses the Truth to cleanse the mind.
    We cannot be sanctified by emotionalism, by social programs, or by error.
2.  **The Word is Truth:** God's Word defines reality. When we read the Word, we
    see God's holiness and our own sinfulness. This leads to repentance and
    faith.
3.  **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the Holy Place of the sanctuary, the Table of
    Shewbread represented the Word of God. The priests ate this bread to sustain
    their ministry. So we must "eat" the Word (John 6:63) to have spiritual life
    and holiness imparted to us.
4.  **Practical Application:** To neglect Bible study is to neglect the only
    means God has ordained for our sanctification. A closed Bible represents a
    starving soul.

---

### Q13. Will God accept the homage of such as deliberately teach contrary to His will?

**“But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of
men." Matt. 15:9.**

**Answer:** Jesus plainly declares that worship based on human tradition rather
than divine command is **vain** (useless/empty).

1.  **The Conflict:** Throughout history, there has been a conflict between the
    "commandments of God" and the "traditions of men."
    - _Example:_ The Pharisees placed their hand-washing rituals above the law
      of honoring parents.
    - _Modern Application:_ Placing Sunday (a tradition of men) in place of the
      Sabbath (the commandment of God).
2.  **Authority:** The issue is one of authority. Do we bow to God, or to man?
    True worship acknowledges God's supreme authority. To knowingly teach
    man-made doctrines in place of God's truth is an act of rebellion, not
    worship.

---

### Q14. Can we close our ears to the truth, and remain innocent?

**“He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be
abomination." Prov. 28: 9.**

**Answer:** Ignorance is one thing, but willful rejection of light is another.

1.  **Rejection of the Law:** The verse specifically mentions turning away from
    "the law." Those who claim they can have a relationship with God while
    despising His law are deceived. The Law is a transcript of God's character.
2.  **Abomination:** This is strong language. In the sanctuary service, the
    prayer (incense) was only accepted when offered on the altar with fire from
    the sacrifice. If one rejects the covenant of obedience, their prayer is
    disconnected from the spirit of true worship.
3.  **Cheap Grace:** To pray for God's favor while refusing to do His will is
    "presumption," not faith. Real faith works by love and purifies the soul
    (Galatians 5:6).

---

### Q15. What encouraging promise did our Saviour leave for those who should do the will of God?

**“If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
God, or whether I speak of myself." John 7:17 (Ps. 25:9) (John 8:12).**

**Answer:** Understanding spiritual truth is not primarily a matter of
intellect, but of **will**.

1.  **The Condition:** "If any man _will do_ [wills to do] His will." The
    surrender of the will to God is the key that unlocks the storehouse of
    truth. A rebellious heart blinds the eyes; a submissive heart opens them.
2.  **Divine Guidance:** Psalm 25:9 says, _"The meek will he guide in
    judgment."_ God promises that if we honestly desire to obey Him—no matter
    the cost—He will not leave us in darkness or error. We will "know the
    doctrine."
3.  **Certainty:** In a world of religious confusion, this is our security. We
    do not need to depend on scholars or priests. If we surrender to Christ and
    search the Word, the Spirit will guide us into all truth (John 16:13).

**[ILL]** If you are trying to tune a radio to a specific station, you must dial
it precisely. If you stubbornly refuse to turn the dial, you will hear only
static. A willingness to obey God is the "tuning" of the soul that allows the
clear signal of Heaven's truth to be received.

---

### Q16. What will be the fate of the spiritually blind teacher, and of those whom he presumes to teach?

**“Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the
blind, both shall fall into the ditch." Matt. 15:14.**

**Answer:** This verse destroys the idea that we can be saved by following a
pastor or priest while neglecting our own study.

1.  **Shared Fate:** If a leader is blind (teaching error) and the follower is
    blind (ignorant of the Word), **both** fall into the ditch. The layman is
    not excused because he "followed his leader." We are individually
    responsible to God.
2.  **"Let Them Alone":** Sometimes, when men are wedded to their traditions and
    refuse light, the most effective thing to do is to "let them alone" and not
    waste time in fruitless argument, but rather seek those who are open to
    truth.

---

### Q17. To whom will the gates of the heavenly city be opened?

**“Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may
enter in." Isa. 26:2 (Rev. 22:14).**

**Answer:** The final entry into the City of God is reserved for a people
defined by character and truth.

1.  **The Righteous Nation:** They are "righteous." This is the work of
    **Justification** (declared righteous by Christ's blood) and
    **Sanctification** (made righteous by His Spirit).
2.  **Keepers of the Truth:** They do not merely "know" the truth; they "keep"
    it. This implies guarding it, obeying it, and living it.
3.  **Harmony with Revelation:** Revelation 22:14 confirms this: _"Blessed are
    they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life,
    and may enter in through the gates into the city."_
4.  **Conclusion:** Sound doctrine is not an end in itself. Its purpose is to
    prepare a people—cleansed, obedient, and faithful—who can live in the
    presence of a holy God forever.

**[ILL]** A key must fit the lock perfectly to open the door. If the key is bent
or filed incorrectly (error), the door will not open. The "truth as it is in
Jesus" is the key that fits the gates of Zion. God creates a people who love the
truth because He is the Truth.
