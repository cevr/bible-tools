# Reading 64: The Millennium

## Introduction

The millennium—a thousand-year period mentioned in Revelation 20—stands as one of the most misunderstood yet vital prophetic teachings in Scripture. Contrary to popular belief, the Bible reveals not a golden age of earthly peace before Christ returns, but a dramatic separation at His coming, followed by a desolate earth during the thousand years, and ultimately the final judgment and destruction of sin. Understanding this truth shields God's people from dangerous deceptions in the last days and anchors our hope firmly in Christ's glorious return.

## Core Truths

### The World's Condition Before Christ Returns

Many sincere Christians believe the world will gradually improve until the entire earth is Christianized, ushering in a millennium of peace. Yet Scripture paints a starkly different picture.

> _"And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man."_ (Luke 17:26)

What were Noah's days like?

> _"And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually."_ (Genesis 6:5)

Paul confirms this trajectory will repeat:

> _"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers... having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof."_ (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God" in 2 Timothy 3:4 uses a single Greek word—_philēdonos_—from which we derive "hedonism." Paul foresaw that even professed Christians would worship self-gratification while maintaining religious appearances.

### No Improvement Before the End

Will this moral decline reverse itself before Christ comes?

> _"But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."_ (2 Timothy 3:13)

The parable of the wheat and tares confirms that good and evil grow together until the harvest:

> _"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."_ (Matthew 13:30)

**When is the harvest?**

> _"The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels."_ (Matthew 13:39)

This demolishes the idea of a converted world before Christ returns. The wheat and tares—the righteous and wicked—remain mingled until the Second Coming itself.

### Two Classes Only at Christ's Coming

When Jesus appears, humanity will be divided into only two groups:

> _"For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them... But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:2-4)

- **The wicked**: Living in darkness, surprised by sudden destruction
- **The righteous**: Walking in light, watching and ready

There is no third class—no unconverted masses who will have a "second chance" during a millennium of peace.

## Deeper Truths

### The Popular Deception Exposed

[Q] **"But doesn't Micah prophesy that nations will beat their swords into plowshares? Doesn't this prove a coming age of world peace?"**

This is one of the most significant prophetic misunderstandings of our time. Notice carefully:

> _"But in the last days... many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord... and they shall beat their swords into plowshares... neither shall they learn war any more."_ (Micah 4:1-3)

The text says the **nations shall say** this—it describes what people will proclaim, not what God declares will happen. This is the popular teaching of the last days: peace and safety, world conversion, the gradual triumph of Christianity.

But what does God say will actually occur?

> _"Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong."_ (Joel 3:9-10)

The prophecy is **reversed**! While the world preaches peace, God commands preparation for the battle of the great day. The contrast is stunning:

| **What Nations Say** (Micah 4:3) | **What God Says** (Joel 3:10) |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Swords into plowshares           | Plowshares into swords        |
| Spears into pruning hooks        | Pruning hooks into spears     |
| No more war                      | Prepare war                   |

[DYK🔎] Joel 3 describes the gathering of nations to the "valley of Jehoshaphat" for judgment. _Jehoshaphat_ means "Jehovah judges"—a fitting name for the place where God settles accounts with rebellious humanity.

### Christ's Rod of Iron—Judgment, Not Conversion

[Q] **"But doesn't Psalm 2 promise that the heathen will be given to Christ for an inheritance? Doesn't this mean worldwide conversion?"**

Read the entire passage:

> _"Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession."_ (Psalm 2:8)

This sounds promising—until verse 9:

> _"Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."_ (Psalm 2:9)

This is not conversion but destruction. Revelation 19 applies this prophecy directly to Christ's second coming:

> _"And out of His mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God."_ (Revelation 19:15)

The "rod of iron" is not a shepherd's staff gently guiding converted nations—it is a scepter of judgment that shatters rebellion like clay pottery.

[ILL] A potter's vessel, once shattered, cannot be restored. Broken pottery was used in ancient times as refuse—worthless shards discarded in heaps outside the city. So complete will be the destruction of the wicked that they are compared to fragments of clay, irreparable and cast away.

### The Man of Sin Destroyed at Christ's Coming

Paul reveals that wickedness continues until Christ appears:

> _"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming."_ (2 Thessalonians 2:8)

Daniel confirms that the persecuting "little horn" prevails against God's people until the very end:

> _"I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."_ (Daniel 7:21-22)

**Persecution continues until Christ comes**. There is no pre-advent millennium of peace where the church triumphs over her enemies through earthly means.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Final Scoffers

Peter foresaw the spiritual climate just before Christ's return:

> _"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."_ (2 Peter 3:3-4)

These scoffers appeal to uniformitarianism—the idea that natural processes continue unchanged, making supernatural intervention impossible. They deliberately ignore the Flood's testimony (2 Peter 3:5-6) and thus reject the coming judgment by fire.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "walking after their own lusts" reveals the motive behind skepticism. Unbelief in Christ's coming is not primarily intellectual—it is moral. Those who love their sins find the doctrine of Christ's return inconvenient.

### Sanctuary Connection: Judgment Precedes the Kingdom

Daniel 7 provides a crucial sequence:

1. The little horn makes war with the saints (v. 21)
2. The Ancient of days comes (v. 22)
3. Judgment is given to the saints (v. 22)
4. The saints possess the kingdom (v. 22)

This judgment phase corresponds to the work in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary—the investigative judgment that began in 1844 (Daniel 8:14). Christ's ministry in the Most Holy Place must be completed before He leaves the sanctuary to receive His kingdom and return for His people.

The doctrine of a pre-advent millennium ignores this heavenly work entirely. It places the kingdom before the judgment, reversing God's order.

### Righteousness by Faith: Victory Amidst Wickedness

How shall God's people live in these perilous times?

> _"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."_ (2 Timothy 3:12)

This promise is both sobering and encouraging. Persecution is not a sign of failure but of faithfulness. Yet notice: the godly life is lived **in Christ Jesus**. This is righteousness by faith in action.

In the days of Noah, one family stood against the entire world—not in their own strength, but by faith in God's word (Hebrews 11:7). So today, God's remnant will stand against the tide of wickedness, not by human resolve, but by the indwelling power of Christ.

> _"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works."_ (Titus 2:13-14)

The same Christ who appears in glory is the One who now purifies His people. Our hope is not in a gradual improvement of society, but in the transforming work of our High Priest who makes us ready for His coming.

## Practical Application

### What This Truth Calls Us To

1. **Reject the false hope of earthly utopia.** The world will not be converted before Christ returns. Our mission is not to Christianize governments but to call men and women out of Babylon and into Christ's kingdom of grace.

2. **Maintain urgency in witnessing.** If there were a millennium of peace ahead, evangelism could wait. But the harvest is at the end of the world—every soul who dies unsaved has no second chance. The three angels' messages are urgent calls to preparation.

3. **Expect persecution, not popularity.** "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." If the world applauds our religion, we may be preaching something other than the gospel. True godliness will provoke opposition.

4. **Find strength in Christ for the conflict.** We cannot stand against the tide in our own strength. Daily surrender, daily abiding in Christ, daily receiving His righteousness—this alone equips us for the perilous times.

5. **Look up, not around.** The "blessed hope" is not a reformed society but a returning Saviour. When wickedness abounds and love grows cold, lift your eyes to heaven. Our redemption draws near.

[ILL] In the darkness before dawn, the night appears blackest. A traveler walking through the night may grow discouraged as the shadows deepen around him. But the wise traveler knows: the deepest darkness signals that morning is near. So it is with the Christian. The increasing wickedness of our world is not cause for despair but for hope—for the darkest hour precedes the dawn of the eternal day.

## Appeal

> _"And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."_ (Luke 21:28)

Dear friend, where is your hope fixed today? Is it in the uncertain prospects of this world, or in the certain promise of Christ's return?

The popular teaching of a coming golden age is a dangerous deception. It lulls souls to sleep, delays preparation, and blinds eyes to the signs of Christ's coming. But you need not be deceived. The Word of God is clear: evil will increase, persecution will come, and then—suddenly—Jesus will appear in the clouds of heaven.

Will you be among those surprised by "sudden destruction"? Or will you be watching, ready, clothed in the righteousness of Christ?

Today, if you hear His voice, harden not your heart. Surrender fully to Jesus. Let Him purify you and prepare you for that glorious day. The night is far spent; the day is at hand. Look up—your redemption draws near!

> _"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."_ (Titus 2:13)
