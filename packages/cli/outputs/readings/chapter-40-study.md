# Bible Study: The Sure Word of Prophecy

## Introduction

In a world filled with uncertainty, confusion, and countless voices claiming truth, God has given His people an anchor—the "sure word of prophecy." This study explores the divine origin of Scripture, the purpose of biblical prophecy, and why we can trust the prophetic word more than even our own eyewitness experiences. Understanding how God has spoken through His prophets transforms Bible study from mere academic exercise into a life-changing encounter with the living God.

## Core Truths

### The Divine Origin of Scripture

The Bible is not a collection of human opinions or ancient folklore. Its origin is supernatural:

> _"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."_ (2 Timothy 3:16-17)

The word "inspiration" translates the Greek _theopneustos_, meaning literally **"God-breathed."** Scripture is the very breath of God committed to writing through human instruments.

[DYK🔎] The term _theopneustos_ appears only once in the entire Bible—here in 2 Timothy 3:16. Paul coined this unique word to emphasize that Scripture's origin is not human imagination but divine exhalation. Just as God breathed life into Adam (Genesis 2:7), He breathed His word into the prophets.

**The fourfold purpose of Scripture:**

1. **Doctrine** — Teaching us what is true
2. **Reproof** — Showing us what is wrong in our lives
3. **Correction** — Guiding us back to the right path
4. **Instruction in righteousness** — Training us to live godly lives

The goal is not merely knowledge but transformation—that we might be "perfect" (complete, mature) and equipped for every good work God calls us to perform.

### How Prophecy Was Given

Peter pulls back the curtain on the prophetic process:

> _"For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."_ (2 Peter 1:21)

The prophets did not simply decide to prophesy. They were "moved"—the Greek _pheromenoi_ describes a ship carried along by the wind. The Holy Spirit was the divine wind; the prophets were the vessels carried along by His power.

[Q] **"If human authors wrote the Bible, how can it be the Word of God?"**

This is precisely Peter's point. The origin was not human will but divine impulse. The prophets contributed their vocabulary, style, and personality, yet the message came from God. A secretary may type a letter in her own handwriting, but the message belongs to the one who dictated it. So Scripture is truly God's Word expressed through human language.

### The Spirit of Christ in the Prophets

A remarkable truth often overlooked:

> _"Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow."_ (1 Peter 1:10-11)

The same Spirit who later became incarnate in Jesus was the One speaking through the Old Testament prophets! This means:

- **All Scripture points to Christ** — He is the central theme
- **The prophets themselves did not fully understand** — They searched their own writings
- **Prophecy reveals both suffering and glory** — The cross before the crown

[ILL] Imagine a servant given a sealed letter to deliver to the king's bride. He carries it faithfully but cannot read its contents. Only when the bride opens it is the full message revealed. So the prophets carried messages whose depths they could not fully fathom, yet they delivered them faithfully, knowing they served not only their own generation but "us" who would later receive the fulfillment (1 Peter 1:12).

## Deeper Truths

### Revelation Belongs to God's People

Moses declared a fundamental principle:

> _"The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever."_ (Deuteronomy 29:29)

There are mysteries God has not disclosed, and we must humbly accept this. But what He _has_ revealed is our rightful inheritance—to be studied, understood, and obeyed. We are not spiritual trespassers when we study prophecy; we are heirs claiming our Father's estate.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "revealed" (_galah_) means to uncover, remove a veil, or make naked. God has stripped away the covering from certain truths so His children can see clearly. Prophecy is not meant to confuse but to illuminate.

### The Book of Revelation: Christ Unveiled

The final book of Scripture bears a significant title:

> _"The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him."_ (Revelation 1:1)

"Revelation" translates _apokalypsis_—an unveiling, an uncovering. This book does not conceal Christ; it reveals Him! Many avoid Revelation thinking it too mysterious, yet God pronounces a special blessing:

> _"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein."_ (Revelation 1:3)

This is the only book in Scripture that begins with a promised blessing for its readers. The blessing comes through three actions:

1. **Reading** — Personal engagement with the text
2. **Hearing** — Receiving and understanding the message
3. **Keeping** — Obeying what is written

[Q] **"Isn't Revelation too symbolic and confusing for ordinary Christians to understand?"**

God would not promise a blessing for studying a book He never intended us to understand. The symbols of Revelation are largely explained elsewhere in Scripture—the beasts, the woman, the waters, the horns all have Old Testament roots. By letting Scripture interpret Scripture, the book opens to the humble, prayerful student. Jesus Himself directed His disciples to study Daniel (Matthew 24:15), and Revelation is Daniel's companion volume.

### Prophecy: More Sure Than Experience

Peter makes a startling claim. He had witnessed Christ's transfiguration—seeing His glory, hearing the Father's voice:

> _"For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of His majesty... And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount."_ (2 Peter 1:16, 18)

Yet Peter declares something even more reliable:

> _"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts."_ (2 Peter 1:19)

**More sure than eyewitness testimony!** Why?

- Human senses can be deceived
- Memories fade and distort
- Satan can counterfeit experiences
- But fulfilled prophecy cannot be manufactured

[ILL] A man may sincerely testify that he saw a ghost in his bedroom at midnight. We cannot verify his experience—perhaps he dreamed, perhaps his eyes deceived him, perhaps fear created phantoms. But if a prophet declares a century in advance that a specific king named Cyrus will decree the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and history records this very event (Isaiah 44:28; Ezra 1:1-3), we have evidence no skeptic can explain away. The Bible's fulfilled prophecies are God's signature, proving His authorship.

### The Time of the End: Unsealing Daniel

Christ Himself directed attention to Daniel's prophecies:

> _"When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth, let him understand)."_ (Matthew 24:15)

Jesus expected His followers to study Daniel and understand its prophecies. Yet certain portions were sealed:

> _"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."_ (Daniel 12:4)

The "time of the end" would be marked by:

- **Increased travel** — "Many shall run to and fro"
- **Increased knowledge** — Particularly of prophetic truth
- **Unsealing of Daniel's prophecies** — Understanding previously obscure passages

[DYK🔎] The phrase "run to and fro" (_shut_) in Hebrew describes the movement of eyes scanning a document—searching, examining, studying diligently. The prophecy promised that in the time of the end, many would search Daniel's pages, and understanding would increase. The great prophetic awakening of the early 1800s, when students worldwide simultaneously discovered the prophecies of Daniel 8 and 9, fulfilled this prediction remarkably.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### No Private Interpretation

Peter warns:

> _"Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation."_ (2 Peter 1:20)

The word "interpretation" translates _epilysis_—literally, "unloosing." Prophecy did not originate from the prophet's own "unloosing" or explanation. It came from God, and therefore:

- **Scripture interprets Scripture** — We compare spiritual things with spiritual (1 Corinthians 2:13)
- **No individual has monopoly on truth** — The community of believers, guided by the Spirit, studies together
- **Private speculation is dangerous** — We must test all interpretations by the full counsel of God's Word

This principle protects us from the twin errors of:

1. **Rationalism** — Human reason as supreme judge
2. **Mysticism** — Private "revelations" divorced from Scripture

### Prophecy and the Sanctuary

The prophetic books, especially Daniel and Revelation, are deeply connected to the sanctuary:

- **Daniel's visions** center on the sanctuary being "cast down" and "cleansed" (Daniel 8:11-14)
- **Revelation** opens with Christ among the candlesticks (Revelation 1:12-13) and climaxes with the temple in heaven opened (Revelation 11:19; 15:5-8)
- **The "time of the end"** coincides with the opening of the Most Holy Place ministry—the investigative judgment

Prophecy is not abstract prediction; it unveils what God is doing in the heavenly sanctuary to save and vindicate His people. The "sure word of prophecy" shows us where we are in the stream of time and what Christ is accomplishing for us right now.

### The Great Controversy Connection

Satan has always sought to obscure prophecy because it:

- **Exposes his strategies** — The beasts, the false prophet, Babylon
- **Reveals his defeat** — The stone crushing the image, the beast cast into the lake of fire
- **Anchors faith** — Fulfilled prophecy proves God's sovereignty
- **Prepares a people** — Those who understand the times can stand faithful

The enemy promotes two opposite errors:

1. **Neglect of prophecy** — "It's too hard to understand"
2. **Sensationalism about prophecy** — Wild speculation that brings reproach

God's people are called to balanced, reverent, diligent study—taking heed to the prophetic word "as unto a light that shineth in a dark place."

## Practical Application

### How to Study Prophecy Faithfully

1. **Pray for the Holy Spirit's guidance** — The same Spirit who inspired the prophets must illuminate our understanding (John 16:13)

2. **Let Scripture interpret Scripture** — When you find a symbol, search for where Scripture defines it (e.g., waters = peoples, Revelation 17:15; beast = kingdom, Daniel 7:23)

3. **Study with humility** — Approach God's Word as a student, not a critic

4. **Accept what is revealed; trust God with what is hidden** — Some details remain unclear; God will reveal more as we need it

5. **Apply what you learn** — Prophecy is not given for curiosity but for transformation. The blessing comes to those who "keep those things which are written" (Revelation 1:3)

6. **Connect prophecy to Christ** — Every prophetic vision ultimately reveals Jesus—His character, His work, His kingdom

### Victory Over Spiritual Darkness

The prophetic word is "a light that shineth in a dark place." In our dark world of:

- Moral confusion
- Spiritual deception
- Uncertainty about the future
- Demonic counterfeits

God has given us a lamp for our feet (Psalm 119:105). We need not walk in darkness or fear the future. The same God who predicted Babylon's fall, Persia's rise, Greece's conquests, and Rome's dominion—and who saw each fulfilled precisely—holds tomorrow in His hands.

[ILL] A traveler lost in a dense forest at night sees a distant lighthouse beam. He cannot see the entire path, but as long as he keeps his eyes on that light, he will reach safety. So prophecy does not reveal every detail of the future, but it shows us enough to walk confidently toward the eternal kingdom. The "day star" will soon "arise in your hearts"—Christ Himself will come, and all shadows will flee.

## Appeal

> _"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed."_ (2 Peter 1:19)

Friend, God has not left you in darkness. He has spoken through His prophets, confirmed His Word through fulfilled prophecy, and preserved it for your salvation. The question is not whether the prophetic word is reliable—it is whether you will take heed.

Will you commit today to:

- **Read** the prophetic Scriptures with new earnestness?
- **Hear** what the Spirit is saying to the churches?
- **Keep** the things that are written, ordering your life by God's revealed will?

The "time of the end" is upon us. Daniel's sealed book is open. The light is shining. May you walk in that light until the Day Star—Jesus Christ Himself—rises in your heart at His glorious appearing.

> _"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand."_ (Revelation 1:3)
