### Q1. Just prior to His ascension to heaven, what did Jesus tell His disciples to await?

**“And, behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you: but tarry ye in the
city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.” Luke 24:49.**

**Answer:** Before the disciples could undertake the immense task of the Great
Commission, they were commanded to "tarry" (wait). This instruction reveals a
fundamental principle of the Christian life: human effort, zeal, and
organization are insufficient without the direct power of God.

- **The Promise of the Father:** This promise refers to the gift of the Holy
  Spirit (John 14:16, 26). Jesus was about to ascend to the heavenly sanctuary
  to begin His work as our High Priest. His first act of mediation was to pour
  out the Spirit upon His waiting church.
- **Endued with Power:** The word "endued" means to be clothed. Just as the
  priests in the earthly sanctuary were clothed in holy garments to minister
  before God (Exodus 28:2), the disciples needed to be clothed with spiritual
  power to minister to the world.
- **Dependence on Christ:** By commanding them to wait, Jesus taught them their
  total dependence on Him. They could not generate this power themselves; it had
  to be received from "on high."

**Key Term:**

- **Endued:** To be invested or clothed with a specific quality or ability. In a
  spiritual sense, it is the impartation of Christ’s power and character to the
  believer.

**[ILL]** Imagine a complex, heavy machine designed to perform a great work. It
has gears, levers, and wheels, but it sits motionless. No matter how much a
person pushes or pulls it, it cannot fulfill its purpose until it is plugged
into a power source. The disciples were like that machine—chosen and structured
for a purpose—but they had to wait for the "electricity" of the Holy Spirit to
animate them for service.

### Q2. With what did He say they would soon be baptized?

**“Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.” Acts 1:5.**

**Answer:** Jesus distinguishes here between the symbol (water) and the reality
(the Spirit). John the Baptist prepared the way with water baptism unto
repentance, but Jesus brings the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which brings life
and power.

- **Immersion in the Spirit:** To be "baptized" means to be fully immersed or
  submerged. This implies that the Holy Spirit is not merely an influence that
  touches us lightly, but a presence that completely surrounds and fills the
  believer (Acts 2:4; Ephesians 5:18).
- **Cleansing and Fire:** This baptism is elsewhere described as a baptism of
  fire (Matthew 3:11). It serves to burn up the dross of sin and selfishness,
  purifying the heart so that Christ can dwell within.
- **The Work of Grace:** This baptism connects justification (our standing
  before God) with sanctification (our fitness for heaven). It is the power that
  writes the law of God upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10), enabling obedience that
  is impossible for the natural man.

**Key Term:**

- **Baptism:** From the Greek _baptizo_, meaning to dip, immerse, or submerge.
  Spiritually, it signifies a complete washing and consecration to God.

**[ILL]** If you take an empty bottle and seal it tight, you can throw it into
the ocean, and it will be surrounded by water, yet remain dry inside. But if you
remove the stopper, the water rushes in and fills it completely. Many Christians
are surrounded by truth but remain dry because the "stopper" of self and sin has
not been removed. The baptism of the Holy Spirit fills the empty vessel of the
heart.

---

### Q3. For what important work was this baptism to prepare them?

**“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and
ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in
Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” Acts 1:8.**

**Answer:** The purpose of the Spirit's power is not for self-exaltation or
emotional excitement, but for **witnessing**.

- **Power to Witness:** A witness is one who gives testimony based on personal
  knowledge. The Holy Spirit gives the believer a personal experience with Jesus
  that makes their testimony irrefutable.
- **Righteousness by Faith in Action:** This power enables the believer to live
  a life that reflects Christ. We witness not only by our words but by a
  character transformed by grace. When the world sees victory over temper,
  pride, and selfishness in a believer’s life, they see a witness to the power
  of the Gospel (Matthew 5:16).
- **Global Scope:** The work was to begin at home ("Jerusalem") and extend to
  the whole world. This mirrors the prophecy of the Gospel message going to
  every "nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people" (Revelation 14:6).

**[ILL]** In a court of law, a lawyer can argue eloquently, but the case often
turns on the testimony of a witness who says, "I saw this happen." The Holy
Spirit changes the Christian from a "lawyer" who merely argues doctrine into a
"witness" who says, "I was a slave to sin, but Christ set me free."

### Q4. Following the outpouring of the Spirit, what preaching results followed?

**“Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said,... Men
and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be
baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost... Then they that gladly
received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them
about three thousand souls.” Acts 2:37-41.**

**"And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among
the people;...and believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of
men and women." Acts 5:12-14.**

**"And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in
Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the
faith." Acts 6:7.**

**Answer:** The outpouring of the Spirit (the "Former Rain") produced immediate
and massive fruit. The results show clearly what happens when the Gospel is
preached in the power of the Spirit rather than merely through human logic.

- **Conviction of Sin:** The hearers were "pricked in their heart." The Spirit
  brings deep conviction, revealing the sinner's true condition before God’s law
  (Romans 7:7). This leads to the question, "What shall we do?"
- **Repentance and Remission:** Peter’s answer highlights the steps of
  salvation:
  1.  **Repentance:** A genuine sorrow for sin and a turning away from it (2
      Corinthians 7:10).
  2.  **Baptism:** Public confession of faith and death to the old life (Romans
      6:3-4).
  3.  **Remission:** The forgiveness and removal of the guilt of sin through
      Christ's blood (1 John 1:9).
- **Obedience to the Faith:** It is notable that even "priests"—those most
  entrenched in religious tradition and legalism—became "obedient to the faith."
  This proves that the Gospel leads to obedience, not lawlessness (Romans 3:31).

**Key Terms:**

- **Remission:** The act of sending away or canceling a debt. In salvation, God
  cancels our debt of sin through the atonement of Christ.
- **Repentance:** Not just regret for consequences, but a change of mind and
  heart regarding sin itself, leading to reformation.

**[ILL]** A man may lecture a sleeping person all night without waking him. But
let a loud cry of "Fire!" be raised, and the sleeper awakes instantly. Human
logic is often like whispering to the spiritually dead; the Holy Spirit is the
awakening cry that "pricks the heart" and rouses the conscience to action.

### Q5. How did persecution affect the preaching of the gospel?

**“And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was
at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of
Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles... Therefore they that were scattered
abroad went every where preaching the word.” Acts 8:1-4.**

**Answer:** Satan attempted to crush the infant church through persecution, but
God overruled this malice to spread the truth.

- **The Blood of Seed:** Instead of silencing the church, persecution scattered
  the believers like seeds carried by the wind. Every refugee became a
  missionary.
- **The Priesthood of Believers:** Notice that the apostles stayed in Jerusalem,
  but the "scattered" lay members went preaching. The work of the Gospel is not
  reserved for the ordained ministry alone; every soul born of the Spirit is to
  be a light bearer.
- **Great Controversy Perspective:** This illustrates a recurring theme in the
  Great Controversy: whenever the enemy attacks God's truth with force, God uses
  that pressure to expand His kingdom (Genesis 50:20).

**[ILL]** If you blow on a campfire to put it out, you often only succeed in
sending sparks flying into the dry grass nearby, starting new fires everywhere.
So it was with the persecution of the early church; the "breath" of the dragon
only spread the fire of the Gospel.

### Q6. What Old Testament prophecy was fulfilled at the time of the outpouring of the Spirit?

**“But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said,...
These are not drunken, as ye suppose... But this is that which was spoken by the
prophet Joel; And It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour
out of My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy
.” Acts 2:14-18. (See Joel 2:28-29.)**

**Answer:** Peter identifies the Pentecost experience as the fulfillment of
Joel's prophecy. This anchors the New Testament experience in Old Testament
revelation.

- **"All Flesh":** The Spirit was no longer restricted to a few prophets or
  judges but was available to all believers—sons, daughters, servants, and
  handmaidens.
- **Prophetic Guidance:** The return of the "spirit of prophecy" (Revelation
  19:10) is a mark of God’s true church. God guides His people through visions
  and dreams as they draw near to the end.
- **The Last Days:** Peter understood that the outpouring of the Spirit
  initiated the "last days," the final era of earth's history leading to the
  judgment.

**Key Term:**

- **Prophecy:** A message inspired by God, revealing His will, His character, or
  future events, intended to edify and guide the church (1 Corinthians 14:3).

---

### Q7. What expressions in Joel's prophecy indicate a double fulfillment of this outpouring?

**“Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for He
hath given you the former rain moderately, and He will cause to come down for
you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.” Joel
2:23. (See also Hosea 6:3.)**

**Answer:** The imagery of "rain" in Scripture describes the work of the Holy
Spirit. In the Palestinian agricultural cycle, there were two distinct rains
essential for the harvest:

- **The Former Rain (Early Rain):** This fell at seed-time (autumn) to germinate
  the seed and cause it to take root. Historically, this corresponds to the
  outpouring at **Pentecost**, which launched the Christian church.
  Individually, it represents the work of conversion and early sanctification.
- **The Latter Rain:** This fell just before the harvest (spring) to ripen the
  grain for gathering. Historically, this points to a final outpouring of the
  Holy Spirit at the **end of time** to prepare God’s people for the Second
  Coming and the close of probation.
- **The Need for Both:** Without the former rain, there is no life to grow;
  without the latter rain, the grain will not ripen for the harvest (Mark
  4:28-29). We need the "ripening" of character—the full reproduction of
  Christ’s image—before He comes.

**Key Terms:**

- **Former Rain:** The Spirit's work in conversion and the establishment of the
  early church.
- **Latter Rain:** The Spirit's final, refreshing power to seal God's people and
  empower the Loud Cry message (Revelation 18).

**[ILL]** A farmer can plant the best seed in fertile soil, but if no rain falls
to swell the grain in the final weeks, the harvest will be withered and useless.
We may have the "seed" of truth and the "sprout" of conversion, but we
desperately need the "Latter Rain" of the Spirit to mature our characters for
heaven.

### Q8. In the time of the latter rain, for what are we told to pray?

**“Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall
make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to everyone grass in the
field.” Zechariah 10:1.**

**Answer:** We are not to wait in idleness. When the time for the promise
arrives, we must actively ask for it.

- **Asking in Faith:** God has promised the Spirit, but He inquires of His
  people to do it for them (Ezekiel 36:37). We must recognize our need and plead
  for the power to overcome every defect of character.
- **The Time is Now:** We are living in the time of the "Latter Rain." The
  investigative judgment is in progress in the heavenly sanctuary. Just as the
  High Priest cleansed the sanctuary, the Spirit seeks to cleanse the soul
  temple of the believer.
- **Individual Experience:** The verse promises rain to "everyone grass." This
  is an individual experience. One plant in the field cannot absorb moisture for
  another; each believer must have a personal connection with Christ.

**[ILL]** When a sailing ship is becalmed at sea, the sailors cannot create the
wind. However, they can raise the sails and set the rigging so that when the
breeze comes, they are ready to catch it. Prayer and obedience are "raising the
sails" for the Latter Rain.

### Q9. How is the closing gospel work under the outpouring of the Spirit described by John the revelator?

**“After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great
power; and the earth was lightened with His glory.” Revelation 18:1.**

**Answer:** This verse describes the final phase of God's work on earth, often
called the "Loud Cry." It coincides with the Latter Rain.

- **Great Power:** This angel strengthens the message of the three angels of
  Revelation 14. It signifies a mighty movement of the Holy Spirit that will
  bring the work of the Gospel to a close.
- **Lightened with Glory:** In the Bible, God's "glory" is His character (Exodus
  33:18-19; 34:6-7). The earth will be illuminated not just by arguments, but by
  the revelation of God's character of love and righteousness seen in His
  people.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** The world will finally see a demonstration of what
  the Gospel can do: produce a people who keep the commandments of God and the
  faith of Jesus (Revelation 14:12) amidst a rebellious world.

**Key Term:**

- **Glory:** The weightiness, honor, and radiance of God. Spiritually, it refers
  to His moral character—His justice, mercy, and truth.

---

### Q10. What is the message of this angel?

**“And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is
fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every
unclean and hateful bird.” Revelation 18:2.**

**Answer:** The message is a stark exposure of spiritual apostasy. It repeats
the message of the second angel (Revelation 14:8) but adds descriptions of
deeper corruption.

- **Babylon Identified:** Babylon represents the confusion of false religious
  systems that mix biblical truth with pagan error and worldly power. It is a
  system that seeks salvation by works or sacraments rather than by faith in
  Christ alone.
- **Spiritual Decline:** The repetition "is fallen, is fallen" indicates a
  progressive fall. Rejection of light leads to darkness. By rejecting the First
  Angel's message (the everlasting gospel and judgment hour), the professed
  churches open themselves to the "habitation of devils" (spiritualism and
  error).
- **The Controversy:** As the end approaches, there will be only two camps:
  those who follow the Lamb (Christ) and those who are part of Babylon.

**Key Term:**

- **Babylon:** Derived from Babel (confusion). In prophecy, it symbolizes
  apostate religion that unites with the state and persecutes dissenters.

**[ILL]** An old building may look sturdy on the outside, but if the foundation
is rotting and termites are eating the beams, it is dangerous to inhabit. This
angel warns that the "structure" of worldly religion, though impressive, is
spiritually condemned and about to collapse.

---

### Q11. What did Peter on the day of Pentecost tell his hearers to do?

**“And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves
from this untoward generation.” Acts 2:40.**

**Answer:** The Gospel is not just information; it is a call to separation.

- **"Save Yourselves":** While Christ is the only Savior, the sinner must choose
  to accept that salvation. We "save ourselves" by fleeing to the Refuge Christ
  has provided.
- **Untoward Generation:** The word "untoward" means crooked or perverse. The
  world's maxims, its fashions, and its principles are contrary to the law of
  God. To be saved, one must step out of the line of the world and walk in the
  narrow path of Christ.
- **Sanctification:** This separation is practical sanctification. It involves
  leaving behind the habits, entertainments, and sins that characterize the
  ungodly age.

**[ILL]** If a ship is sinking, the captain calls out, "Save yourselves! Get
into the lifeboats!" He does not mean the passengers must row to land on their
own strength, but they must take the action of leaving the sinking vessel and
entering the safety provided.

---

### Q12. What similar call and appeal will be made under the final outpouring of the Holy Spirit?

**“And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her My people,
that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.”
Revelation 18:4-5.**

**Answer:** Just as Peter called believers out of the Jewish apostasy, the
Spirit now calls God's people out of global religious apostasy.

- **"My People":** God has true children scattered throughout the confused
  religious systems of "Babylon." They love the Lord but have not yet seen the
  full light of truth. The Latter Rain empowers the message that calls them out.
- **Separation from Sin:** The call is to separate not just physically, but
  spiritually. To remain in Babylon is to become a "partaker of her sins." God
  holds us responsible for the light we have; when truth is presented, we must
  obey.
- **The Consequence:** Those who refuse to separate from the sins of Babylon
  will share in her "plagues" (the Seven Last Plagues). This highlights the
  sanctuary truth: sin must be blotted out from the believer, or the believer
  will be blotted out with the sin.
- **Final Atonement:** The sins reaching heaven implies the investigative
  judgment is concluding. God is making the final separation between the wheat
  and the tares.

**[ILL]** Lot lived in Sodom. Before the fire fell, angels were sent to pull him
out. He had to leave his home and his associations behind to be saved. Today,
the message of Revelation 18 is the angel's hand grasping us, urging us to leave
the sins of the world before the final judgment falls.
