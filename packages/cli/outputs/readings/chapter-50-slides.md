## Slide 1 – Q1: The Appointment of Judgment

- **Question:** Has God appointed the day of judgment?
- **Key Text:** Acts 17:31 – “Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he
  will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained;
  whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from
  the dead.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Universal Accountability & Righteousness

- **Universal Accountability:**
  - The judgment is not a random event; it is a fixed appointment.
  - God will judge “the world.” Whether king, servant, believer, or skeptic,
    everyone comes under review.
- **Judged in Righteousness:**
  - The standard is God’s character, transcribed in His law (Psalm 119:172 – “My
    tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are
    righteousness.”).
  - (James 2:12 – “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
    law of liberty.”)
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Because all have sinned, we cannot stand on our own merits.
  - Our only hope is to be found in Christ, having His perfect life credited to
    our account.
  - (Philippians 3:9 – “And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness,
    which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
    righteousness which is of God by faith:”)

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Court Appointment:**
  - Receiving a summons for court is terrifying if you have broken the law and
    have no lawyer.
  - However, if the Judge is your Father and the Defense Attorney is your Savior
    who paid your fine, the date becomes a day of vindication.
  - The judgment reveals who has accepted the Advocate.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Divine Revelation

- **Question:** To whom has this event been made known?
- **Key Text:** Amos 3:7 – “Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he
  revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **Divine Mercy:**
  - God acts with transparency and love.
  - He does not wish for anyone to be caught unprepared (2 Peter 3:9 – “The Lord
    is not slack concerning his promise... but is longsuffering to us-ward, not
    willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”).
- **The Role of Prophecy:**
  - Prophecy is given to facilitate repentance and preparation.
  - God reveals the “secret” so men and women may make peace with Him before the
    books close.
- **The Prophetic Chain:**
  - Just as Noah warned of the Flood, God raised up a prophetic movement in the
    “time of the end” to announce the judgment.

## Slide 6 – Q3: The First Angel’s Message

- **Question:** Where is the announcement of the judgment made?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:7 – “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give
  glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made
  heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points

- **“Is Come”:**
  - The verb tense indicates the judgment begins _before_ the Second Coming.
  - This is the **Investigative Judgment** (Pre-Advent Judgment), reviewing the
    lives of professed believers in the heavenly sanctuary.
- **Fear God:**
  - Reverence Him, respect His authority, and hate evil (Proverbs 8:13 – “The
    fear of the LORD is to hate evil...”).
  - Surrender the will to Him.
- **Give Glory to Him:**
  - We give glory by revealing His character.
  - Allowing Christ to live in us produces “fruits of righteousness” (John 15:8
    – “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit...”).

## Slide 8 – Q3: Worship and Definition

- **Worship the Creator:**
  - The message calls us back to the true God and His memorial of creation, the
    Sabbath.
  - (Exodus 20:11 – “For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,
    and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day...”)
- **Definition: Investigative Judgment**
  - The phase of judgment beginning in 1844 (Daniel 8:14).
  - God reviews records to determine who is safe to save.
  - Sins of the righteous are blotted out before Christ returns.

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Everlasting Gospel

- **Question:** What does the angel preach who makes this announcement?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:6 – “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of
  heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
  earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Gospel and Judgment

- **Inseparable Messages:**
  - One cannot understand the judgment without the “good news.”
  - The Gospel is that Christ has conquered sin; Judgment vindicates those who
    accept that Gospel.
- **Global Scope:**
  - A universal call to every nation; no secret groups.
- **Power to Save:**
  - The Gospel is the power of God (Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the
    gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one
    that believeth...”).
  - It includes **Pardon** (forgiveness) and **Power** (victory over sin).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We do not face judgment alone; the Gospel transforms us to stand “faultless”
    (Jude 24 – “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
    present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding
    joy,”).

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Lifeboat:**
  - A warning that a ship is sinking (judgment) is terrifying only if there is
    no lifeboat.
  - The First Angel points to the sinking ship of this world.
  - Simultaneously, he points to the unsinkable Lifeboat: the “Everlasting
    Gospel” of Jesus Christ.

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Threefold Message

- **Question:** By what is this angel accompanied before his work is
  accomplished?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:8-10 – “And there followed another angel, saying,
  Babylon is fallen... And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud
  voice, If any man worship the beast and his image... The same shall drink of
  the wine of the wrath of God...”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **Cumulative Messages:**
  - 1st Angel: Calls for true worship.
  - 2nd Angel: Warns against false systems (Babylon).
  - 3rd Angel: Warns against the Mark of the Beast.
- **Babylon is Fallen:**
  - Spiritual confusion and apostasy in churches that reject the warning.
- **The Wrath of God:**
  - God’s final rejection of sin.
  - Those clinging to sin cannot dwell in His presence.
- **The Result:**
  - A people who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus (Revelation
    14:12).

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Effect of the Message

- **Question:** What will be the effect of the united work of these three
  messages?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:15 – “And another angel came out of the temple,
  crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle,
  and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth
  is ripe.”
- **Reference:** Matthew 13:39 – “...the harvest is the end of the world; and
  the reapers are the angels.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Ripening and Separation

- **The Ripening:**
  - The message forces a final decision for or against God.
  - The “wheat” (righteous) fully reflect Christ’s character (sanctification
    completed).
  - The “tares” (wicked) become fully settled in rebellion.
- **Separation:**
  - The Three Angels’ Messages act as a winnowing fan.
- **Sanctification by Faith:**
  - The harvest proves the Gospel works.
  - God will have a people who have overcome the world, flesh, and devil through
    faith.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Sun and the Clay:**
  - The same sun that hardens clay melts wax.
  - The same message of judgment and love hardens hearts that resist (like
    Pharaoh).
  - It softens and purifies hearts that receive it.
  - The message brings everyone to their true “ripe” condition.

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Second Coming

- **Question:** What takes place in connection with the harvest?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:14 – “And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and
  upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
  crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points

- **King of Kings:**
  - Jesus wears a “golden crown” (diadem), not a priestly mitre.
  - His mediatorial work in the sanctuary has ended.
- **The Reaper:**
  - Christ comes to claim His own.
  - He gathers those who accepted His righteousness and let Him write His law in
    their hearts.
- **Sequence:**
  1. Warning (Rev 14:6-12).
  2. Close of Probation.
  3. The King returns to reap (Rev 14:14).

## Slide 19 – Q8: The Mighty Angel

- **Question:** What was the appearance of an angel seen by John, as recorded in
  chapter ten?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 10:1 – “And I saw another mighty angel come down from
  heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face
  was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points

- **Identity:** The description strongly suggests **Jesus Christ** in a special
  role.
- **Clothed with a Cloud:** Associated with God’s presence and judgment (Matthew
  24:30).
- **Rainbow:** Recalls the rainbow around the throne (Revelation 4:3);
  symbolizes the covenant of mercy. Even in judgment, mercy is present.
- **Face as the Sun:** Matches the glorified Christ (Revelation 1:16; Matthew
  17:2).
- **Pillars of Fire:** Symbolizes firmness and the tread of a conqueror.

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Little Book

- **Question:** What did he hold in his hand?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 10:2 – “And he had in his hand a little book open:
  and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points

- **An "Open" Book:**
  - Implies the book was previously closed or sealed.
- **Identity of the Book:**
  - Points to the book of Daniel.
  - Daniel is the only book explicitly sealed until the “time of the end.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Authority and Power

- **Question:** And what did the angel do?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 10:2-3 – “And he set his right foot upon the sea, and
  his left foot on the earth, And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion
  roareth...”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points

- **Supreme Authority:**
  - Standing on both land and water signifies worldwide dominion.
  - The message is not local; it involves the destiny of the whole planet.
- **Lion’s Roar:**
  - Symbolizes the power of God’s voice (Hosea 11:10 – “They shall walk after
    the LORD: he shall roar like a lion...”).
  - The message is proclaimed with power and urgency.

## Slide 25 – Q11: Time No Longer

- **Question:** What was the burden of this message?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 10:5-6 – “And the angel which I saw stand upon the
  sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, And sware by him that
  liveth for ever and ever... that there should be time no longer:”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points

- **Prophetic Time:**
  - Does not mean the end of world history or the end of time as a dimension.
  - Marks the end of the longest time prophecy (2300 days of Daniel 8:14).
- **No More Dates:**
  - After 1844, there are no more definite time prophecies setting dates for the
    Lord’s return.
- **Urgency:**
  - We are living in the “time of the end.”
  - Probation is running out.

## Slide 27 – Q12: The Book of Daniel Opened

- **Question:** The book in the hand of the angel, from which he proclaimed this
  time message, was said to be "open." When was the only sealed book of the
  Bible, that contained definite time, to be opened?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 12:4 – “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal
  the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
  knowledge shall be increased.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points

- **Sealed until the End:**
  - Daniel’s prophecies regarding long time periods were “sealed” (not fully
    understood).
- **Knowledge Increased:**
  - In the early 19th century, men of God “ran to and fro” in the Scriptures.
  - The Holy Spirit “opened” the understanding of the 2300-day prophecy.
- **The Connection:**
  - The open book in Revelation 10 is the unsealed book of Daniel.

## Slide 29 – Q13: The Judgment Scene

- **Question:** What does the prophet Daniel say about the judgment?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:9-10 – “I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and
  the Ancient of days did sit... thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten
  thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the
  books were opened.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Courtroom:**
  - The Ancient of Days (Father) presides.
  - Millions of angels attend this solemn scene.
- **The Books:**
  - **Book of Life:** Names of the saved (Philippians 4:3).
  - **Book of Remembrance:** Good deeds (Malachi 3:16).
  - **Records of Sin:** The record of iniquity (Ecclesiastes 12:14).
- **The Purpose:**
  - Heaven determines who has truly accepted Christ's righteousness and retained
    it by faith.

## Slide 31 – Q14: Earthly Opposition

- **Question:** What did Daniel see the little horn (Roman Church) do after the
  judgment opened?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 7:11 – “I beheld then because of the voice of the great
  words which the horn spake...”

## Slide 32 – Q14: Key Points

- **Parallel Events:**
  - The judgment in Daniel 7 occurs _while history is still unfolding on earth_.
  - It is not the execution of the wicked (which happens later).
- **The Antichrist Spirit:**
  - While heaven is cleansing the sanctuary, earthly powers (“little horn”) are
    still warring against God’s truth with boastful words.

## Slide 33 – Q15: The 2300 Days

- **Question:** When did the angel say this judgment work, called the cleansing
  of the sanctuary would commence?
- **Key Text:** Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand three
  hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Prophetic Calculation

- **Prophetic Time:**
  - A day represents a year in prophecy (Ezekiel 4:6 – “...I have appointed thee
    each day for a year.”).
- **The Timeline:**
  - Begins: **457 B.C.** (Command to restore Jerusalem).
  - Ends: **A.D. 1844**.
- **Cleansing the Sanctuary:**
  - In the earthly service, this was the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)—a day of
    judgment.
  - In 1844, Jesus entered the Most Holy Place to begin the final work of
    atonement.

## Slide 35 – Q15: Application (Cleansing & Faith)

- **Definition of Cleansing:**
  - The removal of the record of sins from the heavenly temple.
  - Corresponds to the blotting out of sins for the believer (Acts 3:19 –
    “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
    out...”).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Just as the sanctuary is cleansed, God cleanses the heart of the believer
    who trusts in Jesus.

## Slide 36 – Q16: The Great Disappointment

- **Question:** What did John do with the little book given him by the angel?
  And what effect did it have upon him?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 10:10 – “And I took the little book out of the
  angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as
  soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points

- **Sweet as Honey:**
  - Believers in the 1840s “ate” the book of Daniel.
  - The hope that Jesus would return in 1844 was sweet; it produced joy and deep
    consecration.
- **Bitter Belly:**
  - When Oct 22, 1844 passed, the sweetness turned to crushing bitterness.
- **The Mistake:**
  - They had the right **time** (1844) but the wrong **event**.
  - They thought the sanctuary was the earth; it was actually in heaven.

## Slide 38 – Q17: Eating the Book

- **Question:** What was symbolized by his eating the book?
- **Key Text:** Ezekiel 3:1 – “Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that
  thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points

- **Internalization:**
  - Eating symbolizes making the message part of one’s very being.
  - The Advent believers did not just study intellectually; they absorbed the
    message.
- **Application (Faith):**
  - Jesus said we must eat His flesh and drink His blood (John 6:53).
  - We must receive Him by faith into our hearts.
  - The message of His coming is only sweet to those who have received His life.

## Slide 40 – Q18: Historical Parallels

- **Question:** Were not the disciples disappointed in their expectations
  concerning Christ's work at His first advent?
- **Key Text:** Acts 1:6 – “When they therefore were come together, they asked
  of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to
  Israel?”
- **Reference:** Luke 24:21 – “But we trusted that it had been he which should
  have redeemed Israel...”

## Slide 41 – Q18: Key Points

- **Misunderstood Prophecy:**
  - The disciples had the correct **Person** and **time** (Daniel 9), but the
    wrong **event**.
  - They expected a kingdom of glory; Christ brought a kingdom of grace.
- **The Cross as Disappointment:**
  - Their hopes were crushed at the cross, yet it was the universe's greatest
    victory.
- **Testing Faith:**
  - God allows disappointment to sift believers.
  - The 1844 disappointment led sincere believers to study deeper, discovering
    the heavenly sanctuary.

## Slide 42 – Q18: Illustration

- **[ILL] The Wrong Train Station:**
  - If you wait for a friend at the airport, but he arrives at the train
    station, you miss him because you are looking in the wrong place.
  - He has arrived, but you don't see him.
  - The Advent believers looked at the “earth” for the cleansing; Jesus went
    into the “Most Holy Place” in heaven.
  - They had to turn their eyes of faith upward.

## Slide 43 – Q19: A New Commission

- **Question:** What did the lord say should afterward be done?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 10:11 – “And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy
  again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.”

## Slide 44 – Q19: Key Points

- **Prophesy Again:**
  - The Great Disappointment was not the end, but a new beginning.
  - They were commissioned to preach the **full** message: the third angel, the
    Sabbath, and the sanctuary.
- **Global Commission:**
  - The message must go to “many peoples and nations.”
  - This birthed the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist mission.

## Slide 45 – Q20: The Fall of Babylon

- **Question:** What message was immediately to follow the proclamation of the
  judgment?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:8 – “And there followed another angel, saying,
  Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
  drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”

## Slide 46 – Q20: Key Points

- **Rejection of Light:**
  - The organized churches rejected the First Angel’s message (the
    judgment/coming King).
  - This rejection resulted in a spiritual fall ("Babylon is fallen").
- **Transition:**
  - They turned from Scripture to human tradition.
  - This leads to the study of the Second Angel's message: identifying Babylon
    and why God calls His people out.
