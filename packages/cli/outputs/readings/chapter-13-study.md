# Reading 13: Christ the Way of Life

## Introduction

Every human being faces the same fundamental problem: we are born sinners, separated from God, and destined for eternal death. Yet into this hopeless condition, God has provided a complete remedy—His own Son. This study explores how Christ becomes not merely our example or teacher, but our very life, and how through faith we may experience the same victory over sin that He demonstrated in human flesh.

## Core Truths

### The Universal Condition of Mankind

Scripture leaves no room for human boasting or self-salvation. The apostle Paul declares plainly:

> _"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."_ (Romans 3:23)

> _"But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin."_ (Galatians 3:22)

This is not merely a description of outward behavior—it is the diagnosis of our very nature. From Adam's fall, every child born into this world has inherited a sinful nature, a bent toward evil, a heart that naturally turns away from God. No amount of education, culture, or moral effort can change this inward corruption.

**Sin** is not simply making mistakes; it is the transgression of God's law of love (1 John 3:4). And the sentence upon all who sin is unequivocal:

> _"The wages of sin is death."_ (Romans 6:23)

Not merely physical death, but eternal separation from the Source of all life. This is justice—for God cannot allow sin to continue forever, destroying His creation and marring His universe.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "come short" in Romans 3:23 is _hystereo_, meaning to fall behind, to lack, to be inferior. It pictures a runner who cannot reach the finish line—no matter how hard we try, we cannot by our own effort attain to God's perfect standard.

### The Gift That Meets Our Need

But the same verse that pronounces death upon sinners also reveals heaven's remedy:

> _"The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)

Notice the contrast: death is earned ("wages"), but life is given ("gift"). We deserve the first; we can never earn the second. Eternal life is not a reward for good behavior—it is a gift flowing from the heart of a loving God who desires not the death of the sinner, but that all should come to repentance (Ezekiel 33:11; 2 Peter 3:9).

> _"This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."_ (1 John 5:11)

Here is a truth of infinite importance: **eternal life is not something separate from Christ—it is in Him.** Life is not a commodity God distributes apart from relationship; it is bound up in the Person of His Son. To have life, we must have Christ. To reject Christ is to reject life itself.

## Deeper Truths

### Christ In You—The Mystery of Godliness

Many professed Christians think of Christ as a distant Savior—someone who died for them two thousand years ago, who now sits far away in heaven. But Scripture reveals something far more intimate and powerful:

> _"He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."_ (1 John 5:12)

> _"Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"_ (2 Corinthians 13:5)

Christ is not merely _for_ us—He is to be _in_ us. This is the great mystery of the gospel: "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27). The question is not merely, "Do you believe _about_ Christ?" but "Is Christ living _in_ you?"

[Q] **"How can Christ literally be 'in' me? Isn't He in heaven?"**

Christ is indeed in heaven, ministering as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1–2). But He is also omnipresent through the Holy Spirit. Jesus promised, "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you" (John 14:18). The Spirit is called "the Spirit of Christ" (Romans 8:9), and through the Spirit, Christ Himself dwells in the believing heart. This is not mere metaphor—it is spiritual reality. Paul testified:

> _"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me."_ (Galatians 2:20)

### From Death to Life—The New Birth

Before conversion, every person is spiritually dead:

> _"God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ."_ (Ephesians 2:4–5)

Dead men cannot save themselves. They cannot even cooperate with their own resurrection. This is why the gospel is such good news—God does for us what we could never do for ourselves. He "quickens" us—makes us alive—together with Christ.

This spiritual resurrection is called **the new birth**:

> _"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever."_ (1 Peter 1:23)

Just as we had nothing to do with our first birth, so the new birth is entirely God's work in us. We cannot manufacture it, earn it, or produce it by religious effort. We can only receive it by faith—opening the heart to Christ and allowing Him to create within us a new nature.

[ILL] Consider a man who has been declared legally dead and lies cold upon a slab. No amount of self-improvement books stacked beside him will bring him to life. No motivational speeches can stir his heart to beat again. He needs _life_ from outside himself—a power that can raise the dead. So it is with every sinner. We do not need better advice; we need resurrection. And that resurrection comes only through Christ.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "born again" (_gennao anothen_) can also mean "born from above." Nicodemus thought Jesus spoke of physical re-entry into the womb (John 3:4), but Jesus was speaking of a spiritual birth that comes down from heaven—a divine work that transforms the soul.

### The Promise Through the Seed

God's plan to restore life to fallen humanity was not an afterthought. Before Adam and Eve left the garden, God announced the remedy:

> _"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."_ (Genesis 3:15)

This first gospel promise pointed to One who would come from the woman's line to crush the serpent's head—to destroy Satan and undo the work of sin. Christ was "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (Revelation 13:8). Before creation began, the Godhead had already devised the plan of redemption.

This promise narrowed through Abraham:

> _"The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land."_ (Genesis 12:7)

> _"And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed."_ (Acts 3:25)

Who is this "seed"? Paul makes it unmistakably clear:

> _"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."_ (Galatians 3:16)

Every promise of God—redemption, inheritance, eternal life—flows through Christ alone. Abraham believed this promise, and his faith was "counted unto him for righteousness" (Romans 4:3). The patriarch was not saved by law-keeping but by faith in the coming Redeemer—the same faith that saves us today.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Why the Law Cannot Save

If righteousness could come through human obedience to the law, then Christ died for nothing:

> _"If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."_ (Galatians 2:21)

The law is holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12). It reveals God's character and shows us our sin. But it has no power to save the sinner or transform the heart. The law is like a mirror—it shows the dirt on our face, but it cannot wash it away. For cleansing, we need water; for salvation, we need Christ.

> _"But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe."_ (Galatians 3:22)

God has enclosed all humanity under the verdict of sin—not to condemn us hopelessly, but to drive us to Christ as our only hope. When we see that all human effort is bankrupt, we are ready to receive the gift of righteousness by faith.

### Christ Our Way, Truth, and Life

> _"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me."_ (John 14:6)

Christ is not merely _a_ way among many—He is _the_ way. He is not merely a teacher of truth—He is _the_ truth incarnate. He is not merely pointing to life—He _is_ the life. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Colossians 2:9). To come to God, we must come through Christ. There is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12).

### The Victory Christ Achieved—And Offers to Us

Here we touch upon a truth of immense practical importance for victorious Christian living. Why did Christ take human flesh?

> _"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil."_ (Hebrews 2:14)

Christ did not take the nature of angels; He took the nature of Abraham's seed (Hebrews 2:16). He was "made like unto His brethren" in all things, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest (Hebrews 2:17). He was "in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15).

**This means Christ faced every temptation we face—from within the same fallen, weakened human nature we inherit—and overcame.** He did not overcome through divine power unavailable to us, but through the same means offered to every believer: faith in the Father, dependence upon the Holy Spirit, and the word of God.

[Q] **"Are you saying Christ had a sinful nature like ours?"**

Scripture is clear that Christ "knew no sin" (2 Corinthians 5:21) and "in Him is no sin" (1 John 3:5). He never committed a single sinful act, thought, or motive. But He _inherited_ the same weakened, fallen human nature that has come down through four thousand years of hereditary weakness since Adam. The virgin Mary was not immaculate; she was a descendant of sinful Adam, and Jesus received human nature through her.

This truth does not diminish Christ's holiness—it magnifies His victory and makes Him our true helper. If Christ took a nature different from ours, He cannot be our example in overcoming. But because He faced every inherited tendency to sin that we face—and overcame by divine power working in humanity—He stands as proof that sin can be conquered in human flesh.

> _"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne."_ (Revelation 3:21)

Christ overcame in human flesh. Now He offers the same victory to every soul who receives Him by faith.

[ILL] Imagine a man in a deep pit, unable to climb out. A rescuer comes, but instead of descending into the pit, he stands at the edge and shouts instructions. "Climb up!" he calls. "Here's how I would do it!" But the man cannot climb. Now imagine a second rescuer who descends into the pit himself, stands beside the trapped man, and then by his own strength lifts him out. This is what Christ has done. He did not stand at a distance and tell us how to live. He descended into the pit of our fallen humanity, overcame where we have failed, and now offers to lift us out by His own indwelling life.

### The Sanctuary Connection

Christ's work as the Way of Life is beautifully illustrated in the sanctuary:

- **The outer court** with its altar of sacrifice points to Christ's death on the cross—the foundation of our salvation, where the penalty of sin was paid.
- **The holy place** with its candlestick, table of shewbread, and altar of incense represents Christ's ongoing ministry in us—His light (John 8:12), His word as our daily bread (John 6:35), and His intercession (Romans 8:34).
- **The most holy place** points to Christ's final work of atonement, when every trace of sin is blotted out and God's people are sealed with His character—fully prepared for His return.

The entire sanctuary teaches one message: Christ is our life, from justification at the cross to final glorification when He appears.

## Practical Application

### What Does This Mean for Daily Living?

1. **Stop trying to save yourself.** No amount of good works, religious observance, or moral improvement can earn eternal life. Righteousness is a gift received by faith, not a wage earned by performance. Rest in Christ.

2. **Receive Christ by faith—daily.** Faith is not a one-time decision made years ago. It is a present, living connection with Christ maintained moment by moment. Each morning, open your heart anew to His indwelling presence. "He that hath the Son hath life"—do you have Him today?

3. **Feed upon the Word.** The new birth comes "by the word of God" (1 Peter 1:23). Christ dwells in us through faith, and faith comes by hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17). Daily Bible study is not optional—it is the means by which Christ's life flows into us.

4. **Believe that victory over sin is possible.** Christ overcame every temptation in human flesh. The same power is available to you through His indwelling Spirit. You need not remain defeated by habits, temper, lust, or any besetting sin. "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13).

5. **Live by faith, not by feeling.** Galatians 2:20 says Paul lived "by the faith of the Son of God." Faith is not an emotion; it is taking God at His word regardless of feelings. When temptation comes, claim by faith that Christ lives in you and that His strength is made perfect in your weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9).

## Appeal

The invitation of heaven stands open to every soul:

> _"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."_ (Revelation 22:17)

"Whosoever will"—there are no exceptions. The gift of eternal life in Christ is offered to you today. But notice the condition: you must _come_. You must _take_. This is the response of faith—not earning, but receiving; not working, but trusting.

Are you weary of struggling in your own strength? Have you tried again and again to overcome sin, only to fail? Christ invites you to stop trying and start trusting. Let Him live His life in you. Let His victory become your victory.

> _"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."_ (Galatians 3:26)

> _"If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ."_ (Romans 8:17)

Think of it—heirs of God! Joint-heirs with Christ! Everything that belongs to Christ becomes yours through faith: His righteousness, His victory, His inheritance, His eternal life. Will you receive Him today?

The way is open. The truth is revealed. The life is offered. Christ Himself stands at the door of your heart and knocks. "If any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him" (Revelation 3:20).

Open the door. Let Christ in. And you will have life—abundant, victorious, eternal.
