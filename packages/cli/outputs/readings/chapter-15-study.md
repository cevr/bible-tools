### Q1. To what is the Christian's hope likened?

"That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we
might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the
hope set before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil." Hebrews 6:18, 19.

**Answer:**

The Bible likens the Christian’s hope to an **anchor**. In the storms of life
and the tempests of temptation, the believer is not left to drift aimlessly but
is secured by a connection to heaven itself.

- **A Sure and Steadfast Anchor:** Unlike a ship’s anchor that grips the
  shifting sands of the ocean floor, our spiritual anchor is cast upward. It is
  "sure and steadfast" because it does not depend on our fluctuating feelings or
  weak human performance, but on the "immutable" (unchangeable) promise and oath
  of God.
- **Within the Veil:** This is a vital truth for the Advent believer. The "veil"
  refers to the entrance into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary. Our
  hope is anchored in Christ, our High Priest, who has entered the very presence
  of God to minister His blood on our behalf (Hebrews 9:11–12, 24).
- **Consolation and Refuge:** We are described as those who have "fled for
  refuge." Just as the ancient Israelite fled to a City of Refuge to escape the
  avenger (Numbers 35), the sinner flees to Christ to escape the condemnation of
  the law and the guilt of sin.

**Definitions:**

- **Immutable:** Unchangeable; permanent. God's character and His promises
  cannot change (Malachi 3:6).
- **The Sanctuary:** The dwelling place of God. The earthly tabernacle was a
  model of the true tabernacle in heaven where Christ now ministers for us
  (Hebrews 8:1–2).

**[ILL]** Imagine a ship caught in a violent hurricane. If the captain throws
the anchor onto the deck of the ship, it provides no stability. The anchor must
grapple with something outside the ship, something immovable. Similarly, if we
place our hope in our own works, our own feelings, or our own strength (the
"deck" of our lives), we will drift. We must cast our hope outside of ourselves,
hooking it securely into the Throne of God "within the veil."

### Q2. What is the Christian's hope called?

"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and
our Saviour Jesus Christ." Titus 2:13.

**Answer:**

The Scriptures designate the return of our Lord as the **"blessed hope."** This
is the climax of the plan of salvation and the central expectation of the church
throughout the ages.

- **The Glorious Appearing:** This hope is not merely for death or a disembodied
  existence in heaven, but for the literal, visible, and personal return of
  Jesus Christ. It is the "glorious appearing" that will bring an end to the
  reign of sin and death (1 Thessalonians 4:16–17).
- **The Great God and Saviour:** This verse powerfully affirms the deity of
  Christ. We are not waiting for a mere man or angel, but for the Creator
  Himself to come and claim His purchased possession.
- **The Focus of the Heart:** To the believer who understands the Great
  Controversy, this world offers no permanent satisfaction. The heart longs for
  the restoration of all things, which can only occur at the Second Advent.

**[ILL]** A bride who is separated from her bridegroom by a long war does not
merely hope for a letter or a gift; her "blessed hope" is the day he walks
through the door, and they are reunited forever. The church is the bride, and
Christ is the Bridegroom. Our hope is His personal presence.

### Q3. At what time did Paul expect to realize this hope?

"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord,
the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all
them also that love His appearing." 2 Timothy 4:8.

**Answer:**

Paul expected to receive his reward not at the moment of death, but **"at that
day"**—the day of Christ's appearing (the Second Coming).

- **Laid Up:** The crown is currently "laid up" (reserved/stored) in heaven.
  This confirms that the righteous dead are currently sleeping in Jesus,
  awaiting the resurrection morning to receive their reward (1 Thessalonians
  4:13–16; John 14:1–3).
- **The Crown of Righteousness:** This crown represents the victory of the
  gospel. It is not a crown of human merit, but of _righteousness_.
  - **Imputed Righteousness:** We have a title to heaven because of what Jesus
    did _for_ us (Romans 4:22–24).
  - **Imparted Righteousness:** Through the Spirit, God fits us for heaven by
    working _in_ us, enabling us to "love His appearing" and live in harmony
    with His law (Philippians 2:13).
- **The Righteous Judge:** The judgment is not to be feared by those in Christ.
  The Judge is also the Saviour who has covered them with His own robe of
  righteousness (Isaiah 61:10).

**Definitions:**

- **Righteousness by Faith:** The experience where a sinner is declared right
  with God through faith in Jesus (Justification) and is transformed into
  Christ’s image by the Holy Spirit (Sanctification).

### Q4. What is said of the hope of the wicked?

"So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be as a spider's web." Job
8:13, 14.

**Answer:**

The hope of those who forget God, and specifically the hope of the hypocrite, is
described as **fragile, temporary, and destined to perish.**

- **The Spider's Web:** A spider's web is an intricate work of engineering,
  often beautiful to behold, but it possesses no structural strength. It can be
  swept away by a single stroke of a broom or a gust of wind.
- **False Assurance:** The hypocrite may outwardly appear religious and may even
  believe they are saved. However, because their hope is built on
  self-righteousness, outward forms, or presumption rather than a surrendered
  relationship with Christ, it cannot withstand the judgment or the storms of
  the last days (Matthew 7:26–27).
- **Forgetting God:** The root of this false hope is "forgetting God." When men
  forget God’s law and His justice, they invent a false gospel that promises
  peace where there is no peace (Jeremiah 6:14).

**[ILL]** A man may build a beautiful house on a frozen lake in the middle of
winter. It may feel solid for a season. But when spring comes and the ice melts,
the foundation vanishes, and the house sinks. The hope of the wicked is built on
the "ice" of this temporary world, not the Rock of Ages.

### Q5. What will be accomplished by him who hath the Christian's hope?

"And every man that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself, even as He is
pure." 1 John 3:3.

**Answer:**

The genuine hope of seeing Jesus produces **personal purity and holiness of
life.** It is impossible to truly hold the Advent hope while clinging to willful
sin.

- **The Effect of Hope:** Biblical hope is not a passive waiting; it is an
  active, purifying agent. If we expect to live in a sinless heaven with a holy
  God, we will—by God’s grace—seek to live a holy life now.
- **"Purifieth Himself":** This does not mean we save ourselves or scrub away
  our own sins (only the blood of Jesus can do that). It means we _cooperate_
  with God's work of sanctification. We choose to put away known sins, we guard
  our thoughts, and we separate from the corruptions of the world (2 Corinthians
  7:1).
- **"Even as He is Pure":** The standard is not the culture around us, or other
  church members, but Jesus Christ Himself. God’s plan is to restore the moral
  image of God in man.
- **Victory over Sin:** This verse teaches clearly that a believer, through the
  power of the indwelling Christ, can and must turn away from iniquity. We are
  to be "partakers of the divine nature," escaping the corruption that is in the
  world (2 Peter 1:4).

**Definitions:**

- **Sanctification:** The process by which the Holy Spirit makes the believer
  holy, setting them apart for God's use and character development (1
  Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]** If you were invited to meet a King or a President tomorrow, you would
wash, groom yourself, and put on your best clothes. You would prepare yourself
to be in their presence. How much more, if we expect to see the King of Kings,
should we wash our robes of character in the blood of the Lamb?

### Q6. How is he accounted whose hope is in God?

"Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord
his God." Psalm 146:5. "Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose
hope the Lord is." Jeremiah 17:7.

**Answer:**

The person whose hope is anchored in Jehovah is accounted **happy** and
**blessed.**

- **The God of Jacob:** The use of "Jacob" here is encouraging. Jacob was a
  deceiver who wrestled with God and became "Israel" (a prince with God). He
  represents the struggling sinner who prevails by faith. God is the helper of
  the helpless.
- **Source of Happiness:** True happiness is not found in wealth, political
  power ("put not your trust in princes" - v. 3), or health, all of which can
  vanish. Happiness (blessedness) is the serene security of knowing that the
  Creator of heaven and earth is your Help.
- **Total Dependence:** Jeremiah 17 contrasts the man who trusts in man (who is
  like a heath in the desert) with the man who trusts in the Lord (who is like a
  tree planted by waters). The blessed man draws his life and vitality directly
  from God.

### Q7. In what may the child of God abound?

"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may
abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost." Romans 15:13.

**Answer:**

The believer is privileged to **abound in hope.** This means to have an
overflowing measure, more than enough to survive the trials of the day.

- **The Source:** It is the "God of hope" who gives this gift. Hope is not a
  human temperament; it is a divine grace.
- **Joy and Peace in Believing:** Notice the order: We believe (faith), and God
  fills us with joy and peace. The result of this filling is an "abounding"
  hope. Doubt destroys peace; faith builds it.
- **Power of the Holy Ghost:** We cannot manufacture this hope. It is the
  specific work of the Third Person of the Godhead to impress the reality of
  heaven upon the human mind. When we are filled with the Spirit, hope is the
  natural fruit.

---

### Q8. In what may he rejoice?

"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and
rejoice in hope of the glory of God." Romans 5:2.

**Answer:**

The Christian rejoices in the **hope of the glory of God.**

- **Access by Faith:** Through Jesus, the door to the Father is open. We do not
  stand outside trembling; we have "access" to the throne of grace (Hebrews
  4:16).
- **Grace Wherein We Stand:** This refers to our standing in Justification. We
  stand acquited, clothed in Christ’s righteousness. This gives us the firm
  footing to rejoice.
- **The Glory of God:**
  1.  **Future:** We hope for the day we will see His visible glory.
  2.  **Character:** We hope for the restoration of God’s glory (His character)
      within us. "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27).

**Definitions:**

- **Justification:** God's legal declaration that a repentant sinner is
  righteous, based solely on the merits of Christ's sacrifice (Romans 3:24).

---

### Q9. When the love of God fills the heart, what is the result?

"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us." Romans 5:5.

**Answer:**

The result is that **hope maketh not ashamed** (or, hope does not disappoint
us).

- **No Disappointment:** Worldly hopes often end in shame and disappointment. A
  man hopes for a promotion and doesn't get it; he hopes for wealth and loses
  it. But the Christian hope will never lead to shame, because the object of
  that hope (Jesus) is faithful.
- **Internal Evidence:** How do we know our hope is real? Because the "love of
  God is shed abroad in our hearts." The Holy Spirit gives us an experiential
  knowledge of God's love. This internal witness gives us bold assurance that we
  belong to Him.
- **Boldness:** Because we are not ashamed, we are willing to confess Christ
  before men, regardless of the cost.

**[ILL]** A child waiting for a parent to pick them up from school is not
ashamed to wait, because they know their parent's love and character. They know
the parent will come. The Holy Spirit assures us of the Father's love, so we
wait for Him without embarrassment or fear of abandonment.

### Q10. In the time of trouble, who will be the hope of the righteous?

"The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem, and
the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the Lord will be the hope of His
people, and the strength of the children of Israel." Joel 3:16.

**Answer:**

In the final great crisis of earth's history, **the Lord Himself** will be the
hope and harbor of His people.

- **The Shaking:** The verse describes the physical and social upheaval of the
  last days—the "time of trouble" such as never was (Daniel 12:1). When earthly
  governments, economies, and the very laws of nature seem to fail, every human
  support will be removed.
- **The Hope (Harbor):** The marginal reading for "hope" in this text is often
  "place of repair" or "harbor." When the world is in chaos, God is the storm
  shelter for those who have kept His commandments and the faith of Jesus
  (Revelation 14:12).
- **Voice from Zion:** This points to God's deliverance of His people at the
  very end of time, declaring the covenant of peace with those who have sought
  refuge in the Sanctuary of His mercy.

**Sanctuary Connection:** The voice comes from "Zion" and "Jerusalem"—symbolic
of the heavenly seat of government. It is from the throne of judgment that
deliverance comes for those covered by the Atonement.

### Q11. What inspiring words are spoken to such as hope in God?

"Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the
Lord." Psalm 31:24.

**Answer:**

The command is to **"Be of good courage."**

- **Divine Strengthening:** The promise is that if we maintain our courage and
  refuse to let go of our hope, God "shall strengthen your heart." He imparts
  supernatural endurance to the weary.
- **Active Waiting:** Hope is not passivity. It requires "courage." It takes
  courage to obey God when the world disobeys. It takes courage to keep the
  Sabbath when others work. It takes courage to believe in the Second Coming
  when scoffers say, "Where is the promise of his coming?" (2 Peter 3:3–4).
- **To All:** This promise is universal to "all ye that hope in the Lord." No
  one is excluded from this source of strength if their hope is in Him.

### Q12. What has the resurrection of Jesus Christ wrought for us?

"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His
abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of
Jesus Christ from the dead." 1 Peter 1:3.

**Answer:**

The resurrection of Jesus has **begotten us again** (given us new birth) unto a
**"lively hope"** (a living hope).

- **A Living Hope:** Our hope is not in a dead philosophy or a past historical
  figure, but in a living Man—Jesus Christ—who conquered the grave. Because He
  lives, we shall live also (John 14:19).
- **The Guarantee:** The resurrection of Jesus is the receipt, or the guarantee,
  that the sacrifice was accepted and that the grave cannot hold those who die
  in the Lord.
- **New Birth:** Peter connects the resurrection with being "begotten again."
  The power that raised Christ from the dead is the same power that raises a
  sinner from the death of sin to a new life of righteousness (Ephesians
  1:19–20; Romans 6:4).

**Definitions:**

- **Lively:** Old English for "living," "active," or "vigorous."

---

### Q13. How long should the Christian's hope endure?

"And we desire that everyone of you do show the same diligence to the full
assurance of hope unto the end." Hebrews 6:11.

**Answer:**

The Christian's hope must endure **"unto the end."**

- **Perseverance:** The Bible does not teach that a single act of faith
  guarantees salvation regardless of future choices. We are called to hold fast
  the confidence of our hope firm unto the end (Hebrews 3:14).
- **Diligence:** Spiritual drift is dangerous. It takes "diligence"—consistent
  effort in prayer, study, and obedience—to maintain the "full assurance of
  hope."
- **Full Assurance:** God does not want us to live in doubt. He wants us to have
  full assurance. But this assurance grows as we walk daily with Jesus.

**[ILL]** A runner does not win the race by starting well. He wins by crossing
the finish line. Many start the Christian life with joy, but when trials come,
they drop out. The crown is for the finisher (2 Timothy 4:7).

---

### Q14. What end is referred to?

"Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the
grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." 1 Peter
1:13.

**Answer:**

The "end" referred to is the **revelation of Jesus Christ** (His Second Coming).

- **Gird Up the Loins of Your Mind:** In Bible times, men wore long robes. To
  run or work, they had to tuck ("gird") their robes into a belt to move freely.
  Mentally, this means we must gather up our loose thoughts, discipline our
  minds, and focus on truth. We cannot allow our minds to be entangled with the
  trivialities of the world.
- **Be Sober:** This implies spiritual alertness and temperance. We must avoid
  the intoxication of worldly pleasure and false doctrine.
- **Grace at the Revelation:** While we receive grace now to overcome sin, there
  is a final bestowal of grace when Jesus returns—the grace of glorification,
  where this mortal puts on immortality (1 Corinthians 15:53). We are to look to
  _that_ day as the goal.
