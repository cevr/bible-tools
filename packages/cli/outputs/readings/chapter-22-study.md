# Reading 22: God's Willingness to Forgive

## Introduction

One of the most astonishing truths in all of Scripture is that the infinite God of the universe desires to forgive sinners. Not reluctantly, not partially, but eagerly, fully, and abundantly. This study explores the overwhelming evidence that God's heart yearns to pardon every repentant soul—a truth that, when truly grasped, transforms our understanding of His character and our response to His grace.

## Core Truths

### God Does Not Treat Us as We Deserve

> _"He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him."_ (Psalm 103:10-11)

Here is the foundation of all hope for sinners: **God does not give us what we deserve**. Justice would demand punishment; mercy offers pardon. The psalmist uses the most vast measurement he can conceive—the immeasurable distance between heaven and earth—to illustrate the magnitude of God's mercy.

**Mercy**: God's compassionate disposition to withhold deserved punishment and extend kindness to the undeserving (Ephesians 2:4-5).

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "mercy" (_chesed_) in Psalm 103:11 refers to God's covenant love—a loyal, steadfast, pursuing affection that does not let go. It appears over 240 times in the Old Testament, revealing this as one of God's most prominent characteristics.

### God Is Ready—Even Eager—to Forgive

> _"For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee."_ (Psalm 86:5)

Notice the word **"ready."** God is not reluctant, not hesitant, not waiting to be persuaded. He stands prepared, willing, longing to pardon. And His mercy is not measured out sparingly—it is "plenteous," overflowing, more than sufficient for the greatest sinner.

[Q] **"But doesn't God's justice require that sin be punished? How can He simply forgive?"**

This is precisely why the cross is so essential. God does not overlook sin or pretend it never happened. His justice is fully satisfied in Christ's sacrifice. _"He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins"_ (1 John 1:9)—note that forgiveness flows from both God's faithfulness to His promises _and_ His justice, now satisfied at Calvary. The cross reveals that mercy and justice meet in perfect harmony (Psalm 85:10).

## Deeper Truths

### Historical Evidence of God's Forgiving Heart

Scripture provides powerful testimonies of God's willingness to forgive even in the most difficult circumstances:

**Abraham's Intercession for Sodom** (Genesis 18:32)

When Abraham pleaded for the wicked city of Sodom, bargaining down from fifty righteous to ten, God agreed to each request. This remarkable dialogue reveals that God was more willing to spare than to destroy—He never said "no" to Abraham's appeals. The patriarch stopped asking before God stopped granting.

**Moses and Rebellious Israel** (Numbers 14:19-20)

After Israel's great sin of unbelief at Kadesh-Barnea, Moses pleaded: _"Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of Thy mercy."_ God's response was immediate: _"I have pardoned according to Thy word."_ A nation that had repeatedly murmured, doubted, and rebelled received instant pardon upon intercession.

**David's Adultery and Murder** (Psalm 32:5)

David committed adultery with Bathsheba and murdered Uriah—grievous sins against God and man. Yet when he acknowledged his transgression: _"Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin."_ The language suggests instantaneous forgiveness. David did not serve a probationary period; forgiveness came with confession.

[DYK🔎] Psalm 32 and Psalm 51 both record David's experience of repentance and restoration. Jewish tradition holds that these were written after Nathan confronted David, revealing that true confession leads to full restoration, though consequences in this life may remain (2 Samuel 12:13-14).

### The Condition and Completeness of Forgiveness

> _"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."_ (1 John 1:9)

**Confess**: The Greek word _homologeo_ means "to say the same thing"—to agree with God about our sin, calling it what He calls it, without excuse or minimization.

God's forgiveness accomplishes two things:

1. **Forgiveness**—the guilt is removed
2. **Cleansing**—the defilement is washed away

This is not merely legal pardon; it is moral purification. God's forgiveness addresses both our standing before His law _and_ our condition of heart.

> _"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon."_ (Isaiah 55:7)

**Abundantly pardon**: The Hebrew literally suggests God will "multiply to pardon" or "greatly multiply forgiveness." However great our sins, His pardoning mercy is greater still.

[ILL] Consider a child who has broken her father's treasured possession through disobedience. Trembling, she approaches him, expecting anger, punishment, rejection. Instead, he gathers her in his arms, wipes her tears, and whispers, "I forgive you completely." The broken object cannot be restored, but the relationship is—and more: through her experience of his grace, her love for him deepens beyond what it was before. So God deals with repentant sinners. Our sin grieves His heart, but His response to genuine confession is embrace, not rejection.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Cross: Ultimate Proof of God's Forgiving Heart

> _"But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."_ (Romans 5:8)

Here is evidence that silences every doubt about God's willingness to forgive. He did not wait for us to reform, to prove ourselves worthy, to earn His favor. **While we were yet sinners**—enemies, rebels, lost—Christ died for us.

> _"He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?"_ (Romans 8:32)

Paul's logic is irresistible: If God gave the greatest gift (His Son), will He withhold lesser gifts (forgiveness, grace, eternal life)? The cross proves that nothing we need will be denied to those who come to Him in faith.

### The Sanctuary and Forgiveness

In the earthly sanctuary, the daily sacrifices revealed God's provision for the forgiven sinner. Each morning and evening, a lamb was offered—pointing to the "Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). The repentant Israelite who brought his sacrifice and confessed his sin over the victim's head received assurance of pardon.

This pointed forward to Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary. As our High Priest, He presents the merits of His sacrifice before the Father, ever living to intercede for us (Hebrews 7:25). When we confess our sins, Christ applies His blood to our account, and the record stands: forgiven.

**Justification**: God's legal declaration that the repentant sinner is righteous because of Christ's merits applied to their account (Romans 3:24; 5:1).

[DYK🔎] In the sanctuary service, the priest would eat a portion of the sin offering, symbolically bearing the sin of the worshiper (Leviticus 10:17). This illustrated how our sins would be borne by Christ, our great High Priest, who "bare our sins in His own body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24).

### Why God Waits: His Longsuffering Heart

> _"The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."_ (2 Peter 3:9)

Some wonder why God delays His return, why He permits sin to continue. Peter answers: **He is not willing that any should perish.** Every day that passes is another day of grace, another opportunity for sinners to repent, another testimony to God's patient, forgiving heart.

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, God's character has been maligned. Satan has portrayed Him as severe, exacting, unforgiving. Every act of divine mercy, every pardoned sinner, every restored backslider testifies against Satan's lies and reveals God's true nature.

## The Parable of the Prodigal: A Portrait of the Father's Heart

> _"But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."_ (Luke 15:20)

Christ's parable of the prodigal son reveals the Father's heart toward returning sinners:

- **"A great way off"**—The son had only begun his journey home; the father did not wait for him to arrive
- **"His father saw him"**—The father had been watching, waiting, longing for his son's return
- **"Had compassion"**—His heart was moved with tender mercy
- **"Ran"**—In ancient Middle Eastern culture, a dignified man never ran; the father abandoned his dignity in his eagerness to reach his son
- **"Fell on his neck, and kissed him"**—Before a word of confession, the son was embraced

The son had prepared a speech: "Make me as one of thy hired servants" (Luke 15:19). But the father interrupted with commands for the best robe, a ring, sandals, a feast. The returning sinner received not the servant's status he requested but the son's position he had forfeited.

[Q] **"But isn't this parable teaching cheap grace? The son doesn't have to change?"**

Notice what the parable _does_ show: the son "came to himself" (v. 17), took full responsibility—"I have sinned" (v. 18)—and actually returned. Repentance involves a change of mind that leads to a change of direction. The father's forgiveness was free, but the son's repentance was real. And consider: after experiencing such overwhelming grace, would this son ever be the same? Would he not serve his father from love rather than duty? This is the power of forgiveness understood—it transforms the forgiven one.

## Practical Application

### God's Forgiveness Applied to Your Life

**Understanding**: God's willingness to forgive is not in question. The cross has settled it. Whatever your sin, however many times you have failed, however far you have wandered—He is ready, willing, eager to pardon you completely.

**Response**:

- **Come as you are.** You need not clean yourself up first. The prodigal was received in his rags, with the smell of the pigsty still upon him.
- **Be specific in confession.** Call your sin what God calls it. Do not minimize, excuse, or blame others.
- **Believe His promise.** "Everyone that asketh receiveth" (Matthew 7:8). Faith takes God at His word.
- **Rest in His unchanging character.** Even a mother may forget her nursing child, but God will not forget you (Isaiah 49:15).

**Growth**: Having received such mercy, extend it to others. "Forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you" (Ephesians 4:32). Let the experience of divine forgiveness soften your heart toward those who sin against you.

### Overcoming Doubt

Some struggle to believe they are truly forgiven. They feel their sins are too great, too repeated, too shameful. To such souls, God speaks:

> _"How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"_ (Luke 11:13)

If sinful earthly parents know how to give good gifts to their children, **how much more** will the holy, loving Father give to those who ask? Your feelings may doubt, but God's Word stands sure. Rest on His promise, not your emotions.

## Appeal

> _"Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee."_ (Isaiah 49:15)

Beloved, the evidence is overwhelming. From Genesis to Revelation, from Abraham's intercession to the prodigal's embrace, God has demonstrated His willingness—His eagerness—to forgive.

Have you been keeping distance from Him, fearing rejection? He sees you while you are "yet a great way off" and runs to meet you.

Have you been trusting in your own worthiness? Come with empty hands, for He alone provides the "best robe" of Christ's righteousness.

Have you fallen into the same sin again and again? He is "plenteous in mercy" and will "abundantly pardon."

The invitation stands open. The Father watches. The feast is prepared. The only question remaining is: **Will you come?**

> _"Everyone that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened."_ (Matthew 7:8)

Come to Him today. Confess your sins fully. Believe His forgiveness completely. And go forth to live in the joy of a pardoned child of God.
