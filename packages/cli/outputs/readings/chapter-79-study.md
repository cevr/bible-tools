# Reading 79: Law and Gospel

## Introduction

One of the most profound truths in Scripture is the harmonious relationship between God's law and His gospel of grace. Far from being opponents, these two pillars of divine truth work together in perfect unity to accomplish heaven's great purpose: the salvation and restoration of fallen humanity. Understanding how law and gospel complement each other unlocks the very heart of the plan of redemption.

## Core Truths

### The Gospel: God's Power to Save

The apostle Paul boldly declared: _"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth"_ (Romans 1:16).

The word "gospel" means "good news"—and what better news could there be than salvation from sin and death? When the angels announced Christ's birth to the shepherds, they proclaimed: _"Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord"_ (Luke 2:10–11).

**Saviour**: One who rescues, delivers, and preserves from danger—in this case, from the eternal consequences of sin (Matthew 1:21).

The angel Gabriel explained exactly what Jesus would do: _"He shall save His people from their sins"_ (Matthew 1:21). Notice carefully—not **in** their sins, but **from** their sins. Christ came not merely to forgive sin's penalty but to break sin's power over the believer.

`[DYK🔎]` The name "Jesus" is the Greek form of the Hebrew "Joshua," meaning "Jehovah saves." Every time we speak His name, we proclaim the gospel!

### One Saviour for All Ages

A crucial truth often overlooked is that Christ's salvation reaches backward as well as forward in time. Scripture declares: _"And for this cause He is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance"_ (Hebrews 9:15).

The blood of Christ availed for believers in the old dispensation precisely as it does in the new. Consider:

- **Abel** offered sacrifice "by faith" (Hebrews 11:4)—faith in what? In the coming Lamb of God.
- **Abraham** had the gospel preached to him (Galatians 3:8).
- **Melchisedec** served as "priest of the most high God" (Hebrews 7:1), ministering for sin long before Moses.

The first promise given to fallen humanity—that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head (Genesis 3:15)—was as truly the gospel of Jesus Christ as the angels' song over Bethlehem: _"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men"_ (Luke 2:14).

`[ILL]` Imagine a great bridge spanning a chasm. Those who crossed from the eastern side trusted its strength just as surely as those who crossed from the west. So Christ's sacrifice is the one bridge from earth to heaven, and all who have ever been saved—whether they looked forward to the cross or backward to it—crossed by faith in the same Saviour.

## Deeper Truths

### The Law: Revealer of Sin

If the gospel is God's remedy for sin, the law is the divine standard that reveals what sin is. Scripture is emphatic: _"By the law is the knowledge of sin"_ (Romans 3:20). Paul testified: _"I had not known sin, but by the law"_ (Romans 7:7).

Even in the earliest ages, people understood sin. Abimelech rebuked Abraham: _"What hast thou done unto us? ... thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin"_ (Genesis 20:9). The men of Sodom "were sinners before the LORD exceedingly" (Genesis 13:13). How did they know they were sinners? By the moral law of God, which has existed from the beginning.

`[Q]` **"Wasn't the law only given at Sinai? How could people before Moses know about sin?"**

The formal codification of God's law at Sinai was not its first existence. Romans 5:13–14 shows that sin—and therefore law—existed from Adam to Moses. God's moral principles are eternal reflections of His unchanging character (Psalm 119:89, 142, 160). At Sinai, God wrote in stone what had always been true in heaven.

### Christ's Relationship to the Law

When Jesus came, did He intend to abolish the law to make salvation easier? He answered this question directly:

> _"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."_ (Matthew 5:17)

**To fulfil** (Greek: _pleroo_): To fill up, complete, carry out the full intent and design of something.

The law was "ordained to life" (Romans 7:10). Had man never broken it, he would have lived eternally without need of a Saviour. Christ came to fulfil the law—to carry out its life-giving purpose—by providing righteousness for all who believe.

Consider this carefully: If the law could simply be abolished after man broke it, there would be no need for Christ. It is the law alone that condemns the sinner to death. If the condemning instrument could be removed, man would live without a Saviour. But God's law, being a transcript of His eternal character, cannot be altered or abolished. Therefore, an atonement had to be made before the law, in behalf of the sinner.

Christ declared the law's permanence: _"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled"_ (Matthew 5:18).

`[DYK🔎]` A "jot" (Hebrew _yod_) is the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet—a tiny mark like an apostrophe. A "tittle" is an even smaller decorative stroke that distinguishes similar Hebrew letters. Jesus was saying that not the smallest detail of God's law would ever be changed!

### Faith Establishes the Law

Here is where law and gospel unite beautifully. Paul asks and answers a pivotal question:

> _"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."_ (Romans 3:31)

**Establish** (Greek: _histemi_): To cause to stand firm, to uphold, to confirm.

True faith in Christ does not weaken or annul God's law—it upholds and confirms it! How? By providing what the law demands but could never produce: a righteous standing before God and the power to live a righteous life.

`[ILL]` A man deeply in debt cannot escape his obligation by tearing up the record of what he owes. The debt remains. But if a wealthy friend pays the full amount on his behalf, the debt is satisfied—not ignored. So Christ does not erase God's law but satisfies its claims against us by His perfect life and atoning death. The law stands vindicated; the sinner goes free.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary: Where Law and Gospel Meet

In the sanctuary service, God beautifully illustrated the relationship between law and gospel. Inside the ark of the covenant, in the Most Holy Place, rested the Ten Commandments—the unchanging standard of righteousness. Above the law was the mercy seat, where blood was sprinkled on the Day of Atonement.

This arrangement teaches profound truth:

- **The law** (beneath) represents God's unchanging, eternal standard
- **The mercy seat** (above) represents God's grace provided through sacrifice
- **The blood** (between) represents Christ's atonement, satisfying the law's claims while extending mercy to the repentant sinner

God's throne rests upon righteousness (the law) and mercy (the gospel). Neither can be separated from the other. The great controversy between Christ and Satan centers on whether God's law is just and whether it can be kept. Christ's life and death answered both questions—the law is perfect, and through His grace, His people can be made "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4) and walk in newness of life.

### One Lawgiver, One Advocate

Scripture is clear: _"There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy"_ (James 4:12). The same God who gave the law also provided the Saviour. And that Saviour now serves as our Advocate: _"If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous"_ (1 John 2:1).

**Advocate** (Greek: _parakletos_): One called alongside to help, a defender, an intercessor who pleads another's case.

Jesus stands in heaven's courtroom, not to argue that the law should be changed, but to plead His own merits on behalf of those who trust Him. His blood speaks better things than the blood of Abel (Hebrews 12:24). The law that condemns the sinner is satisfied by the Saviour who died for him.

`[Q]` **"If Christ is my Advocate, does it matter how I live?"**

The same verse that calls Christ our Advocate begins with an important condition: _"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not"_ (1 John 2:1). Christ's advocacy is not a license to continue in sin but provision for those who are earnestly striving to overcome. The goal is not sinning less but ceasing from sin altogether—and this Christ makes possible through His indwelling life (Galatians 2:20; Philippians 4:13).

## Practical Application

### The Final Generation

In Revelation's closing message to the world, law and gospel stand united in God's remnant people:

> _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:12)

Notice both elements:

1. **The commandments of God**—the unchanging moral law
2. **The faith of Jesus**—not merely faith _in_ Jesus, but the very faith _of_ Jesus reproduced in His followers

This is the description of the final generation who will stand through the time of trouble without a mediator. They will demonstrate before the universe that God's law can be kept by fallen human beings through the power of Christ dwelling within.

### What This Means for You

There is no salvation in the law itself. The law has no redeeming quality—it can only reveal sin and condemn the sinner. Redemption comes solely through the blood of Christ.

A sinner may cease breaking God's commandments and strive with all his powers to keep them, but this will not atone for past sins or redeem him from his fallen condition. The hope of eternal salvation hangs upon Christ alone.

- **Adam** hung his hope there
- **Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham** hung theirs there
- **The believing Israelites** hung theirs there
- **We** can do no better

Faith in Christ's blood alone can free us from our transgressions. And a life of obedience to the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus will be sufficient passport through the golden gates of the city of God—not because obedience earns salvation, but because it is the fruit of genuine faith.

### Living It Out

This truth calls us to:

1. **Trust wholly in Christ** for righteousness—His perfect life credited to our account (justification)
2. **Surrender daily to His transforming power**—His righteous character formed within us (sanctification)
3. **Honour God's law as the standard of Christian living**—not as a means of earning favour, but as the expression of love for Him who first loved us (John 14:15)
4. **Look forward with hope** to the day when sin's presence will be forever removed and God's people will reflect His image perfectly

## Appeal

> _"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_ (John 3:16)

Dear friend, the law and gospel are not enemies—they are partners in your salvation. The law shows you your need; the gospel supplies that need. The law reveals sin; Christ removes sin. The law demands righteousness; Christ provides righteousness.

Will you come to Jesus today, trusting wholly in His merits for pardon and in His power for victory? Will you accept both His forgiveness for the past and His strength for the future? The same Saviour who died to pay sin's penalty lives to break sin's power in your life.

Heaven's invitation stands open: _"Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow"_ (Isaiah 1:18). Come to Jesus. He will save you **from** your sins—and that is the best news the universe has ever heard.
