### Chapter 3: Power in the Word

**Introduction**

In the study of the sanctuary and the plan of salvation, we must understand the
instrument God uses to accomplish His will. In the physical creation, God did
not use tools or engines; He used His Word. In the spiritual re-creation
(salvation), He uses the same instrument. Righteousness by Faith is essentially
a reliance on the creative power of God’s Word to do what human effort cannot
do: transform the heart and produce a holy life.

### Q1. What was the way in which God brought the heavens into existence?

**"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by
the breath of his mouth... For He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it
stood fast." Psalm 33:6-9.**

**Answer:**

The Bible opens with the revelation of **creative power**. This passage teaches
that the material universe was not formed out of pre-existing matter, but was
called into existence by the _fiat_ (command) of the Almighty.

- **The Nature of God’s Word:** In human experience, a word is merely a sound
  expressing an idea. We must speak, and then _do_ something to make it happen.
  With God, the word _is_ the deed. The power to fulfill the command is in the
  command itself (Isaiah 55:11).
- **Immediate Obedience:** The text says, "He spake, and it was done." There was
  no delay, no resistance, and no gradual evolution. The matter obeyed the voice
  of its Creator instantly.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a master artist painting a sunrise. He must mix
paints, apply brushstrokes, and work for hours to create an _image_ of light.
But when God created light, He simply said, "Let there be light." He did not
need brushes or canvas; His word contained the reality of the light itself.

### Q2. What is it that Christ uses to uphold all things?

**"Upholding all things by the word of His power." Hebrews 1:3.**

**Answer:**

Creation is not like a clock that God wound up and left to run on its own. The
same power that called the worlds into existence is required to keep them in
existence moment by moment.

- **Continuous Creation:** The laws of nature (gravity, thermodynamics, etc.)
  are simply the habits of God, maintained by His powerful Word. If He were to
  withdraw His word, the universe would collapse into chaos.
- **Security for the Believer:** If the Word of Christ is strong enough to hold
  the stars in their courses and the atoms in their structure, it is strong
  enough to hold the believer up in the midst of temptation (Jude 24).

---

### Q3. Of what great truth are some willingly ignorant?

**"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens
were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: whereby
the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished." 2 Peter
3:5,6.**

**Answer:**

Peter warns of a skepticism that denies the intervention of God in history. This
"willing ignorance" overlooks two great events: Creation and the Flood.

- **The Flood:** The Antediluvians mocked Noah because they saw no physical
  evidence of rain. They trusted their senses rather than the Word of God.
  However, the water that was held in check by God's word was released by that
  same word, resulting in judgment.
- **The Lesson:** We must not judge reality by what we see (circumstances), but
  by what God has said.

---

### Q4. By what are the present heavens and earth reserved for a similar fate?

**"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in
store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
men." 2 Peter 3:7.**

**Answer:**

Just as the world was once destroyed by water, it is destined to be purified by
fire. The only thing preventing this fire from breaking out right now is the
"word" that keeps it in store.

- **The Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the fire on the altar
  consumed the sacrifice. In the final judgment, the fire of God’s glory will
  consume sin.
- **Atonement:** **Atonement** is the reconciliation of God and man (Romans
  5:11). Those who are covered by the Atonement of Christ are safe from the
  consuming fire, for Christ has already borne that judgment for them.

---

### Q5. What other passage of Scripture also reveals that creative power is exercised through the word of God?

**"Let them praise the name of the Lord: for He commanded, and they were
created." Psalm 148:5.**

**Answer:**

The Psalmist calls upon the sun, moon, stars, and angels to praise God because
they owe their very existence to His command. This establishes the absolute
sovereignty of God. If the inanimate creation obeys His voice instantly, how
much more should man, created in God's image, listen to that Word?

---

### Q6. What change is wrought out in the life of one who is in Christ?

**"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature [literally, "a new
creation"]: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new." 2
Corinthians 5:17.**

**Answer:**

Here we move from physical creation to **spiritual creation**.

- **Justification as Creation:** **Justification** is God’s legal declaration
  that a sinner is righteous (Romans 3:24). But it is more than just a legal
  change; it is a creative act. When God declares a man righteous in Christ, He
  makes him a "new creature."
- **Newness of Life:** This is not a patch on the old life. It is a new heart
  and a new mind (Ezekiel 36:26). The "old things" (love of sin, selfishness,
  pride) pass away as the life of Christ takes possession of the soul.

**[ILL] Illustration:** You cannot turn a wolf into a sheep by shearing it or
teaching it to eat grass; its nature remains predatory. It would require a
miracle of creation to change its species. Similarly, education and culture
cannot change a sinner into a saint. Only the Creator can install a new nature.

---

### Q7. Jesus described this same experience in what other passage?

**"Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a
man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." John 3:3.**

**Answer:**

Jesus uses the metaphor of birth to explain the radical nature of conversion.

- **The Necessity:** It is not that a man _ought_ not to enter heaven without
  this change; he _cannot_. The atmosphere of heaven is holiness; a heart that
  has not been "born again" would find heaven to be a place of torture, for it
  would be utterly out of harmony with God.
- **The Method:** As we had no part in our physical birth, so we cannot generate
  our own spiritual birth. It is the work of the Spirit of God, received by
  faith.

---

### Q8. By what agency is this new creation or new birth accomplished?

**"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word
of God, which liveth and abideth for ever." 1 Peter 1:23.**

**Answer:**

The instrument of the new birth is the Word of God.

- **The Seed:** A seed contains the life of the plant. The Word of God is the
  "incorruptible seed." It contains the life of Christ. When this Word is
  received into the heart by faith, the life of Christ begins to grow there.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We do not produce righteousness; we receive the
  Seed. As the seed grows, it naturally produces the fruit of obedience
  (Galatians 5:22-23). Our part is to receive and cherish the Word.

---

### Q9. What is the first creative commandment that is mentioned in the Bible?

**"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light." Genesis 1:3.**

**Answer:**

God addressed the darkness and chaos of the deep. He did not struggle with the
darkness; He simply introduced light, and the darkness vanished. This is the
pattern for how God deals with the darkness of sin.

---

### Q10. Did God also command another light to shine out of darkness?

**"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our
hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ." 2 Corinthians 4:6.**

**Answer:**

Paul directly connects the creation of physical light with the conversion of the
soul.

- **The Dark Heart:** The human heart by nature is "darkness" (Ephesians 5:8).
  We cannot create light within ourselves.
- **The Divine Command:** God speaks the word of forgiveness and grace into the
  heart. This "shining" is the revelation of His character (His glory) seen in
  Christ.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the Holy Place, the seven-branched candlestick
  represented Christ, the Light of the World, and His Word illuminating the
  church through the Spirit.

---

### Q11. What was it about Christ's teaching that astonished people?

**"And they were astonished at His doctrine: for His word was with power." Luke
4:32.**

**Answer:**

The scribes and Pharisees quoted human authorities and traditions. Christ spoke
from the Source. His word possessed an inherent power that convicted the
conscience. True preaching today is not the sharing of human opinions, but the
delivery of God's Word, which still retains that same power.

---

### Q12. What important fact testified to the power of Christ's word?

**"And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is
this! for with authority and power He commandeth the unclean spirits, and they
come out." Luke 4:36.**

**Answer:**

Even the demonic realm recognizes the authority of the Word.

- **Spiritual Warfare:** We are in a "Great Controversy" between Christ and
  Satan. We cannot defeat the enemy with logic or willpower.
- **The Weapon:** Jesus defeated Satan in the wilderness by saying, "It is
  written" (Matthew 4:4). We overcome by the "word of our testimony" regarding
  the blood of the Lamb (Revelation 12:11).

---

### Q13. In ancient times, how did God bring healing to His people?

**"He sent His word, and healed them, and delivered them from their
destructions." Psalm 107:20.**

**Answer:**

Healing, whether physical or spiritual, comes through the Word. This verse
implies that the Word is a messenger ("He sent His word"). It goes forth to
accomplish a specific task. When we are sick with sin, the remedy is found in
the promises of God.

### Q14. In what way did the Roman centurion reveal his strong faith in Christ?

**"The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest
come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed."
Matthew 8:8.**

**Answer:**

The Centurion is one of the Bible's greatest examples of **Righteousness by
Faith**.

- **Dependence on the Word:** He did not ask for a sign, a touch, or a feeling.
  He knew that if Jesus simply _spoke_, the result was guaranteed.
- **Faith Defined:** Faith is accepting God’s Word as fact, before the result is
  seen. If we wait to "feel" healed or "feel" forgiven before we believe, we are
  not exercising faith. We must believe the Word _only_.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If a reliable wealthy friend gives you a check for a
thousand dollars, you consider the debt paid before you even go to the bank. You
trust the "word" written on the paper. God's promises are checks signed in the
blood of Jesus. We may treat them as current reality.

---

### Q15. What did Christ say is the seed of the kingdom of God?

**"The seed is the word of God." Luke 8:11.**

**Answer:**

In the Parable of the Sower, Jesus identifies the Word as the seed.

- **Potential Life:** A seed may look small and dry, but inside is the germ of
  life. The Bible may seem like just a book, but within its pages is the life of
  God.
- **Growth:** Just as a seed needs good soil, the Word needs a receptive heart.
  When received, it produces "after its kind"—it produces the character of
  Christ in the believer.

---

### Q16. Where does God want Christ's word to dwell?

**"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom." Colossians 3:16.**

**Answer:**

The Word is not to be a visitor, but a resident.

- **Indwelling Christ:** To have the Word dwell in us is to have Christ dwell in
  us, for He is the "Word made flesh" (John 1:14).
- **Sanctification:** **Sanctification** is the process of the Word taking over
  more and more of the mind, replacing worldly thoughts with God's thoughts,
  resulting in a holy life.

---

### Q17. Could those who believed not on Jesus Christ receive this important seed?

**"Ye have not His word abiding in you: for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe
not." John 5:38.**

**Answer:**

Unbelief shuts the door to the Word. The religious leaders of Jesus' day
memorized the Scriptures, but the Word did not _abide_ (live) in them because
they rejected Christ. We cannot separate the written Word from the Living Word.
To reject Christ is to drain the Bible of its power for our souls.

---

### Q18. How does the Word of God work in the life of the believer?

**"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received
the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but
as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
believe." 1 Thessalonians 2:13.**

**Answer:**

- **Not Human Opinion:** If the Bible is merely good advice from ancient men, it
  has no power to save. We must receive it as the voice of God speaking to us
  individually.
- **Effectual Working:** The Greek word for "effectually worketh" is _energeia_
  (energy). The Word is active. It energizes the will to obey.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We do not work _for_ the Word; the Word works _in_
  us. "It is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
  pleasure" (Philippians 2:13).

---

### Q19. What new nature is imparted to us through the promises of God?

**"Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by
these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption
that is in the world through lust." 2 Peter 1:4.**

**Answer:**

This is the secret of victory over sin.

- **Imparted Righteousness:** How do we get God's nature? Through His
  _promises_. Every promise of God contains the power to fulfill itself. When we
  grasp a promise (e.g., "Sin shall not have dominion over you"), we are
  actually partaking of the divine nature.
- **Escaping Corruption:** We do not escape the world by running to a monastery,
  but by holding to the promises. The divine nature expels the carnal nature as
  light expels darkness.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A diver can remain dry while underwater if he is inside
a diving bell. He is in the water, but not _of_ the water. The believer is in
the world, but through the "diving bell" of God's promises, he is surrounded by
the atmosphere of heaven (the divine nature) and is kept from the corruption
around him.

---

### Q20. What is it that can cleanse the lives of believers in Christ?

**"Now are ye clean through the word which I have spoken unto you." John 15:3.**

**Answer:**

- **Cleansing Power:** Just as water cleanses the body, the Word cleanses the
  mind and conscience.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** This points to the **Laver** in the courtyard, where
  the priests washed before entering the Holy Place. We must be washed daily by
  the "washing of water by the word" (Ephesians 5:26).
- **Justification:** The declaration of Christ ("Ye are clean") makes it so. He
  pronounces us clean, and His word provides the reality of that purity.

---

### Q21. How can a young man cleanse his ways?

**"Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto
according to Thy word." Psalm 119:9.**

**Answer:**

The question is practical: How can a young person, full of energy and facing
strong temptations, remain pure?

- **The Standard:** The Word is the standard of right and wrong.
- **The Method:** "Taking heed" means to align one's life with the Word. It
  involves constant reference to the Scriptures as the guide for every decision.

---

### Q22. What is the result of accepting the Word of God into the heart and life?

**"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee." Psalm
119:11. (See also Psalm 17:4.)**

**Answer:**

This is the conclusion of the matter: The Word is the antidote to sin.

- **Hiding the Word:** This implies more than reading; it means memorizing,
  meditating, and storing the Word in the deep affections of the heart.
- **Victory:** When temptation comes, the Holy Spirit brings the "hidden" Word
  to remembrance. If the heart is full of God's Word, there is no room for sin.
- **The Path of Christ:** This was Jesus' secret. He hid the law within His
  heart (Psalm 40:8), and therefore He could say, "I delight to do thy will." As
  we behold Him in the Word, we are changed into the same image.
