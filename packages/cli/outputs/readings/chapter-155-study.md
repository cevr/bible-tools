# Bible Study: Backsliding—The Danger of Drifting from God

## Introduction

Backsliding—the gradual or sudden departure from a living connection with God—is one of the most subtle and dangerous spiritual conditions a believer can experience. Scripture reveals that God views backsliding not as a minor stumble but as a treacherous departure, like a spouse abandoning their beloved. Yet in the same breath, the Lord extends His healing, His love, and His invitation to return. Understanding the causes, dangers, and divine remedy for backsliding is essential for every Christian who desires to stand faithful until Jesus comes.

## Core Truths

### What Is Backsliding?

Backsliding is more than occasional failure; it is a spiritual regression—a turning away from the living God to whom we once drew near. The prophet Jeremiah describes its bitter consequences:

> _"Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that My fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts."_ (Jeremiah 2:19)

**Backsliding** is defined as: A gradual or sudden departure from close fellowship with God, marked by loss of reverent fear (awe and love), disobedience, and spiritual coldness (Hosea 11:7; Revelation 2:4).

Notice three elements in this passage:

- **Self-inflicted correction**: The backslider's own sin becomes their teacher through painful consequences
- **Bitterness of fruit**: What seemed sweet in departing from God turns bitter
- **Root cause identified**: Forsaking the Lord and losing the fear (reverent awe) of God

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "backsliding" (_meshubah_) comes from the root meaning "to turn away" or "to apostatize." It pictures someone who was once walking toward God but has turned their back and is now walking in the opposite direction.

### The Universal Tendency

Scripture reveals a sobering truth about human nature, even among God's professed people:

> _"And My people are bent to backsliding from Me."_ (Hosea 11:7)

The word "bent" suggests an inclination, a leaning, a gravitational pull. Like water flowing downhill, our fallen nature naturally drifts away from God unless actively resisted. This is why Paul warned, "Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall" (1 Corinthians 10:12).

### The Root Causes

Why do professed believers slide back? Jeremiah identifies the core issues:

> _"They hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? everyone turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle."_ (Jeremiah 8:5–6)

Three causes emerge:

1. **Holding fast to deceit**—cherishing sin, self-deception, or false doctrines
2. **Refusing to return**—stubbornness and pride preventing genuine repentance
3. **No self-examination**—failing to ask, "What have I done?"

[ILL] Consider the horse rushing headlong into battle—no pause, no reflection, no consideration of danger. So the backslider plunges forward in their chosen course, swept along by momentum and habit, refusing to stop and consider where their path leads. Only the voice of God's Spirit, like a hand on the reins, can arrest such headlong flight toward destruction.

## Deeper Truths

### How God Regards Backsliding

The Lord does not view backsliding with cold indifference. His heart is that of a wounded spouse:

> _"Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord."_ (Jeremiah 3:20)

This imagery reveals:

- **Covenant relationship**: God sees His people as bound to Him in sacred covenant, as intimate as marriage
- **Personal grief**: Backsliding wounds the heart of God
- **Treachery, not mere weakness**: The departure is a betrayal of love and trust

[Q] **"Isn't this picture of God as a wounded husband too emotional? Is God really affected by our choices?"**

Scripture consistently portrays God as having genuine feelings toward His creatures. "In all their affliction He was afflicted" (Isaiah 63:9). Christ wept over Jerusalem (Luke 19:41). The Holy Spirit can be grieved (Ephesians 4:30). While God is not subject to the instability of human emotions, He genuinely loves us and is moved by our choices. This is not weakness but the depth of infinite love.

### A Specific Area of Backsliding: Robbing God

When Israel asked, "Wherein shall we return?" God pointed to a specific area of departure:

> _"Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings."_ (Malachi 3:7–8)

This reveals that backsliding can manifest in practical, measurable ways—particularly in our stewardship. The tithe is holy unto the Lord (Leviticus 27:30), and withholding it is identified as robbery. But notice God's gracious remedy:

> _"Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse... and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it."_ (Malachi 3:10)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "prove Me now" is remarkable—God invites testing! This is the only place in Scripture where God challenges His people to test Him. Faithfulness in stewardship becomes a pathway back to blessing and a tangible demonstration of trust.

### Why Some Disciples Left Jesus

Even during Christ's earthly ministry, some who followed Him turned back:

> _"From that time many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with Him."_ (John 6:66)

The context reveals why: Jesus had just taught the difficult doctrine that He was the bread from heaven and that eating His flesh and drinking His blood (receiving Him fully by faith) was essential for eternal life (John 6:53–58). The teaching was too demanding, too humbling, too contrary to their expectations.

[Q] **"Does this mean once someone backslides, they were never truly saved?"**

Not necessarily. Scripture shows genuine believers can drift away (Hebrews 2:1), fall from grace (Galatians 5:4), and need restoration (Galatians 6:1). The key question is not whether one ever stumbled but whether one returns. Peter denied Christ but was restored. Judas betrayed Christ and refused restoration. The difference was in their response to the Spirit's conviction.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Backsliding

The sanctuary service beautifully illustrates both the danger of backsliding and the remedy. In the ancient tabernacle, the **daily burnt offering** was maintained morning and evening (Exodus 29:38–42)—the fire on the altar was never to go out (Leviticus 6:13).

This constant sacrifice represented the need for continuous dependence on Christ's merits. When Israel neglected the sanctuary service, it signaled spiritual decline. When they returned to faithful worship, it marked revival.

Today, Christ ministers in the heavenly sanctuary as our High Priest (Hebrews 8:1–2). Backsliding occurs when we neglect this priestly ministry—when we cease coming boldly to the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16), when we forsake the daily bread of His Word and the incense of prayer.

**The remedy is to return to the sanctuary**—to reconnect with Christ's intercession, to confess our sins and receive cleansing (1 John 1:9), and to let the blood of Jesus continue its purifying work in our hearts.

### The Law in the Heart—The Safeguard Against Sliding

> _"The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide."_ (Psalm 37:31)

This verse reveals the divine antidote to backsliding: not merely knowing the law externally but having it written in the heart through the new covenant (Hebrews 8:10). When God's law becomes our delight rather than our burden, when obedience flows from love rather than fear of punishment, our steps become stable.

This is righteousness by faith at its practical core. The same Christ who justifies us by His blood sanctifies us by His indwelling Spirit. His righteousness is not merely **imputed** (credited to our account) but **imparted** (worked into our character). This internal transformation is our only security against backsliding.

[ILL] A tree with shallow roots topples in the first strong wind. But a tree with deep roots, drawing water from underground streams, stands firm through the fiercest storm. So it is with the Christian whose faith is rooted deeply in Christ—connected to the living water of His Word and Spirit. External profession without internal transformation leaves us vulnerable; deep-rooted faith keeps our steps from sliding.

### The Great Controversy and Last-Day Danger

Jesus warned of special danger in the final days:

> _"And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."_ (Matthew 24:12)

As we approach the end, Satan intensifies his efforts. The atmosphere of iniquity—lawlessness, moral compromise, distraction—chills spiritual fervor. The phrase "the love of many" suggests not outsiders but professed believers whose first love grows cold (Revelation 2:4).

This is the great controversy manifested in individual lives: Will God's people remain faithful when the pressure to compromise increases? Will the church stand when the world's current sweeps against it?

## Practical Application

### The Path of Return

For the backslider, God outlines a clear path home:

**1. Acknowledge your condition** (Jeremiah 3:13)

> _"Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God."_

No excuses, no blame-shifting—honest confession before God.

**2. Forsake sin and wrong thoughts** (Isaiah 55:7)

> _"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord."_

True repentance involves turning, not just feeling sorry. And notice—even our **thoughts** must be surrendered.

**3. Return to the Lord** (Isaiah 55:7)

> _"Return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon."_

The Hebrew word translated "abundantly pardon" literally means "multiply pardon"—God does not pardon grudgingly but lavishly.

**4. Bring words of confession** (Hosea 14:2)

> _"Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto Him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously."_

Come with humble, specific confession. Name your sins before God. Ask for His cleansing.

### Prevention: Watch and Pray

> _"Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak."_ (Mark 14:38)

**Watching** involves:

- Self-examination: "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith" (2 Corinthians 13:5)
- Spiritual alertness to Satan's devices
- Honest assessment of spiritual temperature

**Praying** involves:

- Daily, earnest communion with God
- Specific prayer against known weaknesses
- Dependence on divine strength rather than human resolve

### The Test of Genuine Faith

Paul provides the acid test:

> _"Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"_ (2 Corinthians 13:5)

The question is not merely, "Do I believe?" but "Is Christ living in me?" Genuine Christianity is not creed only but Christ indwelling—His life reproduced in ours, His love flowing through us, His victory becoming ours.

## Appeal

> _"I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for Mine anger is turned away from him."_ (Hosea 14:4)

What tender words! God does not merely tolerate the returning backslider—He **heals** them. He does not love them reluctantly—He loves them **freely**. His anger is not permanently fixed—it is **turned away**.

If you sense spiritual coldness, if your first love has faded, if you recognize yourself in these scriptures—hear the voice of Jesus: "Return unto Me, and I will return unto you" (Malachi 3:7).

The path home is open. The Father waits. The High Priest intercedes. The Spirit draws.

> _"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."_ (Luke 21:36)

In these last days, will you answer His call? Will you return—or remain—in living fellowship with Christ? He who kept Peter from utter ruin after his denial, He who restored David after his great sin, He who healed Israel's backslidings again and again—this same Jesus stands ready to receive you, cleanse you, and keep you from falling (Jude 24).

Come home today. Stay close tomorrow. And by His grace, stand faithful until He appears.
