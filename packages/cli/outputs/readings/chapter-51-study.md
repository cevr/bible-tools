# Bible Study: The Second Angel's Message

## Introduction

In the great prophetic sequence of Revelation 14, three angels carry heaven's final messages to a world approaching its solemn judgment. The second angel's cry—"Babylon is fallen, is fallen"—is both a divine diagnosis and a compassionate warning. This message exposes the spiritual condition of apostate Christianity and calls God's sincere people to separate from error before it is forever too late. Understanding Babylon's identity and fall is essential for those who would stand with the remnant who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

## Core Truths

### The Announcement of Babylon's Fall

The second angel follows immediately upon the first angel's proclamation of the everlasting gospel and the hour of God's judgment:

> _"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."_ (Revelation 14:8)

This is not primarily a political or military fall, but a **moral and spiritual fall**—a departure from pure gospel truth into corruption and error.

[DYK🔎] The name "Babylon" comes from the Hebrew _Babel_, meaning "confusion" (Genesis 11:9). In Scripture, Babylon represents opposition to God's truth, beginning with the tower builders who sought salvation through human works and confederacy rather than through faith in God's word.

### Identifying Babylon

Revelation 17 provides the most detailed description of Babylon:

> _"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."_ (Revelation 17:4–5)

**Key symbolic elements:**

- **A woman** in prophecy represents a church (Jeremiah 3:1, 14, 20; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Revelation 12:1)
- **Arrayed in purple and scarlet**—colours of royalty and wealth
- **A golden cup**—outward beauty concealing inward corruption
- **Mother of harlots**—indicating she has unfaithful daughters who resemble her

This is not a pure woman (like the church of Revelation 12), but an **adulterous** one—a church that has united with worldly powers and corrupted gospel truth.

### The Nature of Spiritual Adultery

James speaks plainly to churches that seek worldly alliances:

> _"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God."_ (James 4:4)

**Babylon's fall** is connected with "a falling away" that Paul prophesied would precede Christ's return:

> _"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition."_ (2 Thessalonians 2:3)

This apostasy involved departure from the simplicity of the gospel, the exaltation of human tradition over Scripture, and the union of church and state—all characteristics of the papal system that developed over centuries.

## Deeper Truths

### The Mother and Her Daughters

Revelation 17 calls Babylon "the mother of harlots"—not a single church, but a **family of churches** sharing common characteristics of apostasy.

[Q] **"Does the second angel's message apply only to the Roman Catholic Church?"**

The evidence suggests Babylon includes more than Rome alone. The papal church is the "mother," but Protestant churches that retain her errors or have fallen into similar apostasy are her "daughters." Notice these candid Protestant admissions:

- One Catholic author observed that "the Church of England stands guilty of the same" idolatry as Rome, with "ten churches dedicated to Mary for one dedicated to Christ."
- A Protestant writer, Mr. Hopkins, acknowledged: "The Protestant churches have much of Antichrist in them, and are far from being wholly reformed from corruption and wickedness."

This is not bigotry—it is the honest testimony of thoughtful observers within these communions.

### The Wine of Babylon

What has Babylon given the nations to drink?

> _"The inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication."_ (Revelation 17:2)

**Wine** in this context represents **false doctrine**—teachings that intoxicate the mind, confuse judgment, and lead souls away from pure biblical truth. Among these errors are:

- Natural immortality of the soul
- Eternal torment of the wicked
- Sunday sacredness in place of the Bible Sabbath
- Baptism by sprinkling instead of immersion
- Salvation by works or by grace without transformation
- Union of church and state

[ILL] Imagine a traveler parched with thirst, gratefully accepting a beautiful golden cup from a richly dressed woman. The cup appears magnificent; the drink tastes sweet. But it is poisoned wine that dulls his senses and leads him into the wilderness to perish. So it is with Babylon's doctrines—they appear beautiful and satisfying, but they lead the soul away from truth and life.

### The Fall Is Progressive

Notice the repetition: "Babylon is fallen, **is fallen**." This suggests a **progressive moral decline** that reaches its climax in the last days.

Revelation 18 describes her final condition:

> _"Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird."_ (Revelation 18:2)

Paul predicted this condition for the last-day church:

> _"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."_ (2 Timothy 3:1–5)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof" describes religion that maintains outward ceremony while rejecting the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. This is the essence of Babylon's fall—profession without possession, ritual without righteousness.

### Confessions from Within

The testimony of honest observers within fallen churches confirms the second angel's message. Consider this striking confession:

> "Apostasy, apostasy, apostasy, is engraved on the very front of every church; and did they know it, and did they feel it, there might be hope; but alas! they cry, 'We are rich, and increased in goods, and have need of nothing.'" —Robert Atkins

This echoes Christ's message to the Laodicean church—the final church age—which believes itself spiritually wealthy while being "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked" (Revelation 3:17).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Babylon's Fall

Babylon's fall directly connects to the sanctuary message. The earthly sanctuary revealed God's plan for cleansing His people from sin—the day of atonement when Israel was to "afflict their souls" and put away all sin (Leviticus 16:29–31; 23:27–29).

The heavenly sanctuary's Most Holy Place ministry—the antitypical day of atonement—began in 1844. This solemn work calls for:

- Heart-searching confession of sin
- The blotting out of sins through Christ's blood
- Character preparation for Christ's return

**Babylon rejects this work.** She offers a counterfeit gospel that:

- Denies the need for complete victory over sin
- Substitutes human tradition for divine law
- Ignores the investigative judgment
- Teaches that grace excuses continued transgression

The second angel's message calls God's people **out of this system** and **into the sanctuary truth**—into a right relationship with Christ our High Priest, who alone can cleanse us from all sin.

### Righteousness by Faith and Babylon's Error

Babylon's "wine" includes a perversion of righteousness by faith. Some in Babylon teach salvation by works (human merit); others teach salvation without works (cheap grace). Both are errors.

**True righteousness by faith** includes:

1. **Justification**—Christ's righteousness **imputed** to us; we are declared righteous by faith apart from works (Romans 4:5; 5:1)
2. **Sanctification**—Christ's righteousness **imparted** to us; we are made righteous through His indwelling life (Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:13)
3. **Glorification**—Christ's work completed in us; His people are sealed, ready to meet Him in peace (Ephesians 4:13; Revelation 14:1–5)

[Q] **"Can believers actually overcome all known sin in this life?"**

Scripture teaches that through Christ's power, they can and must:

> _"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me."_ (Philippians 4:13)

> _"Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy."_ (Jude 24)

Babylon obscures this truth. She either discourages believers from expecting victory or leads them to trust in their own efforts. But Christ offers His own victorious life to dwell within—not to excuse sin, but to **overcome** it.

### The Great Controversy in Babylon's Fall

Babylon's fall is a climactic moment in the great controversy between Christ and Satan. Satan has worked through Babylon to:

- Misrepresent God's character
- Nullify God's law (especially the Sabbath)
- Persecute God's faithful people
- Counterfeit salvation with false doctrines

The second angel's message exposes these deceptions and reveals that God will vindicate His truth before the universe. Babylon's judgment demonstrates that:

- Error cannot stand before truth
- Human systems cannot replace divine revelation
- God's remnant people will be delivered

## Practical Application

### Recognizing Babylon's Influence

Babylon's "wine" has affected nearly every Christian church to some degree. Ask yourself:

- Do I hold any belief that contradicts clear Scripture?
- Am I trusting in human tradition or pastoral authority over the Bible?
- Have I been taught that God's law (including the Sabbath) has been abolished?
- Do I believe I can be saved while continuing in known sin?

### The Call to Come Out

God's call through the second angel is not optional:

> _"Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues."_ (Revelation 18:4)

This call requires:

1. **Honest investigation** of one's beliefs by Scripture alone
2. **Humble surrender** of cherished errors when light comes
3. **Courageous obedience** regardless of cost or consequence
4. **Connection** with God's remnant people who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12)

[ILL] A loving father sees his children playing in an old building marked for demolition. He calls urgently, "Come out, my children!" He does not hate the building—he loves his children. So God calls His people from Babylon—not in hatred, but in love, knowing the judgment that must fall.

### Maintaining Spiritual Separation

Coming out of Babylon involves:

- **Doctrinal separation**: Rejecting errors that contradict Scripture
- **Practical separation**: Refusing worldly compromises in worship and life
- **Spiritual preparation**: Allowing Christ to complete His work of cleansing in our hearts
- **Watchful prayer**: Guarding against Babylon's subtle influence

## Appeal

_"Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."_ (2 Corinthians 6:17–18)

The second angel's message is urgent but gracious. God sees His sincere children scattered among the fallen churches of Babylon. He loves them too dearly to leave them there. He calls—tenderly, persistently, urgently—"Come out of her, My people."

The third angel's message (which follows immediately) provides the remedy—the full truth for these last days, including the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. Those who heed these three angels' messages will be prepared to meet Christ in peace.

Will you answer the call? Will you allow the Holy Spirit to lead you into all truth? Will you separate from error and unite with God's commandment-keeping people?

The choice is personal, the time is short, and the decision is eternal. Heaven waits for your response.
