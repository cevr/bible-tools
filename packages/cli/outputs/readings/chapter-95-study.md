# Bible Study: Sabbath Reform

## Introduction

In the closing scenes of earth's history, God calls His people to repair a breach
that has been made in His holy law. The seventh-day Sabbath, planted by the
Creator at the foundation of the world, has been trampled underfoot by human
tradition. This study traces God's prophetic call for Sabbath restoration in the
last days—a call inseparable from the three angels' messages and the preparation
of a people to stand in the day of the Lord.

## Core Truths

### The Danger of Human Tradition

When religious leaders substitute human commands for divine commands, Christ
pronounces their worship **vain**:

> _"But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of
> men."_ (Matthew 15:9)

The Pharisees had devised a tradition called "Corban" that allowed men to neglect
caring for their aging parents while appearing religious. Jesus exposed this as
making _"the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition"_ (Matthew
15:6).

**The principle is clear**: Any tradition—however ancient, however widely
accepted—that sets aside a plain command of God renders our worship empty.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "of none effect" (_akuroō_) is a legal term
meaning "to annul" or "to make void." Jesus was saying that human traditions had
legally invalidated God's command in the eyes of those who followed them—though
not, of course, in heaven's record.

### Two Plantings: Divine and Human

When the disciples reported that the Pharisees were offended by Christ's rebuke,
Jesus answered with a solemn principle:

> _"Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up."_
> (Matthew 15:13)

This raises a vital question for every religious institution and practice: **Who
planted it?**

**The seventh-day Sabbath** was planted by God Himself at creation:

> _"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
> is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and
> hallowed it."_ (Exodus 20:11)

Three divine acts established the Sabbath:

1. **God rested** on the seventh day (Genesis 2:2)
2. **God blessed** the seventh day (Genesis 2:3)
3. **God sanctified** (set apart as holy) the seventh day (Genesis 2:3)

No other day in all of Scripture receives this threefold distinction.

**The Sunday institution**, by contrast, claims a different origin. Note this
remarkable admission from Roman Catholic sources:

> _"Question—Has the church power to make any alterations in the commandments of
> God?_
>
> _Answer—Instead of the seventh day, and other festivals appointed by the old
> law, the church has prescribed the Sundays and holy days to be set apart for
> God's worship; and these we are now obliged to keep in consequence of God's
> commandment, instead of the ancient Sabbath."_
>
> —_Catholic Christian Instructed_, p. 204

[Q] **"But doesn't the New Testament teach that Sunday replaced the Sabbath?"**

Scripture records no such change. Jesus kept the Sabbath (Luke 4:16). The
apostles kept it decades after the resurrection (Acts 13:14, 42, 44; 16:13;
17:2; 18:4). The change came gradually through human authority, not divine
command. When we compare Matthew 15:13 with this historical admission, the
conclusion is unavoidable: what man has planted, God will uproot.

## Deeper Truths

### A Last-Day Blessing for Sabbath-Keepers

Isaiah 56 contains a remarkable prophecy that speaks directly to our time:

> _"Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for My salvation is
> near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed. Blessed is the man that
> doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath
> from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil."_ (Isaiah 56:1-2)

Notice the **time setting**: "My salvation is near to come." Peter confirms this
refers to the last days:

> _"Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be
> revealed in the last time."_ (1 Peter 1:5)

When God's salvation is about to appear—when the advent message is being
preached—a special blessing rests upon those who keep His Sabbath holy.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "pollute" in Isaiah 56:2 (_chalal_) means "to
profane, to make common, to wound." Sabbath-breaking treats as ordinary what God
has declared sacred—it wounds the day that bears His blessing.

### The Sabbath Promise Extends to All Nations

Some object that the Sabbath was only for Jews. But Isaiah explicitly includes
the Gentiles:

> _"Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord, to serve
> Him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be His servants, every one that
> keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even
> them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of
> prayer."_ (Isaiah 56:6-7)

And what will these faithful Gentile Sabbath-keepers receive?

> _"Even unto them will I give in Mine house and within My walls a place and a
> name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting
> name, that shall not be cut off."_ (Isaiah 56:5)

The Sabbath was never exclusively Jewish. It was made for **man**—all mankind
(Mark 2:27). It was instituted before sin, before Jews existed, before there were
even nations. It is the memorial of creation, binding every creature to the
Creator.

### The Prophetic Call: Repair the Breach

Isaiah 58 records God's charge to His ministers in the last days:

> _"Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew My people
> their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins."_ (Isaiah 58:1)

What is this transgression? After addressing various failures, God focuses on one
particular remedy:

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My
> holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and
> shalt honour Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor
> speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord."_
> (Isaiah 58:13-14)

The expression _"turn away thy foot from the Sabbath"_ is striking. It pictures
people **trampling** upon God's holy day—treating it as common ground to be
walked upon carelessly.

Those who respond to this call receive a special title:

> _"And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt
> raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The
> repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in."_ (Isaiah 58:12)

[ILL] Imagine an ancient city protected by a great wall. Enemies have battered a
breach—a gap—through which invaders pour. The city cannot be safe until that
breach is repaired. God's law is the wall of protection around His people. When
one commandment is removed or altered, a breach exists through which the enemy
gains access. God calls for workers who will **repair the breach**—restore the
Sabbath truth that has been trampled down—and thus make His people secure.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

The Sabbath finds its deepest meaning in the sanctuary:

- **The Sabbath points to the Creator**—and the Most Holy Place contains the ark
  with God's law, including the Sabbath commandment (Revelation 11:19)
- **The Sabbath is a sign of sanctification** (Ezekiel 20:12)—the very work
  Christ performs as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary
- **The investigative judgment** examines who has truly kept God's
  commandments—including the Sabbath (Ecclesiastes 12:13-14; Revelation 14:7, 12)

The Sabbath is not merely a day; it is **a test of loyalty** in the great
controversy between Christ and Satan. Satan has attacked God's law, particularly
the Sabbath, because it identifies the true God as Creator and distinguishes His
worship from all counterfeits.

### Untempered Mortar: The Wall That Will Fall

Ezekiel describes religious teachers who hide their eyes from God's Sabbaths and
put no difference between holy and common (Ezekiel 22:26). To maintain their
position, they "daub with untempered mortar"—building arguments without solid
biblical foundation (Ezekiel 22:28; 13:10-11).

God's verdict is solemn:

> _"Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there
> shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a
> stormy wind shall rend it."_ (Ezekiel 13:11)

When do these hailstones fall?

> _"Hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the
> time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?"_ (Job 38:22-23)

Under the **seventh plague**, great hailstones fall upon those who have clung to
false religious systems (Revelation 16:17-21). Every wall built on human
tradition rather than divine truth will collapse.

[Q] **"Isn't this overly harsh? Are sincere Sunday-keepers really in danger?"**

God judges according to light received. Many sincere Christians have kept Sunday
in ignorance, trusting their teachers. But when the third angel's message brings
clear light, each person becomes responsible for their response. The issue is not
sincerity alone, but **obedience to known truth**. "To him that knoweth to do
good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin" (James 4:17).

### The Third Angel's Message

The final warning to the world centers on commandment-keeping:

> _"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man
> worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in
> his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God... Here is the
> patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and
> the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:9-12)

The contrast is clear:

- **The beast's mark**: Submission to human authority that sets aside God's law
- **The seal of God**: Loyalty to God demonstrated by keeping all His
  commandments, including His Sabbath (Ezekiel 20:12, 20)

This is not legalism. Notice: they keep _"the commandments of God, **and** the
faith of Jesus."_ True Sabbath-keeping flows from living faith in Christ—His
righteousness received by faith, enabling obedience from the heart.

### Sabbath in Eternity

The Sabbath is not a temporary institution to pass away. It will endure through
all eternity:

> _"For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain
> before Me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it
> shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to
> another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord."_ (Isaiah
> 66:22-23)

What began in Eden will continue in the earth made new. The Sabbath is the
eternal bond between Creator and creation, a weekly celebration of His power, His
love, and His finished work.

## Practical Application

### How to Keep the Sabbath Holy

Isaiah 58:13 provides practical guidance:

1. **"Turn away thy foot"**—Stop treating the Sabbath as common; give it special
   honor
2. **"Not doing thine own ways"**—Set aside regular work and business
3. **"Nor finding thine own pleasure"**—Worldly entertainment and selfish
   recreation give way to spiritual pursuits
4. **"Nor speaking thine own words"**—Common conversation about worldly matters
   is replaced by holy themes
5. **"Call the Sabbath a delight"**—The day becomes a joy, not a burden

The Sabbath is best kept when we:

- Begin at sunset Friday with preparation and prayer
- Gather with fellow believers for worship
- Study God's Word and spend time in nature
- Minister to the sick and suffering (as Jesus did)
- Share the gospel with those in need
- Close at sunset Saturday with gratitude and thanksgiving

### Be a Repairer of the Breach

God calls every believer to join in this last-day work:

- **Study** the Sabbath truth until it fills your heart with conviction
- **Practice** faithful Sabbath-keeping in your own life
- **Share** the Sabbath message with others lovingly but clearly
- **Stand** firm even when opposition comes

[DYK🔎] The remnant church faces the dragon's wrath specifically because they
"keep the commandments of God" (Revelation 12:17). The Sabbath controversy will
be the final test of loyalty in earth's closing drama—not as a mere day, but as a
sign of submission to God's authority versus human tradition.

## Appeal

> _"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the
> tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."_ (Revelation
> 22:14)

The tree of life, lost in Eden through disobedience, will be restored to those
who keep God's commandments. The Sabbath, instituted before the fall, points
forward to the restoration of all things.

A breach has been made in God's holy law. Human tradition has planted what God
did not plant. But in mercy, God sends a message of restoration before the final
storm breaks. He invites you today to take your stand with the faithful of all
ages—to be numbered among the Repairers of the breach and the Restorers of paths
to dwell in.

The plant of human origin will be rooted up. Only what God has planted will
remain. The seventh-day Sabbath, blessed and sanctified at creation, will endure
through all eternity. Which planting will you choose?

_"Today if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts."_ (Hebrews 4:7)
