### Q1. Has anything been left as a legacy to the righteous?

**“Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but the Lord delivereth him out of
them all.” (Psalm 34:19)**

**Answer:** It is often a source of perplexity to the believer why, if he has
accepted Christ and seeks to keep the commandments of God, he still faces
trials. The Psalmist here acknowledges a reality of the **Great Controversy**:
we live in enemy territory. The legacy of the righteous in this present world
includes affliction, but it is accompanied by a greater promise—deliverance.

1.  **The Reality of Conflict:** God does not promise the righteous an exemption
    from trouble. In fact, "all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall
    suffer persecution" (2 Timothy 3:12). The closer a man walks with Christ,
    the more he becomes a target for the enemy of souls.
2.  **The Nature of Deliverance:** Deliverance does not always mean the
    immediate removal of the problem. Often, God delivers us _in_ the trouble
    before He delivers us _out_ of it. He sustains the spirit and preserves the
    faith, ensuring that the trial does not destroy the soul.
3.  **Refining the Character:** God permits afflictions to purify the church.
    Just as the sanctuary service required fire for the offering, the Christian
    life involves a "fiery trial" to consume the dross of selfishness and sin (1
    Peter 4:12).

**[ILL] The Refiner’s Fire:** Imagine a goldsmith refining raw gold. He puts the
metal into the crucible and turns up the heat. He does not do this to destroy
the gold, but to remove the impurities (dross) that make it weak and dull. He
knows the process is finished only when he can see his own face perfectly
reflected in the molten liquid. So God sits as a refiner (Malachi 3:3), allowing
the heat of affliction until the image of Jesus is perfectly reflected in our
characters.

### Q2. What ought those in affliction to have from their friends?

**“To him that is afflicted, pity should be showed from his friend.” (Job
6:14)**

**Answer:** In the book of Job, we see the failure of friends who brought
accusation rather than comfort. The Bible teaches that true friendship manifests
the character of God, which is love and mercy.

- **The Ministry of Pity:** The word "pity" here implies deep
  compassion—suffering _with_ another. Christians are called to "bear ye one
  another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ" (Galatians 6:2).
- **Reflecting Christ:** Jesus is the Friend that sticks closer than a brother
  (Proverbs 18:24). His ministry on earth was one of constant pity for the
  suffering. When we show pity to the afflicted, we are acting as His hands and
  feet.
- **A Test of Faith:** Job suggests that withholding pity is akin to forsaking
  the fear of the Almighty. How we treat the suffering is a test of our
  connection with heaven.

**[ILL] The Good Samaritan:** In the parable of the Good Samaritan, the priest
and the Levite saw the wounded man but passed by. They perhaps had "correct"
theology, but they lacked the love of God. The Samaritan, however, showed pity.
He stopped, bound up the wounds, and paid the cost. True religion is not just
knowing truth; it is stopping to show pity to the afflicted.

### Q3. If one visits, and shows pity toward those in affliction, what does it indicate that he possesses?

**“Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the
fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from
the world.” (James 1:27)**

**Answer:** Here the apostle defines genuine Christianity not by profession, but
by practice. This verse highlights two essential aspects of the plan of
salvation: practical benevolence and personal holiness.

1.  **Active Benevolence:** Faith that does not work is dead (James 2:17).
    Visiting the fatherless and widows—the most vulnerable—demonstrates that the
    law of God (the law of love) has been written on the heart. This is
    **Righteousness by Faith** in action: Christ’s life of love flowing through
    the believer.
2.  **Personal Purity:** The text also commands us to keep "unspotted from the
    world." This refers to **Sanctification**.
    - _Sanctification:_ The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to make the believer
      holy in character and life, setting them apart for God’s use (1
      Thessalonians 4:3).
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the priest had to wash
    before entering the holy place. So too, those who look for the coming of the
    Lord must be washed in the blood of the Lamb and keep their garments
    unspotted from the pollution of sin (Revelation 22:14).

**[ILL] The Fruit Tree:** You can label a dead stick "Apple Tree," but that does
not make it one. A living apple tree is identified by its fruit. If the sap (the
Holy Spirit) is flowing, the tree will naturally produce apples (good works and
purity). We do not do these works _to be_ saved (legalism), but we do them
because we _are_ saved and His life is in us.

### Q4. What did David say with reference to his affliction?

**“It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy
statutes.” (Psalm 119:71)**

**Answer:** It takes a converted heart to thank God for trouble. David
recognized that affliction was a necessary schoolmaster.

- **The School of Suffering:** Prosperity often leads to spiritual slumber. We
  tend to forget our need of God when everything goes well. Affliction wakes us
  up and drives us to the Scriptures.
- **Learning the Statutes:** The "statutes" are the specific counsels and laws
  of God. David implies that he understood the theory of God’s law before, but
  through suffering, he learned the _experience_ of it. He learned that God’s
  way is the only path of safety.
- **Submission:** The outcome of this lesson is a heart that stops rebelling and
  yields to the sovereignty of God.

**[ILL] The Shepherd’s Rod:** A shepherd carries a rod not only to defend the
sheep but to correct them. If a sheep insists on wandering toward a cliff, the
shepherd may use the rod to block the way or even strike the sheep to turn it
back. The blow may hurt, but it saves the sheep’s life. David, a shepherd
himself, knew that God’s rod was for his ultimate good (Psalm 23:4).

---

### Q5. Before he had affliction, what was his tendency?

**“Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word.” (Psalm
119:67)**

**Answer:** This verse diagnoses the human condition: our natural tendency is to
drift away from God.

1.  **The Danger of Ease:** When the sky is blue and the sea is calm, the sailor
    may fall asleep at the helm. It is the storm that forces him to watch and
    steer carefully. "Going astray" is the natural result of a life without the
    discipline of trial.
2.  **The Restoration of Obedience:** "But now have I kept thy word." The goal
    of the Gospel is not merely forgiveness, but restoration to obedience. God
    wants to bring us back to harmony with His law.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot keep His word in our own strength.
    Affliction reveals our weakness, leading us to cast ourselves wholly upon
    the merits and power of Christ. When we are weak, then are we strong (2
    Corinthians 12:10).

---

### Q6. When affliction came upon him, what did he consider it was for?

**“Look upon mine affliction and my pain, and forgive all my sins.” (Psalm
25:18)**

**Answer:** David saw a connection between his suffering and his need for
cleansing. While not every sickness is a direct punishment for a specific sin
(see John 9:3), suffering is intended to turn our minds toward self-examination
and repentance.

- **Sin is the Sting:** The physical pain was less burdensome to David than the
  weight of separation from God. His primary prayer was for forgiveness.
- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the ancient Day of Atonement, the people were to
  "afflict their souls" (Leviticus 23:27). This meant deep searching of heart
  and confession of sin, so that the High Priest could blot out their record.
  Affliction helps us do this work of preparation.
- **Justification Defined:** David asks God to "forgive." This is the plea for
  **Justification**—God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is pardoned
  and accounted righteous because of Christ’s sacrifice (Romans 4:7-8).

**[ILL] The Hidden Infection:** A man may have a hidden infection in his body
that he ignores. When a fever strikes and pain lays him low, he is forced to go
to the physician. The fever is uncomfortable, but it reveals the problem so the
cure can be applied. Affliction is the fever that drives us to the Great
Physician to deal with the infection of sin.

---

### Q7. How does God regard the cry of the afflicted?

**“He heareth the cry of the afflicted.” (Job 34:28)**

**Answer:** Though God permits trial, He is never indifferent to it.

- **God is Listening:** The Creator of the universe bends His ear to the
  lowliest sufferer. No tear falls unnoticed; no groan is unheard.
- **The High Priest:** We do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with
  the feeling of our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15). Jesus, in the heavenly
  sanctuary, hears every prayer of the afflicted believer and presents it with
  His own blood before the Father.

---

### Q8. With what feelings does the Lord look upon His children?

**“Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear
Him.” (Psalm 103:13)**

**Answer:** This is one of the most tender descriptions of God in the Old
Testament. It combats the false idea that God is a harsh judge waiting to
condemn.

1.  **The Fatherhood of God:** God looks upon us not merely as subjects, but as
    family. Through faith in Jesus, we are adopted. "Behold, what manner of love
    the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God"
    (1 John 3:1).
2.  **Divine Pity:** Just as a good earthly father feels the pain of his
    suffering child more acutely than the child does, so God feels our sorrows.
    "In all their affliction He was afflicted" (Isaiah 63:9).
3.  **The Condition:** The promise is to them that "fear Him"—not a
    terror-filled fear, but a reverent, trustful respect.

**[ILL] The Parent at the Bedside:** If a child is ill with a fever, the parent
does not mock or ignore the child. The parent sits by the bedside, wipes the
fevered brow, and holds the child’s hand. The parent may not be able to
instantly remove the sickness, but their presence and pity provide comfort. This
is how God sits with His suffering children.

---

### Q9. What has the Lord promised to be to those who are oppressed?

**“The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of
trouble.” (Psalm 9:9)**

**Answer:**

- **A Stronghold:** The word "refuge" here implies a high tower or a fortress.
  It is a place of safety where the enemy cannot reach.
- **Safety in Christ:** There is no safety in human policy or worldly power. Our
  only safety against the accusations of Satan and the trials of life is to be
  "hid with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3).
- **Sanctuary Imagery:** In ancient Israel, there were "cities of refuge" where
  a person could flee for safety. Christ is the true City of Refuge. The horns
  of the altar in the sanctuary also represented a place of protection.

---

### Q10. When the Saviour was about to go away from the earth, what did He say He would send to His disciples?

**“If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I
will send Him unto you.” (John 16:7)**

**Answer:** Jesus prepared His disciples for His ascension to the heavenly
sanctuary. He would not leave them as orphans.

- **The Necessity of Departure:** It was expedient for Christ to go, so He could
  begin His work as our High Priest in heaven and send the Spirit to be
  everywhere present on earth.
- **The Gift:** He promised the "Comforter" (Greek: _Paraclete_), meaning one
  called alongside to help.
- **Christ’s Presence:** Through the Spirit, Christ dwells in our hearts. This
  is the secret of **Righteousness by Faith**—not us trying to imitate a distant
  Jesus, but the Spirit of Christ living out His life within us (Galatians
  2:20).

---

### Q11. What is the Comforter called?

**“But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father,
even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of
Me.” (John 15:26)**

**Answer:**

- **The Spirit of Truth:** The Holy Spirit never leads contrary to the Word of
  God, for the Word is truth (John 17:17). He guides the believer into all
  truth, correcting errors and revealing the character of God.
- **Testifying of Christ:** The primary work of the Holy Spirit is to spotlight
  Jesus. He does not speak of Himself; He reveals the loveliness of Christ’s
  character and the sufficiency of His sacrifice.
- **Sanctification:** It is through the "sanctification of the Spirit and belief
  of the truth" (2 Thessalonians 2:13) that we are fitted for heaven. The Spirit
  writes the law on the heart.

---

### Q12. What has the Lord promised to the mourner?

**“Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.” (Matthew 5:4)**

**Answer:** This beatitude contains a spiritual paradox: happiness (blessedness)
is found in mourning.

1.  **Mourning for Sin:** While this applies to sorrow over loss, its deeper
    meaning is mourning for sin. True repentance involves a "godly sorrow" that
    leads to reformation (2 Corinthians 7:10).
2.  **The Comfort:** Those who mourn their sinful condition are comforted by the
    assurance of pardon. When we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
    forgive (1 John 1:9).
3.  **Sanctuary Connection:** On the Day of Atonement, those who mourned for
    their sins received the comfort of the "clean slate"—the blotting out of
    sins.

**[ILL] The Dark Background:** A jeweler displays a diamond against black
velvet. The darkness of the background makes the jewel shine brighter. So it is
with grace. It is only when we mourn the darkness of our own sin that the
diamond of Christ’s righteousness shines with true brilliance to comfort our
souls.

### Q13. What prophetic words were especially designed to comfort the mothers in Bethlehem who should mourn for having lost their innocent children through the envy of Herod?

**“Thus saith the Lord: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from
tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord; and they shall come again
from the land of the enemy.” (Jeremiah 31:16; compare with Matthew 2:16-18)**

**Answer:** This prophecy, while originally regarding Israel's captivity, finds
a fulfillment in the slaughter of the innocents by Herod. It offers a profound
hope regarding death.

- **The Land of the Enemy:** The text calls death "the land of the enemy." Death
  is not a friend; it is the wages of sin (Romans 6:23). It is an intruder in
  God's creation.
- **The Hope of Resurrection:** The promise "they shall come again" refers to
  the resurrection. This teaches that the dead are not currently in heaven, but
  are in the "land of the enemy" (the grave/death), awaiting the call of the
  Life-giver.
- **The Reward:** The faithful mother’s work is not lost. God marks her tears,
  and in the resurrection morning, families will be reunited.

---

### Q14. What does the apostle present as a comfort to those who have lost dear friends by death?

**“For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which
sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him... Wherefore comfort one another with
these words.” (1 Thessalonians 4:14-18)**

**Answer:** Paul gives the ultimate comfort for the bereaved: the Second Coming
of Christ.

1.  **Sleep in Jesus:** The Bible consistently describes death as a "sleep"
    (John 11:11-14). It is a state of unconscious rest, free from pain and
    awareness, until the resurrection.
2.  **The Resurrection:** Just as Christ rose, so will those who died trusting
    in Him. "The dead in Christ shall rise first."
3.  **Reunion:** We shall be "caught up together... to meet the Lord in the
    air." This is the blessed hope. We are not comforted by the idea that our
    loved ones are watching us suffer now, but by the promise that they will be
    woken from sleep when Jesus returns.

**[ILL] The Long Night:** When a child goes to sleep at night, they know nothing
of the passing hours. The next moment they are conscious of is the morning sun
and their parents' faces. So it is with death. The believer closes his eyes in
death, and his very next conscious moment is seeing the face of Jesus coming in
the clouds.

---

### Q15. When one has received the Comforter in his heart, what use should he make of it?

**“Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them
which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of
God.” (2 Corinthians 1:4)**

**Answer:** God does not pour His grace into us to be stored, but to flow
through us.

- **Channels of Grace:** When God brings us through a trial, He gives us a
  unique empathy and experience to help others going through similar trials.
  Your pain becomes your pulpit; your test becomes your testimony.
- **Practical Ministry:** We are to comfort others not with platitudes, but "by
  the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted." We share the promises and
  the reality of God's presence that sustained us.

**[ILL] The Bucket Brigade:** In the old days, men would form a line to put out
a fire, passing buckets of water from one to another. If one man held onto the
bucket and refused to pass it, the flow stopped. We are in a line receiving the
water of life and comfort. We must pass it on to the next person in the fire of
affliction.

---

### Q16. How was Paul once comforted when in trouble?

**“Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by
the coming of Titus.” (2 Corinthians 7:6)**

**Answer:** Paul, the great apostle, was not ashamed to admit he was "cast down"
(depressed or discouraged).

- **Human Instrumentality:** God often comforts us through people. He did not
  send an angel to Paul this time; He sent Titus.
- **The Value of Fellowship:** We should not isolate ourselves in our sorrow.
  The communion of saints is God's appointed method for sustaining His people. A
  visit, a kind word, or the mere presence of a faithful friend is a means of
  grace.

---

### Q17. When in affliction, how should one rest his case?

**“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God.”
(Romans 8:28)**

**Answer:** This is the bedrock of Christian optimism. It is not that all things
_are_ good (sin and sickness are bad), but that God overrules all things _for_
good.

- **The Condition:** The promise is "to them that love God." For the rebellious,
  trials often harden the heart. For the lover of God, trials soften and refine.
- **The Definition of "Good":** Verse 29 defines the "good" as being "conformed
  to the image of His Son." God’s goal is not necessarily our temporary comfort,
  but our eternal character.
- **Providence:** We rest our case in the knowledge that nothing happens by
  accident. God is at the helm of our lives.

---

### Q18. How did the bonds which were endured by Paul work for good?

**“But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened
unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; so that my
bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places.”
(Philippians 1:12)**

**Answer:** Paul was in prison in Rome, yet he saw this as a victory, not a
defeat.

- **Furtherance of the Gospel:** Because Paul was chained to Roman guards, the
  elite Praetorian Guard heard the gospel. The message penetrated the highest
  levels of Caesar's household (Philippians 4:22).
- **Great Controversy Perspective:** Satan tried to silence Paul by locking him
  up. God turned the prison into a megaphone.
- **Application:** When we are restricted or afflicted, we should look for the
  new opportunities God is creating for the gospel to advance.

---

### Q19. How does Christ exhort those who have tribulation in the world?

**“These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the
world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the
world.” (John 16:33)**

**Answer:**

- **Two Realms:** In the world—tribulation. In Me—peace. The Christian lives in
  both realms simultaneously. We feel the trouble of the world, but we possess
  the peace of Heaven.
- **The Basis of Courage:** "Be of good cheer." Why? Not because we are strong,
  but because "I [Jesus] have overcome the world."
- **Vicarious Victory:** This is the essence of **Righteousness by Faith**.
  Jesus met every temptation, every sorrow, and the full weight of sin, and He
  conquered. When we are in Him, His victory is credited to us. We do not fight
  _for_ victory; we fight _from_ His victory.

**[ILL] The Conqueror's Family:** When a king returns from battle having won the
war, his family shares in the peace and the spoils, even though they did not
fight on the front lines. Jesus is our King. He fought the battle at Calvary and
won. Now He says to us, "Be of good cheer; the enemy is defeated. Share in My
peace."

---

### Q20. What comforted the apostle in these troubles?

**“For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” (Romans 8:18)**

**Answer:** Paul uses the language of accounting ("I reckon" or calculate). He
weighed the cost and the reward.

- **The Comparison:** On one side of the scale is "suffering of this present
  time" (short, temporary). On the other side is "glory" (eternal, weighty). The
  glory so far outweighs the suffering that they are not even worthy of
  comparison.
- **Revealed "In" Us:** Notice it says the glory is revealed _in_ us. This
  refers to the final restoration of God's image in man—glorification. To be
  made like Jesus, free from sin and death forever, is worth any price.

---

### Q21. What did he call the troubles that beset him?

**“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.” (2 Corinthians 4:17)**

**Answer:**

- **Light Affliction:** Paul suffered beatings, shipwrecks, and hunger (2
  Corinthians 11), yet he calls it "light." How? By looking at the "eternal
  weight of glory."
- **Worketh for Us:** Affliction is not a meaningless accident. It is "working"
  something. It is producing spiritual muscle, endurance, and character.
- **The Perspective of Eternity:** To the earth-bound view, trials seem like
  mountains. To the heaven-bound view, they are "but for a moment."

**[ILL] The Scales:** Imagine a balance scale. On the left side, place all your
sickness, tears, losses, and pain. It looks heavy. But on the right side, God
places "Eternity" and "Glory." The right side slams down, launching the left
side into the air. The weight of glory makes the weight of affliction seem like
a feather.
