# Bible Study: The Powers That Be

## Introduction

The Christian's relationship to civil government presents one of the most
practical and profound questions of faith: How do we honor earthly authorities
while maintaining supreme allegiance to God? Scripture reveals that civil
government is indeed ordained of God for the good of society—yet there exists a
higher authority before whom every ruler and every soul must ultimately give
account. Understanding these two spheres of authority is essential for
navigating the challenges that face God's people in every age.

## Core Truths

### God's Ordination of Civil Government

The apostle Paul makes a remarkable declaration regarding earthly powers:

> _"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but
> of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."_ (Romans 13:1)

This statement establishes a foundational truth: civil government is not a human
invention but a divine institution. God has ordained governmental authority for
the preservation of order and the restraint of evil in a fallen world.

**Ordained**: This means "appointed" or "established by decree." God has set up
civil authority as part of His providential care for humanity.

The proper sphere of civil government is clearly defined:

> _"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil... for he is the
> minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil."_
> (Romans 13:3–4)

Government's God-given role is to:

- **Restrain evil** through the administration of justice
- **Protect the innocent** from those who would do harm
- **Maintain civil order** for the welfare of society

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "minister" in Romans 13:4 is _diakonos_—the
same word from which we derive "deacon." Civil rulers, in their proper function,
are servants of God for the good of the people, whether they recognize it or
not.

### The Christian's Duty to Civil Authority

Scripture gives clear instruction regarding our responsibility to government:

> _"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
> magistrates, to be ready to every good work."_ (Titus 3:1)

> _"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it
> be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by
> him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do
> well."_ (1 Peter 2:13–14)

Christians are called to:

- **Pay taxes honestly**: _"Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom
  tribute is due"_ (Romans 13:7)
- **Show proper respect**: _"Honour all men... Honour the king"_ (1 Peter 2:17)
- **Obey just laws**: _"To obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work"_
  (Titus 3:1)

This submission is not based on the worthiness of rulers but on recognition of
God's ordering of society. Even when governing authorities are corrupt or
unjust, Christians are called to be model citizens in all matters that do not
conflict with God's higher law.

## Deeper Truths

### Two Distinct Spheres of Authority

Christ Himself established the principle that distinguishes between civil and
religious authority:

> _"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the
> things that are God's."_ (Matthew 22:21)

This profound statement reveals that there are two separate realms:

1. **Caesar's realm**: Civil matters—taxes, public order, civic duties
2. **God's realm**: Religious matters—worship, conscience, faith, obedience to
   divine law

[Q] **"Doesn't Romans 13 mean we must obey government in everything?"**

No. Romans 13 defines the _legitimate_ sphere of civil authority—punishment of
evil and protection of good in _civil_ matters. When government steps outside
its God-given boundaries and commands what God forbids, or forbids what God
commands, the Christian must obey the higher authority. The same Paul who wrote
Romans 13 was repeatedly imprisoned for disobeying religious decrees from civil
authorities (Acts 16:23–24; 2 Corinthians 11:23–25).

### The Sanctuary Principle of Government

In the sanctuary service, we see God's ideal pattern of governance. The priests
served in sacred things, teaching the people God's law (Malachi 2:7). Civil
rulers administered justice in civil matters. When King Uzziah attempted to burn
incense in the temple—a priestly function—God struck him with leprosy (2
Chronicles 26:16–21).

This separation illustrates a vital truth: **God has never authorized civil
government to enforce religious observance**. The mingling of church and state
corrupts both institutions and inevitably leads to persecution of those who
follow conscience rather than civil decree.

## Biblical Examples of Faithful Resistance

### The Three Hebrews and Nebuchadnezzar's Image

King Nebuchadnezzar issued a universal decree:

> _"That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut,
> psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the
> golden image... and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour
> be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace."_ (Daniel 3:5–6)

Three Hebrew captives—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—faced an impossible
choice: obey the king and violate God's command against idol worship, or obey
God and face death.

Their response reveals the principle that guides God's people in every age:

> _"O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be
> so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
> furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it
> known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the
> golden image which thou hast set up."_ (Daniel 3:16–18)

[ILL] Consider a soldier who receives orders from his captain to attack
civilians. Though he owes obedience to his captain in military matters, there is
a higher law—the law of humanity—that forbids murder of innocents. No earthly
authority can command what a higher law forbids. So it is with the Christian:
civil authority is legitimate in its sphere, but when it commands what God
forbids, we must obey the Commander-in-Chief of the universe.

God honored their faithfulness with miraculous deliverance. Even the heathen
king was compelled to acknowledge:

> _"Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his
> angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the
> king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship
> any god, except their own God."_ (Daniel 3:28)

### Daniel in the Lions' Den

Daniel's enemies knew they could find no fault in his civil conduct:

> _"We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it
> against him concerning the law of his God."_ (Daniel 6:5)

They manipulated King Darius into signing a law forbidding prayer to any god for
thirty days. Daniel's response was immediate and unwavering:

> _"He went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
> Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave
> thanks before his God, as he did aforetime."_ (Daniel 6:10)

Daniel did not pray publicly to make a demonstration. He simply continued his
faithful practice of communion with God. He would not allow any human decree to
interrupt his relationship with Heaven.

[DYK🔎] Daniel's windows were "open toward Jerusalem"—toward the temple where
God's presence dwelt. Even in exile, Daniel's prayers were directed toward the
sanctuary, the center of God's government on earth. His loyalty was to the
throne of God above every earthly throne.

### The Apostles Before the Sanhedrin

Christ had commanded: _"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature"_ (Mark 16:15). The Jewish authorities countermanded this with their
own decree: _"And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor
teach in the name of Jesus"_ (Acts 4:18).

The apostles' response established the unchanging principle:

> _"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto
> God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and
> heard."_ (Acts 4:19–20)

When imprisoned for continuing to preach, God Himself intervened:

> _"But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them
> forth, and said, Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words
> of this life."_ (Acts 5:19–20)

Brought again before the council, the apostles declared the principle that has
guided faithful believers through every age of persecution:

> _"We ought to obey God rather than men."_ (Acts 5:29)

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Higher Power Above All Powers

Solomon, the wisest of earthly kings, recognized a supreme authority above all
human government:

> _"If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment
> and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher
> than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they."_ (Ecclesiastes
> 5:8)

God observes every act of injustice. No tyrant's decree escapes His notice. The
persecutor may triumph for a season, but there is One who "regardeth"—who takes
careful note of every wrong done to His children.

### Religion: The Realm of God Alone

**Religion**: The recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and
obedience; man's personal relation of faith and duty to his Creator.

By its very nature, religion is **between the soul and God**. No human authority
can stand between a person and their Maker:

> _"And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is
> in heaven."_ (Matthew 23:9)

> _"Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ."_
> (Matthew 23:10)

[Q] **"Doesn't the state have authority to enforce religious observances for the
good of society?"**

Christ's words make clear that worship belongs to God alone: _"Thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve"_ (Matthew 4:10). When
civil government attempts to enforce religious practice, it usurps God's
prerogative and puts itself in the place of God (2 Thessalonians 2:3–4). The
history of religious persecution—from pagan Rome to the medieval church to
modern totalitarian states—demonstrates the evil fruit of such presumption.

### Accountability to God Alone in Matters of Faith

> _"So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God."_ (Romans
> 14:12)

Since every soul must personally answer to God for their faith and practice, no
human authority can lawfully compel conscience:

> _"Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he
> standeth or falleth."_ (Romans 14:4)

The believer is Christ's purchased possession:

> _"Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men."_ (1 Corinthians
> 7:23)

This does not mean Christians are rebellious or anarchical. In civil matters,
they are the most loyal citizens. But in matters of faith, worship, and
conscience, they acknowledge only one Master—the Lord Jesus Christ.

### The Great Controversy and Religious Liberty

The conflict between God's government and Satan's rebellion centers on the
question of allegiance. Satan has always sought to compel worship—whether
through Nebuchadnezzar's image, Darius's decree, Rome's imperial cult, or the
religious persecutions of the Dark Ages.

God's government, by contrast, operates on the principle of love and free
choice. He invites: _"Come now, and let us reason together"_ (Isaiah 1:18). He
appeals: _"Choose you this day whom ye will serve"_ (Joshua 24:15). He never
compels.

When civil government attempts to enforce religious observance, it reflects
Satan's principle of coercion rather than God's principle of liberty. This is
why prophecy reveals that in the last days, a union of church and state will
again attempt to compel worship, using civil penalties against those who follow
conscience (Revelation 13:15–17).

## Practical Application

### Principles for the Christian Citizen

1. **Be exemplary citizens in civil matters**—pay taxes honestly, obey just
   laws, show respect to authorities, contribute to the common good.

2. **Recognize the limits of civil authority**—government has no God-given
   jurisdiction over matters of faith, worship, or conscience.

3. **Prepare for times of testing**—Daniel and the three Hebrews did not
   suddenly become faithful when the crisis came. Their faithfulness in the
   furnace and the lions' den grew from daily habits of communion with God.

4. **Trust God with the consequences**—"Our God whom we serve is able to deliver
   us... But if not, we will not serve thy gods." Whether God delivers
   miraculously or allows us to suffer, we leave results with Him.

5. **Maintain a spirit of humility and love**—resist unjust laws without
   bitterness or hatred toward those who enforce them. The apostles continued to
   preach with joy even after being beaten (Acts 5:40–42).

6. **Stand on principle, not preference**—we do not resist government because we
   dislike its leaders or disagree with political policies. We resist only when
   government commands what God forbids or forbids what God commands.

### Living in the Judgment Hour

> _"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one
> may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,
> whether it be good or bad."_ (2 Corinthians 5:10)

The investigative judgment now proceeding in heaven reminds us that every soul
must give account to God—not to pope, king, president, or any human tribunal.
This solemn truth should:

- **Liberate us** from fear of human authority in matters of conscience
- **Sober us** with recognition that God sees and records every action
- **Motivate us** to daily faithfulness in small things, preparing us for
  whatever tests may come

## Appeal

> _"We ought to obey God rather than men."_ (Acts 5:29)

Dear friend, the time is coming—and may already be upon us—when loyalty to God
will require costly choices. The principles established in Scripture are not
abstract theology but practical guides for navigating the final crisis.

How stands your relationship with Heaven today? Daniel's faithfulness in the
lions' den grew from years of faithful prayer "as he did aforetime." The three
Hebrews' courage before the furnace was the fruit of settled convictions formed
long before the crisis.

Will you commit today to daily communion with God—to know His voice so clearly
that no counterfeit decree can deceive you? Will you purpose in your heart, like
Daniel, that you will not defile yourself with the world's offerings, whatever
the cost?

The God who shut the lions' mouths and walked with His servants in the fiery
furnace is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He is able to deliver—and
even if He permits us to seal our testimony with suffering, He will never leave
nor forsake His faithful ones.

_"Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but
rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."_ (Matthew
10:28)
