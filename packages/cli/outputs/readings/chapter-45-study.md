# Reading 45: The Prophetic Symbols of Daniel 8

## Introduction

Daniel chapter 8 presents one of Scripture's most remarkable prophetic visions—a sweeping panorama of world empires from ancient Persia to the close of earth's history. Given while Daniel served in the palace at Shushan, this vision introduces the 2,300-day prophecy, the longest time prophecy in the Bible, pointing forward to the cleansing of the sanctuary and God's final judgment work. Understanding these symbols unlocks our comprehension of where we stand in the stream of time.

## Core Truths

### The Setting and First Symbol: The Ram

Daniel received this vision while at "Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam" (Daniel 8:2)—significantly, the very capital of the Persian Empire he was about to see portrayed.

> _"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last."_ (Daniel 8:3)

We need not guess the meaning, for Gabriel declares plainly:

> _"The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia."_ (Daniel 8:20)

The two horns represent the dual nature of this kingdom—Media and Persia united. The higher horn coming up last perfectly describes how Persia, though joining the alliance later, became the dominant power under Cyrus the Great.

[DYK🔎] Persian kings actually wore a crown bearing the image of a ram's head, and the ram was the guardian spirit of Persia in ancient astrology. God chose a symbol the Persians themselves recognized!

### The He-Goat from the West

> _"As I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes."_ (Daniel 8:5)

Again, Scripture interprets itself:

> _"And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king."_ (Daniel 8:21)

The goat "touched not the ground"—a vivid picture of the lightning speed of Alexander the Great's conquests. In just thirteen years (334–323 BC), Alexander conquered the known world, from Greece to India, moving with such swiftness his campaigns seemed almost supernatural.

[DYK🔎] Ancient Greek coins depicted their nation as a goat, and the Aegean Sea derives its name from the Greek word "aix" (goat). Once again, God used symbols these empires recognized as their own emblems!

### The Four Horns: Division of Greece

> _"Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."_ (Daniel 8:8)

Gabriel explains: _"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power"_ (Daniel 8:22).

At the height of his power, Alexander died suddenly in Babylon at age 32. His empire was eventually divided among four generals:

- **Cassander** — Macedonia and Greece (west)
- **Lysimachus** — Thrace and Asia Minor (north)
- **Seleucus** — Syria and Babylon (east)
- **Ptolemy** — Egypt (south)

"Toward the four winds of heaven"—exactly as prophesied, the empire split in four directions. Yet these successors never possessed Alexander's power: "but not in his power."

## Deeper Truths

### The Little Horn: A Power Unlike the Others

> _"And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land."_ (Daniel 8:9)

This "little horn" differs from the little horn of Daniel 7. Here, it emerges from one of the four divisions of Greece and becomes "exceeding great"—greater even than Medo-Persia (which was merely "great," verse 4) or Greece (which was "very great," verse 8).

[Q] **"Is this little horn the same as the one in Daniel 7?"**

While both represent persecuting powers opposing God's people, careful study reveals distinctions. Daniel 7's little horn arises from the fourth beast (Rome) among ten horns, representing a religious-political power emerging from divided Rome. Daniel 8's little horn arises from one of four Greek divisions and encompasses both pagan and papal Rome as successive phases of the same persecuting system. The vision in chapter 8 focuses particularly on Rome's attack against the sanctuary and its services—both the literal temple and its heavenly antitype.

### The Attack on Heaven Itself

The little horn's ambitions reach beyond earthly conquest:

> _"And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down."_ (Daniel 8:10-11)

Notice the progression of blasphemous presumption:

1. **Attacking "the host of heaven"** — persecuting God's people
2. **Magnifying himself to "the prince of the host"** — setting himself against Christ
3. **Taking away "the daily"** — obscuring Christ's continual priestly ministry
4. **Casting down "the place of his sanctuary"** — substituting an earthly system for heaven's true sanctuary service

[ILL] Imagine a servant in a royal palace who gradually usurps his master's authority. First, he mistreats fellow servants. Then he claims to speak for the king. Eventually, he sits on the throne itself, receives homage meant for the king, and tears down the king's official court, replacing it with his own counterfeit. This is precisely what the little horn power does spiritually—it attacks God's people, claims Christ's prerogatives, and substitutes an earthly priesthood and sanctuary system for Christ's heavenly ministry.

### The Sanctuary to Be Cleansed

In response to the question "How long?" regarding this desolation, a stunning answer comes:

> _"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."_ (Daniel 8:14)

This is the longest time prophecy in Scripture. In prophetic symbolism, a day represents a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6), making this 2,300 years.

[Q] **"What sanctuary is being cleansed? The earthly temple was destroyed in AD 70."**

Precisely! This prophecy extends far beyond any earthly temple. It points to the heavenly sanctuary where Christ ministers as our High Priest (Hebrews 8:1-2; 9:11-12, 24). The "cleansing" corresponds to the Day of Atonement service described in Leviticus 16, when the sanctuary was cleansed from the accumulated record of confessed sins.

The starting point and calculation of the 2,300 days is not given in Daniel 8—Daniel fainted before the explanation was complete (Daniel 8:27). This sets the stage for Daniel 9, where Gabriel returns to complete the instruction, beginning with the words: "understand the matter, and consider the vision" (Daniel 9:23).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### God's Sovereignty Over World Empires

This prophecy demonstrates that God holds the nations in His hand. Centuries before Persia rose to power, before Alexander was born, before Rome existed as an empire, God revealed the succession of kingdoms with perfect accuracy. The same God who knew the end from the beginning is orchestrating history toward its appointed climax.

> _"He removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding."_ (Daniel 2:21)

### The Sanctuary at the Center

Notice how the entire vision moves toward the sanctuary. The succession of empires matters because of their relationship to God's people and God's sanctuary. The little horn's most grievous sin is not mere political conquest but spiritual usurpation—taking away the "daily" (Christ's continual ministry) and casting down the "place of his sanctuary."

This reveals a crucial truth: the sanctuary is the nerve center of the Great Controversy. Satan's primary attack is against Christ's mediatorial work. Any system that:

- Interposes human priests between sinners and Christ
- Offers earthly sacrifices instead of pointing to Calvary's completed sacrifice
- Claims authority to forgive sins that belongs to God alone
- Obscures the reality of Christ's present heavenly ministry

—participates in the little horn's assault on the sanctuary.

### The Judgment and Final Deliverance

Daniel 7:26 provides the ultimate outcome: _"The judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end."_

The cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8:14 corresponds to the judgment scene of Daniel 7:9-10. God's answer to centuries of persecution and blasphemy is the investigative judgment—the heavenly Day of Atonement when accounts are settled, names are either retained or blotted from the book of life, and God's people are finally vindicated.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "cleansed" in Daniel 8:14 is "tsadaq," meaning "to be made right, justified, vindicated." The sanctuary is not merely purified—it is set right, and God's character and His faithful people are vindicated before the universe.

## Practical Application

### Understanding Christ's Present Ministry

The little horn's work is to obscure the "daily"—Christ's continual ministry on our behalf. Our response must be to fix our eyes on the heavenly sanctuary:

> _"Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession."_ (Hebrews 4:14)

Do you approach God through human intermediaries, or do you come boldly to the throne of grace through Christ alone? The sanctuary truth liberates us to have direct access to our Savior.

### Living in the Time of Judgment

If the 2,300 days ended in 1844 (as Daniel 9 will reveal), we are living in the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary—the antitypical Day of Atonement. Ancient Israel treated this day with solemn reverence, afflicting their souls and putting away all sin (Leviticus 16:29-31; 23:27-29).

This truth calls us to:

1. **Sober self-examination** — Is there any sin cherished, any idol unrendered?
2. **Complete confession** — Only sins confessed and forsaken are transferred to the sanctuary and ultimately blotted out
3. **Joyful confidence** — Christ our Advocate pleads His blood on our behalf; victory is assured for all who trust Him

### The Assurance of Prophecy's Fulfillment

Every detail of this prophecy has been fulfilled with stunning precision—from the two horns of Medo-Persia to the four divisions of Greece to the rise of persecuting Rome. Should we doubt that the sanctuary will be cleansed, the judgment concluded, and God's kingdom established?

> _"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn."_ (2 Peter 1:19)

## Appeal

Daniel "fainted, and was sick certain days" after receiving this vision (Daniel 8:27). The weight of what he saw—centuries of persecution, truth trampled underfoot, God's sanctuary assaulted—overwhelmed him. Yet God did not leave His prophet in despair. He sent Gabriel to complete the explanation and reveal that despite the apparent triumph of evil, God's purposes would prevail.

We live in the time when "the sanctuary is being cleansed"—the hour of God's judgment has come. Christ our High Priest stands ready to forgive, cleanse, and empower every soul who comes to Him in faith.

> _"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."_ (Hebrews 4:16)

Will you trust your case to the heavenly Advocate today? Will you confess every known sin, surrender every cherished idol, and rest your eternal destiny on the merits of Christ's blood? The same God who revealed the future to Daniel holds your life in His hands. The sanctuary doors stand open. The High Priest waits. Come now, while mercy lingers.
