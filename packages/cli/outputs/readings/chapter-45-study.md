### Q1. Where was Daniel at the time that this vision was given to him?

**“I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in
the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was
by the river of Ulai.” (Daniel 8:2)**

**Answer:**

While Daniel was bodily in Babylon (subject to the final years of the Babylonian
empire), in vision he was transported to Shushan (Susa), the future capital of
the Persian Empire. This relocation in the vision signifies that the prophecy
concerns events that would transpire primarily after the fall of Babylon.

- **The Prophetic Setting:** God often transports His prophets in the Spirit to
  different times and places to reveal the unfolding of the Great Controversy.
- **Historical Accuracy:** The river Ulai (the Eulaeus) flowed near Susa. The
  specific geographical detail confirms the historical reality of Daniel’s
  experience; this is not a myth, but a revelation from the God of history.
- **Preparation for the Future:** God was preparing His people for the
  transition from one world empire to another. Even before Babylon fell, God was
  already outlining the history of the Medes and Persians.

**[ILL] The Architect’s Blueprint:** Before a single brick is laid for a new
wing of a building, the architect has already drawn the plans. Similarly, before
the rise of Persia or Greece, the Great Architect of history had already mapped
out the rise and fall of nations, proving that He is in control (Isaiah
46:9–10).

### Q2. In this vision, what did Daniel see first?

**“Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the
river a ram which had two horns.” (Daniel 8:3)**

**Answer:**

The first symbol presented to Daniel is a ram with two horns. As we will see
later in the chapter, the Bible explicitly interprets its own symbols.

- **The Symbol of Power:** In the ancient world, horns symbolized power and
  authority (Zechariah 1:18–19).
- **Two Aspects of One Power:** The text notes (in verse 3) that the two horns
  were high, but one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
  This perfectly illustrates the dual nature of the Medo-Persian empire.
  - The Medes rose first.
  - The Persians rose later but became the stronger, dominant force under Cyrus
    the Great.
- **God’s Foreknowledge:** This detail confirms the divine inspiration of the
  Bible. God accurately described the political dynamic of a world superpower
  centuries before modern historians analyzed it.

### Q3. What was next shown to him?

**“As I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of
the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn
between his eyes. And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. And I saw
him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote
the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand
before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there
was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. Therefore the he goat waxed
very great.” (Daniel 8:5-8)**

**Answer:**

While Daniel contemplated the ram, a new power appeared: a rough "he goat"
charging from the west.

- **The Identity:** This represents the empire of Greece (identified in verse
  21).
- **Speed of Conquest:** The phrase "touched not the ground" signifies the
  incredible speed of Alexander the Great’s conquests. In roughly a decade, his
  armies swept across the known world, conquering the Persian Empire with
  unprecedented swiftness.
- **The Notable Horn:** This "great horn" represents Alexander the Great
  himself, the first king who unified the Grecian forces against Persia.
- **The Fury of Power:** The prophecy describes the intense hostility ("choler")
  between these powers. History records the bitter vengeance Greece sought
  against Persia for previous invasions.
- **Human Power vs. Divine Sovereignty:** Despite the goat’s immense power, the
  text says "he waxed very great." But worldly greatness is fleeting. No human
  conqueror, no matter how powerful, can secure eternal life or lasting peace.

**[ILL] The Falling Star:** Alexander the Great rose like a blazing meteor,
illuminating the political sky, only to burn out instantly. It reminds us that
"all flesh is grass" (Isaiah 40:6). True greatness is not found in conquering
nations, but in conquering self through the grace of Christ (Proverbs 16:32).

---

### Q4. When the notable horn was broken, what came up next?

**“When he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four
notable ones toward the four winds.” (Daniel 8:8)**

**Answer:**

This verse contains a striking fulfillment of prophecy.

- **Broken When Strong:** Alexander did not die in old age or defeat. He died at
  the height of his power, at age 32, reportedly due to a fever aggravated by
  intemperance (excessive drinking).
  - _Temperance Lesson:_ Even the conqueror of the world was conquered by his
    own appetite. A Christian must exercise self-control through the Holy Spirit
    to be fit for service (1 Corinthians 9:25–27).
- **Four Notable Ones:** Upon Alexander’s death, there was no single heir to
  hold the empire together. Instead, after years of conflict, the empire was
  divided among his four leading generals (Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and
  Ptolemy) toward the "four winds" (north, south, east, west).
- **Prophetic Precision:** The Bible predicted that the kingdom would be divided
  into four, not three or five. History confirms this exactly.

---

### Q5. What important horn came out of one of these horns?

**“Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great,
toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. And it
waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and
of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.” (Daniel 8:9-10)**

**Answer:**

Here appears the central antagonist of the vision: the "Little Horn."

- **Origin:** The text says it came "out of one of them." In the Hebrew
  grammatical structure, this likely refers to one of the "winds" (directions)
  mentioned in the previous verse. Rome rose from the West, eventually
  conquering the divisions of the Greek empire.
- **Identity:** Historically, this symbol represents **Rome** in its two phases:
  1.  **Pagan Rome:** The political empire that persecuted God’s people and
      crucified Christ.
  2.  **Papal Rome:** The religio-political power that succeeded the Caesars and
      continued the work of persecution and spiritual obscuration.
- **Expansion:** It grew toward the South (Egypt), the East (Syria/Macedonia),
  and the Pleasant Land (Judea/Israel).
- **War on the Host:** This power is described as attacking the "host of
  heaven." While Pagan Rome martyred early Christians, Papal Rome persecuted the
  faithful "stars" (teachers and leaders of the true church) during the 1260
  years of papal supremacy.

**Definition:**

> **The Great Controversy:** The cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan. In
> Daniel 8, we see this conflict played out on earth as the Little Horn power
> attempts to obscure the ministry of Christ and destroy His people.

### Q6. What command was then given to an angel that stood nearby?

**“I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said,
Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.” (Daniel 8:16)**

**Answer:**

- **The Commander:** The "man's voice" likely belongs to the Prince of the host,
  Jesus Christ, who has authority over the angels.
- **Gabriel’s Mission:** Gabriel, the angel who stands in the presence of God
  (Luke 1:19), is commissioned to be the interpreter of prophecy.
- **Our Need for Understanding:** God does not give prophecy to confuse us, but
  to save us. If Daniel needed help to understand, how much more do we? We must
  pray for the Holy Spirit to open our minds to the Scriptures (John 16:13).

---

### Q7. What were the first words that the angel then spoke to the prophet?

**“Understand, a son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.”
(Daniel 8:17)**

**Answer:**

- **A Message for the Final Days:** Gabriel explicitly states that this vision
  applies to the "time of the end." It is not merely local history for the Jews
  of antiquity; it stretches to the final scenes of earth's history.
- **The Importance of Daniel 8:** Since we are living in the "time of the end,"
  the study of Daniel 8 is crucial for the Seventh-day Adventist believer and
  all Christians. It reveals the specific attack Satan has launched against the
  intercessory ministry of Christ.

---

### Q8. Did the angel then explain about the ram and the he-goat?

**“The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia.” (Daniel 8:20-21)**

**Answer:**

- **Biblical Interpretation:** We do not need to guess the meaning of these
  symbols. The Bible provides its own dictionary.
  - Ram = Media and Persia.
  - Goat = Greece.
- **Certainty of Faith:** This explicit identification gives us confidence to
  identify the subsequent symbols (the four horns and the Little Horn) using the
  same historicist method. We look for the powers that followed Greece in
  history.

---

### Q9. What is represented by the four horns that come up in place of the broken one?

**“Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall
stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.” (Daniel 8:22)**

**Answer:**

- **Fulfillment:** As noted in Q4, this represents the division of the Grecian
  Empire into four Hellenistic kingdoms.
- **"Not in his power":** None of these divided kingdoms ever achieved the
  singular, unified strength that the empire possessed under Alexander. Division
  always leads to weakness (Mark 3:24).

---

### Q10. What is the meaning of the "little horn" in verse 9?

**“In the latter time of their [successors of Alexander] kingdom, when the
transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and
understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.” (Daniel 8:23)**

**Answer:**

Gabriel provides further details on the "Little Horn" power (Rome/Papacy):

- **Fierce Countenance:** This power would be ruthless and unyielding. Rome was
  known as the "kingdom of iron" (Daniel 2:40).
- **Understanding Dark Sentences:** This implies skill in intrigue, diplomacy,
  and "hidden" or occult knowledge. It represents a power that uses policy and
  craft to deceive.
- **Spiritual Application:** This power is not just political; it represents a
  system of religion that substitutes human mediators for the Divine Mediator.
  It claims the prerogatives of God.

**[ILL] The Counterfeit:** If a man wants to deceive people with fake money, he
doesn't make it look like a blue square; he makes it look almost exactly like
the real dollar. The Little Horn is Satan’s masterpiece—a religious system that
looks like Christianity but removes the power of Christ’s direct mediation in
the heavenly sanctuary.

### Q11. What was this little horn to do to God's sanctuary?

**“Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the
daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.”
(Daniel 8:11)**

**Answer:**

This is the theological heart of the chapter.

- **Magnified against the Prince:** The "Prince of the host" is Jesus Christ.
  This power sets itself up as a rival to Christ’s authority.
- **Taking away the "Daily":** The word "sacrifice" is supplied by translators.
  The Hebrew word is _ha-tamid_, meaning "the continual." This refers to
  Christ’s continual ministry in the heavenly sanctuary (His intercession,
  represented by the daily services of the earthly tabernacle).
  - By establishing an earthly priesthood and the sacrifice of the Mass, the
    Papal system effectively obscured Christ’s continual work in heaven from the
    minds of the people. It cast the "place" of His sanctuary down to earth,
    making people look to men for forgiveness rather than to Jesus in heaven.
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** True Righteousness by Faith relies
  entirely on the work of Christ _in heaven_ for us (Justification) and _in us_
  by His Spirit (Sanctification). Any system that places human works or earthly
  priests between the sinner and the Savior "casts down" the truth of the
  sanctuary.

**Definition:**

> **Sanctuary (Heavenly):** The true tabernacle in heaven "which the Lord
> pitched, and not man" (Hebrews 8:2), where Jesus ministers His blood to blot
> out our sins and restore us to favor with God.

---

### Q12. What was finally to happen to this persecuting power?

**“The judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and
to destroy it unto the end.” (Daniel 7:26)**

**Answer:**

Although the user’s question references Daniel 7:26 (a parallel prophecy), the
truth remains the same for the power in Daniel 8.

- **The Judgment:** The reign of the Little Horn is ended by the judgment of
  God. Before Christ returns, there is a legal proceeding in heaven (the
  Investigative Judgment) where the records are reviewed.
- **Vindication:** God will vindicate His truth and His people. The power that
  persecuted the saints and obscured the gospel will be stripped of its
  dominion.
- **Assurance:** We need not fear this power if we are hidden in Christ. The
  judgment is good news for the saints, as it pronounces judgment _in favor_ of
  them (Daniel 7:22).

---

### Q13. At what time, according to this important prophecy, was the sanctuary to be cleansed?

**“He said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed.” (Daniel 8:14)**

**Answer:**

This is the foundational verse of the Advent movement.

- **The Time Period:** 2,300 prophetic days. In Bible prophecy, a day represents
  a literal year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). This period of 2,300 years is the
  longest time prophecy in the Bible.
- **The Start and End:** As explained in Daniel 9, this period begins with the
  decree to restore Jerusalem (457 B.C.). Counting 2,300 years from 457 B.C.
  brings us to **1844 A.D.**
- **The Event:** "Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
  - In the earthly type (Leviticus 16), the sanctuary was cleansed once a year
    on the **Day of Atonement**. This was a day of judgment and the final
    removal of sin from the camp.
  - In 1844, Jesus entered the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary to
    begin the work of final judgment and the "blotting out" of sins (Acts 3:19).
- **Practical Application (Sanctification):** The cleansing of the sanctuary
  involves the cleansing of God’s people. God is calling for a people who are
  cleansed from all sin, not by their own power, but by the indwelling life of
  Christ. We are living in the great antitypical Day of Atonement.

**Definition:**

> **Atonement (Final):** The closing work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary,
> where He blots out the record of confessed sins and prepares a people to stand
> pure and holy in His sight at His coming.

### Q14. How did this view of desolation and persecution by the little horn power affect the prophet?

**“I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the
king's business.” (Daniel 8:27)**

**Answer:**

- **The Weight of the Vision:** Daniel was physically overcome by the revelation
  of the conflict, the persecution of God's people, and the long delay (2,300
  days/years) before the final cleansing. It showed the seriousness of the Great
  Controversy.
- **Faithfulness in Duty:** Despite his illness and the heavy burden of
  prophetic knowledge, Daniel "rose up, and did the king's business."
- **Lesson for Us:** Waiting for the Lord’s return should not make us idle. We
  occupy till He comes (Luke 19:13). While our hearts are in the heavenly
  sanctuary with Jesus, our hands should be busy with the duties of this life
  and the mission of sharing the gospel.

**[ILL] The Watchman:** A watchman on the wall sees the danger coming and is
burdened by it, yet he does not abandon his post. He stays alert and warns the
city. We are called to be watchmen, faithful in our daily tasks while warning
the world that the hour of God's judgment is come.
