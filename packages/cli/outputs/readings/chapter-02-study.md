# Bible Study: Searching the Scriptures

## Introduction

The Bible is no mere collection of ancient writings—it is the living voice of God, able to make us "wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus" (2 Timothy 3:15). From Genesis to Revelation, one golden thread runs through every page: the gospel of Jesus Christ. This study reveals how the entire Bible, Old and New Testaments alike, testifies of our Saviour and calls us to diligent, prayerful searching of its sacred pages.

## Core Truths

### The Scriptures Testify of Christ

When Jesus spoke the words, _"Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me"_ (John 5:39), not a single word of the New Testament had yet been written. Christ was directing the Jewish people to the Old Testament—the very scrolls they revered—and declaring that these writings bore witness of Him.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "search" (_eraunaō_) means to investigate thoroughly, as a miner searches for precious ore or a hunter tracks game. Christ calls us not to casual reading, but to earnest, diligent investigation of His word.

This truth revolutionizes how we approach the Old Testament. Every sacrifice, every prophecy, every type and shadow points forward to Jesus. The Passover lamb, the brazen serpent, the smitten rock, the manna from heaven—all testify of Christ.

### The Gospel in Every Age

Many suppose the gospel began with Christ's earthly ministry, but Scripture reveals otherwise:

> _"And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham."_ (Galatians 3:8)

Abraham rejoiced to see Christ's day (John 8:56). His faith in the promised Seed was counted unto him for righteousness (Genesis 15:6; Romans 4:3). The patriarchs offered sacrifices not as empty ritual, but as expressions of faith in the coming Redeemer.

The Israelites in the wilderness also received the gospel:

> _"For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."_ (Hebrews 4:2)

[Q] **"How could Israel have the gospel without knowing Jesus?"**

The gospel has always been salvation by grace through faith in God's appointed Substitute. Before the cross, believers looked forward to the Lamb of God; after the cross, we look back. But in every age, salvation comes the same way—through faith in Christ's merits, not human works. The Israelites ate spiritual meat and drank from that spiritual Rock, _"and that Rock was Christ"_ (1 Corinthians 10:4).

### Moses and the Reproach of Christ

Consider the testimony of Moses:

> _"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt."_ (Hebrews 11:26)

Moses, fifteen centuries before Bethlehem, chose "the reproach of Christ" over Egypt's wealth. How? Because by faith he saw the invisible Redeemer and counted identification with God's suffering people more valuable than all earthly honour.

[ILL] A man discovers a field containing buried treasure. To the watching world, he appears foolish—selling everything he owns to purchase a common plot of ground. But he knows what they do not: beneath that ordinary soil lies wealth beyond imagination. So Moses saw what Egypt could not see—the surpassing riches of Christ—and gladly exchanged temporal glory for eternal treasure.

## Deeper Truths

### Christ: The Foundation of All Scripture

The apostle Paul declares that the church is _"built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone"_ (Ephesians 2:20). Notice: both apostles (New Testament) and prophets (Old Testament) share the same foundation—Jesus Christ.

This unity explains why Philip could take a passage from Isaiah 53 and _"preach unto him Jesus"_ (Acts 8:35). The Ethiopian eunuch was reading words written seven centuries before Christ's birth, yet Philip found the gospel there, because Christ is the subject of all Scripture.

[DYK🔎] The passage the eunuch was reading (Isaiah 53:7-8) describes the Messiah as "a lamb" led to slaughter who "opened not his mouth." This is the same imagery used by John the Baptist: "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). The entire sacrificial system was a gospel sermon in symbol.

### The Need for Guidance

When Philip asked the eunuch, "Understandest thou what thou readest?" he received a humble reply:

> _"How can I, except some man should guide me?"_ (Acts 8:31)

Here is a vital principle. The Scriptures are clear enough for the humblest seeker to find salvation, yet God has ordained that believers should help one another understand His word. The eunuch had the scroll; he lacked the key. Philip provided what was needed—not new revelation, but the connection between prophecy and its fulfillment in Jesus.

[Q] **"If we need human teachers, doesn't that undermine Scripture's sufficiency?"**

Not at all. The Holy Spirit is the supreme Teacher (John 16:13), and Scripture interprets Scripture. Human teachers serve as instruments, not authorities. Notice Philip did not give his own opinions; he _"began at the same scripture"_ and simply showed how it pointed to Christ. Our role as students and teachers is always to let the Bible explain itself.

### The Berean Standard

The believers at Berea set the pattern for all true Bible students:

> _"These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the Scriptures daily, whether those things were so."_ (Acts 17:11)

Two qualities marked their nobility:

1. **Readiness of mind**—openness to receive truth
2. **Daily searching**—personal verification from Scripture

They did not reject Paul's teaching; neither did they accept it blindly. They tested everything by the written word. This is the safeguard against deception in every age.

[DYK🔎] The word "noble" (_eugenes_) literally means "well-born" or "of good stock." But here the Holy Spirit applies it not to social standing but to spiritual character. True nobility is measured by how we handle God's word.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Word as Life

Christ declared, _"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God"_ (Matthew 4:4). Physical bread sustains the body for a few hours; the word of God sustains the soul for eternity.

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the word of God is both our sword and our shield (Ephesians 6:17). When Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness, our Lord met every attack with "It is written." He did not argue, reason, or rely on His divine power—He trusted the word. If the Son of God needed Scripture to resist temptation, how much more do we?

### God's Word Magnified

The psalmist makes a remarkable declaration:

> _"Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name."_ (Psalm 138:2)

God's name represents His character—His love, justice, mercy, and truth. Yet He has magnified His word even above this. Why? Because the word reveals and confirms the character. When we trust the Scriptures, we are trusting the God who cannot lie (Titus 1:2).

[ILL] A king's seal guarantees his decrees; it stakes his royal honour on their truthfulness. If the seal is broken, the king is dishonoured. God has set His seal upon the Scriptures—He has magnified His word above His name—staking His eternal character on every promise, prophecy, and precept. To doubt the word is to doubt God Himself.

### The Sanctuary Connection

The Israelites' experience in the wilderness powerfully illustrates how God has always taught the gospel through symbol and type. The tabernacle, with its sacrifices, priesthood, and furnishings, was a living sermon on Christ's work of redemption:

- **The outer court** with its brazen altar pointed to Christ's sacrifice on Calvary—justification through His shed blood.
- **The holy place** with its daily ministry pictured Christ's ongoing intercession and our daily walk with Him—sanctification through His indwelling Spirit.
- **The most holy place** and the annual Day of Atonement foreshadowed the final work of judgment and cleansing—the complete blotting out of sin from God's people.

When Paul says Israel "drank of that spiritual Rock... and that Rock was Christ" (1 Corinthians 10:4), he reveals that every blessing they received flowed from the same Saviour who sustains us today. The gospel has never changed; only our vantage point differs—they looked forward in faith; we look backward in gratitude.

## Practical Application

### How to Search the Scriptures

1. **Approach with prayer.** Ask the Holy Spirit to open your understanding (Psalm 119:18). The same Spirit who inspired the word must illuminate it.

2. **Read with readiness of mind.** Come willing to believe and obey what you find, even if it challenges your assumptions or calls for change.

3. **Search daily.** Regularity is more valuable than occasional intensity. A little water every day keeps the plant alive; a flood once a month destroys it.

4. **Let Scripture interpret Scripture.** Compare passage with passage. The clearer texts illuminate the more difficult ones.

5. **Look for Christ.** In every chapter, ask: "What does this reveal about Jesus? How does this point to His character, His sacrifice, His ministry, His coming kingdom?"

6. **Test all teaching.** Like the Bereans, receive instruction with openness but verify everything by the word. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20).

7. **Obey what you learn.** Light received brings more light; light rejected brings darkness. "If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine" (John 7:17).

Dear friend, the Scriptures are able to make you wise unto salvation. They testify of Christ—the same Christ who loved you, died for you, and even now intercedes for you in the heavenly sanctuary. Will you receive His word with readiness of mind? Will you search it daily, letting it transform your character and prepare you for His coming?

The Ethiopian eunuch went on his way rejoicing after he found Jesus in the Scriptures. The same joy awaits every sincere seeker. God has magnified His word above all His name; He invites you to trust it fully, obey it gladly, and find in its pages the eternal life it promises.

Open the sacred book today. Search for Christ. He is waiting to be found.
