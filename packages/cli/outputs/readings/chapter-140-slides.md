## Slide 1 – Q1: The Adversary

- **Question:** With what adversary does man have to contend?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 5:8 – “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the
  devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Great Controversy

- The Christian life is not a playground; it is a battleground.
- We are engaged in a high-stakes conflict between Christ and Satan.
- **The Nature of the Enemy:**
  - A “roaring lion” symbolizes power and a ravenous desire to destroy.
  - He is the accuser: Revelation 12:10 – “...for the accuser of our brethren is
    cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.”
  - He is the father of lies: John 8:44 – “...When he speaketh a lie, he
    speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”

## Slide 3 – Q1: Sobriety and Vigilance

- **The Call to Sobriety:**
  - To be serious-minded and spiritually awake.
  - Luke 21:34 – “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
    overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so
    that day come upon you unawares.”
- **The Call to Vigilance:**
  - The enemy is invisible to human eyes; we must be alert.
  - Vigilance is reliance on Jesus, the Captain of our Salvation.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- We cannot defeat a supernatural enemy with natural strength.
- **Justification:** Being declared righteous places us under Christ’s
  protection.
- **Sanctification:** Being made righteous provides our spiritual armor.
- Ephesians 6:11 – “Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
  against the wiles of the devil.”

## Slide 5 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Sheep and the Lion**
- Imagine a small sheep grazing in a field where a lion prowls.
- If the sheep tries to fight the lion with its own strength, it will perish.
- The sheep’s safety lies not in its own teeth or claws, but in staying close to
  the Shepherd.
- **Lesson:** Our victory is found only in abiding in Christ; wandering away
  makes us prey.

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Nature of Temptation

- **Question:** When is a man tempted?
- **Key Text:** James 1:14 – “But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of
  his own lust, and enticed.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: The Process of Temptation

- While Satan instigates, he finds an ally within the fallen human heart.
- **The Steps:**
  1. **Drawn Away:** Losing focus on Christ.
  2. **Lust:** Strong, disordered desires inherent in fallen nature.
  3. **Enticed:** Sin is presented as attractive or necessary.
- **Temptation vs. Sin:**
  - Being tempted is not sin; Jesus was tempted yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15).
  - Sin occurs when the will consents.

## Slide 8 – Q2: Key Points & Application

- **The Role of the Heart:**
  - Jeremiah 17:9 – “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
    wicked: who can know it?”
  - Outward reformation is not enough; we need a new heart.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We cannot “fix” our own nature. We need Christ’s imparted righteousness.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
    Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
    and write them in their hearts...”

## Slide 9 – Q3: The World as an Obstacle

- **Question:** Is there still another obstacle to man's spiritual advancement?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 2:15 – “Love not the world, neither the things that are
  in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
  him.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Understanding “The World”

- The believer faces a three-fold enemy: The Devil, The Flesh, and The World.
- **Definition:** The organized system of society functioning without God
  (maxims, fashions, pursuit of power).
- **The Exclusivity of Love:**
  - Matthew 6:24 – “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
    one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
    other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”
  - James 4:4 – “...whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the
    enemy of God.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Sanctuary Connection & Illustration

- **Sanctuary Lesson:**
  - Priests washed at the laver before entering the Holy Place (Exodus 30:20 –
    “When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with
    water, that they die not...”).
  - We must be cleansed from the world to commune with God.
- **Illustration: The Boat**
  - A boat is designed to be _in_ the water, but if the water gets _into_ the
    boat, it sinks.
  - We are to be in the world to witness, but if the spirit of the world gets
    _into_ us, our spiritual life sinks.

## Slide 12 – Q4: Human Strength vs. Divine Power

- **Question:** Can anyone overcome these enemies in his own strength alone?
- **Key Text:** John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth
  in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can
  do nothing.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: The Foundation of Righteousness by Faith

- **The Absolute Negative:**
  - Christ says without Him we can do _nothing_, not just “a little.”
  - We cannot generate a single thought of true holiness apart from Him.
- **The Source of Life:**
  - The branch draws sap from the vine to produce fruit.
  - Galatians 5:22–23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,
    longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against
    such there is no law.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Practical Application

- **Abiding:**
  - Requires a continuous, daily connection, not just a one-time conversion.
- **Legalism vs. Gospel:**
  - Attempting to keep the law without Christ is legalism and leads to failure
    (Romans 7).
  - Keeping the law _through_ the power of Christ is the Gospel.
  - Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
    who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Our Cooperative Part

- **Question:** What is required on our part if we are kept from our foes?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 26:41 – “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
  temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Watch and Pray

- Christ provides the power, but He does not override our will.
- **Watch:**
  - Work of the intellect/will. Guarding the senses against Satan’s devices.
- **Pray:**
  - Work of faith. Connecting our weakness to God’s omnipotence.
- **The Weakness of the Flesh:**
  - Even the converted person dwells in fallen human nature. We cannot trust our
    feelings.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Illustration & Definition

- **Key Term: Sanctification**
  - Setting ourselves apart for God’s use and dying to self.
  - 1 Corinthians 15:31 – “I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ
    Jesus our Lord, I die daily.”
- **Illustration: The Guard**
  - A soldier may be loyal (willing spirit) but fall asleep from exhaustion
    (weak flesh).
  - Prayer is the lifeline that keeps the soldier awake and calls for
    reinforcements.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Constant Prayer

- **Question:** How much should we pray?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 5:17 – “Pray without ceasing.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Prayer as a Lifestyle

- **Unbroken Communion:**
  - Living in a constant atmosphere of prayer, heart open to God.
- **Dependence:**
  - Continual prayer expresses continual dependence on God.
- **"Breath of the Soul":**
  - We do not breathe only when we feel like it; we breathe to live.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Faith is the hand that takes hold of God. We keep that hand extended to
    receive Christ’s righteousness for every need.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Strength in Solitude

- **Question:** On what occasions did David receive strength and encouragement?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 63:6 – “When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on
  thee in the night watches.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Meditation and Memory

- **The Night Watches:**
  - In distraction-free silence, we hear God’s voice clearly.
- **Biblical Meditation:**
  - Not emptying the mind, but _filling_ it with God’s character and law.
- **The Power of Memory:**
  - Remembering God’s past faithfulness cures present despair.
  - Psalm 77:11 – “I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
    thy wonders of old.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Truly Blessed Man

- **Question:** What did he say of the man who was truly blessed?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 1:2 – “But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in
  his law doth he meditate day and night.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: The New Covenant Experience

- **Delight, Not Duty:**
  - The converted heart sees the Law as a transcript of God’s character.
  - Romans 7:12 – “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and
    just, and good.”
- **Meditation:**
  - Drives the believer to Christ for forgiveness (Justification) and power
    (Sanctification).
- **Stability:**
  - Psalm 1:3 – “And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water...”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Love Letter vs. The Tax Code**
- A letter from the tax office is read with dread or indifference.
- A letter from a deeply loved one is read with delight; every word is
  treasured.
- **Lesson:** The legalist reads the Bible like a tax code; the true believer
  reads it as a love letter from God.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Spiritual Taste

- **Question:** Will such a condition of mind be distasteful to one who really
  loves God?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 104:34 – “My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be
  glad in the LORD.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Transformation of Taste

- **The Carnal Mind:**
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **The Renewed Mind:**
  - Sanctification changes our spiritual taste buds.
  - We lose the taste for worldly stimulants and hunger for the Bread of Life.
  - Thinking of Jesus—His sacrifice and Sanctuary ministry—becomes our greatest
    joy.

## Slide 27 – Q10: Joy and Perseverance

- **Question:** How long ought one to continue in this constant devotion?
- **Key Texts:**
  - 1 Thessalonians 5:16 – “Rejoice evermore.”
  - 1 Thessalonians 5:17 – “Pray without ceasing.”

## Slide 28 – Q10: A Permanent Condition

- **Rejoice Evermore:**
  - Joy is a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22).
  - It relies on the assurance of salvation, not circumstances.
- **Perseverance:**
  - The Christian race is a marathon, not a sprint.
- **Union of Joy and Prayer:**
  - Psalm 16:11 – “...in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there
    are pleasures for evermore.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Duty in the End Times

- **Question:** What is the special duty of those who live in the time when the
  Lord's coming is expected?
- **Key Text:** Mark 13:33, 37 – “Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not
  when the time is... And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.”

## Slide 30 – Q11: The Danger of Sleeping

- **Spiritual Slumber:**
  - Represents indifference and being caught up in the world (Matthew 25:5 –
    “While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.”).
- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - Christ is ministering in the Most Holy Place.
  - We do not know when our names will come up; we must be ready daily.

## Slide 31 – Q11: Sanctuary Application

- **Day of Atonement:**
  - On the earthly Day of Atonement, people afflicted their souls to focus on
    cleansing.
  - Leviticus 23:27 – “...it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall
    afflict your souls...”
- **Application:**
  - We should be ensuring every sin is confessed and blotted out through
    repentance and prayer.

## Slide 32 – Q12: Intensified Battle

- **Question:** As the Lord's coming draws near, what will make the duty of
  prayer and watchfulness more imperative?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:12 – “...Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of
  the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he
  knoweth that he hath but a short time.”

## Slide 33 – Q12: Satan's Wrath and Deception

- **Satan’s Strategy:**
  - He knows his time is short and works with desperate energy.
  - Expect increased false miracles and temptations.
  - Matthew 24:24 – “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets,
    and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible,
    they shall deceive the very elect.”
- **Great Controversy Theme:**
  - We are a spectacle to the universe (1 Corinthians 4:9).
  - God demonstrates that His law can be kept even amidst Satan’s rage.

## Slide 34 – Q13: Assurance of Help

- **Question:** Can we at that time have all the help we desire to withstand our
  enemies?
- **Key Text:** John 16:23 – “...Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye
  shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.”

## Slide 35 – Q13: Unlimited Resources

  - Praying with the authority and character of Jesus.
  - Presenting Christ’s righteousness as our claim to be heard.
- **The Gift of the Spirit:**
  - Luke 11:13 – “...how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy
    Spirit to them that ask him?”
- **The Mediator:**
  - Jesus mixes the incense of His merits with our prayers (Revelation 8:3–4).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We receive help as a gift of grace, not because of our own works.

## Slide 36 – Q14: When Help is Delayed

- **Question:** If help does not come when it is first asked, what should one
  do?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Luke 18:7 – “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night
    unto him, though he bear long with them?”
  - Psalm 27:14 – “Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
    thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.”

## Slide 37 – Q14: The Purpose of Waiting

  - Persistence shows we value what we are asking for.
- **Character Building:**
  - Waiting teaches patience and total reliance on God’s timing.
- **The Promise:**
  - God _will_ avenge them speedily from the perspective of eternity.

## Slide 38 – Q14: Illustration

- **Learning to Walk**
- A parent may stand a few steps away while a child struggles to walk to them.
- They wait not because they don't care, but because the struggle strengthens
  the child's muscles.

## Slide 39 – Q15: The Final Reward

- **Question:** What promise is vouchsafed to those who are found watching when
  the Lord comes?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:37 – “Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he
