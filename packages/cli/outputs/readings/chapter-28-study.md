### Q1. Has God made known His will concerning the condition of His people?

"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification." 1 Thess. 4:3.

**Answer:** God has not left us in the dark regarding His ultimate purpose for
our lives. His will is not merely that we be forgiven, but that we be
transformed. This process is called **sanctification**.

- **Definition:** **Sanctification** is the ongoing work of God’s grace by which
  the believer is separated from sin and dedicated entirely to God, resulting in
  a character that reflects the holiness of Christ (1 Thessalonians 5:23).
- **God’s Design:** Just as a builder designs a house to be inhabited, God
  designs the human soul to be a dwelling place for His Spirit. He is not
  satisfied with a legal declaration of forgiveness alone; He desires a
  restoration of His image within us (Romans 8:29).
- **The Standard:** The standard of sanctification is nothing less than the
  character of God Himself, as revealed in His law and in the life of Jesus
  Christ.

[ILL] **The Vessel:** Imagine a cup in a royal palace. It is not enough for the
king to simply declare that the cup belongs to him (justification). The cup must
also be washed clean and set aside solely for the king's use, never to hold
common or unclean things again. That setting apart and daily cleansing is
sanctification.

### Q2. Can man accomplish this work for himself?

"I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the
same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing." John 15:5.

**Answer:** Here lies the foundation of **Righteousness by Faith**. Human
effort, willpower, and discipline, while useful in the affairs of life, are
utterly powerless to produce genuine holiness.

- **Total Dependence:** A branch cannot generate sap; it can only receive it. In
  the same way, a Christian cannot manufacture righteousness. We are dependent
  on the vital connection with Jesus for every impulse of goodness.
- **The Fruit, Not the Root:** Good works and a holy life are the _fruit_ of
  salvation, not the _root_. We do not sanctify ourselves to be accepted by God;
  we are accepted by God through Christ, and His life flowing through us
  produces sanctification (Galatians 2:20).
- **"Nothing":** Jesus does not say we can do "a little" without Him. He says
  "nothing." Any obedience attempted apart from the indwelling Christ is merely
  legalism—an outward form without saving power.

[ILL] **The Glove:** A glove lies limp on a table. It cannot pick up a Bible or
shake a hand. It has the shape of a hand, but no life. Only when a living hand
fills the glove can it work. We are the glove; Christ is the hand.
Sanctification is His life moving within us.

---

### Q3. Through what medium is this change wrought?

"And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified
through the truth." John 17:19.

**Answer:** The agent God uses to cleanse the mind and heart is His Word, the
Truth.

- **The Power of the Word:** The Bible is not just a book of history; it is
  "quick, and powerful" (Hebrews 4:12). When received by faith, the Word of God
  has the power to change the nature of the receiver (1 Peter 1:23).
- **Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary, the priest washed at the
  laver before entering the Holy Place. Today, Christ our High Priest washes His
  church "with the washing of water by the word" (Ephesians 5:26).
- **Intellectual vs. Experimental:** It is not enough to merely read the truth;
  we must be "sanctified through" it. This means the truth must conquer our
  prejudices, correct our habits, and govern our conscience.

---

### Q4. In order to enjoy sanctification, what attitude must one assume toward the truth?

"God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of
the Spirit and belief of the truth." 2 Thess. 2:13.

**Answer:** Sanctification requires the cooperation of the human will with the
Divine Spirit. The text highlights two essential elements:

1.  **Sanctification of the Spirit:** This is the divine power. The Holy Spirit
    applies the blood of Christ to the conscience and empowers the will to do
    right (Ezekiel 36:27).
2.  **Belief of the Truth:** This is the human response. This is not a passive
    nod of the head, but an active, grasping faith that accepts God’s warnings
    and promises as a reality for _me_ personally.

- **The Balance:** God provides the power (grace), but man must exercise the
  choice (faith). We cannot sanctify ourselves, but God will not sanctify us
  against our will. We must believe that what God says is true and act upon it.

---

### Q5. But is a simple acknowledgment of God's requirements enough to secure this desirable boon?

"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification
of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ." 1
Peter 1:2.

**Answer:** No, a theoretical knowledge is insufficient. The election of God is
"unto obedience."

- **The Goal is Obedience:** The purpose of the Gospel is not to bypass the Law,
  but to bring us back into harmony with it. **Justification** (being declared
  righteous) leads to **Sanctification** (being made righteous), which results
  in loving obedience to God's commandments (Romans 8:3–4).
- **Sprinkling of the Blood:** In the Old Testament sanctuary service, the
  sprinkling of blood ratified the covenant and cleansed the sanctuary. This
  signifies that our obedience is always mingled with the merits of Christ. Even
  our best works need the merits of Jesus to be acceptable to God.
- **Genuine Faith Works:** As the apostle James clarified, faith that does not
  lead to obedience is dead (James 2:17, 26).

---

### Q6. What change is necessary to make us branches of the Vine?

"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed
away; behold, all things are become new." 2 Cor. 5:17.

**Answer:** The change required is nothing less than a new creation—the "new
birth."

- **Radical Transformation:** Christianity is not a modification of the old
  nature; it is the implantation of a new nature. The "old things" (love of sin,
  selfishness, pride) die, and "new things" (love for God, humility, purity)
  take their place.
- **The Heart Work:** The stony heart is removed, and a heart of flesh is given
  (Ezekiel 36:26). This is the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit.
- **Definition of Conversion:** A turning around. The man who once faced the
  world and had his back to God now faces God and turns his back on the world.

[ILL] **The Caterpillar:** A caterpillar does not learn to fly by taking
aviation classes or by trying harder to jump. It must undergo a metamorphosis to
become a butterfly. It becomes a "new creature." So the sinner must be born
again to live the life of a saint.

---

### Q7. Then how much of the individual is affected by sanctification?

"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly: and I pray God your whole spirit
and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ." 1 Thess. 5:23.

**Answer:** True Bible sanctification is holistic; it encompasses the entire
being.

- **Spirit:** The higher powers of the mind, the conscience, and the connection
  with God.
- **Soul:** The affections, emotions, and personality.
- **Body:** The physical dwelling place of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19).
- **Health Reform:** This verse establishes the biblical basis for health
  reform. We cannot pollute the body with harmful substances (alcohol, tobacco,
  unclean foods) or intemperance and expect the mind to be fully sanctified. The
  physical condition affects the spiritual perception. To prepare for the coming
  of the Lord, the body must be brought into subjection to the laws of life.

---

### Q8. Before we can enjoy this great honor, what must we have?

"The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom; and before honor is
humility." Prov. 15:33.

**Answer:** Humility is the prerequisite for all spiritual growth.

- **Emptying Self:** We cannot be filled with Christ while we are full of self.
  The first step in the plan of salvation is recognizing our own spiritual
  poverty (Matthew 5:3).
- **The Stairway:** In the world, to go up, you must climb. in the Kingdom of
  Heaven, to go up, you must go down. We must descend into the valley of
  humiliation to find the fountain of life.
- **Christ's Example:** Jesus, though He was God, "humbled himself, and became
  obedient unto death" (Philippians 2:8). We follow Him by reckoning our old
  self dead.

---

### Q9. When united to Christ, what is our duty?

“If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where
Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not
on things on the earth." Col. 3:1, 2.

**Answer:** Our duty is to cultivate heavenly-mindedness by focusing on Christ's
work for us in the heavenly sanctuary.

- **The Heavenly Sanctuary:** Paul directs our eyes to where Christ is
  "sitting"—at the right hand of God. He is there as our High Priest,
  interceding for us (Hebrews 8:1–2).
- **Displacement:** We overcome love for the world not by grit, but by the
  "expulsive power of a new affection." When we see the beauty of Jesus and His
  work in heaven, the things of earth lose their attraction.
- **Risen Life:** If we have been baptized (buried) and risen with Him (Romans
  6:4), our citizenship is now in heaven. We are pilgrims here.

---

### Q10. Besides humility, what other grace is necessary?

"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the
vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness." Eph. 4:1, 2.

**Answer:** Meekness is the companion of humility.

- **Definition:** **Meekness** is not weakness; it is strength under control. It
  is the ability to endure injury without resentment and to submit to God's
  dealings without murmuring.
- **Walking Worthy:** A sanctified life is a life that matches the high calling
  we have received. It is inconsistent to claim to be a child of the King while
  displaying a proud, harsh, or unforgiving spirit.
- **Evidence of Grace:** The strongest proof of Christianity is a loving and
  lovable Christian.

---

### Q11. In all things, what should be our mind?

"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." Phil. 2:5.

**Answer:** We are to possess the very mind and attitude of Jesus Christ.

- **Imparted Righteousness:** This is the core of sanctification. It is not just
  acting like Jesus; it is having His thoughts and His Spirit imparted to us.
- **Self-Renunciation:** The context of Philippians 2 shows that the "mind of
  Christ" is the spirit of self-sacrificing love—living entirely for the good of
  others and the glory of God, rather than for self-advancement.

---

### Q12. Then what response can be sincerely made?

"Not My will, but thine, be done." Luke 22:42.

**Answer:** The surrender of the will is the battleground of the Christian life.

- **The Governing Power:** The will is the governing power in the nature of man.
  God does not ask for our feelings; He asks for our will.
- **Gethsemane:** Jesus entered into the depths of human struggle in Gethsemane.
  He conquered by surrendering His human desire for safety to the divine plan
  for redemption.
- **Victory:** When we can sincerely say, "Not my will, but Thine," the battle
  is won. God can then work in us "to will and to do of his good pleasure"
  (Philippians 2:13).

---

### Q13. When in this attitude, what will God do for the petitioner?

"God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshiper of God, and doeth His
will, him He heareth." John 9:31.

**Answer:** God opens the storehouse of heaven to those who are in harmony with
His will.

- **Clarification:** This does not mean God ignores the prayer of a repentant
  sinner crying for mercy (Luke 18:13). It means that those who _cherish_
  sin—who hold onto rebellion ("sinners" in the defiant sense)—cut off the
  channel of communication (Psalm 66:18).
- **Harmony:** Prayer is not intended to change God's mind, but to bring us into
  harmony with Him so that He can bestow the blessings He longs to give. When we
  do His will, our prayers align with His purposes.

---

### Q14. In what words does the apostle express the same sentiment?

"And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and
do those things that are pleasing in His sight." 1 John 3:22.

**Answer:** There is an inseparable link between obedience and answered prayer.

- **Confidence:** A clear conscience gives us "confidence toward God" (v. 21).
  When we know we are striving to please Him, we approach Him with the trust of
  a child.
- **The Law and Prayer:** He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even
  his prayer shall be abomination (Proverbs 28:9). Conversely, the one who loves
  God's law finds an open audience with the King.
- **Pleasing Him:** Sanctification involves doing things simply because they
  please our Father, much like a loving child delights to do small kindnesses
  for a parent.

---

### Q15. What will the lord do for those who love Him sufficiently to keep His words?

"If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and we
will come unto him, and make our abode with him." John 14:23.

**Answer:** The reward is the personal, spiritual indwelling of the Father and
the Son through the Holy Spirit.

- **Love is the Motive:** True obedience springs from love, not fear. "If a man
  love Me, he _will_ keep My words." It is the natural outflow of the
  relationship.
- **The Indwelling:** This is the mystery of the gospel: "Christ in you, the
  hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27). The believer becomes a temple of the living
  God.
- **Restoration:** Sin separated man from God; the plan of salvation restores
  the union.

---

### Q16. In what condition are those in whom Christ dwells?

"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is
life because of righteousness." Rom. 8:10. "All thy commandments are
righteousness." Ps. 119:172. "And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe
to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as He hath commanded us."
Deut. 6:25.

**Answer:** Those in whom Christ dwells are in a state of living righteousness.

1.  **Dead to Sin:** The "body" (the old nature of sin) is reckoned dead. It no
    longer dominates the life.
2.  **Alive to Righteousness:** The Spirit brings new life.
3.  **The Connection to Law:**
    - Psalm 119:172 defines righteousness as God's **commandments**.
    - Therefore, if Christ (the Living Righteousness) dwells in us, He will live
      out the principles of the **law** in our lives.
    - **Righteousness by Faith** does not abolish the law; it establishes it in
      the heart (Romans 3:31). We keep the commandments not _to be_ saved, but
      because we _are_ saved and inhabited by the Law-Giver.

---

### Q17. How is this state of things brought about?

"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of
your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will
of God." Rom. 12:2.

**Answer:** This state is achieved through a radical non-conformity to the world
and a renewing of the mind.

- **Not Conformed:** The world has a mold—fashion, amusement, ambition,
  appetite. The Christian refuses to be pressed into that mold.
- **Transformed:** The Greek word is _metamorphoo_ (metamorphosis). It is an
  inner change that works its way out.
- **Renewing the Mind:** This happens through the study of Scripture and prayer.
  As we behold Christ, we are changed (2 Corinthians 3:18).

---

### Q18. Then what will we be able to do?

"And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus."
Col. 3:17.

**Answer:** We will be able to live a representative life. To do something "in
the name of" someone means to act with their authority and consistent with their
character.

- **Consistency:** There is no division between "religious" life and "secular"
  life. Business, recreation, home life—all are done under the banner of Christ.
- **The Test:** Before any action, word, or amusement, the sanctified person
  asks: "Can I do this in the name of Jesus? Can I ask His blessing upon it?"

---

### Q19. To what extent must our deeds be done with reference to God's glory?

"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
God." 1 Cor. 10:31.

**Answer:** Even the most common biological functions—eating and drinking—are to
be sanctified.

- **The Body Temple:** Because our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit,
  what we put into them matters. A clouded brain (from poor diet, stimulants, or
  narcotics) cannot perfectly discern the will of God.
- **Practical Holiness:** Sanctification reaches the kitchen and the dining
  table. We eat to live and serve God; we do not live to eat and serve appetite.
- **Temperance:** True temperance is total abstinence from that which is
  harmful, and moderate use of that which is good.

---

### Q20. Why should we be so careful of our bodies?

"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
service." Rom. 12:1.

**Answer:** Because we are not our own; we are bought with a price. We are to
offer ourselves as a "living sacrifice."

- **Living Sacrifice:** In the Old Testament, the animal was killed. In the New
  Testament, we "die daily" to self, but live to serve.
- **Holy and Acceptable:** God could not accept a blemished sacrifice in the
  sanctuary service (Malachi 1:8). We should strive to present our bodies in the
  best possible health to God, as a reasonable act of worship.

[ILL] **The Machine:** If a master craftsman gives you a finely tuned, expensive
machine to do his work, you insult him if you pour sand into the gears or fail
to oil it. God has given us the delicate machinery of the body/mind. We honor
Him by keeping it in peak condition for His service.

---

### Q21. How much must we give up to become a true disciple of Christ?

"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he
cannot be My disciple." Luke 14:33.

**Answer:** We must give up absolutely everything.

- **Ownership:** This does not necessarily mean we sell every possession and
  become destitute (though God calls some to that). It means we renounce
  _ownership_. We become stewards. The house, the money, the talent, the
  family—all belong to God. We manage them for Him.
- **Idols:** Anything we hold back—any cherished sin or possession we value more
  than Christ—becomes an idol that blocks sanctification.

---

### Q22. After forsaking all of self, what must we accept, in order to learn of Christ?

"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and
ye shall find rest unto your souls." Matt. 11:29.

**Answer:** We must accept His yoke.

- **The Yoke:** In biblical times, a yoke was a wooden frame joining two oxen to
  pull a load. It implies service, submission, and partnership.
- **Partnered with Christ:** We do not pull the load alone. We are yoked with
  Christ. He bears the heavy end of the burden.
- **Rest in Service:** Paradoxically, true rest is found in submission to
  Christ. The hardest life is the one fighting against conscience; the most
  restful life is the one fully surrendered to God's will.

---

### Q23. How large a place in our affections should the love of Christ occupy?

"He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me: and he that
loveth son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me." Matt. 10:37.

**Answer:** Christ must have the supreme place on the throne of the heart.

- **First Commandment:** "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." Even valid
  human loves (family, friends) become idolatry if placed above obedience to
  Christ.
- **Testing Truth:** Sometimes following the truth causes division in families.
  In such painful times, the sanctified believer chooses Jesus, trusting Him
  with the consequences.

---

### Q24. If we thus follow Christ, what will be the result?

"Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his
lord. If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you." John 15:20.

**Answer:** The result of a holy life in a sinful world is often persecution.

- **The Friction:** Holiness exposes sin. Darkness hates the light. If we live
  like Jesus, the world will treat us as it treated Jesus.
- **The Great Controversy:** We are in a war. The dragon is wroth with the woman
  and makes war with the remnant of her seed who keep the commandments of God
  (Revelation 12:17). We should not be surprised when trials come; they are
  badges of our discipleship.

---

### Q25. But will this persecution separate us from Christ or His love?

"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of
God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." Rom. 8:38, 39.

**Answer:** No external force can separate the loyal believer from Christ.

- **Eternal Security in Relationship:** While we are free to walk away (God does
  not force the will), no enemy, no devil, no government, and no hardship can
  rip us from His hand if we choose to stay.
- **The Final Triumph:** The sanctified life begins with "God's will" (Q1) and
  ends with inseparable union with God's love. The Great Controversy ends with
  the people of God secure, sealed, and safe in His presence forever.

[ILL] **The Anchor:** A ship in a storm may be tossed by the waves, the wind may
howl, and the sails may tear. But if the anchor is holding fast within the veil
of the harbor, the ship is safe. Our anchor is Christ, within the veil of the
heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 6:19). Nothing can cut that line but our own choice
to let go.
