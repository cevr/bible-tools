# Reading 28: Bible Sanctification

## Introduction

Sanctification—the process by which God makes His people holy—stands at the very heart of salvation's purpose. God does not merely forgive sin; He transforms sinners into saints. This study reveals that true sanctification is not human achievement but divine work, accomplished through the truth, by the Spirit, as we abide in Christ. It affects our whole being—spirit, soul, and body—and prepares us for eternity with God.

## Core Truths

### God's Will: Your Sanctification

The Scriptures leave no doubt about what God desires for every believer:

> _"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:3)

**Sanctification**: To be made holy; set apart from sin and consecrated to God's service. The Greek word _hagiasmos_ carries the idea of being separated from common use and devoted entirely to sacred purposes.

This is not a suggestion or secondary concern—it is God's express will. He saved us not merely to escape punishment, but to be restored to His image.

[DYK🔎] The word "sanctify" shares the same root as "saint" and "holy." In Scripture, every true believer is called a "saint"—not because of personal perfection, but because God has set them apart and is working holiness in them.

### The Divine Agent: Christ Alone

Can we accomplish this transformation by our own effort?

> _"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing."_ (John 15:5)

The answer is an emphatic **no**. Apart from Christ, we are powerless to produce genuine holiness. A branch severed from the vine withers and dies; so does the soul disconnected from Jesus.

[ILL] Consider an electric lamp. It may be beautifully crafted, perfectly wired, and placed in the finest room. But until it is connected to the power source, it gives no light. So it is with us: all our religious activities, good intentions, and moral efforts produce no true holiness until we are vitally connected to Christ, the Source of all spiritual power.

### The Medium: Truth and Spirit

Through what agency does God sanctify His people?

> _"Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth."_ (John 17:17)

> _"God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth."_ (2 Thessalonians 2:13)

Sanctification requires:

- **The Truth**—God's Word, which reveals His character and will
- **The Spirit**—the Holy Spirit, who applies truth to the heart
- **Belief**—personal faith that receives and obeys the truth

Truth without the Spirit becomes cold intellectualism. The Spirit without truth leads to emotional fanaticism. But truth received by faith and applied by the Spirit transforms the character.

## Deeper Truths

### More Than Acknowledgment: Obedience Required

Is merely knowing the truth sufficient for sanctification?

> _"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ."_ (1 Peter 1:2)

The goal of sanctification is **obedience**. Not obedience to earn salvation, but obedience as the fruit of genuine faith. The blood of Jesus cleanses us; the Spirit empowers us; and we respond in willing, loving obedience.

[Q] **"Doesn't this make sanctification a form of works-righteousness?"**

Not at all. Notice the order: we are sanctified _unto_ obedience—obedience is the result, not the cause. A sanctified heart naturally produces obedient actions, just as a healthy apple tree naturally produces apples. The fruit does not make the tree good; the tree's nature produces the fruit. So Christ working within produces the obedience without (Philippians 2:13).

### A Complete Transformation

How much of the person does sanctification affect?

> _"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

God's sanctifying work is **comprehensive**:

- **Spirit**—our highest faculties, the capacity for communion with God
- **Soul**—the mind, emotions, and will
- **Body**—our physical being and habits

True sanctification leaves no compartment of life untouched. It governs what we think, feel, choose, eat, drink, and do.

[DYK🔎] Many Christians speak of "spiritual" matters as separate from "physical" concerns, but Scripture knows no such division. Paul commanded, _"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God"_ (1 Corinthians 10:31). God claims the whole person.

### The New Creation

What fundamental change must occur?

> _"Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."_ (2 Corinthians 5:17)

Sanctification builds upon regeneration—the new birth. We must first become new creatures in Christ before we can grow in holiness. The old nature cannot be reformed; it must be replaced. Then the new life, implanted by the Spirit, develops and matures.

> _"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God."_ (Romans 12:2)

**Conformed** means pressed into a mold from outside. **Transformed** (Greek: _metamorphoo_, from which we get "metamorphosis") means changed from within—like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. God does not merely reshape our outward behavior; He transforms our inner nature.

## The Conditions: What God Requires of Us

### Humility

> _"The fear of the Lord is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility."_ (Proverbs 15:33)

> _"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness."_ (Ephesians 4:1, 2)

Pride was the original sin of Satan. It remains the chief obstacle to sanctification. We must come to God acknowledging our utter helplessness—not bringing our achievements, but our need.

### Surrender of the Will

> _"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus."_ (Philippians 2:5)

> _"Not My will, but Thine, be done."_ (Luke 22:42)

Christ's prayer in Gethsemane reveals the essence of sanctification: the human will yielded entirely to the divine will. This is not passive resignation but active cooperation with God's purposes.

[ILL] A skilled potter cannot shape clay that is rigid or unyielding. The clay must be soft, pliable, responsive to the potter's hands. So God cannot sanctify a stubborn, self-willed heart. But when we surrender, saying "Thy will be done," we become workable in the Master's hands, and He shapes us into vessels of honor.

### Total Consecration

> _"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."_ (Romans 12:1)

> _"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple."_ (Luke 14:33)

Old Testament sacrifices were dead when placed on the altar. Christians are called to be **living sacrifices**—daily, continually offering ourselves to God. This means:

- Our time belongs to Him
- Our talents are for His service
- Our possessions are held as stewards
- Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit
- Our relationships are subordinate to His will

### Supreme Love for Christ

> _"He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me."_ (Matthew 10:37)

Christ does not ask us to love family less; He asks us to love Him more. When He holds first place, all other loves find their proper order. But if any earthly affection rivals His claim, it becomes an idol that hinders sanctification.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and Sanctification

The earthly sanctuary illustrated the entire plan of salvation, including sanctification:

- **The Altar of Burnt Offering** (outer court): Complete surrender; the whole sacrifice consumed. So we must lay all on the altar of consecration.

- **The Laver**: Daily cleansing through the Word. _"Sanctify them through Thy truth"_ (John 17:17).

- **The Table of Showbread** (holy place): Daily feeding on Christ, the Bread of Life, sustaining spiritual growth.

- **The Candlestick**: The light of the Spirit illuminating our path, enabling us to walk in the light.

- **The Altar of Incense**: The prayers of the saints, continual communion with God.

As the priests ministered daily in the holy place, so believers are called to daily sanctification—constant feeding on the Word, continual prayer, perpetual walking in the Spirit's light.

### Abiding in Christ: The Secret of Victory

> _"If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him."_ (John 14:23)

> _"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."_ (Romans 8:10)

The indwelling Christ is the power of sanctification. When He makes His home in the heart:

- The power of sin is broken
- The love of sin diminishes
- The practice of sin ceases
- Righteousness becomes natural

This is not suppression of the old nature by human willpower, but displacement of the old by the new. Christ within lives His life through us.

[Q] **"Is it possible to reach a state where we no longer need Christ's help?"**

Never. The branch never outgrows its need for the vine. Even the most mature Christian depends moment by moment on Christ's sustaining grace. Sanctification does not make us independent of Christ; it deepens our dependence. The more we grow, the more we realize our need.

## Practical Application

### Walking with Christ Daily

> _"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."_ (Colossians 3:1, 2)

**Practical steps for daily sanctification:**

1. **Morning Consecration**: Begin each day surrendering your will afresh to God. _"Not my will, but Thine, be done."_

2. **Scripture Feeding**: The truth sanctifies. Daily immerse yourself in God's Word—not merely reading, but meditating, memorizing, and applying.

3. **Prayer Without Ceasing**: Maintain constant communion with God throughout the day. Brief, earnest prayers keep the soul connected to the Source of power.

4. **Physical Stewardship**: Care for the body as God's temple. What you eat, drink, and how you treat your health matters to God (1 Corinthians 10:31).

5. **Thought Life**: Guard the mind. _"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus."_ What you allow into your mind shapes your character.

6. **Do All to God's Glory**: Every task, however small, becomes sacred when done for Him. _"Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus"_ (Colossians 3:17).

### Counting the Cost

> _"Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."_ (Matthew 11:29)

Christ's yoke is easy, His burden light (Matthew 11:30). Yet following Him will bring opposition:

> _"If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you."_ (John 15:20)

The sanctified life may cost us popularity, position, relationships, or comfort in this world. But nothing can separate us from Christ's love:

> _"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."_ (Romans 8:38, 39)

## Appeal

> _"Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:24)

God who commands sanctification also supplies it. He who calls you to holiness will accomplish holiness in you—if you will surrender, trust, and abide.

Will you today make a fresh consecration? Will you lay all on the altar—your will, your time, your body, your relationships, your future? The One who loved you enough to die for you now lives to sanctify you. He waits to transform you by His indwelling presence.

The world offers a broad road of self-pleasing. Christ offers a narrow way of self-surrender. But at the end of self-pleasing lies emptiness and death. At the end of self-surrender lies fullness and eternal life.

> _"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:23, 24)

Come to Him today. Abide in Him always. And He will perfect that which concerns you.
