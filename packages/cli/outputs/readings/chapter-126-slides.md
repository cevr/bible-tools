## Slide 1 – Q1: The Effect of Good Words

- **Question:** What is said of the heavy hearted, and the effect of cheering
  words upon such?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 12:25 – “Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop;
  but a good word maketh it glad.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Burden Bearing)

- **The Burden of Sin and Care:**
  - “Heaviness” represents the crushing weight of guilt, anxiety, or
    discouragement.
  - Spiritual burdens bow down the soul and hinder our walk with God.
- **The Ministry of Encouragement:**
  - A “good word” is not flattery, but the truth of the gospel.
  - Pointing a despondent soul to God’s promises is the work of the Holy Spirit.
- **Christ Our Example:**
  - Jesus did not break the bruised reed (Isaiah 42:3 – “A bruised reed shall he
    not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth
    judgment unto truth.”).
  - We are called to lift up the hands which hang down (Hebrews 12:12).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Sanctuary Application

- **The High Priest’s Shoulders:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the High Priest bore the names of the tribes upon
    his shoulders (Exodus 28:12).
  - **Application:** This illustrates Christ, our High Priest, bearing the
    weight of our cares and sins so we are not crushed by them.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Hiker’s Burden:**
  - Imagine a man hiking a steep mountain with a heavy pack of stones, bent
    over, seeing only the dirt.
  - He cannot see the summit or the view.
  - A “good word” is like a friend who removes the pack and points his eyes
    toward the peak.
  - Result: Strength and vision are restored.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Health and Cheerfulness

- **Question:** What is the influence of cheerfulness upon the sad and
  despondent?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 17:22 – “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine; but
  a broken spirit drieth the bones.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Justification and Health)

- **The Health of the Soul:**
  - A “merry heart” is not frivolity, but a spirit of trust and gratitude.
  - Peace comes through **Justification**: The act of God whereby He declares a
    sinner righteous based on the merits of Jesus Christ, received by faith
    alone (Romans 5:1).
- **A Broken Spirit:**
  - Dwelling on doubt and murmuring destroys physical vitality (“drieth the
    bones”).
  - Despondency weakens the immune system and the strength to resist temptation.
- **Christian Physiology:**
  - Faith conquers fear and promotes health.
  - Cheerfulness is a duty we owe to God and our bodies (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Cellar vs. The Sunshine:**
  - A plant kept in a dark, damp cellar becomes pale, weak, and prone to
    disease.
  - A plant in the sunshine becomes green, robust, and fruitful.
  - **Lesson:** A trusting heart is the sunshine of the soul; gloom is the
    cellar that invites decay.

- **Question:** What did Job exclaim in a time of sore trouble, when well
  meaning friends came to him with words of reproach?
- **Key Text:** Job 16:2 – “I have heard many such things: miserable comforters
  are ye all.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Avoiding Criticism)

- **Misunderstanding God’s Character:**
  - Job’s friends wrongly believed suffering was always punishment for secret
    sin.
  - They failed to understand the **Great Controversy**, where Satan attacks the
    righteous to break their faith.
- **The Failure of Criticism:**
  - They offered accusation instead of sympathy.
  - They poured vinegar into his wounds rather than oil.
- **True Comforters:**
  - A true comforter does not act as a judge.
  - Remember: “For the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
    outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.” (1 Samuel 16:7).

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Wounded Soldier:**
  - A “miserable comforter” stands over a wounded soldier lecturing him on the
    tactical mistake he made to get shot.
  - A true friend kneels down, binds the wound, and carries him to safety.
  - **Lesson:** We are called to be medics of grace, not critics of the law.

## Slide 11 – Q4: The Law of Sympathy

- **Question:** What did he say would have been the case had their circumstances
  been reversed?
- **Key Text:** Job 16:4, 5 – “I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in
  my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at
  you: but I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips
  should assuage your grief.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points (The Golden Rule)

- **The Golden Rule:**
  - Job expresses the spirit of Matthew 7:12 – “Therefore all things whatsoever
    ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”
- **Sympathy over Judgment:**
  - To “heap up words” is easy; to enter another’s pain requires the love of
    Christ.
  - The Spirit of Christ leads us to strengthen the weak, not crush them.
- **Assuaging Grief:**
  - Our words should be a soothing balm.
  - We follow Jesus, who is “touched with the feeling of our infirmities”
    (Hebrews 4:15).

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Drowning Man:**
  - Two men watch a man drowning in rapids.
  - One shouts instructions and criticisms from the shore.
  - The other throws a rope and pulls.
  - **Lesson:** It is easy to criticize from safety; it is Christlike to extend
    help in the deep waters.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Comforting Others

- **Question:** Are not those who have suffered and been comforted of God, best
  able to comfort others?

  Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who
  comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them,
  which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted
  of God.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points (Purpose of Trials)

- **The Source of All Comfort:**
  - All true comfort originates with the Father and the Holy Spirit (the
    Comforter).

  - We cannot lead others where we have not been.
  - Those who have passed through the fire are the most effective witnesses.
- **The Cycle of Grace:**
  - God comforts us to equip us for ministry.
  - We are channels, not reservoirs; grace must flow out.

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Mountain Guide:**
  - A guide who only studies a map can give technical advice.
  - A guide who has climbed the mountain and weathered the storms can say,
    “Follow me, I know the way.”
  - **Lesson:** Our trials make us experienced guides for others.

## Slide 17 – Q6: The Harvest of Light

- **Question:** What beautiful promise is written for the upright in heart?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 97:11 – “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for
  the upright in heart.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points (Sowing and Reaping)

- **The Metaphor of Sowing:**
  - Light and joy are “sown” like seeds.
  - They may be hidden in dark soil (trials) for a time, but the harvest is sure
    (Galatians 6:9).
- **The Condition:**
  - The promise is for the “upright in heart” (sincerity and surrender).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The “righteous” are those who have accepted the Righteousness of Christ.
  - Result: “And the work of righteousness shall be peace” (Isaiah 32:17).

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

  help from God?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 30:11 – “Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing:
  thou has put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points (Divine Exchange)

- **God’s Work:**
  - The text emphasizes God’s action: _Thou_ hast turned; _Thou_ hast put off.
  - Conversion is the work of God, not man.
- **Change of Raiment:**
  - Sackcloth = our sorrow, sin, and penance.
  - Gladness = the garment God provides.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**

    clothe thee with change of raiment.”

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Beggar and the King:**
  - A beggar in rags is invited to a royal banquet.
  - The King removes the rags and clothes him in a royal purple robe.

## Slide 23 – Q8: The Spirit of Service

- **Question:** What should be the spirit of our service toward God?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 100:2 – “Serve the Lord with gladness: come before His
  presence with singing.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points (Liberty in Service)

- **Service and Liberty:**
  - The New Covenant writes the law in the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
  - We serve not _to be_ saved (bondage), but _because we are_ saved (liberty).
- **The Atmosphere of Heaven:**
  - Heaven is a place of joy; serving with gladness practices the manners of
    home.
- **Witness to the World:**
  - A complaining Christian misrepresents the Master.
  - A joyful servant makes the truth attractive.

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Slave vs. The Son:**
  - A slave works in the field fearing the whip.
