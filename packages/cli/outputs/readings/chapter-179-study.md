# Bible Study: The New Jerusalem

## Introduction

The New Jerusalem is the eternal home God has prepared for His redeemed people—a literal, glorious city of unimaginable beauty and perfection. This is not a fairy tale or mere symbolism, but the culmination of all God's promises to His faithful children throughout history. From Abraham's tent to John's Patmos vision, Scripture unveils this city as the ultimate destination for all who overcome through faith in Christ.

## Core Truths

### God Has Prepared a Real City

The Bible presents the New Jerusalem not as a metaphor but as an actual dwelling place with precise dimensions, real materials, and definite features. God is "not ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city" (Hebrews 11:16).

> "But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city." (Hebrews 11:16)

The patriarchs understood that their earthly pilgrimage was temporary. Abraham, though dwelling in tents in Canaan, "looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10). His hope was not in earthly Canaan but in the heavenly Jerusalem.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "prepared" (_hetoimazō_) in Hebrews 11:16 is the same word Jesus used when He said, "I go to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2). God's preparations for His people are thorough, personal, and ongoing.

### The City's Present Location and Future Descent

Scripture reveals that this city currently exists in heaven:

> "But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all." (Galatians 4:26)

When believers embrace Christ by faith, they spiritually "are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem" (Hebrews 12:22). Though we do not yet dwell there physically, our citizenship is already registered in heaven (Philippians 3:20).

At the appointed time, John saw this city descend:

> "And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband." (Revelation 21:2)

### Magnificent Dimensions and Materials

The city's measurements reveal divine perfection:

- **Size**: "Twelve thousand furlongs" (Revelation 21:16)—approximately 1,500 miles in circumference, or 375 miles on each side, forming a perfect square
- **Wall height**: "A hundred and forty and four cubits" (Revelation 21:17)—about 216 feet (66 meters)
- **Wall material**: "Jasper" with "the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass" (Revelation 21:18)

[DYK🔎] The city is described as a perfect cube—"the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal" (Revelation 21:16). The only other perfect cube in Scripture was the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary (1 Kings 6:20), where God's presence dwelt. The entire New Jerusalem is, in effect, a Holy of Holies—God dwelling perpetually with His people.

### The Twelve Foundations and Gates

The foundations bear "the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb" (Revelation 21:14), confirming this is the very city Abraham anticipated (Hebrews 11:10). These foundations are adorned with twelve precious stones:

1. Jasper
2. Sapphire
3. Chalcedony
4. Emerald
5. Sardonyx
6. Sardius
7. Chrysolyte
8. Beryl
9. Topaz
10. Chrysoprasus
11. Jacinth
12. Amethyst

> "And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones." (Revelation 21:19-20)

[DYK🔎] These twelve stones correspond to the twelve stones in the high priest's breastplate (Exodus 28:17-20), which represented the twelve tribes of Israel. In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest carried God's people on his heart before the Lord. In the New Jerusalem, God's people are permanently woven into the very foundations of their eternal home.

The twelve gates, each bearing the name of one of Israel's tribes, are "twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl" (Revelation 21:21).

[ILL] A pearl is formed when an oyster responds to irritation—a grain of sand or injury—by coating it with layers of nacre until something beautiful emerges. Each gate of the New Jerusalem, fashioned from a single pearl, may remind the redeemed that entrance to God's city comes through suffering transformed into glory. Christ's wounds became our doorway to eternal life.

## Deeper Truths

### The City as Sanctuary Fulfillment

The New Jerusalem represents the ultimate fulfillment of the sanctuary message. Consider the progression:

- **Eden**: God walked with man in the garden (Genesis 3:8)
- **Tabernacle/Temple**: God dwelt among His people in the sanctuary (Exodus 25:8)
- **Christ**: "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt [tabernacled] among us" (John 1:14)
- **New Jerusalem**: "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them" (Revelation 21:3)

The city needs "no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it" (Revelation 21:22). The entire city is holy ground—the Most Holy Place expanded to encompass all the redeemed.

[Q] **"If there's no temple in the New Jerusalem, does this mean the sanctuary is no longer important?"**

Not at all. The absence of a temple is not the absence of God's presence but its universal abundance. The sanctuary taught Israel that sin separated them from God, requiring mediation through priest and sacrifice. In the New Jerusalem, sin is forever destroyed, and nothing separates us from God. The sanctuary's purpose is fulfilled—not abolished but completed. We no longer need types and shadows because we have the reality: God dwelling face to face with His people.

### The Throne, the River, and the Tree of Life

At the city's heart stands "the throne of God and of the Lamb" (Revelation 22:3). From this throne flows "a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal" (Revelation 22:1), and on either side grows "the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month" (Revelation 22:2).

This scene echoes and restores Eden (Genesis 2:9-10) while exceeding it:

| **Eden**                              | **New Jerusalem**                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| A tree of life                        | The tree of life, bearing twelve fruits |
| A river watering the garden           | The river of life from God's throne     |
| God's presence in the cool of the day | God's throne in the midst of the city   |
| Access lost through sin               | Access restored through Christ          |

> "Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." (Revelation 22:14)

What Adam forfeited by disobedience, Christ restores to all who keep His commandments through faith. This is not legalism but the fruit of righteousness by faith—Christ's life lived out in redeemed humanity, empowered by His indwelling Spirit.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "healing of the nations" (Revelation 22:2) uses the Greek word _therapeia_, from which we derive "therapy." Even in perfection, God continually ministers health and wholeness to His people—not because they are sick, but because He is the eternal source of life. His care never ceases.

### Who Will Enter—And Who Will Not

Scripture is clear about entrance requirements:

**Excluded**: "There shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie" (Revelation 21:27).

**Welcomed**: "Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city" (Revelation 22:14).

[Q] **"Doesn't this contradict salvation by grace? Are we saved by keeping commandments?"**

The obedience described here is not the cause of salvation but its evidence. No one earns entrance into the New Jerusalem. The redeemed are those who, by grace through faith, have received Christ's righteousness—both imputed (covering them) and imparted (transforming them). They keep God's commandments not to be saved but because they are saved, because Christ lives in them (Galatians 2:20). Heaven would not be heaven to those who hate God's law; only those who love what God loves will find joy there.

Ellen White writes: "The Holy City will be to them a place of joy. There they may breathe the atmosphere of heaven, and speak and sing the praises of God." Those who enter have been prepared for the place prepared for them.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Final Vindication of God's Character

The New Jerusalem represents more than a reward for the righteous—it demonstrates the triumph of God's government of love. For millennia, Satan has charged that God's law cannot be kept, that His character is arbitrary, and that His government leads to bondage. The holy city populated with redeemed sinners—now "without fault before the throne of God" (Revelation 14:5)—forever refutes these lies.

The ransomed will bear witness throughout eternity that:

- God's law is just, holy, and good
- His mercy and justice are perfectly harmonized
- Obedience by faith is possible through Christ's enabling grace
- Love, not force, is the foundation of God's kingdom

### The Great Controversy Ended

> "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." (Revelation 21:4)

The presence of God's throne in the city signifies that the rebellion is ended. Sin has been eradicated from the universe. "There shall be no more curse" (Revelation 22:3). The great controversy between Christ and Satan concludes with God dwelling eternally with a universe made secure against sin forever.

[ILL] A skilled surgeon does not merely bandage a tumor—he removes it entirely, then restores the patient to health. God's plan in the great controversy was never merely to manage sin but to eradicate it completely. The New Jerusalem is the operating theater made into a palace—the place where healing was accomplished becomes the home where wholeness is enjoyed eternally.

## Practical Application

### This Truth Calls Us To:

1. **Live as pilgrims, not settlers**: Like Abraham, we must hold earthly possessions loosely, recognizing that our true citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). The New Jerusalem is real—earthly treasures are temporary.

2. **Prepare our characters now**: Those who enter the holy city have been purified by Christ's blood and transformed by His Spirit. The work of sanctification—overcoming sin through faith—is present preparation for a future home. We cannot enjoy heaven if we do not love what heaven loves.

3. **Keep His commandments through faith**: Revelation 22:14 promises access to the tree of life to those who keep God's commandments. This is not human effort but Christ's life reproduced in the believer. We must daily surrender to His indwelling presence.

4. **Share the invitation**: The gates of the New Jerusalem are always open (Revelation 21:25). God invites all to enter. We who have heard the call must extend it to others: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come" (Revelation 22:17).

5. **Set our affections on things above**: Meditating on the glories of the heavenly city strengthens our resolve to overcome temptation. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him" (1 Corinthians 2:9). Yet God has revealed enough to kindle holy longing.

## Appeal

> "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus." (Revelation 22:20)

The New Jerusalem is not a dream. It is the most solid reality in the universe—more enduring than the mountains, more certain than tomorrow's sunrise. God, who cannot lie, has promised it. Christ, who died to secure it, is preparing it now. The Holy Spirit, who seals believers for redemption, guarantees our inheritance.

Will you be there? The gates are open. The invitation is extended. The Tree of Life awaits those who overcome through the blood of the Lamb.

Whatever earthly attachments bind you, whatever sins entangle you, whatever fears discourage you—look up. Your redemption draws near. The city with foundations is almost in view. By faith, fix your eyes on the New Jerusalem, and let its glory draw you ever closer to the Lamb upon the throne.

_"Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."_ (Revelation 22:14)
