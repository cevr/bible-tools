### Q1. How does God look upon pride?

**“The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way,
and the froward mouth, do I hate.” (Proverbs 8:13)**

**Answer:** This verse establishes a fundamental truth in the Great Controversy:
pride is not merely a personality flaw; it is the very essence of sin. God does
not merely dislike pride; He _hates_ it because it separates the creature from
the Creator.

1.  **The Root of Rebellion:** Pride was the original sin of Lucifer. He said in
    his heart, "I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like
    the most High" (Isaiah 14:13–14). Therefore, pride is the spirit of Satan.
2.  **The Barrier to Faith:** God desires to save us, but pride acts as an iron
    gate against the Holy Spirit. A proud heart feels no need for a Saviour, no
    need for repentance, and no need for the **atonement** provided in the
    sanctuary.
3.  **The Definition of True Fear:** To "fear the Lord" is not to be terrified
    of Him, but to stand in awe of His holiness and character. When we see God
    as He really is, we naturally hate the things that are unlike
    Him—specifically "pride and arrogancy."

- **Definition:** **Righteousness by Faith** is the experience of trusting
  wholly in Christ for salvation and obedience. Pride is the exact opposite of
  faith because pride trusts in self (Habakkuk 2:4).

**[ILL]** Imagine a beautiful tree that looks healthy on the outside, but its
roots are soaking up poison from the soil. Eventually, the fruit becomes toxic.
Pride is that poison in the root system of the human heart. No matter how "good"
a person’s outward actions appear, if the root is pride (doing it for
self-glory), the fruit is unacceptable to God.

### Q2. How does pride in the heart operate on the possessor?

**“The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts
of the rock, whose habitation is high: that saith in his heart, Who shall bring
me down to the ground?” (Obadiah 3)**

**Answer:** The prophet Obadiah reveals the most dangerous aspect of pride:
**self-deception**.

1.  **False Security:** The Edomites (addressed in this verse) felt secure in
    their mountain fortresses ("clefts of the rock"). Spiritually, pride makes a
    sinner feel safe in their own morality or correct doctrines, while they are
    actually in danger of eternal loss.
2.  **The Laodicean Condition:** This parallels the message to the Laodicean
    church in Revelation 3:17: "Because thou sayest, I am rich... and knowest
    not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."
    Pride blinds us to our true spiritual nakedness.
3.  **Resistance to Warning:** The proud heart asks, "Who shall bring me down?"
    It assumes it is untouchable. This attitude prevents the Holy Spirit from
    convicting the heart of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8).

- **Key Insight:** We can only receive the robe of Christ's righteousness when
  we first admit that our own garments are "filthy rags" (Isaiah 64:6). Pride
  prevents this confession.

**[ILL]** Consider a man walking on the edge of a cliff in the dark. A guide
offers him a light, but the man proudly refuses, believing he knows the way
perfectly. His confidence does not save him from the fall; it actually ensures
his destruction. Pride is the refusal of the Light of the World (John 8:12).

### Q3. In what way were the proud Pharisees deceived?

**“And He said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but
God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is
abomination in the sight of God.” (Luke 16:15)**

**Answer:** Jesus exposes the fatal error of religious legalism. The Pharisees
sought to establish their own righteousness through outward performance, but
they neglected the inward cleansing of the heart.

1.  **Outward vs. Inward:** Men judge by what they can see—actions, ceremonies,
    and status. God judges by the motive of the heart (1 Samuel 16:7). A good
    deed done for a selfish reason (to be seen of men) is an "abomination"
    because it uses holy things for self-worship.
2.  **Self-Justification:** To "justify" means to declare righteous. The
    Pharisees declared themselves righteous.
    - **Definition:** **Justification** is a legal act where God declares a
      repentant sinner righteous solely because of the merits of Jesus Christ
      (Romans 3:24–26). When we try to justify ourselves, we reject Christ’s
      sacrifice.
3.  **The Abomination:** Why is human esteem an abomination? because it elevates
    man to the place of God. It suggests that human effort can satisfy the
    claims of God's holy Law, which is a falsehood. The Law requires perfect
    love, which the unrenewed heart cannot produce (Romans 8:7).

**[ILL]** If you have a counterfeit coin, you might polish it until it shines
brighter than a real gold coin. You might convince a child or a stranger that it
is valuable. But when you take it to the bank (the judgment), the expert sees it
is worthless base metal. God looks past the polish of our outward profession to
the metal of our character.

### Q4. What does the Saviour say of those who exalt themselves through their pride of heart?

**“For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself
shall be exalted.” (Luke 14:11)**

**Answer:** This is a universal spiritual law of the Kingdom of Heaven. The way
up is down; the way down is up.

1.  **The Great Reversal:** The world operates on survival of the fittest and
    the promotion of self. The Kingdom of Grace operates on self-sacrificing
    love. Therefore, those who climb the ladder of pride are actually descending
    into darkness.
2.  **The Example of Christ:** This principle is perfectly seen in Jesus. He was
    in the "form of God" but "humbled himself, and became obedient unto death...
    Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him" (Philippians 2:5–9).
3.  **The Necessity of Emptying:** God cannot fill a vessel that is already
    full. If we are full of self-importance, there is no room for the Holy
    Spirit. We must be emptied (abased) of self so that we may be filled with
    Christ.

**[ILL]** Two buckets in a well are connected by a rope and pulley. As one goes
down into the water to be filled, the other must go up. We cannot be filled with
the "living water" of Christ's life unless we are willing to go down into the
depths of humility. If we insist on staying "high" and dry, we remain empty.

### Q5. What did He say to those disciples of His whom He found disputing as to who should be greatest among them?

**“And He sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man
desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all.” (Mark
9:35)**

**Answer:** The disciples were infected with the spirit of the world—the desire
for supremacy. Jesus corrects this by redefining greatness.

1.  **Sanctified Service:** In God's eyes, greatness is measured by service, not
    status. The King of the universe girded Himself with a towel and washed
    dirty feet (John 13:4–5).
2.  **The Cure for Ambition:** The desire to be "first" causes strife, division,
    and sin. The remedy is to voluntarily take the position of the "last"—to
    seek the welfare of others before oneself.
3.  **Practical Application:** This touches every part of life—the home, the
    church, and the workplace. A follower of Jesus does not ask, "How can I get
    people to serve me?" but "How can I help lift the burden of others?"
    (Galatians 6:2).

- **Definition:** **Sanctification** is the process of becoming more like Jesus.
  Since Jesus is a servant, sanctification means growing in the spirit of
  service and losing the spirit of self-seeking.

**[ILL]** In a wolf pack, the leader fights to the top to eat first. In a
family, a loving mother or father often eats last to ensure the children are
fed. The wolf represents the kingdom of force and pride; the parent represents
the Kingdom of God.

### Q6. In what way did He illustrate true humility to His disciples?

**“And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of them,
and said... Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the
same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 18:2, 3)**

**Answer:** Jesus uses a visual aid—a small child—to teach the necessity of
conversion.

1.  **Conversion Required:** Jesus prefaced this by saying, "Except ye be
    converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the
    kingdom of heaven." Conversion (turning around) involves a change from
    self-reliance to God-reliance.
2.  **Characteristics of a Child:**
    - **Helplessness:** A child knows they cannot provide for themselves; they
      trust their parents for food and shelter.
    - **Teachable:** A child believes what the parent says without cynical
      questioning.
    - **No Past Merit:** A child has no "career achievements" to boast of.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** We must accept salvation exactly as a
    child accepts a gift—with open hands and simple trust. We cannot "earn"
    entrance to heaven any more than a toddler earns their dinner. We are
    dependent on the merits of our Father.

**[ILL]** Imagine a man drowning in the ocean. A lifeguard swims out to save
him. If the man struggles and tries to "help" by swimming his own way, he might
drown them both. He must "humble" himself, stop struggling, and let the
lifeguard carry him. This is what it means to trust Christ.

### Q7. Among all those who profess to love the Lord, toward whom will He favorably look?

**“To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit,
and trembleth at My word.” (Isaiah 66:2)**

**Answer:** God passes by the palaces of the proud and the academies of the
learned to find the heart that is broken for sin.

1.  **Poor in Spirit:** To be "poor" here means to recognize our spiritual
    bankruptcy (Matthew 5:3). We have no righteousness of our own to offer God.
2.  **Contrite Spirit:** "Contrite" comes from a root word meaning "crushed" or
    "powdered." It refers to a heart that is broken over the pain its sin has
    caused God. It is not merely fear of punishment, but grief over rebellion
    against Love.
3.  **Trembling at the Word:** This denotes a high respect for God's authority.
    The humble person does not debate the Bible or try to explain away unpopular
    commandments; they submit to God's will, saying, "Speak, Lord; for thy
    servant heareth" (1 Samuel 3:9).

- **Sanctuary Connection:** On the Day of Atonement, the Israelites were
  commanded to "afflict their souls" (Leviticus 23:27). This was a time of deep
  searching of heart and humility. We are living in the antitypical Day of
  Atonement now; it is time for a contrite spirit, not spiritual pride.

---

### Q8. With whom will the Lord dwell?

**“I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and
humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of
the contrite ones.” (Isaiah 57:15)**

**Answer:** This is one of the most beautiful promises in Scripture regarding
the **incarnation** of God in the believer.

1.  **Two Dwelling Places:** God dwells in the "high and holy place" (Heaven/The
    Sanctuary above) _and_ in the "humble spirit" (The Sanctuary of the heart).
2.  **The Purpose of Indwelling:** He dwells with us "to revive." Sin kills; the
    presence of God brings life.
3.  **Imparted Righteousness:** This is the essence of the Gospel
    mystery—"Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27). When the heart
    is emptied of pride, the Holy Spirit enters to impart the life of Jesus.
    This power enables the believer to overcome sin and walk in newness of life.

**[ILL]** The sun is millions of miles away, a massive ball of fire (the "high
and holy place"). Yet, a tiny dewdrop on a leaf can reflect the entire image of
the sun. The High and Lofty One can be perfectly reflected in the lowliest human
heart that is still and open to Him.

### Q9. While thus honoring the humble, what course will He take with the proud?

**“But He giveth more grace. Wherefore He saith, God resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace unto the humble.” (James 4:6)**

**Answer:** Here we see the mechanics of salvation. Grace is the water of life,
but pride plugs the pipe.

1.  **God Resists the Proud:** This is not because God is vindictive, but
    because pride is incompatible with His character. A proud person stands in
    opposition to the government of heaven. God must "resist" them just as a
    doctor resists the spread of a cancer.
2.  **Grace for the Humble:**
    - **Definition:** **Grace** is not just "unmerited favor" (forgiveness); it
      is also the enabling power of God to do His will (2 Corinthians 12:9).
    - The humble admit they cannot keep the Law or change their own hearts. In
      response to this helplessness, God pours out His power (grace) to do for
      them what they cannot do for themselves.
3.  **Victory through Humility:** We often fail to overcome sin because we are
    too strong in ourselves. When we finally say, "Lord, I cannot defeat this
    enemy," He says, "I know. Stand back and let Me fight for you" (2 Chronicles
    20:15).

**[ILL]** Water always flows to the lowest point. It bypasses the mountain peaks
and settles in the valleys. If we want the "living water" of God's grace, we
must go low. We must be the valley, not the mountain peak.

### Q10. What will the Lord do for him who humbles himself?

**“Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt
you in due time.” (1 Peter 5:6)**

**Answer:** Peter encourages believers to submit to God's discipline and
providences.

1.  **Under the Mighty Hand:** Sometimes God's hand presses on us through
    trials, disappointments, or discipline. Pride rebels against this pressure.
    Humility accepts it, knowing that God is shaping the character.
2.  **In Due Time:** We often want exaltation or vindication _now_. God knows
    the perfect time. For Joseph, the "due time" came after years in a dungeon.
    For Jesus, it came after the cross.
3.  **True Exaltation:** This is not worldly fame. It is the exaltation of
    character—being lifted out of the pit of sin and selfishness into the
    atmosphere of heaven. It is to be made a "king and priest" unto God
    (Revelation 1:6).

---

### Q11. In the time of man's final exaltation (1 Thess. 4:16, 17) what will befall the proud and lofty?

**“For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and
lofty, and upon everyone that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low.”
(Isaiah 2:12)**

**Answer:** The study concludes with the final judgment—the end of the Great
Controversy.

1.  **The Day of the Lord:** This refers to the Second Coming of Christ. At this
    time, all human distinctions—wealth, rank, intellect, power—will vanish.
2.  **The End of Pride:** Pride is the source of all contention, war, and
    rebellion against God's law. For peace to be restored to the universe, pride
    must be eradicated. Those who have clung to their pride, refusing to let
    Christ remove it, will be "brought low" in destruction.
3.  **The Investigative Judgment:** We are living in the time just before this
    event. Now is the time to search our hearts. As the High Priest performs the
    final work of atonement, our souls should be humbled, lest we be found
    wanting (Daniel 5:27).

**[ILL]** During a hurricane, the tall, stiff oak trees are often snapped in
half or uprooted because they resist the wind. The grass and the bending
willows, which bow low before the wind, survive the storm. In the coming storm
of the Day of the Lord, only those who bow before God will stand.

---

### Q12. Who alone will then be exalted?

**“And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men
shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.” (Isaiah
2:17)**

**Answer:** The ultimate goal of the plan of salvation is to restore the
universe to its proper order: God at the center, and all creation rejoicing in
Him.

1.  **The Lord Alone:** Salvation is "of the Lord" (Jonah 2:9). When the
    redeemed stand on the sea of glass, they do not sing of their own
    achievements, their own willpower, or their own good works. They sing the
    song of Moses and the Lamb: "Great and marvelous are _Thy_ works... for
    _Thou_ only art holy" (Revelation 15:3–4).
2.  **Righteousness by Faith Triumphant:** This verse proves that human merit
    plays no part in our salvation. If we contributed even one thread to the
    garment of our salvation, we would have reason to be exalted. But because
    Christ does it all—justifying us by His blood and sanctifying us by His
    Spirit—He alone receives the glory.
3.  **The Happy Universe:** When self is dethroned and Christ is enthroned, the
    result is perfect peace and joy. This is the "grace of humility"—it opens
    the door to an eternity of fellowship with God.

**[ILL]** When the sun rises, the stars fade from view. They are still there,
but the glory of the sun is so much greater that they are not seen. In eternity,
the glory of God's love and grace will be so bright that no human glory will be
visible. We will be happy to be hidden in Christ.
