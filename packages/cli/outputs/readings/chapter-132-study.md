# Reading 132: The Grace of Humility

## Introduction

Pride was the original sin that corrupted heaven, and it remains the root of all human rebellion against God. Yet humility—that despised grace which the world counts as weakness—is the very quality that heaven most esteems. This study reveals God's uncompromising opposition to pride and His tender invitation to the humble heart, showing us that the path downward is truly the path upward in God's kingdom.

## Core Truths

### God's Hatred of Pride

Scripture declares with unmistakable clarity that pride is not merely a weakness but an abomination to the Almighty:

> _"The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate."_ (Proverbs 8:13)

Notice that pride is listed alongside "evil" and "the froward mouth"—it belongs to the same family of sins that God's holy character cannot tolerate. The fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 9:10), necessarily includes a hatred of pride.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "pride" (_ga'own_) in Proverbs 8:13 carries the meaning of "rising up" or "exaltation"—the very act of lifting oneself above one's proper place before God. It is the same root used to describe the "swelling" of the Jordan River overflowing its banks (Jeremiah 12:5).

### The Deception of Pride

Pride is not merely offensive to God—it is destructive to the one who harbors it because it blinds and deceives:

> _"The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high: that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?"_ (Obadiah 3)

The Edomites, dwelling in the impregnable rock fortress of Petra, felt secure in their lofty position. Their pride whispered, "You are untouchable." Yet their very confidence became their downfall. So it is with every proud heart—it cannot see its own danger.

**Self-deception**: The proud person genuinely believes their own exalted opinion of themselves. This was the tragedy of the Pharisees:

> _"Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."_ (Luke 16:15)

[Q] **"But isn't some self-confidence necessary and healthy?"**

There is a vast difference between confidence _in God_ and confidence _in self_. The Christian may have bold assurance—not in personal merit, but in Christ's sufficiency. Paul could say, "I can do all things"—but only "through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13). True spiritual confidence rests entirely on Another.

## Deeper Truths

### The Divine Law of Inversion

Christ articulated a principle that operates as surely as any law of nature:

> _"For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."_ (Luke 14:11)

This is not merely a preference of God but a spiritual law woven into the fabric of reality. Self-exaltation inevitably leads to humiliation; self-humbling inevitably leads to exaltation. The question is not _whether_ one will be humbled, but _by whom_—by oneself now, or by God later.

[ILL] Consider two trees in a storm. The proud oak, rigid and unbending, stands tall until the wind snaps it in two. The humble willow bends low before the gale, and when the storm passes, it rises again unharmed. So it is in the spiritual life: those who bend before God in humility survive the tempests that destroy the proud.

### The Pathway to Greatness

When Christ's disciples disputed who would be greatest, He did not rebuke their desire for greatness—He redirected it:

> _"If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all."_ (Mark 9:35)

The kingdom of heaven inverts all earthly values. Greatness is measured not by how many serve you, but by how many you serve. The path to the throne runs through the servant's quarters.

To illustrate this, Jesus called a little child:

> _"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven."_ (Matthew 18:2–4)

What is it about a child that represents true humility?

- **Dependence**: A child knows they cannot provide for themselves
- **Teachableness**: A child receives instruction without argument
- **Trust**: A child believes simply and wholly
- **Unpretentiousness**: A child does not claim achievements or status

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "humble himself" (_tapeinoō_) means to make low, to bring down to the ground. It is the same word used of Christ's humiliation in Philippians 2:8: "He humbled himself, and became obedient unto death." The greatest example of humility is not found among men, but in God Himself descending to become a servant.

### Where God Dwells

Perhaps the most astonishing truth in Scripture concerning humility is where God chooses to make His home:

> _"I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones."_ (Isaiah 57:15)

The infinite God, enthroned in the highest heaven, looks down and chooses to dwell—not in palaces or cathedrals, but in the humble heart! He who fills the universe with His presence makes His special abode in the lowly spirit.

> _"To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word."_ (Isaiah 66:2)

[Q] **"What does it mean to 'tremble at His word'?"**

To tremble at God's word is to take it with utmost seriousness—to recognize its authority, fear its warnings, and value its promises above all earthly considerations. It is the opposite of casual, selective, or dismissive Bible reading. The one who trembles at God's word reads it with reverent attention, knowing that eternal destinies hang upon its truths.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Pride: The Origin of All Evil

The grace of humility becomes even more precious when we understand that pride was the original sin—the root from which all evil sprang.

Lucifer, the covering cherub, the highest of created beings, lifted up his heart:

> _"Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness."_ (Ezekiel 28:17)

> _"For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the most High."_ (Isaiah 14:13–14)

Five times Lucifer said "I will"—exalting self above God. This is the essence of sin. Every subsequent transgression is simply an echo of that first proud rebellion.

When Satan tempted Eve, he appealed to the same pride: "Ye shall be as gods" (Genesis 3:5). Pride is therefore not merely _a_ sin—it is _the_ sin, the mother of all iniquity.

### Christ: The Perfect Contrast

Against this backdrop of satanic pride, the humility of Christ shines with transcendent beauty:

> _"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."_ (Philippians 2:5–8)

Where Lucifer grasped for equality with God, Christ—who possessed that equality rightfully—laid it aside. Where Satan exalted himself, Christ emptied Himself. Where pride sought to ascend, love descended to the lowest depths.

This is the mind we are invited to have. The sanctified life is one in which self is progressively dethroned and Christ is enthroned in its place.

[ILL] In the sanctuary service, the altar of burnt offering stood at the entrance—the place where the self-will of the sinner was symbolically surrendered in the sacrifice. No one could enter further into God's presence without first passing this altar. So it is in Christian experience: there is no deeper fellowship with God until pride is laid on the altar and consumed.

### Grace: God's Provision for the Humble

God's response to pride and humility is not arbitrary but flows from the very nature of His character:

> _"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."_ (James 4:6)

**Resisteth**: The Greek word (_antitassomai_) is a military term meaning to set oneself in battle array against. God actively opposes the proud—He marshals His forces against them.

**Giveth grace**: To the humble, God gives _more_ grace—abundant, overflowing, sufficient for every need. Grace cannot fill a vessel already full of self.

> _"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time."_ (1 Peter 5:6)

The mighty hand of God may press heavily at times. Humility says, "Amen" to God's dealings. It does not demand an explanation or immediate relief. It trusts that He who brings low will also exalt—in due time.

## Practical Application

### How Pride Manifests Today

Pride wears many masks in the Christian life:

- **Spiritual pride**: Looking down on others' spiritual attainments
- **Intellectual pride**: Valuing one's own understanding above Scripture
- **Denominational pride**: Glorying in church membership rather than Christ
- **Self-righteous pride**: Trusting in one's own obedience for acceptance
- **Wounded pride**: Taking offense when not recognized or appreciated
- **False humility**: Drawing attention to one's supposed lowliness

[Q] **"How can I tell if I'm truly humble or just pretending?"**

True humility is not _thinking less of yourself_—it is _thinking of yourself less_. It does not constantly examine itself to see if it is humble enough; it is too occupied with Christ and others to engage in such self-focus. The truly humble person is often unaware of their humility—because the moment we congratulate ourselves on being humble, pride has returned.

### Cultivating the Grace of Humility

While humility cannot be manufactured by human effort, we may cooperate with God's work by:

1. **Beholding Christ daily**: "We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image" (2 Corinthians 3:18). The more we see His glory, the less our own importance.

2. **Welcoming God's humbling providences**: When circumstances deflate our ego, recognize God's gracious hand at work.

3. **Practicing service**: Voluntarily take the lower place; seek opportunities to serve without recognition.

4. **Confessing pride as sin**: When the Spirit reveals pride, acknowledge it immediately before God.

5. **Praying for a humble heart**: "Create in me a clean heart, O God" (Psalm 51:10)—a heart emptied of self, filled with Christ.

### The Final Reckoning

The day is coming when every proud thing will be brought low:

> _"For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low."_ (Isaiah 2:12)

> _"And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day."_ (Isaiah 2:17)

The universe will one day be purged of every trace of the pride that brought sin into existence. The meek shall inherit the earth (Matthew 5:5). Those who humbled themselves under God's mighty hand will be exalted with Christ forever.

Those who exalted themselves will lose all. Those who humbled themselves will gain all.

## Appeal

> _"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."_ (James 4:10)

Dear friend, pride is not a small matter—it is the very spirit of Satan working in the human heart. It deceives us, separates us from God, and leads to certain destruction. But there is hope!

The same grace that humbled the proud heart of Saul of Tarsus can humble your heart and mine. The same Spirit that led Christ to the cross can lead us to lay down our self-exaltation at His feet.

Will you today ask God to search your heart and reveal any hidden pride? Will you welcome His humbling hand, knowing that He resists the proud but gives grace to the humble? Will you choose the path of the servant, following in the footsteps of Him who said, "I am meek and lowly in heart"?

The God who dwells in the high and holy place is looking for a home. Will He find it in your heart—poor, contrite, trembling at His word?
