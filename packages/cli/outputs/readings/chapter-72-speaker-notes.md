# Speaking Notes: Moral Obligation in the Patriarchal Age

---

## Slide 1 – Introduction: The Question of Moral Law Before Sinai

Here is the question we must settle today: Did God hold men accountable to His moral law _before_ the Ten Commandments were given at Sinai?

Some have supposed that the law of God began with Moses—that Abraham, Noah, and the patriarchs lived in an age of moral freedom, without divine commandments binding upon them. If this were true, it would change everything about how we understand sin, righteousness, and our own standing before God.

But Scripture tells a different story. Today we will see from the Bible that:

- God's moral law has always existed.
- Sin has always been the transgression of that law.
- And men in every age have been called to obedience through faith in the coming Redeemer.

This is not merely an academic question. It bears directly on how we understand righteousness by faith and our own accountability before God today.

**Transition:** Let us begin at the beginning—not at Sinai, but at the very origin of sin itself.

---

## Slide 2 – Sin from the Beginning

**Read 1 John 3:8** – "He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning."

Notice carefully: sin did not begin with Adam and Eve. It did not begin at Sinai. Sin began "from the beginning"—with Satan himself, in heaven.

Now here is the crucial point: _the very existence of sin presupposes a standard against which it is measured._ You cannot have transgression without something to transgress. If Satan sinned "from the beginning," then God's law existed from the beginning.

The angels who joined Satan in rebellion were cast down and reserved for judgment. Heaven itself was governed by moral law, and the fall of Lucifer was its violation.

**Transition:** But what exactly is sin? Let the Scripture define it for us.

---

## Slide 3 – Sin Defined

**Read 1 John 3:4** – "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law."

This is God's definition, not man's. Sin is not merely falling short of an ideal. It is not simply making mistakes or failing to live up to your potential. Sin is _rebellion against the expressed will of God_—the violation of His law.

**Read Romans 4:15** – "Where no law is, there is no transgression."

Here is the logic: wherever sin exists, law must also exist. If there is transgression, there must be something to transgress.

**Transition:** Now let us apply this logic to the time before Sinai.

---

## Slide 4 – The Law Preceded Sinai

The Scripture is clear:

- Sin existed before Sinai—we read of it in Genesis 4, Genesis 6, Genesis 13.
- Sin is the transgression of the law.
- Therefore, _law existed before Sinai._

If there was transgression from Adam to Moses—and Scripture abundantly testifies that there was—then the law was in force throughout that entire period.

Paul confirms this in Romans 4:15: "The law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression." The wrath of God fell upon sinners before Sinai _because_ they had violated His law.

Even the angels who rebelled were judged by God's law in heaven itself (2 Peter 2:4). The law did not begin on earth; it began in the throne room of God.

**Transition:** Now let us examine the evidence—case by case—from the patriarchal age. We begin with the first recorded death in human history.

---

## Slide 5 – Cain and Abel: Murder and the Sixth Commandment

**Read Genesis 4:8** – "And Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."

The first death in Scripture was not by natural causes. It was murder. And God held Cain accountable.

**Read Genesis 4:10–11** – "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground... now art thou cursed from the earth."

What law did Cain violate? The sixth commandment: "Thou shalt not kill." Yet Exodus 20 had not yet been given. The commandment was known and binding, written upon the conscience by the Creator Himself.

**Transition:** But there is more to this story. John tells us the root of Cain's sin.

---

## Slide 6 – The Root of Cain's Sin

**Read 1 John 3:12** – "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."

The difference between Cain and Abel was not ceremonial—it was _moral_. One had a righteous character; the other did not. This distinction implies a standard of righteousness—God's law.

And notice what God said to Cain _before_ the murder:

**Read Genesis 4:7** – "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door."

"Doing well" and "not doing well" are moral categories. They require a moral standard. God was holding Cain accountable to His law—and warning him that sin was crouching, ready to destroy him.

**Transition:** Cain's descendants multiplied, and so did their sin. By the time of Noah, the whole earth was corrupt.

---

## Slide 7 – The Antediluvian World: Violence and the Law

**Read Genesis 6:11** – "The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence."

**Read Genesis 6:13** – "The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."

The flood was God's judgment upon sin. And judgment presupposes law. You cannot justly punish someone for violating a standard that does not exist.

Violence is a violation of the sixth commandment. Corruption before God implies idolatry—violations of the first and second commandments. The impurity that filled the earth violated the seventh commandment.

The whole law of God was being trampled, and God brought judgment.

**Transition:** But in the midst of that wicked generation, one man stood apart.

---

## Slide 8 – Noah: A Preacher of Righteousness

**Read Genesis 6:8** – "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord."

**Read 2 Peter 2:5** – Noah was "a preacher of righteousness."

What righteousness did Noah preach? Not a lawless righteousness—but the righteousness of God, which is always in harmony with His law.

**Psalm 119:172** says, "All thy commandments are righteousness."

Righteousness is conformity to the will of God as expressed in His law. It is not merely legal standing, but right-doing—a life that reflects the character of God Himself. Noah preached this standard, and he lived it by faith.

**Transition:** The judgment of the flood passed, but sin soon filled the earth again. Let us consider the cities of the plain.

---

## Slide 9 – Sodom: Unlawful Deeds

**Read Genesis 13:13** – "But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly."

God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with fire from heaven. But notice how Peter describes their sin:

**Read 2 Peter 2:8** – Lot, "that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds."

Mark the word: _unlawful_. Their deeds were contrary to law—God's law. The seventh commandment and the principles underlying it were binding and were violated. This was centuries before Sinai.

God did not judge them by a standard they did not have. He judged them by the law He had always established.

**Transition:** Consider now a young man in Egypt, far from his father's house.

---

## Slide 10 – Joseph: Sin Against God

When Potiphar's wife tempted Joseph day after day, he gave this reply:

**Read Genesis 39:9** – "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"

Joseph recognized adultery as _sin against God_—not merely a social offense, not merely a betrayal of his master, but a violation of God's commandment.

He knew God's law, though Moses had not yet received it on tables of stone. The law was written in his heart by faith. And that law held him steady in the hour of temptation.

**Transition:** But what about the heathen nations? Were they also accountable to God's law?

---

## Slide 11 – The Amorites and the Nations of Canaan

God told Abraham:

**Read Genesis 15:16** – "In the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full."

The Amorites were filling up a cup of iniquity. Their chief sin was idolatry—1 Kings 21:26 says Ahab "did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites."

When Israel entered Canaan, God commanded them:

**Read Leviticus 20:23** – "Ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them."

God judged these nations for breaking His law—the commandments forbidding idolatry and immorality. They did not have the written code, but the law was binding upon them.

**Transition:** And this raises a vital principle about God's justice.

---

## Slide 12 – Just Judgment Requires Just Law

If there was no law binding the nations, there could be no just ground for judgment. But God's judgments are always righteous.

**Read Genesis 18:25** – "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"

**Read Psalm 19:9** – "The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."

God is just. He does not punish where there is no law. The fact that He judged these nations proves they were under His law—and had violated it.

**Transition:** What does all this evidence tell us about the nature of God's law?

---

## Slide 13 – The Law of God Is Eternal

Here is the great principle: God's moral law is as eternal as God Himself.

It is the transcript of His character, the expression of His will, the standard of righteousness for all intelligent beings—angelic and human—in all ages.

- Satan and his angels were judged by it in heaven (2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6).
- Adam and Eve were judged by it in Eden.
- The antediluvians, the Sodomites, and the Canaanites were all judged by it—centuries before Sinai.

The law did not begin at Sinai. It was revealed there in written form, but it had always existed.

**Transition:** So what, then, was the purpose of Sinai?

---

## Slide 14 – The Ten Commandments at Sinai

The Ten Commandments at Sinai were not the creation of a new moral code. They were the formal, written proclamation of principles that had always been in force.

God wrote on stone what had long been written in the conscience of mankind.

**Read Romans 2:14–15** – "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts."

Even those who never saw the tables of stone had the law written within. Sinai was a clarification and a codification—not an innovation.

**Transition:** Now let us consider one of the greatest examples of faith and obedience—Abraham.

---

## Slide 15 – Abraham: Obedience by Faith

Why did God make His promises to Abraham's seed? Scripture gives us the reason:

**Read Genesis 26:5** – "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."

Abraham kept God's commandments—before Sinai, before Moses, before the written code. But was he saved by this obedience? No.

**Read Genesis 15:6** – "And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness."

Abraham was justified by faith. But his faith _produced_ obedience. He kept God's commandments—not to earn favor, but because faith works by love (Galatians 5:6).

**Transition:** This brings us to the very heart of righteousness by faith.

---

## Slide 16 – Righteousness by Faith Explained

Righteousness by faith includes two great realities:

**Justification—imputed righteousness:** God counts the believing sinner as righteous because of Christ's merits.

**Read Romans 4:5** – "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."

**Sanctification—imparted righteousness:** God works in the believer to produce actual conformity to His law.

**Read Philippians 2:13** – "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure."

Abraham's life demonstrates both. He was counted righteous by faith, and he was made righteous by God's transforming power working within him.

**Transition:** This is why faith and works can never be separated.

---

## Slide 17 – Faith and Works United

**Read James 2:26** – "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."

True faith in Christ always results in keeping God's commandments from the heart. Not to earn salvation—but because faith that does not obey is not real faith.

Abraham kept God's commandments because he loved God. And we are called to walk in the same footsteps.

**Transition:** This brings us to a crucial question: Who are the true children of Abraham?

---

## Slide 18 – Who Are Abraham's Children?

Jesus declared:

**Read John 8:39** – "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham."

Abraham's true seed are not those who merely claim descent from him. They are those who walk in the footsteps of his faith.

**Read Galatians 3:29** – "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."

The children of Abraham are those who have his faith—a faith that receives Christ's righteousness and produces a life of loving obedience.

Are you Abraham's child?

**Transition:** Now let us see how the sanctuary message was present even in the patriarchal age.

---

## Slide 19 – The Sanctuary in the Patriarchal Age

From the gates of Eden, where God placed cherubim and a flaming sword, to the altars of Abel, Noah, and Abraham—the way of approach to God was through sacrifice.

Every burnt offering pointed forward to the Lamb of God. The blood of lambs and bulls testified to the great truth:

**Read Hebrews 9:22** – "Without shedding of blood is no remission."

The patriarchs looked forward in faith to the cross, where Christ would bear the penalty of the broken law.

**Read 1 Peter 1:18–20** – "Ye were... redeemed... with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world."

The plan of salvation was established before sin entered. The patriarchs believed it and were saved by it.

**Transition:** And here is a truth that many miss.

---

## Slide 20 – Law and Grace United

The law was never opposed to grace. They have always worked together.

The law revealed sin—Romans 3:20 says, "By the law is the knowledge of sin."

But the law also pointed men to the Redeemer. The sacrificial system taught that God would provide a substitute, a way of reconciliation, an atonement.

**Read Leviticus 17:11** – "For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls."

Atonement means bringing God and man together—reconciliation. The blood of the sacrifice covered sin and pointed forward to Christ, who would blot it out forever.

Law and grace are not enemies. The law diagnoses the disease; grace provides the cure. Both come from the same loving God.

**Transition:** Now let us bring this home to ourselves.

---

## Slide 21 – Application: The Law Stands Over Us Today

If God held the patriarchs accountable to His law, how much more are we accountable—we who have received the full revelation of Jesus Christ and the written Word?

**Read Romans 2:13** – "For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."

This does not mean we are saved by works. But it means that genuine faith will produce a life that honors the law of God.

The one who truly believes in Jesus will say with David:

**Read Psalm 119:97** – "O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day."

Do you love God's law? Or do you resent its claims upon you?

**Transition:** And here is the good news.

---

## Slide 22 – Application: The Possibility of Victory

What was true for Abraham, Joseph, and Noah is true for us: Through faith in Christ, we may keep God's commandments.

Not in our own strength—we have no strength. But by the indwelling life of Christ.

**Read Galatians 2:20** – "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me."

**Read 1 John 5:4** – "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith."

Victory over sin is possible—not because we are strong, but because Christ is strong, and He lives in us by faith.

**Transition:** This is what the last-day people of God will demonstrate.

---

## Slide 23 – The Last-Day People of God

**Read Revelation 14:12** – "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

The last-day people of God will demonstrate that the law can be kept—not by human effort, but by the power of Christ working within.

Notice the two marks: commandment-keeping and faith. They are united. You cannot have one without the other.

This is what God is calling for in this final generation. Will you be among them?

**Transition:** Let me share a brief illustration.

---

## Slide 24 – Illustration: Ignorance Is No Excuse

A man once stood before a judge, accused of stealing. His defense was simple: "I did not know the law against theft was in force in this county. No one showed me the statute book."

The judge replied: "Ignorance of the law is no excuse. The law is the law, whether you read the statute or not. And in truth, you did know it was wrong—for your conscience condemned you even as you did it."

So it was in the patriarchal age. The written tables of stone had not yet been given, but the law was written in the conscience. Every man who sinned knew he was sinning—for "sin lieth at the door" even when no book of statutes sits upon the shelf.

God's law is eternal, and all are accountable to it—including you and me.

**Transition:** And so we come to the great question.

---

## Slide 25 – Appeal: What Will You Do with God's Law?

The question is not whether the law existed before Sinai—Scripture is abundantly clear that it did.

The question is: _What will you do with the law of God today?_

Will you, like Cain, resist the Spirit's conviction and let sin master you? Or will you, like Abel, come to God by faith, offering the blood of the Lamb, and by grace walk in righteousness?

The choice is before you.

**Transition:** Let me press this further.

---

## Slide 26 – Appeal: Choose the Way of Life

Will you, like the men of Sodom, continue in unlawful deeds until judgment falls? Or will you, like righteous Lot, be vexed with sin and cry out for deliverance?

Will you, like the Amorites, fill up the cup of iniquity? Or will you, like Abraham, obey God's voice and keep His commandments—not to earn salvation, but because you love the God who has saved you by His grace?

The way of Cain leads to destruction. The way of Abraham leads to life.

**Transition:** Here is the promise.

---

## Slide 27 – Closing Appeal: Heirs According to the Promise

**Read Galatians 3:29** – "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."

Come to Christ today. Receive His righteousness—both imputed and imparted. Let His law be written in your heart by the Holy Spirit.

By faith, walk in the footsteps of faithful Abraham, looking for that city "which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10).

The law of God is eternal. The grace of God is sufficient. The promises of God are sure.

Will you be Abraham's child—an heir according to the promise?
