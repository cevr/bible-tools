# Bible Study: Sunday Sacredness—What Does the New Testament Actually Teach?

## Introduction

Many Christians today assume the New Testament establishes Sunday as a sacred day of worship, replacing the seventh-day Sabbath. But what does Scripture actually say? When we examine every New Testament reference to the first day of the week, we discover a surprising silence—not one verse commands its observance, calls it holy, or connects it with worship. This study examines all eight New Testament texts mentioning the first day, allowing the Bible to speak for itself.

## Core Truths

### The First Day in the Resurrection Accounts

The first day of the week appears in all four Gospels, but only in connection with one event—the discovery of Christ's empty tomb.

> _"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre."_ (Matthew 28:1)

> _"And when the sabbath was past... very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun."_ (Mark 16:1, 2)

[DYK🔎] Matthew wrote his Gospel approximately six years after Christ's resurrection, Mark wrote his about thirty-two years later, and Luke wrote twenty-four years afterward—yet all three, writing under inspiration, still call the seventh day "the Sabbath" without any hint of change.

Notice what the women were doing:

> _"And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment. Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared."_ (Luke 23:56–24:1)

These devoted followers of Jesus—who had walked with Him for three years—considered the Sabbath commandment still binding. They postponed their work of love until after the Sabbath had passed, then came early Sunday morning to complete their task.

[Q] **"But doesn't the resurrection on Sunday make it the new Christian Sabbath?"**

Scripture nowhere draws this conclusion. The Bible records _when_ Christ rose, but never commands observance of that day. If God intended Sunday to replace the Sabbath, we would expect clear instruction—especially since the Sabbath had been observed for four thousand years. Yet we find complete silence. The resurrection is commemorated by another ordinance entirely: baptism (Romans 6:3–5), not a weekly day.

### The Evening Meeting in John 20

> _"Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst."_ (John 20:19)

Some suggest this was a worship service celebrating the resurrection. But examine the evidence:

**Why were they gathered?** "For fear of the Jews"—not for worship or celebration.

**Did they believe Christ had risen?** Mark records that when others reported seeing the risen Lord, "neither believed they them" (Mark 16:13). Jesus later "upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen" (Mark 16:14).

**Where were they?** In an upper room where they "abode"—their living quarters (Acts 1:13). This was likely their evening meal at home.

**What were they eating?** "Have ye here any meat? And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb" (Luke 24:41–43).

[DYK🔎] Fish and honeycomb were never used in communion services. The disciples were simply having supper at home when Jesus appeared unexpectedly.

[ILL] Imagine finding a group of students gathered in their dormitory on a Friday evening, eating pizza with the door locked because they fear campus troublemakers. Would you conclude they were holding a religious service to honor Friday? The circumstances explain the gathering—not any sacred significance of the day.

### "After Eight Days"

> _"And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst."_ (John 20:26)

[Q] **"Doesn't 'after eight days' point to the following Sunday?"**

The phrase "after eight days" is indefinite. If counted precisely from Sunday evening, it would land on Monday or Tuesday of the following week—not Sunday. Compare how Luke 9:28 says "about an eight days" while Matthew 17:1 says "after six days" for the same event. These are approximate expressions, not precise day counts. Scripture records Jesus meeting His disciples on various days without any pattern suggesting Sunday observance.

## Deeper Truths

### The Troas Meeting—A Closer Look

> _"And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together."_ (Acts 20:7, 8)

This is the only New Testament text showing Christians gathered on the first day. Let us examine it carefully:

**When did this meeting occur?** It was an evening meeting with "many lights"—therefore after sunset. In biblical reckoning, days begin at sunset (Genesis 1:5; Leviticus 23:32). This Saturday night meeting would be, by Bible time, the beginning of the first day.

**Why did they meet?** Paul was "ready to depart on the morrow." This was a farewell gathering, not a regular worship service.

**What did Paul do the next morning (Sunday daylight)?** He walked nineteen and a half miles across the peninsula to Assos while his companions sailed around to meet him (Acts 20:13).

[DYK🔎] If Paul considered Sunday sacred, why would he spend it on a lengthy journey by foot while his companions labored at sailing? Their actions treated Sunday as an ordinary working day.

**Does "breaking bread" indicate communion?** Early Christians broke bread daily (Acts 2:46). The phrase simply means sharing a meal. This farewell gathering included a meal, but nothing suggests a formal worship service transferring Sabbath sanctity to Sunday.

### Paul's Instruction to Corinth

> _"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."_ (1 Corinthians 16:2)

[Q] **"Doesn't this prove Sunday church services with offering collections?"**

The Greek phrase "by him" (παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ) means "at home with oneself." Paul instructed believers to set aside funds privately at home on Sunday—the first working day of the week—so everything would be ready when he arrived. There would be "no gatherings" needed at that time because the funds would already be collected.

This actually suggests _no_ church meeting on Sunday. Paul assumed believers would be at home, available to review their finances and set aside their contribution.

The collection was for "the saints"—famine relief for Jerusalem (Romans 15:25, 26)—not a regular church offering.

### The Complete New Testament Record

We have now examined all eight texts mentioning the first day of the week:

1. Matthew 28:1—Women discover empty tomb
2. Mark 16:1, 2—Same event
3. Mark 16:9—Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene
4. Luke 24:1—Women bring spices to tomb
5. John 20:1—Mary Magdalene at tomb
6. John 20:19—Disciples hiding in fear
7. Acts 20:7—Farewell meeting at Troas
8. 1 Corinthians 16:2—Private setting aside of funds

**Not one text:**

- Commands Sunday observance
- Calls Sunday holy or blessed
- Applies the term "Sabbath" to Sunday
- Records regular Sunday worship
- Shows apostolic authority for changing the day

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Lord's Day Question

> _"I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day."_ (Revelation 1:10)

What is "the Lord's day"? Many assume it means Sunday, but Scripture must define Scripture.

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on **my holy day**."_ (Isaiah 58:13)

> _"Therefore the Son of man is **Lord also of the sabbath**."_ (Mark 2:28)

God claims the seventh-day Sabbath as His own. Christ declared Himself Lord of the Sabbath—not of Sunday. No scripture calls Sunday "the Lord's day."

[DYK🔎] The first documented use of "Lord's day" for Sunday appears in the late second century—long after the New Testament was written. The apostle John, writing in 97 A.D., uses the term without explanation, suggesting his readers would understand it from Scripture—which points only to the Sabbath.

### The Sanctuary and God's Unchanging Law

In the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary stands the ark of God's covenant:

> _"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament."_ (Revelation 11:19)

That ark contains the Ten Commandments—including the fourth, which identifies the seventh day as the Sabbath. God's law in heaven has not changed. Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary upholds that law while providing grace for those who have broken it.

[ILL] Consider a king who establishes a weekly audience day when any citizen may come before him. He chooses one specific day and writes it into the kingdom's constitution. Centuries later, some courtiers suggest changing to a different day, claiming the king would prefer it. But the constitution stands unchanged, and the king has never amended it. Those who truly honor the king come on the day he appointed, not the day others prefer.

### The Great Controversy Perspective

Satan has long sought to lead humanity away from God's appointed times and laws. Through the little horn power of Daniel 7, he would "think to change times and laws" (Daniel 7:25). The gradual shift from Sabbath to Sunday fulfills this prophecy—a change made by human authority, not divine command.

This is not merely about days; it is about authority. Who has the right to determine how we worship—God or human tradition? The Sabbath stands as a test of loyalty, a sign between God and His people (Exodus 31:13; Ezekiel 20:12).

## Practical Application

### What This Means for Believers Today

**1. Return to Scripture as the sole authority.** Tradition, however ancient, cannot override God's Word. "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isaiah 8:20).

**2. Honor the day God blessed and sanctified.** The Sabbath was made for man's blessing (Mark 2:27), established at creation (Genesis 2:2, 3), confirmed at Sinai (Exodus 20:8–11), observed by Christ (Luke 4:16), and kept by the apostles (Acts 13:14, 42, 44; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4).

**3. Trust Christ for victory in obedience.** Sabbath-keeping is not legalism when it flows from a heart transformed by grace. Christ living in us produces willing obedience: "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart" (Psalm 40:8).

**4. Stand prepared for the final test.** As we approach earth's closing scenes, the Sabbath will become a distinguishing mark of those who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).

## Appeal

The evidence of Scripture is clear: the first day of the week holds no sacred status in the New Testament. The seventh-day Sabbath remains God's appointed day of rest and worship—unchanged by the resurrection, unaltered by apostolic practice.

> _"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God."_ (Exodus 20:8–10)

Will you follow Scripture rather than tradition? Will you honor the day your Creator blessed, the day your Saviour observed, the day that points forward to eternal rest in the earth made new?

The invitation stands:

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD."_ (Isaiah 58:13, 14)

Christ offers grace to obey and power to follow wherever His Word leads. He who is "Lord also of the sabbath" invites you into His rest—both now and for eternity.
