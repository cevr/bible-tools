# Bible Study: Results of Disobedience

## Introduction

The cost of human redemption reveals both the infinite value God places upon us and the terrible seriousness of sin. Through the gift of His only Son, God demonstrates love beyond measure—yet this same love calls us to willing obedience. This study explores why God requires obedience, the solemn results of disobedience, and how we may walk safely in His ways through the power of Christ.

## Core Truths

### The Immeasurable Cost of Redemption

Our salvation was not purchased cheaply. Scripture reveals the staggering price God paid:

> _"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_ (John 3:16)

This was no ordinary gift. Paul emphasizes the extraordinary nature of divine love:

> _"For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."_ (Romans 5:7, 8)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "commendeth" (_sunistēmi_) means to demonstrate or prove by evidence. God did not merely _tell_ us He loved us—He _proved_ it through the cross while we were still His enemies.

### Love's Reasonable Response

What does such love require in return? Not payment—for we could never repay—but responsive love expressed through obedience:

> _"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind."_ (Luke 10:27)

But what does loving God look like in practice?

> _"For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments."_ (1 John 5:3)

**Obedience**: Keeping God's commandments as the natural expression of love, not as a means of earning salvation.

[Q] **"Isn't focusing on obedience legalism?"**

Not at all. There is a world of difference between obeying to _earn_ God's favor and obeying _because_ we have received His favor. A child who obeys loving parents does so not to become their child, but because they already _are_ their child. John clarifies that keeping God's commandments flows from love—it is love's language. Christ Himself said, "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15). This is not legalism; it is love in action, made possible by Christ living within us.

### God's Freedom of Choice

The Lord never compels allegiance. He invites:

> _"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."_ (Revelation 22:17)

Joshua presented the same choice to ancient Israel: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve" (Joshua 24:15). God desires willing hearts, not forced submission.

### Why God Asks Obedience

God's commands are not arbitrary restrictions but loving guidelines for our peace and happiness:

> _"O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea."_ (Isaiah 48:18)

[ILL] A loving father builds a fence around a yard not to imprison his children, but to protect them from the dangers of the busy street beyond. Every command of God is a fence of love—protecting us from the destruction that sin inevitably brings. When we break through the fence, we discover not freedom, but peril.

## Deeper Truths

### Solemn Lessons from Sacred History

Scripture records specific incidents where disobedience—even in seemingly small matters—brought severe consequences. These examples are preserved for our instruction.

#### The Ark of the Covenant and Uzzah

God gave explicit instructions regarding the transport of the sanctuary's sacred furniture:

> _"The sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die."_ (Numbers 4:15)

Yet when David sought to move the ark to Jerusalem, human reasoning replaced divine instruction:

> _"And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab."_ (2 Samuel 6:3)

[DYK🔎] God had specified that the ark must be carried on the shoulders of the Levites using staves (Numbers 7:9; 1 Chronicles 15:15). Using a cart—even a _new_ cart—was following Philistine methods (1 Samuel 6:7), not divine instruction. This was the first wrong step in the tragic sequence that followed.

When the oxen stumbled and the ark appeared about to fall, Uzzah reached out to steady it:

> _"And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God."_ (2 Samuel 6:7)

[Q] **"Wasn't Uzzah just trying to help? Why such severe punishment?"**

This question has troubled many readers. Several truths emerge:

1. **The original disobedience created the crisis.** Had they carried the ark properly, there would have been no stumbling oxen, no need for human intervention.

2. **Familiarity had bred irreverence.** Uzzah had grown up with the ark in his father's house for decades. He had likely lost the sense of its sacred character.

3. **God's holiness cannot be compromised.** The ark represented God's very presence. To treat it casually was to treat God casually—a dangerous presumption.

> _"Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil."_ (Ecclesiastes 8:11)

God's patience in delaying judgment sometimes leads us to presume upon His mercy and grow careless in obedience.

#### Saul's Rejection

King Saul received explicit instructions to utterly destroy the Amalekites and all their possessions (1 Samuel 15:3). Instead, he spared the best animals, reasoning they could be used for sacrifice. Samuel's response was devastating:

> _"Thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel."_ (1 Samuel 15:26)

What appeared to Saul as a reasonable modification of God's command was, in God's sight, outright rejection of His word. Samuel declared: "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (1 Samuel 15:22).

#### Lot's Wife

Delivered miraculously from doomed Sodom, Lot's family received clear instruction:

> _"Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."_ (Genesis 19:17)

Yet Lot's wife looked back:

> _"But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt."_ (Genesis 19:26)

Jesus Himself preserved this lesson for us: _"Remember Lot's wife"_ (Luke 17:32).

[ILL] Her backward glance revealed that while her body left Sodom, her heart remained there. She was delivered _from_ the city but not _from_ its influence. So it is with many who profess to follow Christ—outwardly separated from the world, yet inwardly longing for what they left behind. Such divided hearts cannot inherit the kingdom.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and the Seriousness of Sin

The severity of God's response to disobedience concerning the sanctuary illustrates a profound truth: God is holy, and sin—any sin—is deadly serious. The sanctuary system taught this lesson continually.

- In the **outer court**, every sacrifice reminded Israel that sin brings death—only through substitutionary blood could the sinner live.
- In the **holy place**, the priests ministered daily, showing that maintaining fellowship with God requires constant dependence upon His grace.
- In the **most holy place**, once yearly, the high priest entered with blood—a solemn reminder that even forgiven sins must ultimately be dealt with in final judgment.

[DYK🔎] The sanctuary was designed to impress upon Israel that approaching God on human terms rather than His terms meant death. This is not because God is harsh, but because sin itself is lethal—like touching a high-voltage wire. God's instructions are not restrictions but life-preserving protections.

### The Principle of Progressive Light

The writer to the Hebrews draws a sobering comparison:

> _"For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?"_ (Hebrews 2:2, 3)

If disobedience under lesser light brought such consequences, what of those who reject the full light of the gospel? The principle is clear: greater light brings greater responsibility.

> _"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins."_ (Hebrews 10:26)

**Willful sin**: Deliberate, knowing transgression against revealed truth—not the sins of weakness or ignorance, but the calculated rejection of what we know to be right.

This verse does not describe the struggling believer who falls but the hardened rebel who has fully and finally rejected Christ's sacrifice.

### Human Tradition vs. Divine Command

Jesus reserved His strongest rebukes for those who replaced God's commands with human traditions:

> _"But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."_ (Matthew 15:9)

This principle exposes a subtle form of disobedience—substituting human ideas for divine instruction while maintaining an appearance of worship. Such worship, Jesus declared, is _vain_—empty, worthless, without effect.

[Q] **"How can sincere worship be worthless?"**

Sincerity alone does not validate worship. Saul was sincere in thinking his modified obedience was acceptable. Uzzah was sincere in steadying the ark. Lot's wife may have sincerely thought one backward glance would do no harm. But God examines not only our hearts but our actions measured against His revealed will. Worship is acceptable when it is offered according to His word—not merely according to our reasoning, however sincere.

## Practical Application

### What These Truths Call Us To

**1. Reverence God's Word Fully**

We must never presume that our reasoning can improve upon God's instructions. The moment we begin modifying, adjusting, or "updating" divine commands to suit our circumstances or preferences, we walk the path of Saul, Uzzah, and Israel.

**2. Guard Against Spiritual Familiarity**

Like Uzzah, we can grow so accustomed to sacred things that we lose our sense of their holiness. Regular self-examination is needed: Do we approach prayer, Scripture, and worship with appropriate reverence? Have we grown careless with sacred responsibilities?

**3. Leave Sodom Behind—Completely**

The warning about Lot's wife speaks directly to half-hearted discipleship. Christ calls us to forsake the world not merely in location but in affection. A heart still longing for what we professed to leave is a heart in danger.

**4. Distinguish Divine Commands from Human Traditions**

In an age when tradition often masquerades as truth, we must carefully compare every teaching with Scripture. No church authority, no ancient practice, no popular opinion can override "Thus saith the Lord."

**5. Embrace Obedience as Love's Language**

True obedience is not grudging compliance but joyful response to the One who loved us and gave Himself for us. When obedience feels burdensome, the remedy is not to lower God's standard but to deepen our understanding of His love.

## Appeal

> _"O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea."_ (Isaiah 48:18)

Hear the longing in God's voice! He does not command obedience to afflict us but to bless us. Every commandment is an invitation to peace, to righteousness, to the fullness of life He designed us to enjoy.

The examples preserved in Scripture stand as solemn warnings—but also as loving appeals. God would spare us from the consequences of disobedience. He would see us walk safely in His ways, protected by His instructions, empowered by His Spirit, and transformed by His love.

Will you today surrender any area where self-will has replaced God's will? Will you trust that His way—however different from human reasoning—is the only safe way?

Come to Christ not only for forgiveness of past disobedience but for power to walk in present obedience. He who commanded is also He who enables. In Him, obedience becomes not a burden but a blessing—the natural outflow of a heart captivated by infinite love.

> _"And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."_ (Revelation 22:17)
