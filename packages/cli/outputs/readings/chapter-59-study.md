# Bible Study: Signs of the Times

## Introduction

Throughout Scripture, God has given His people prophetic signs to mark the
fulfillment of His purposes. Just as the Jews of Christ's day were censured for
failing to recognize the signs of His first advent, so believers today are called
to discern the signs heralding His second coming. This study examines the
biblical evidence for prophetic signs—both fulfilled and fulfilling—that
demonstrate we are living in the closing hours of earth's history.

## Core Truths

### The Failure to Discern Signs

Christ's rebuke to the religious leaders of His day carries solemn weight:

> _"O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern
> the signs of the times?"_ (Matthew 16:3)

The Jewish nation possessed abundant prophetic evidence identifying the Messiah.
They could predict weather patterns from natural observations, yet they remained
willfully blind to prophecies they had studied for generations. This blindness
was not from lack of evidence but from unwillingness to accept truth that
conflicted with their expectations.

**Key fulfilled signs of Christ's first advent:**

- **Virgin birth**: _"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall
  call his name Immanuel"_ (Isaiah 7:14; fulfilled in Matthew 1:22-23)
- **Birthplace**: _"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah... out of thee shall he come
  forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel"_ (Micah 5:2; fulfilled in Matthew
  2:1)
- **Triumphal entry**: _"Thy King cometh unto thee... lowly, and riding upon an
  ass"_ (Zechariah 9:9; fulfilled in Matthew 21:4-5)

[DYK🔎] Over 300 Old Testament prophecies found fulfillment in Christ's first
advent. The mathematical probability of one person fulfilling even 48 of these
prophecies by chance has been calculated at 1 in 10^157—a number so vast it
exceeds the estimated atoms in the known universe.

### Signs of the Second Advent

The disciples, having witnessed Christ's perfect fulfillment of Messianic
prophecy, naturally inquired about signs of His return:

> _"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy
> coming, and of the end of the world?"_ (Matthew 24:3)

Christ responded with specific, observable signs:

> _"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and
> upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves
> roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
> things which are coming on the earth."_ (Luke 21:25-26)

The prophet Joel had foretold these same celestial phenomena:

> _"The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the
> great and terrible day of the Lord come."_ (Joel 2:30-31)

## Deeper Truths

### The Historical Fulfillment of Celestial Signs

**The Dark Day (May 19, 1780)**

Historical records document an unprecedented darkness that covered New England
and extended into Canada. The Connecticut Legislature, in session at Hartford,
adjourned because members could not conduct business. Candles were lit at
midday; birds fell silent and roosted; many believed the day of judgment had
arrived.

Rev. Elam Potter, preaching just nine days later on May 28, 1780, declared:
_"Such a darkness as probably was never known before since the crucifixion of
our Lord... A great part of the following night, also, was singularly dark. The
moon, though in the full, gave no light."_

[DYK🔎] The darkness of May 19, 1780, has never been satisfactorily explained by
natural causes. While some have suggested forest fires, the phenomenon's
characteristics—including the blood-red appearance of the moon that night and
the geographical extent of the darkness—remain historically unique and align
precisely with prophetic description.

**The Falling of the Stars (November 13, 1833)**

Professor Olmstead of Yale College, a leading astronomer, described this event
as _"probably the greatest display of celestial fireworks that has ever been
since the creation of the world, or at least within the annals covered by the
pages of history."_

The meteor storm was visible across the entire North American continent.
Witnesses reported stars falling like snowflakes, with some estimates suggesting
200,000 meteors per hour at the peak. The display lasted from midnight until
dawn, precisely fulfilling the imagery of Revelation 6:13: _"And the stars of
heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when
she is shaken of a mighty wind."_

[Q] **"Aren't these just natural phenomena that science can explain?"**

While science can describe the mechanics of meteor showers and atmospheric
conditions, this misses the essential point. God often works through natural
means to accomplish His purposes. The question is not _how_ these events
occurred, but _when_ and _whether_ they match prophetic specification. That
these signs appeared in the exact sequence and timeframe indicated by
prophecy—following the great tribulation of the Dark Ages (Matthew
24:29)—demonstrates divine orchestration. A God who created natural laws can
certainly employ them for prophetic purposes.

### Signs of Moral and Spiritual Decline

Scripture warns that the last days will be marked by moral deterioration:

> _"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men
> shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers...
> lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but
> denying the power thereof."_ (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

This prophecy describes not the openly wicked world, but professed Christianity
that maintains religious forms while rejecting transforming power. The form of
godliness without its power is the most dangerous deception—religion that
satisfies conscience while leaving the heart unchanged.

[ILL] Consider a traveler lost in the desert, dying of thirst. He discovers what
appears to be a well, complete with bucket and rope. He draws up the bucket
eagerly—only to find it empty, with holes in the bottom. A form is there, but
the life-giving substance is absent. So it is with religion that preserves
ceremonies, buildings, and traditional language while lacking the transforming
power of the Holy Spirit. It promises refreshment but delivers only
disappointment and death.

### The Increase of Knowledge

Daniel received this prophetic word concerning the time of the end:

> _"But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time
> of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."_
> (Daniel 12:4)

This prophecy has a dual application:

1. **Religious knowledge**: The unsealing of Daniel's prophecies in the
   nineteenth century brought unprecedented understanding of prophetic truth.
   Bible societies were established—the British and Foreign Bible Society
   (1804), the American Bible Society (1816)—distributing hundreds of millions
   of Scriptures worldwide.

2. **Scientific knowledge**: The explosion of technological advancement since
   1800 is historically unprecedented. Humanity progressed more in the past two
   centuries than in the previous six thousand years combined.

[DYK🔎] In 1800, the fastest mode of travel was horseback—the same as in
Abraham's day. Within 170 years, men walked on the moon. This dramatic
acceleration of knowledge fulfills Daniel's prophecy with remarkable precision.

### The Scoffers of the Last Days

Peter prophesied the attitude that would characterize many toward the second
advent message:

> _"Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking
> after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for
> since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
> beginning of the creation."_ (2 Peter 3:3-4)

Notice the connection between moral compromise ("walking after their own lusts")
and theological skepticism. Those who wish to continue in sin have strong
motivation to deny the return of the Judge. The doctrine of Christ's coming is
not merely a matter of prophetic interpretation—it is intensely practical,
calling for holiness of life.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Pattern of Prophetic Signs

God's method of communicating through signs reveals His character:

1. **Signs are given in mercy**: God does not leave His people in darkness about
   the future. As Amos 3:7 declares, _"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but
   he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets."_

2. **Signs require spiritual discernment**: The same evidence that confirmed
   believers in Christ's day hardened skeptics. Signs are not given to compel
   faith but to confirm and strengthen those who choose to believe.

3. **Signs increase accountability**: Those who reject clear prophetic evidence
   face greater condemnation than those who never received it (Luke 12:47-48).

### Sanctuary Connection

The signs of Christ's coming are intimately connected with His heavenly
ministry. Just as the high priest's emergence from the Most Holy Place on the
Day of Atonement signaled the climax of Israel's sacred year, so the
multiplication of signs indicates that Christ's work of intercession is nearing
completion.

In the earthly sanctuary, the congregation waited in solemn expectation while
the high priest ministered within the veil. Today, as Christ performs His final
work of atonement in the heavenly sanctuary, signs in heaven and earth announce
that He will soon emerge—not to offer sacrifice again, but to pronounce blessing
upon those who wait for Him (Hebrews 9:28).

The investigative judgment, now in progress, will conclude before Christ
returns. Every sign that indicates His coming near also reminds us that our
cases may soon be called before the heavenly tribunal. This truth should lead us
not to fear, but to take hold of Christ by faith as our Advocate and
Righteousness.

### Righteousness by Faith and Readiness

Christ's command, _"Therefore be ye also ready"_ (Matthew 24:44), raises a
crucial question: How does one become ready for the Lord's appearing?

Readiness is not achieved through:

- Anxious calculation of dates and times
- External religious conformity
- Human effort at moral improvement

True readiness comes through:

- **Receiving Christ's imputed righteousness**: We must stand in His merits, not
  our own (Romans 3:22-24)
- **Experiencing Christ's imparted righteousness**: His life must be formed
  within us by the Holy Spirit (Galatians 2:20; 4:19)
- **Maintaining living connection with Christ**: Abiding in Him as the branch
  abides in the vine (John 15:4-5)

[ILL] A bride preparing for her wedding does not anxiously manufacture beauty
products or weave her own gown. She receives these as gifts and adorns herself
in what has been provided. So the church, the bride of Christ, does not create
her own righteousness. She receives the robe of Christ's character and adorns
herself with the graces He provides. Her part is to receive, to put on what is
given, and to keep herself from that which would stain the garment.

## Practical Application

The signs of the times call us to specific responses:

### 1. Be Students of Prophecy

_"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take
heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place"_ (2 Peter 1:19). Study the
prophetic word with prayer and humility, comparing scripture with scripture,
that you may not be found among those who fail to discern the times.

### 2. Be Faithful Servants

Christ asks, _"Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made
ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?"_ (Matthew 24:45).
Those who recognize the signs have responsibility to share present truth with
others. We are not to hoard knowledge but to distribute spiritual food to hungry
souls.

### 3. Be Practically Ready

Readiness means more than intellectual assent to doctrine. It means:

- **Daily surrender**: Beginning each day with fresh commitment to Christ
- **Moment-by-moment dependence**: Relying on His power for victory over sin
- **Active service**: Engaging in the work of saving souls
- **Watchful living**: Ordering our affairs as those who expect the Master's
  return

### 4. Avoid the Evil Servant's Error

The evil servant says _"in his heart"_ that the Lord delays His coming (Matthew
24:48). This is not an intellectual position but a heart attitude—living as
though the Lord will not come. Such self-deception leads to spiritual abuse of
others and indulgence of self, ending in destruction.

[Q] **"If people have been expecting Christ's return for nearly 2,000 years,
isn't it foolish to still be watching?"**

Consider: every generation of faithful believers who died expecting Christ will
rise to meet Him when He comes. They will not have waited in vain—merely slept
briefly until the resurrection. But those who abandoned hope and returned to the
world will rise to shame and condemnation. The wise course is to live each day
ready, whether we meet Christ in death or at His appearing. Peter answers this
objection directly: _"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise... but is
longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all
should come to repentance"_ (2 Peter 3:9). The delay is mercy—time for more
souls to be saved.

## Appeal

> _"Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of
> man cometh."_ (Matthew 24:44)

The signs that marked Christ's first advent were clear to those whose hearts
were open to truth. Simeon and Anna recognized the infant Messiah. The wise men
followed the star. But the religious leaders, learned in prophecy, missed the
fulfillment unfolding before their eyes.

Today, the signs of Christ's second advent are equally clear. Celestial wonders
have appeared as prophesied. Knowledge has increased exponentially. Moral
conditions match the apostle's description precisely. Scoffers abound, fulfilling
Peter's prediction. The evidence is overwhelming for those willing to see.

The question is not whether the signs have been given—they have. The question is
whether we will discern them and prepare accordingly. Will we be among those who
watch and are ready, or among those surprised by the Master's return?

Christ stands today as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, mediating His
blood on behalf of all who come to God through Him. He offers freely His
righteousness to cover our guilt and His power to transform our character. But
His intercession will not continue forever. The signs declare that the end draws
near.

Come to Him today. Receive His righteousness. Live in constant readiness. And
when He appears, you will lift up your head with joy and say, _"Lo, this is our
God; we have waited for him, and he will save us"_ (Isaiah 25:9).
