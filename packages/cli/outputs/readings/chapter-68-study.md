# Righteousness and Life

## Introduction

Righteousness and life cannot be separated in God’s plan. Wherever true
righteousness is, there is life; wherever sin rules, there is death. This study
traces how the Bible reveals that:

- Eternal life is found only in Christ.
- The righteousness needed for that life is also only in Christ.
- This righteousness is both a gift (our title to heaven) and a transforming
  power (our fitness for heaven).

We will move from the simple promise of John 3:16 to the deeper connection
between God’s law, Christ’s righteousness, and the life He imparts.

## Core Truths: The Simple Gospel of Life in Christ

### 1. God’s love and the promise of eternal life

> “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
> whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
> (John 3:16)

Key points:

- The **motive** of salvation is God’s love: “God so loved the world.”
- The **gift** is His “only begotten Son” – Christ given to live, die, and rise
  for us.
- The **condition** is simple: “whosoever believeth in Him.”
  - To “believe” in Bible sense means to trust, to personally rely on Christ,
    not merely to admit He exists.
- The **promise**: those who believe “should not perish, but have everlasting
  life.”

Eternal life is therefore not earned; it is a **gift in Christ** received by
faith.

### 2. The gospel reveals righteousness and life together

> “For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it
> is written, The just shall live by faith.” (Romans 1:17)

Definitions:

- **Gospel**: “good news” of what God has done and is doing for our salvation
  through Christ (1 Corinthians 15:1–4).
- **Righteousness of God**: God’s perfect rightness—His holy character and His
  right way of living, revealed in Christ and in His law (Psalms 119:172; John
  14:9).
- **Just** (or justified): those whom God counts righteous because of Christ
  (Romans 3:24).
- **Live by faith**: day-by-day dependence on Christ, not on our own goodness
  (Galatians 2:20).

The gospel does not just tell us how to escape punishment; it reveals **how God
can make sinners truly righteous and give them life** at the same time.

### 3. The gospel brings life and immortality to light

> “[Christ] hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light
> through the gospel.” (2 Timothy 1:10)

Through Christ’s death and resurrection:

- Death is “abolished” in this sense: its **final** power over the believer is
  broken (Hebrews 2:14–15).
- **Life and immortality** are made clear—promised, revealed, and guaranteed in
  Christ (John 11:25–26).

Without Christ, death is the end; in Christ, death is a sleep before
resurrection and eternal life (1 Thessalonians 4:13–16).

## Core Truths: Righteousness and Life Inseparably Joined

### 4. The Bible’s direct link: righteousness = life

> “In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no
> death.” (Proverbs 12:28)

Wherever the “way of righteousness” is followed, the result is **life**, and “no
death” in the ultimate sense.

> “He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness,
> and honour.” (Proverbs 21:21)

Those who “follow after” (pursue) righteousness and mercy find:

- Life
- Righteousness
- Honour

This is not about human self-righteousness, but about **seeking God’s
righteousness** (Matthew 6:33).

### 5. Sin and grace: two kingdoms, two outcomes

> “That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through
> righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 5:21)

Definitions:

- **Sin**: breaking God’s law in thought, word, or deed (1 John 3:4; Romans
  3:23).
- **Grace**: God’s undeserved favor and active power to save from sin (Ephesians
  2:8–9; Titus 2:11–12).

Two “reigns” are contrasted:

- When **sin reigns**, the result is **death**.
- When **grace reigns**, it is **through righteousness** and leads to **eternal
  life**.

Grace does not reign by excusing sin while we continue in it, but by
**establishing righteousness** in us through Christ (Romans 6:14–18).

## Deeper Truths: The Law, Christ, and the Gift of Righteousness

### 6. God’s commandments are righteousness and life

> “All Thy commandments are righteousness.” (Psalms 119:172)

The law (God’s commandments):

- Is a written expression of His righteous character (Romans 7:12).
- Shows what righteousness looks like in practical life (Romans 3:20).

Jesus adds:

> “And I know that His commandment is life everlasting.” (John 12:50)

God’s commandment is **not** a way of death; it is the pathway of life:

- To walk in the commandments is to walk in the way of life.
- But we, in our fallen state, **cannot** keep that law in our own strength
  (Romans 8:7–8).

So the law shows us our need; Christ provides the righteousness the law demands.

### 7. Christ—our righteousness and our life

> “And this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.”
> (Jeremiah 23:6)

Christ is not only righteous; He is **“our righteousness.”**

- **Justification**: God counts Christ’s perfect obedience and sacrifice as ours
  when we believe (Romans 5:1, 18–19). This is **imputed
  righteousness**—credited to us as a gift.
- **Sanctification**: Christ, living in the believer by the Holy Spirit,
  reproduces His character in us (Galatians 2:20). This is **imparted
  righteousness**—actually worked into our lives.

Jesus says:

> “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” (John 14:6)

He is:

- The **Way**: the only road back to God and to obedience (Hebrews 10:19–20).
- The **Truth**: the full revelation of God’s character (John 1:14, 18).
- The **Life**: the source and fountain of both physical and spiritual life
  (John 1:4; 1 John 5:11–12).

You cannot have life without Christ, and you cannot have true righteousness
without Christ—He is both.

### 8. The law, life, and Christ’s answer to the rich young ruler

> “And He said unto him, Why callest thou Me good? there is none good but One,
> that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.”
> (Matthew 19:17)

Here Jesus connects:

- **Entering into life**
- With **keeping the commandments**

But other Scriptures make clear:

- We are not justified (counted righteous) by law-keeping (Galatians 2:16;
  Romans 3:20).
- We are saved by grace through faith in Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8–9).

So what does Jesus mean?

- The commandments describe the **life of love and obedience** that belongs to
  those who are saved (Romans 8:4).
- No one actually keeps the law in truth until Christ dwells in the heart (John
  15:5).
- Thus, to “enter into life” involves entering into a relationship with Christ
  where His righteousness is both **counted** to us and **worked** in us,
  resulting in a life of obedience.

### 9. The gift of righteousness and reigning in life

> “For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which
> receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in
> life by One, Jesus Christ.” (Romans 5:17)

Notice:

- Adam’s sin brought **death** and a reign of sin over the human family.
- Through Christ, God offers:
  - “Abundance of grace”
  - “The gift of righteousness”

Those who **receive** this gift “shall reign in life” by Christ, not merely
exist.

“Reign in life” means:

- No longer slaves to sin (Romans 6:12–14).
- A life where Christ’s victory is shared with us.
- Anticipating eternal life now by a life of fellowship with Him (John 17:3).

### 10. Eternal life as a pure gift

> “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through
> Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

- **Wages** are earned; **death** is exactly what sin earns.
- **Eternal life** is never earned; it is “the gift of God.”
- This gift comes “through Jesus Christ our Lord”—no other channel.

This keeps us from two errors:

1. **Legalism** – thinking we can earn life by our good works.
2. **Lawlessness** – thinking God gives life while leaving us in cherished sin.

In Christ, the gift of eternal life includes the gift of righteousness, which
restores obedience (Hebrews 8:10; Titus 2:11–14).

## Deeper / Hidden Truths: How Christ Draws and Transforms

The Ellen White passage (Happiness Digest, p. 30) helps us see **how** this
righteousness and life become ours in experience.

### 11. Christ the source of every right impulse

> “Christ is the source of every right impulse. He is the only one that can
> implant in the heart enmity against sin.”

This tells us:

- Every genuine desire you have to be clean, honest, and pure is already the
  working of Christ’s Spirit (John 16:8).
- **Enmity against sin** (a hatred of what is evil) is not naturally in the
  human heart (Romans 8:7); it must be planted there by Christ.

Whenever you long for something better, that is evidence that:

> “His Spirit is moving upon [your] heart.”

### 12. The cross and the drawing power of love

> “Jesus has said, ‘And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
> unto Me.’” (John 12:32)

When Christ is “lifted up”:

- On the cross in history.
- In the preaching and sharing of the gospel now.

He **draws** all people to Himself by His love.

As we behold “the Lamb of God upon the cross of Calvary”:

- “The mystery of redemption begins to unfold.”
- “The goodness of God” leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4).
- The love revealed in His suffering “softens the heart, impresses the mind, and
  inspires contrition in the soul.”

Repentance is not working ourselves into sorrow; it is **responding to Christ’s
love** as we see Him crucified for our sins.

### 13. Awakening, conviction, and the commandment coming home

The passage explains that sometimes:

- People become ashamed of their sinful ways.
- They give up certain bad habits.

They may not realize that this is Christ drawing them. But if these reforms
arise from a **sincere desire to do right**, then:

- “It is the power of Christ that is drawing them.”
- An unseen influence is working; conscience is “quickened” (made alive).

As Christ draws them to look upon His cross:

- They behold “Him whom their sins have pierced” (Zechariah 12:10).
- “The commandment comes home to the conscience.”

This is crucial:

- The law (commandment) is no longer just words; it now convicts the heart.
- They see both:
  - The **wickedness** of their life.
  - The **deep-seated sin** of the soul—selfishness, pride, unbelief.

They begin to ask:

> “What is sin, that it should require such a sacrifice…? Was all this love, all
> this suffering… demanded, that we might not perish, but have everlasting
> life?”

This leads to:

- **Real repentance** (2 Corinthians 7:9–10).
- **Real faith** in Christ as the only sufficient Saviour (Acts 4:12).

Here righteousness and life meet: Christ’s death for us reveals the **deadly
nature of sin** and the **boundless love** of God, drawing us to surrender and
trust.

[ILL]

Imagine a man dying of a deadly poison. He feels a little sick, but thinks it
will pass. A friend rushes to him with an antidote.

At first, the man refuses. “I’m not so bad; I’ll get better.” But the friend
shows him an X‑ray: the poison is spreading through his whole body. Then the
friend says, “I drank that same poison once. Someone gave His life to produce
the antidote I now offer you.”

Now the sick man sees two things at once:

1. How deadly the poison really is.
2. How costly the cure was.

His pride breaks. He takes the antidote with gratitude.

So the law (like the X‑ray) shows us how deep sin goes. The cross (like the
Friend’s sacrifice) shows how much it cost God to save us. Seeing both together
leads us to accept the only cure: Christ Himself.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### 14. The character of God: love, law, and life

- God is love (1 John 4:8), and His law is the law of love (Matthew 22:37–40).
- His commandments are “righteousness” (Psalms 119:172) and “life everlasting”
  (John 12:50).
- Satan’s charge is that God’s law is harsh and life‑destroying (Genesis 3:1–5).

The gospel answers this lie:

- Sin, not obedience, brings death (Romans 6:23).
- The way of righteousness is the way of life (Proverbs 12:28).
- Christ demonstrates that full loyalty to God’s law is both loving and
  life‑giving (John 15:10–11).

### 15. The sanctuary connection: righteousness and life in three phases

The earthly sanctuary pointed to Christ’s work:

1. **Outer court (altar)** – Christ’s sacrifice on the cross (John 1:29; Hebrews
   9:22).
   - Here the **penalty of sin** is borne by the Substitute.
   - Righteousness is **imputed** (counted) to the believer who trusts in the
     blood.

2. **Holy place (daily ministry)** – Christ’s continuing ministry as Priest
   (Hebrews 7:25; 8:1–2).
   - Here Christ sends the Holy Spirit, gives power to obey, and maintains our
     spiritual life through Word, prayer, and witness.
   - Righteousness is **imparted** (communicated) to the believer’s life,
     forming a holy character.

3. **Most holy place (day of atonement)** – The investigative judgment and final
   atonement (Daniel 8:14; Hebrews 9:23–28).
   - Here sins are blotted out from the record (Acts 3:19).
   - God prepares a people who “keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
     Jesus” (Revelation 14:12)—righteousness and life united fully.

In all this, eternal life is always and only “through Jesus Christ our Lord”
(Romans 6:23).

### 16. End-time relevance: righteousness by faith and the last message

The last message to the world includes:

- **The everlasting gospel** (Revelation 14:6).
- A call to “fear God, and give glory to Him” (verse 7)—honor His character and
  law.
- A remnant who “keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus” (verse
  12).

Here again:

- **Righteousness** (commandment keeping)
- **Faith** (the faith of Jesus)
- **Life** (everlasting gospel)

are united. This is righteousness by faith in an end‑time setting: a people who
live by Christ’s faith, manifest His obedience, and are ready for eternal life.

## Practical Application: Entering into Righteousness and Life

### 17. How to personally receive this gift

1. **Look to Christ crucified**
   - Spend time contemplating His sacrifice (John 3:14–16).
   - Ask God to show you both the ugliness of sin and the beauty of His love.

2. **Respond to His drawing**
   - When you feel conviction or a desire to change, recognize: Christ is
     drawing you.
   - Do not resist; surrender your will (Hebrews 3:7–8).

3. **Confess and forsake sin**
   - Admit your sins plainly to God (1 John 1:9).
   - Ask for both pardon and power to turn from them (Proverbs 28:13).

4. **Believe His promise of righteousness and life**
   - Take God at His word that Christ is **your righteousness** (Jeremiah 23:6;
     1 Corinthians 1:30).
   - Believe that eternal life is already yours in Christ (1 John 5:11–13), even
     as He continues to change you.

5. **Walk in newness of life**
   - Yield yourself daily to Christ (Romans 6:11–13).
   - Let His Spirit write the law in your heart (Hebrews 8:10).
   - Obedience becomes the fruit of love, not the price of life (John 14:15).

## Appeal

God has united righteousness and life in one Person—Jesus Christ.

- The law shows what righteousness is.
- The cross shows how much our unrighteousness cost.
- The gospel shows how, through Christ, God freely gives both righteousness and
  eternal life to all who believe.

You do not need to make yourself righteous before coming to Him. Every right
desire you feel is already His Spirit drawing you. Come just as you are, look to
the crucified and risen Saviour, and accept Him as:

- **Your righteousness** – your only hope of acceptance with God.
- **Your life** – the source of power to live in obedience and love.

Will you today choose to step onto “the way of righteousness” where “there is no
death,” and let Christ be to you “THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS”?
