# Reading 68: Righteousness and Life

## Introduction

The gospel reveals an inseparable bond between righteousness and life. These are
not two separate gifts but one divine reality—God's righteousness received by
faith results in eternal life. This study explores how Christ alone is both "The
Lord Our Righteousness" and "the life," and how through Him we receive what we
could never earn: perfect righteousness and immortal life.

## Core Truths

### The Gospel Promise: Life Through Believing

The foundation of Christian hope rests on one glorious truth:

> _"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
> whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_
> (John 3:16)

This verse contains the entire plan of salvation in miniature:

- **The source**: God's love
- **The gift**: His only begotten Son
- **The condition**: believing in Him
- **The result**: everlasting life instead of perishing

The gospel reveals God's righteousness in a way that brings life to those who
receive it by faith:

> _"For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it
> is written, The just shall live by faith."_ (Romans 1:17)

Notice the phrase "from faith to faith"—righteousness is received by faith at
the beginning and maintained by faith throughout the Christian journey. There is
no point at which human merit takes over.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "the just shall live by faith" appears three times in the New
Testament (Romans 1:17; Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38), each time emphasizing a
different aspect: Romans emphasizes the righteousness that comes by faith,
Galatians contrasts faith with law-keeping for salvation, and Hebrews emphasizes
persevering faith that does not draw back.

### What the Gospel Brought to Light

> _"Who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light
> through the gospel."_ (2 Timothy 1:10)

**Abolished**: The Greek word _katargeo_ means "to render powerless" or "make of
no effect." Death's power over the believer has been broken, though its presence
remains until the resurrection.

**Life and immortality**: These were not new inventions—they existed with God
from eternity. But through the gospel, they are now "brought to light"—made
available and visible to humanity.

## Deeper Truths

### The Inseparable Connection

Scripture consistently links righteousness and life as cause and effect:

> _"In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no
> death."_ (Proverbs 12:28)

> _"He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness,
> and honour."_ (Proverbs 21:21)

This connection exists because God Himself is both righteous and the source of
all life. Sin brought death (Romans 5:12); righteousness restores life. There is
no life apart from righteousness, and no true righteousness apart from life—they
flow from the same divine fountain.

[Q] **"If righteousness leads to life, doesn't that mean we earn eternal life by
being good?"**

This would be true if we could produce righteousness ourselves. But Scripture is
clear: _"There is none righteous, no, not one"_ (Romans 3:10). The righteousness
that leads to life must come from outside ourselves. We do not _produce_ it; we
_receive_ it. The one who "followeth after righteousness" is seeking it in the
right place—in Christ—and finding it as a gift, not earning it as wages.

### Grace Reigns Through Righteousness

> _"That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through
> righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 5:21)

Notice the chain: **Grace → Righteousness → Eternal Life**

- Grace does not bypass righteousness; it _produces_ righteousness
- This righteousness is not our own—it comes "by Jesus Christ our Lord"
- The result is eternal life

Sin established a kingdom of death. Grace establishes a kingdom of life—but
always "through righteousness." God does not save us _in_ our sins but _from_
our sins (Matthew 1:21).

### Christ: Both Our Righteousness and Our Life

Two remarkable titles belong to Jesus:

> _"And this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR
> RIGHTEOUSNESS."_ (Jeremiah 23:6)

> _"I am the way, the truth, and the life."_ (John 14:6)

These are not merely descriptions—they are His very names. Christ does not
simply _give_ righteousness and life as external gifts; He _is_ righteousness
and life. To have Christ is to have both.

[ILL] Consider a person dying of thirst in a desert. A cup of water brought to
them would save their life temporarily. But imagine instead that a living spring
appeared beside them—an inexhaustible source. Christ is not merely a cup of
righteousness or a portion of life delivered once. He is the living spring.
Those united to Him have righteousness and life flowing continuously from an
infinite source. _"He that believeth on Me, as the scripture hath said, out of
his belly shall flow rivers of living water"_ (John 7:38).

### The Commandments: Righteousness and Life Revealed

Consider what Scripture says about God's commandments:

> _"All Thy commandments are righteousness."_ (Psalm 119:172)

> _"And I know that His commandment is life everlasting."_ (John 12:50)

The commandments _are_ righteousness—not merely rules about righteousness. The
commandment _is_ life everlasting—not merely a path toward life. Why? Because
the commandments are a transcript of God's own character, and God is both
righteous and the source of all life.

[DYK🔎] When Jesus said "His commandment is life everlasting," He used a form of
the Greek word _zoe_, which refers to divine, eternal life rather than mere
biological existence (_bios_). The commandments express the very principle of
divine life.

[Q] **"Does this mean we receive eternal life by keeping the commandments?"**

Jesus said to the rich young ruler: _"If thou wilt enter into life, keep the
commandments"_ (Matthew 19:17). But this same man went away sorrowful, unable to
obey. The law reveals what righteousness is, but it cannot supply the power to
obey. This is why we need Christ—_"the gift of righteousness"_ (Romans 5:17).

The law shows the standard; Christ provides the power. Through union with Him,
His righteousness becomes ours—both imputed (credited to our account) and
imparted (worked into our character).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Two Kingdoms

Romans 5 presents a cosmic contrast:

| **Sin's Kingdom**                  | **Grace's Kingdom**                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Sin reigns unto death              | Grace reigns through righteousness |
| Death reigned by one man's offence | Life reigns by one, Jesus Christ   |
| Wages of sin is death              | Gift of God is eternal life        |

Every soul belongs to one kingdom or the other. There is no neutral ground. Adam
made us citizens of the kingdom of death; Christ offers citizenship in the
kingdom of life.

### Sanctuary Connections

The sanctuary illustrates this truth beautifully:

- **The altar of sacrifice** (outer court): Christ's death abolished death's
  power and made righteousness available
- **The table of showbread** (holy place): Christ sustains our spiritual life
  daily—_"I am the bread of life"_ (John 6:35)
- **The Most Holy Place**: In the ark rested the law—God's righteousness—covered
  by the mercy seat where blood was sprinkled. Righteousness and mercy meet;
  justice and grace unite

The high priest entered the Most Holy Place wearing a golden plate inscribed
"HOLINESS TO THE LORD" (Exodus 28:36). Christ, our High Priest, brings His
perfect righteousness into God's presence on our behalf. His holiness becomes
our holiness; His life becomes our life.

### How We Are Drawn to Christ

The Spirit of Prophecy illuminates the process by which sinners find
righteousness and life:

> "Christ is the source of every right impulse. He is the only one that can
> implant in the heart enmity against sin."

Every conviction of sin, every desire for purity, every longing for truth—these
are evidence of Christ's Spirit working. We do not initiate our own salvation;
He draws us.

> "As Christ draws them to look upon His cross, to behold Him whom their sins
> have pierced, the commandment comes home to the conscience."

Notice the order: First we behold Christ crucified, _then_ the commandment
convicts. It is not law-keeping that leads to Christ, but Christ who leads to
true obedience. The cross reveals both the depths of our sin and the heights of
God's love.

> "They begin to comprehend something of the righteousness of Christ, and
> exclaim, What is sin, that it should require such a sacrifice for the
> redemption of its victim?"

This is the question of a soul awakening to the gospel. Sin must be terrible
indeed if only the death of God's Son could remedy it. And God's love must be
unfathomable if He would pay such a price.

## Practical Application

### Receiving What We Cannot Earn

> _"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through
> Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)

**Wages** are earned; **gifts** are received. Death is what we have earned;
eternal life is what God freely gives. Our part is simple: receive.

But receiving is not passive. It means:

1. **Acknowledging our bankruptcy**—we have no righteousness to offer
2. **Beholding Christ on the cross**—letting His love soften our hearts
3. **Trusting His righteousness**—resting our case entirely on Him
4. **Following after righteousness**—seeking it daily in Christ alone
5. **Allowing grace to reign**—letting His life flow through us into obedience

### Living by Faith Today

"The just shall live by faith" is not merely a doctrine to believe but a life to
live. Each day we face the choice:

- Will I try to manufacture my own righteousness through self-effort?
- Or will I receive Christ's righteousness by faith and let Him live in me?

The one leads to exhaustion and discouragement. The other leads to rest and
victory.

[ILL] A branch does not strain and struggle to produce fruit. It simply abides
in the vine, and fruit appears naturally. Jesus said, _"Abide in Me, and I in
you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no
more can ye, except ye abide in Me"_ (John 15:4). Righteousness and spiritual
life flow from connection, not exertion.

## Appeal

> _"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by
> Me."_ (John 14:6)

Christ is not _a_ way among many—He is _the_ way. He is not _a_ truth among
competing claims—He is _the_ truth. He is not _a_ source of life—He is _the_
life.

Have you received Him? Not merely believed facts about Him, but received Him as
your personal righteousness and life?

If every desire for truth and purity is evidence of His Spirit working in you,
then respond today. Do not resist the drawing. Look to the cross. Behold the
love that paid so great a price. Let that love soften your heart and lead you to
full surrender.

The gift is offered freely. Righteousness and eternal life—not as wages you must
earn, but as grace you may receive through Jesus Christ our Lord.

_"Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."_

Will you believe today?
