## Slide 1 – Q1: The Promise of Redemption

- **Question:** What promise has been given in order that man may be redeemed
  from this condition?
- **Key Text:** Hosea 13:14 – “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I
  will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will
  be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Ransom & Redemption)

- **The Central Hope:** Death is not a friend, but an enemy. Through sin, we
  were sold into bondage.
  - Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal
    life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- **The Ransom:** To ransom means to pay a price to release a captive.
  - Matthew 20:28 – “Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
    to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.”
- **The Redemption:**
  - Spiritual: Buying back the soul from sin (Justification).
  - Physical: Reclaiming the body from the grave.
- **Destruction of the Grave:** God promises the grave will not hold His people
  forever; resurrection breaks the prison bars.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Paid Debt:**
  - Imagine a man imprisoned for a debt he can never pay, languishing without
    hope.
  - A benefactor pays the full sum and opens the prison door.
  - The prisoner is legally free before he steps out.
- **Application:**
  - Christ paid our debt at Calvary.
  - At the resurrection, He opens the cell door of the grave.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Agent of Redemption

- **Question:** Through whom will come this redemption from the grave?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:21, 22 – “For since by man came death, by man
  came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in
  Christ shall all be made alive.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (Two Adams)

- **The First Adam:**
  - As the head of the race, his fall brought sin and mortality to all
    descendants.
- **The Second Adam (Christ):**
  - Jesus stood where Adam fell. By His perfect obedience and death, He became
    the new Head of the race.
  - Romans 5:19 – “For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so
    by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - We have no merit of our own.
  - We stand in the merit and life of our Representative.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Definition (Federal Headship)

- **Federal Headship:**
  - The biblical principle where one person (Adam or Christ) acts on behalf of a
    group.
  - Their actions affect all who are represented by them.
  - We inherit death from Adam; we inherit life through faith in Jesus.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Consequence of No Resurrection

- **Question:** What would have been the result to the dead had not Christ
  obtained their release from the grave?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:16-18 – “For if the dead rise not, then is not
  Christ raised: And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in
  your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (Perished)

- **"Perished":**
  - Paul says without resurrection, the dead have ceased to exist (perished).
  - Implies the righteous dead are not currently in heaven; otherwise, they
    would be "alive," not "perished."
- **The Necessity of Resurrection:**
  - The Christian hope is not death itself, but the resurrection.
  - Without Christ waking us, death would be the final end of existence.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Broken Vase:**
  - If a beautiful vase is shattered to dust, it is ruined ("perished").
  - Unless the artist can miraculously reassemble the dust, it is lost forever.
- **Application:**
  - The resurrection is God reassembling the "dust" of our humanity into a
    glorified existence.

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Father’s Motivation

- **Question:** Why did God give His only-begotten Son to the world?
- **Key Text:** John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only
  begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
  everlasting life.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Love & Life)

- **God Gave:**
  - The Father did not need persuading; the Son's gift was the _result_ of the
    Father's love.
- **To Prevent Perishing:**
  - Justice requires sin be destroyed.
  - Christ took the "perishing" (second death) so we could have His life.
- **Everlasting Life:**
  - Begins now through the new birth.
  - John 5:24 – “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
    believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come
    into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Definition (Atonement)

- **Atonement:**
  - The work of reconciliation.
  - God and man are brought into unity (**at-one-ment**).
  - accomplished through the life, death, and priestly ministry of Christ.

## Slide 13 – Q5: The Sadducees’ Error

- **Question:** What did the Sadducees in Christ's time deny?
- **Key Text:** Luke 20:27 – “Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which
  deny that there is any resurrection.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Skepticism)

- **The Sadducees:**
  - Rationalists and materialists.
  - Accepted only the writings of Moses; rejected oral tradition.
  - Denied the afterlife and the resurrection.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Represents the skeptical mind that refuses to believe in God's power to
    restore life.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Proof from Moses

- **Question:** Referring to the Old Testament, how did Christ prove the
  resurrection?
- **Key Text:** Luke 20:37-38 – “Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed
  at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of
  Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the dead, but of the
  living: for all live unto him.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (God of the Living)

- **The Logic:**
  - Long after the patriarchs died, God said, "I _am_ the God of Abraham"
    (Exodus 3:6).
- **The Meaning:**
  - Not that they are currently alive in heaven (contradicts 1 Thess 4).
  - In God's purpose and memory, they are secure.
  - Because He guarantees their resurrection, He speaks of their life as a
    certainty.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Architect's Plan:**
  - An architect points to an empty lot and says, "This is the library."
  - It is not built yet, but on his blueprints, the reality is certain.
- **Application:**
  - God looks at the sleeping saints and sees them alive by His promise.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Nature’s Illustration

- **Question:** What example from nature is used to illustrate the resurrection
  and the final salvation of the righteous?
- **Key Text:**
  - 1 Corinthians 15:36 – “Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened,
    except it die.”
  - John 12:24 – “Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall
    into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth
    much fruit.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Key Points (The Seed)

- **The Seed:**
  - Looks dead and is buried.
  - When it decays, the germ of life springs forth into a new form.
- **Physical Application:**
  - Our bodies return to dust, but God raises us in glory.
- **Spiritual Application (Sanctification):**
  - Before we can live the life of Christ, self must die.
  - Romans 6:6 – “Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the
    body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Voice

- **Question:** Whose voice raises the dead?
- **Key Text:** John 5:28, 29 – “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in
  the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, And shall come
  forth...”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points (Hearing His Voice)

- **The Creator's Voice:**
  - The voice that said "Let there be light" (Genesis 1:3) speaks into the tomb.
- **The Good Shepherd:**
  - Believers are tuned to His voice.
  - John 10:27 – “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.”
- **Application:**
  - We must learn to obey His voice _now_ (Hebrews 3:7) to wake with joy _then_.

## Slide 22 – Q9: Two Classes

- **Question:** How many distinct groups, or classes, of people will have a
  resurrection?
- **Key Text:** Acts 24:15 – “And have hope toward God, which they themselves
  also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just
  and unjust.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points (Just & Unjust)

- **Two Classes Only:**
  - No middle ground or purgatory.
- **The Just:**
  - Those who accepted Christ’s sacrifice.
  - Sins blotted out in the heavenly sanctuary.
  - Covered by His righteousness.
- **The Unjust:**
  - Those who rejected the Holy Spirit and held onto sin.

## Slide 24 – Q9: Definition (Justification)

- **Justification:**
  - The legal act where God declares a repentant sinner righteous.
  - Not because of their own works, but because of faith in Christ's work.

## Slide 25 – Q10: Description of the Two Resurrections

- **Question:** How does Christ describe these two resurrections?
- **Key Text:** John 5:29 – “And shall come forth; they that have done good,
  unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
  resurrection of damnation.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points (Works as Evidence)

- **Salvation vs. Judgment:**
  - Saved by grace (Ephesians 2:8), but judged by works.
- **Resurrection of Life:**
  - For those whose good works were the fruit of saving faith.
  - James 2:18 – “Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
    thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.”
- **Resurrection of Damnation:**
  - For those whose works proved no connection with Christ.

## Slide 27 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Fruit Tree:**
  - You do not staple apples onto a tree to make it an apple tree.
  - It produces apples because it _is_ an apple tree.
- **Application:**
  - The "good done" by the righteous is the natural fruit of Christ living
    within them.

## Slide 28 – Q11: Timing of the First Resurrection

- **Question:** When will the resurrection of the just occur?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord himself shall descend from
  heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of
  God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”

## Slide 29 – Q11: Key Points (The Second Coming)

- **Corporate Event:**
  - Resurrection does not happen individually at death.
  - It happens when Christ returns.
- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - On the Day of Atonement, people waited for the High Priest to exit the Most
    Holy Place.
  - We wait for Jesus to finish the judgment. When He steps out, the saints are
    awakened.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Timing of the Reward

- **Question:** When are the righteous to receive their final reward?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:14 – “And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot
  recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the
  just.”

## Slide 31 – Q12: Key Points (Recompense)

- **Not at Death:**
  - If the righteous went to heaven at death, they would be rewarded then.
- **At the Resurrection:**
  - Jesus points to the resurrection as the time of reward.
  - 2 Timothy 4:8 – “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
    righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that
    day...”

## Slide 32 – Q13: The Psalmist’s Hope

- **Question:** How did the Psalmist describe that moment when he comes to life
  and leaves the grave?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 17:15 – “As for me, I will behold thy face in
  righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points (Likeness)

- **Beholding His Face:**
  - Matthew 5:8 – “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.”
- **Awaking with His Likeness:**
  - **Moral Likeness:** Character of Christ imparted _now_ (Sanctification).
  - **Physical Likeness:** Glorified body received _then_.
- **Principle:**
  - God stamps the physical image of immortality only upon a character already
    morally like Him.

## Slide 34 – Q14: The Resurrection Body

- **Question:** Will our resurrection bodies be like our present bodies?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:42-44 – “So also is the resurrection of the
  dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in
  dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in
  power: It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: Key Points (Transformation)

- **Identity remains, quality changes:**
  - **Corruption** (decay) $\rightarrow$ **Incorruption** (eternal vitality).
  - **Dishonor** (death) $\rightarrow$ **Glory**.
  - **Weakness** $\rightarrow$ **Power**.
  - **Natural** $\rightarrow$ **Spiritual**.

## Slide 36 – Q14: Definition (Spiritual Body)

- **Spiritual Body:**
  - Not a ghost or immaterial spirit.
  - A real, tangible body (like Christ’s).
  - Called "spiritual" because it is fully responsive to and directed by the
    Holy Spirit, no longer subject to sin.

## Slide 37 – Q15: The Pattern

- **Question:** After whose body will these resurrected ones be fashioned like
  unto?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 3:20, 21 – “For our conversation is in heaven; from
  whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall change
  our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body...”

## Slide 38 – Q15: Key Points (Christ's Body)

- **The Standard:** Jesus Himself.
- **Real Body:**
  - Luke 24:39 – “Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
    and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.”
- **Glorious Body:**
  - We exchange the "body of humiliation" for the perfect image of God.
  - Full restoration of physical creation.

## Slide 39 – Q16: Ultimate Triumph

- **Question:** In what words is the ultimate triumph over death and the grave
  expressed?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:55 – “O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
  where is thy victory?”

## Slide 40 – Q16: Key Points (Victory)

- **The Sting:**
  - The sting of death is sin (1 Corinthians 15:56).
- **Removing the Sting:**
  - Justification: Christ deals with the guilt of sin.
  - Sanctification: Spirit removes the love of sin.
  - Result: Death becomes merely a sleep.
- **The Victory:** The grave cannot hold those who belong to the Prince of Life.

## Slide 41 – Q17: Duration of Life

- **Question:** How long will the righteous live?
- **Key Text:** Luke 20:36 – “Neither can they die any more: for they are equal
  unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the
  resurrection.”

## Slide 42 – Q17: Key Points (Immortality)

- **Equal unto angels:**
  - Sharing their characteristic of deathlessness.
- **Immortality:**
  - Not inherent in the human soul.
  - 1 Timothy 6:16 – “Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no
    man can approach unto...”
  - It is a gift given at resurrection because we are connected to the Source of
    Life.

## Slide 43 – Q18: The Millennium

- **Question:** How long does the other class wait after the first resurrection
  before they are raised?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:4, 5 – “...and they lived and reigned with Christ
  a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
  years were finished.”

## Slide 44 – Q18: Key Points (The 1,000 Years)

- **1. First Resurrection:** At the Second Coming; righteous go to heaven.
- **2. The Millennium:**
  - Righteous judge matters in heaven (1 Corinthians 6:2-3).
  - Wicked are dead on desolate earth.
  - Satan bound by circumstances.
- **3. Second Resurrection:** Wicked raised at the end of the 1,000 years.

## Slide 45 – Q19: Fate of the Wicked

- **Question:** What is to be their fate?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 20:9 – “And they went up on the breadth of the earth,
  and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire
  came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.”

## Slide 46 – Q19: Key Points (Devoured)

- **The Result:**
  - Not eternal torture in consciousness.
  - They are **devoured** (consumed).
- **God's Justice:**
  - A "strange act" (Isaiah 28:21) to cleanse the universe of sin.

## Slide 47 – Q19: Illustration (Refiner's Fire)

- **Fire and Dross:**
  - Fire destroys dross but refines gold.
  - The wicked identify with sin (dross) and are consumed.
  - The righteous have the character of Christ (gold) and are unharmed.
  - Isaiah 33:14 – “Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among
    us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?” (Implies the righteous dwell in
    God's presence).

## Slide 48 – Q20: Who Shares This Fate?

- **Question:** Who are to share this fate?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 21:8 – “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the
  abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and
  all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
  brimstone: which is the second death.”

## Slide 49 – Q20: Key Points (The Second Death)

- **The Tragedy:** Unnecessary, as Christ died to save men from this.
- **The Root Cause:** "Unbelieving"—refusal to let Christ cleanse the heart.
- **The Second Death:**
  - Final, irreversible cessation of life.
  - Complete blotting out of sin.

## Slide 50 – Q20: Application (Victory)

- **Saved FROM Sin:**
  - We are saved _from_ sins, not _in_ them.
- **Victory is Promised:**
  - 1 John 5:4 – “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this
    is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”

## Slide 51 – Q21: The Last Enemy

- **Question:** What is the last enemy that will be destroyed?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:26 – “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is
  death.”

## Slide 52 – Q21: Key Points (Clean Universe)

- **No More Death:**
  - Revelation 21:4 – “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and
    there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall
    there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”
- **Conclusion:**
  - The Great Controversy is ended.
  - Christ has fully ransomed His people.

## Slide 53 – Q21: Illustration

- **The Horizon:**
  - When a storm passes, clouds vanish and the sun breaks through.
  - So will the universe be when sin is finished.
  - Only the sunshine of God's love will remain.
