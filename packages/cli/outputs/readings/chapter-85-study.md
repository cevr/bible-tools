# Reading 85: Ceremonial Sabbaths vs. The Sabbath of the Lord

## Introduction

One of the most misunderstood passages in Scripture is Colossians 2:14-17, where Paul speaks of something "nailed to the cross" and advises believers not to be judged regarding "sabbath days." Many sincere Christians conclude from this that the weekly seventh-day Sabbath was abolished at Calvary. However, a careful, scripture-with-scripture study reveals that Paul distinguishes between two entirely different institutions: the ceremonial sabbaths of the Mosaic system, which were shadows pointing to Christ, and the seventh-day Sabbath of creation, which commemorates God's completed work and remains "the Sabbath of the Lord."

## Core Truths

### The Handwriting of Ordinances

Paul writes of "blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross" (Colossians 2:14). The key question is: **What was this "handwriting of ordinances"?**

The Greek word for "handwriting" (_cheirographon_) refers to a written document—a record written by hand. This stands in sharp contrast to the Ten Commandments, which were not written by human hand.

> _"And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables."_ (Exodus 32:16)

[DYK🔎] The Ten Commandments were not merely written on stone—they were _engraved_ into stone by God's own finger (Exodus 31:18). The Hebrew word for "graven" (_charuth_) indicates something carved deeply, permanently. Such a law cannot be "blotted out" or "nailed" to anything—these expressions simply do not fit tablets of stone.

### Two Different Laws, Two Different Purposes

Scripture consistently distinguishes between:

1. **The moral law of God** (Ten Commandments)—written by God on stone, placed _inside_ the ark of the covenant (Deuteronomy 10:1-5)

2. **The ceremonial law of Moses**—written by Moses in a book, placed _beside_ the ark as a witness against the people (Deuteronomy 31:24-26)

Notice the language: the ceremonial law was "against" Israel and served as "a witness against thee." This aligns perfectly with Paul's description of something "against us, which was contrary to us."

### The Sabbaths That Were Shadows

Paul continues: _"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."_ (Colossians 2:16-17)

These "sabbath days" are explicitly identified as **shadows** pointing to Christ. What were these shadowy sabbaths?

> _"In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath."_ (Leviticus 23:24)

> _"Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement... It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest."_ (Leviticus 23:27, 32)

These ceremonial sabbaths—the Feast of Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, the Feast of Tabernacles—were _annual_ sabbaths tied to the sacrificial system. They involved "meat offerings" and "drink offerings" (Leviticus 23:37)—the very things Paul mentions in Colossians 2:16.

[DYK🔎] The annual feast sabbaths could fall on _any_ day of the week. The fifteenth of Nisan (first day of Unleavened Bread) might occur on a Tuesday one year and a Friday the next. This is fundamentally different from the seventh-day Sabbath, which is fixed to the weekly cycle established at creation.

## Deeper Truths

### The Weekly Sabbath Is Distinct

Scripture itself carefully distinguishes the weekly Sabbath from the ceremonial sabbaths. After listing all the annual feasts and their sabbaths in Leviticus 23, God makes this crucial clarification:

> _"These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord... **Beside the sabbaths of the Lord**, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows."_ (Leviticus 23:37-38)

The phrase "beside the sabbaths of the Lord" indicates that the ceremonial feast days were _in addition to_ and _separate from_ the regular weekly Sabbath. God Himself distinguishes between them.

[Q] **"But doesn't Paul say 'sabbath days' plural, which must include the weekly Sabbath?"**

The plurality refers to the multiple ceremonial sabbaths throughout the Jewish year—Passover, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Pentecost, Trumpets, Day of Atonement, and Tabernacles. Each of these had its own sabbath rest requirements. Paul groups them together as a category of shadows now fulfilled in Christ. The weekly Sabbath, by contrast, is never called a shadow in Scripture—it is a _memorial_ of an already-completed reality: creation.

### The Weekly Sabbath: Made for Man, Not Against Him

Consider what Jesus declared about the seventh-day Sabbath:

> _"The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath."_ (Mark 2:27)

[ILL] A loving father builds a beautiful garden for his children to enjoy. He sets aside one day each week for the family to rest together, walk through the garden, and remember his love. That day is not a burden—it is a gift, designed for their blessing. So God, at creation, fashioned the Sabbath for humanity's benefit, long before sin entered, long before any need for types and shadows pointing to a Redeemer.

If the Sabbath was "made for man" as a blessing, how could it be among those things Paul describes as "against us" and "contrary to us"? The ceremonial system, with its constant reminders of sin through animal sacrifices and offerings, testified to man's guilt and need for atonement. But the weekly Sabbath testified to God's perfect creation and His desire for fellowship with mankind.

### When Was the Weekly Sabbath Made?

> _"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made."_ (Genesis 2:1-3)

The seventh-day Sabbath was instituted at creation—before sin, before the fall, before any need for a Savior from sin. At that time, man's condition was "very good" (Genesis 1:31). There was no curse, no condemnation, nothing "against" man.

[DYK🔎] The Sabbath is the only institution that comes to us directly from Eden's sinless state. Marriage and the Sabbath—both were established before the fall and both remain God's design for humanity.

The ceremonial sabbaths, by contrast, were given at Sinai as part of the sacrificial system—centuries after the fall, specifically designed to point forward to Christ's atoning work.

### Shadows Versus Memorial

Here is the crucial distinction:

- **Ceremonial sabbaths** = _shadows_ pointing **forward** to Christ's redemptive work
- **The weekly Sabbath** = a _memorial_ pointing **backward** to God's creative work

> _"For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."_ (Exodus 20:11)

A shadow ceases to exist when the substance arrives. When Christ came, the ceremonial shadows were no longer needed—"the body is of Christ" (Colossians 2:17). But a memorial of creation cannot cease to be relevant as long as creation exists. We are still the creatures of God's hand; He is still our Creator. The memorial of that reality remains as meaningful as ever.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Attack on God's Memorial

Throughout the great controversy, Satan has sought to obscure God's authority as Creator. The weekly Sabbath stands as the perpetual sign of that authority:

> _"It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed."_ (Exodus 31:17)

By confusing the ceremonial sabbaths (which were indeed nailed to the cross) with the weekly Sabbath (which predates sin and points to creation), the enemy has led many sincere believers to unwittingly set aside God's memorial of creation.

### The Sanctuary Connection

The ceremonial sabbaths were intimately connected with the earthly sanctuary services—particularly the Day of Atonement, which centered on the work in the Most Holy Place. These pointed forward to Christ's heavenly ministry. When Christ ascended to the heavenly sanctuary, He did not abolish the moral law contained in the ark there; rather, He began His high priestly work of applying His sacrifice to repentant sinners.

[DYK🔎] In vision, John saw the heavenly temple opened, revealing "the ark of his testament" (Revelation 11:19). The law within that ark—including the fourth commandment—remains the standard of judgment and the transcript of God's character.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Sabbath

The Sabbath, rightly understood, is a profound expression of righteousness by faith. We rest from our works as God rested from His. We cease our striving and trust in His completed work—both in creation and in redemption. Sabbath-keeping, when entered into by faith, is not legalism but the deepest expression of dependence upon God.

> _"There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his."_ (Hebrews 4:9-10)

The Greek word for "rest" in Hebrews 4:9 is _sabbatismos_—literally, "a keeping of sabbath." This rest remains for God's people, not as a burden, but as a weekly entering into Christ's finished work.

## Practical Application

Understanding this distinction has profound implications for the Christian life:

1. **Freedom from confusion**: We need not be troubled when someone quotes Colossians 2 to suggest the weekly Sabbath is abolished. Scripture itself distinguishes the ceremonial from the moral.

2. **Confidence in God's Word**: The more carefully we study, the more consistent Scripture becomes. God does not contradict Himself—His Sabbath commandment remains "the sabbath of the Lord" throughout all generations.

3. **Joyful obedience**: The Sabbath is a gift, not a burden. It was made _for_ us, designed to bless us with rest, worship, and fellowship with our Creator.

4. **Witness to the Creator**: In an age of evolutionary confusion, the Sabbath stands as a weekly testimony that we serve a Creator God who made all things and rested on the seventh day.

5. **Preparation for eternity**: The prophet Isaiah declares that in the new earth, "from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord" (Isaiah 66:23). The Sabbath will continue throughout eternity—it would be strange indeed if it were abolished now, only to be restored later.

## Appeal

The distinction between ceremonial sabbaths and the weekly Sabbath is not a minor technicality—it touches the heart of our relationship with God as Creator and Redeemer.

> _"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God."_ (Exodus 20:8-10)

The ceremonial shadows have met their substance in Christ. The sacrifices, the feast days, the annual sabbaths—all pointed to Him who is the Lamb of God, and they are no longer binding. But the weekly Sabbath, given in Eden before sin, written by God's finger in stone, and distinguished in Scripture as "the sabbath of the Lord," remains the blessed memorial of creation and the sign of our loyalty to the Creator.

Will you accept this gift? Will you enter into God's rest, ceasing from your own works as He did from His? The Sabbath is not against you—it was made _for_ you, a weekly appointment with your Creator, a foretaste of the eternal rest that awaits the people of God.

_"Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil."_ (Isaiah 56:2)
