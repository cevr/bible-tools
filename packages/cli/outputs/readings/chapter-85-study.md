### Q1. What was the result of blotting out the handwriting of ordinances?

> “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was
> contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross... Let no
> man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or
> of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come;
> but the body is of Christ.” **(Colossians 2:14–17)**

**Answer:**

The result of this "blotting out" was the termination of the ceremonial
system—the code of religious rituals, sacrifices, and yearly festivals that
pointed forward to the coming Messiah. When the Apostle Paul speaks of the
"handwriting of ordinances," he is referring to the ceremonial law, not the
moral law of the Ten Commandments.

1.  **Distinction Between Laws:** The Bible distinguishes between the moral law
    (the character of God) and the ceremonial law (the remedy for sin). The
    ceremonial law dealt with meats, drinks, divers washings, and carnal
    ordinances imposed _until_ the time of reformation (Hebrews 9:10).
2.  **Shadow vs. Body:** Paul explicitly states these ordinances were a
    "shadow." A shadow has no substance of its own; it is merely a projection
    cast by a solid body. The "body" (or substance) is Christ. Once the reality
    (Christ) appeared, the shadow (the types and ceremonies) was no longer
    needed.
3.  **Nailed to the Cross:** When Jesus died on Calvary, the veil of the temple
    was rent in twain (Matthew 27:51), signaling the end of the earthly
    sacrificial system. We no longer offer lambs because the Lamb of God has
    died. To continue in these shadows now is to deny that the Substance has
    come.

- **Term Definition:**
  - **Ceremonial Law:** The system of sacrifices, festivals, and ritual washings
    given to Israel to teach them the gospel in types and symbols. It was
    temporary.
  - **Moral Law:** The Ten Commandments, which define sin and righteousness.
    They are eternal and unchangeable (Psalm 111:7–8).

**[ILL] The Architect’s Blueprints:** Imagine an architect draws a detailed
blueprint for a magnificent house. The workers use these drawings to guide every
step of construction. But once the house is built, you do not live in the paper
blueprints; you live in the house. The ceremonial law was the blueprint or
"shadow" of the plan of salvation. Now that Christ (the House) is finished and
present, we do not cling to the paper rolls of the old ritual system; we dwell
in Him.

### Q2. Upon what were the ten commandments written?

> “And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform,
> even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone.”
> **(Deuteronomy 4:13)**

**Answer:**

The Ten Commandments were written upon stone, signifying their durability,
permanence, and unchangeable nature.

1.  **Written by God:** Unlike the ceremonial laws which were dictated to Moses
    and written in a book (Deuteronomy 31:24), the moral law was written
    directly by God on stone. This indicates that the standard of righteousness
    is not of human origin but divine.
2.  **The New Covenant Connection:** Under the New Covenant, God does not
    abolish this law. Instead, He transfers the writing from tables of stone to
    the "fleshy tables of the heart" (2 Corinthians 3:3; Hebrews 8:10).
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** The problem was never the Law itself, but the
    stony hearts of the people who could not keep it. Through **Justification**,
    God forgives our transgressions of this law. Through **Sanctification**, He
    writes the principles of this law—love to God and love to man—into our very
    nature, empowering us to obey.

- **Term Definition:**
  - **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to make the believer
    holy, imparting the power to overcome sin and live in obedience to God’s law
    (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL] The King’s Decree:** If a king writes a decree in sand on the seashore,
the next tide washes it away; it is temporary. But if he carves his decree into
granite rock, it is meant to stand for ages. God wrote the ceremonial ordinances
on parchment (which decays), but He wrote His Ten Commandments on rock. This
shows that while the method of atonement (sacrifices) would change, the
definition of right and wrong (the Law) stands forever.

### Q3. In what manner were they written on these tables of stone?

> “And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God,
> graven upon the tables.” **(Exodus 32:16)**

**Answer:**

They were "graven" or engraved directly by the finger of God (Exodus 31:18).

1.  **Distinct from the "Handwriting" of Ordinances:** In Colossians 2:14, Paul
    speaks of the "handwriting" (Greek: _cheirographon_, meaning hand-written
    document) that was blotted out. This refers to Moses' handwriting in the
    book of the law. The Ten Commandments, however, are the "writing of God."
    God does not blot out His own character.
2.  **The Basis of Judgment:** Since this law was written by God, it remains the
    standard by which all humanity is judged (James 2:12).
3.  **The Sanctuary:** In the earthly sanctuary, these tables of stone were
    placed _inside_ the Ark of the Covenant, under the Mercy Seat (Deuteronomy
    10:5). This symbolizes that God’s government is founded upon His law, but
    His throne is covered by mercy for the repentant sinner.

**[ILL] The Constitution:** Every nation has temporary bylaws that change with
the administration—like speed limits or tax codes. But the Constitution is the
founding document that defines the nation itself. The ceremonial laws were the
temporary bylaws for the nation of Israel. The Ten Commandments are the
Constitution of the Universe. You cannot "blot out" the Constitution without
destroying the government.

### Q4. For whom was the weekly Sabbath made?

> “And He said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the
> Sabbath.” **(Mark 2:27)**

**Answer:**

The Sabbath was made for "man"—meaning mankind, the human race—not exclusively
for the Jews.

1.  **A Gift, Not a Burden:** Jesus clarifies that the Sabbath was designed as a
    blessing ("for man"), not a burden to work against him.
2.  **Universal Scope:** Since it was made for man, it applies to all men in all
    ages. It is not a "shadow" that fades, but a necessity for human spiritual
    and physical health.
3.  **Not "Against Us":** Colossians 2:14 speaks of ordinances that were
    "against us" and "contrary to us." The Sabbath, being made _for_ man’s
    refreshment and communion with his Creator, cannot be the thing described as
    being "against" him. It is a day of delight (Isaiah 58:13).

- **Righteousness by Faith Application:** The Sabbath is the ultimate sign of
  Righteousness by Faith. On the Sabbath, we cease from our own works and rest
  in God's work of creation and redemption (Hebrews 4:10). It reminds us that we
  cannot save ourselves; we rest in the finished work of Christ.

### Q5. When was the Sabbath made?

> “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them... And
> God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had
> rested from all His work which God created and made.” **(Genesis 2:1–3)**

**Answer:**

The Sabbath was made at the close of Creation week, long before the Jewish
nation existed.

1.  **Pre-Fall Institution:** The Sabbath was established in Eden before sin
    entered the world.
2.  **Not a Shadow:** A "shadow" or type (like a sacrifice) is a remedy or
    lesson pointing to a solution for sin. Since the Sabbath was made _before_
    sin existed, it cannot be a shadow of redemption. It is a memorial of
    creation.
3.  **Sanctified in Time:** God "sanctified" (set apart for holy use) the
    seventh day at the very foundation of the world. What God does forever
    remains (Ecclesiastes 3:14).

**[ILL] The Wedding Ring:** A wedding ring is given at the marriage ceremony to
mark the relationship. If the couple later gets into debt and needs a
debt-repayment plan, that plan is temporary. Once the debt is paid, the plan
ends. But the wedding ring remains because the marriage remains. The ceremonial
law was the debt-payment plan (for sin); the Sabbath is the wedding ring of the
Creator and His creation—it was there at the beginning and remains forever.

### Q6. What was man's condition then?

> “And God saw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And
> the evening and the morning were the sixth day.” **(Genesis 1:31)**

**Answer:**

Man’s condition was "very good"—he was sinless, holy, and in perfect harmony
with God.

1.  **A Sinless Institution:** Because the Sabbath was given to a sinless man,
    it is an institution compatible with perfection. It is not merely a remedial
    measure for sinners.
2.  **Perpetuity:** Since the Sabbath was part of God's perfect plan before the
    fall, it will continue to be part of His perfect plan in the New Earth.
    Isaiah 66:22–23 confirms that in the new heavens and new earth, "from one
    sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the
    Lord."

### Q7. Had man faithfully obeyed God from the beginning, would He have been counted a sinner?

> “For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law
> shall be justified.” **(Romans 2:13)**

**Answer:**

If man had faithfully obeyed God from the beginning, he would never have become
a sinner, for "sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). He would have
remained just (righteous).

1.  **The Definition of Righteousness:** Righteousness is simply perfect
    obedience to God's law.
2.  **The Human Dilemma:** Because all have sinned (Romans 3:23), no human can
    now be justified (declared righteous) by their own attempts to keep the law,
    for our past record condemns us.
3.  **The Gospel Solution:**
    - **Justification (Imputed Righteousness):** We admit we are lawbreakers. We
      accept Christ's perfect life and death in our place. God looks at us and
      sees Christ's obedience. We are "justified" by faith (Romans 5:1).
    - **Sanctification (Imparted Righteousness):** Having been forgiven, Christ
      now lives in us. He empowers us to become "doers of the law" through His
      Spirit. We obey not to _earn_ salvation, but because we _have_ salvation
      and a new heart.

- **Term Definition:**
  - **Imputed Righteousness:** The credit of Christ's perfect life given to the
    sinner at conversion. It is our _title_ to heaven.
  - **Imparted Righteousness:** The power of Christ working _in_ the sinner to
    change their character. It is our _fitness_ for heaven.

### Q8. For what purpose were the sabbaths instituted which formed a part of the "handwriting of ordinances?

> “Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.”
> **(Colossians 2:17)**

**Answer:**

The ceremonial sabbaths (distinct from the weekly Sabbath) were instituted to
serve as "shadows" pointing forward to the work of Christ in the plan of
redemption.

1.  **Prophetic Teaching Tools:** These feast days (like Passover, Pentecost,
    Tabernacles) were acted-out prophecies. For example, the Passover lamb
    pointed to Christ's death; the Day of Atonement pointed to the final
    judgment and cleansing of sin.
2.  **Temporary Nature:** Once "the body" (Christ) arrived and fulfilled these
    prophetic types, the shadows were no longer necessary. We do not need to
    kill a Passover lamb because "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us" (1
    Corinthians 5:7).

**[ILL] The Photo and the Person:** When a soldier goes to war, his wife keeps a
photograph of him. She treasures it because it reminds her of him while he is
absent. But when he walks through the door, she puts the photo down and embraces
her husband. The ceremonial sabbaths were the "photo" of the coming Savior. Now
that Jesus has come, we have the Person. We don't need the photo (the ceremonial
shadows) anymore. However, we still keep the weekly Sabbath because it is not a
photo of a missing Savior, but a day of present rest _with_ Him.

### Q9. To what does the Sabbath of the fourth commandment direct the mind?

> “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
> is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day,
> and hallowed it.” **(Exodus 20:11)**

**Answer:**

The fourth commandment directs the mind back to **Creation**.

1.  **The Sign of Authority:** The Sabbath identifies _who_ God is: the Creator
    of heaven and earth. It distinguishes the true God from false gods who made
    nothing (Jeremiah 10:11).
2.  **Different Direction:** The ceremonial sabbaths pointed **forward** to the
    Cross and the removal of sin. The weekly Sabbath points **backward** to the
    Creation and the establishment of God's government.
3.  **The Three Angels' Messages:** The call to worship the Creator in the last
    days (Revelation 14:7) is a direct reference to the fourth commandment
    language. In the final conflict, the issue will be worship—acknowledging
    God's authority as Creator through His holy Sabbath.

### Q10. Were there any sabbath days in the old dispensation that were local and shadowy?

> “In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a
> sabbath...” **(Leviticus 23:24)** “Also the tenth day of the seventh month
> there shall be a day of atonement... It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest,
> and ye shall afflict your souls.” **(Leviticus 23:27–32)**

**Answer:**

Yes, there were specific annual days called "sabbaths" that were distinct from
the weekly seventh-day Sabbath.

1.  **Floating Days:** These ceremonial sabbaths fell on specific dates of the
    year (like the 10th day of the 7th month). Just like our birthday falls on a
    different day of the week each year, these annual sabbaths could fall on a
    Monday, Wednesday, or any day.
2.  **Shadows of Redemption:** The text mentions the Day of Atonement (Yom
    Kippur). This was a shadow of Christ's High Priestly ministry in the
    heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8 & 9). It was "local" (for the Jewish economy)
    and "shadowy" (predictive).
3.  **Afflicting the Soul:** While the weekly Sabbath is a joyful celebration of
    creation, the ceremonial sabbath of the Day of Atonement was a time of
    "afflicting souls"—solemn judgment and repentance.

---

### Q11. What were these days for?

> “These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy
> convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, a burnt
> offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, everything
> upon his day.” **(Leviticus 23:37)**

**Answer:**

These days were for the administration of the ceremonial system—offerings,
sacrifices, meat offerings, and drink offerings.

1.  **The Context of Colossians 2:** Notice the list in Leviticus matches Paul's
    list in Colossians 2:16: "meat, drink, holy day... sabbath days." Paul was
    clearly referring to these annual feast days found in the ceremonial law,
    which involved food and drink offerings.
2.  **Dependency on Sacrifices:** These days were inextricably linked to the
    shedding of animal blood. Since animal sacrifices ceased at the cross, the
    days associated with them also lost their significance.

---

### Q12. Were these entirely distinct from the seventh-day Sabbath?

> “Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside all your
> vows, and beside all your free will offerings, which ye give unto the Lord.”
> **(Leviticus 23:38)**

**Answer:**

Yes, the Bible explicitly distinguishes them. Leviticus 23:38 draws a sharp line
between the ceremonial feast days and "the Sabbaths of the Lord."

1.  **"Beside" Means "In Addition To":** God commanded the yearly feasts
    (Passover, etc.) to be kept _in addition to_ the weekly Sabbath. They are
    not the same institution.
2.  **Ownership:** The weekly Sabbath is called "The Sabbath of the **Lord**"
    (Exodus 20:10). The ceremonial sabbaths are often referred to as "your
    sabbaths" or "her sabbaths" (Hosea 2:11), belonging to the Jewish national
    system.
3.  **Conclusion:** The "handwriting of ordinances" nailed to the cross included
    the yearly sabbaths (shadows). The "writing of God" on stone included the
    weekly Sabbath (the memorial of creation). The Christian is free from the
    Jewish feasts, but remains under the obligation of the Moral Law to love God
    and keep His commandments (John 14:15; Revelation 14:12).

**[ILL] The Two Books:** Imagine a doctor gives you two books. One is a book of
"Emergency Procedures" for treating a specific disease you have. The other is a
book of "Rules for Healthy Living" (diet, exercise, sleep). Once the disease is
cured, you can throw away the Emergency Procedure book—it was temporary and
remedial. But you never throw away the Rules for Healthy Living; they are for
your permanent well-being. The Ceremonial Law was the emergency procedure for
sin (pointing to the Cure, Jesus). The Moral Law (including the Sabbath) is the
rule of healthy spiritual living for all eternity.
