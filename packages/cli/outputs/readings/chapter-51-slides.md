Here is the slide deck presentation for the study on the Second Angel’s Message
and Babylon.

## Slide 1 – Q1: The Second Angel’s Announcement

- **Question:** What announcement is made by the second angel of Rev. 14?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:8 – “And there followed another angel, saying,
  Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
  drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Identity and Meaning

- **The Sequence:** The Second Angel follows the First.
  - The First Angel brought the "everlasting gospel" and judgment.
  - The Second Angel announces the moral collapse of those who rejected the
    First.
- **Identity of Babylon:**
  - Derived from "Babel," signifying confusion (Genesis 11:9 – “Therefore is the
    name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of
    all the earth...”).
  - Represents a religious system mixed with error and worldliness.
- **The Nature of the Fall:**
  - Not initially physical destruction, but a **moral and spiritual fall**.
  - Rejection of light leads to darkness (John 12:35 – “Then Jesus said unto
    them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the
    light, lest darkness come upon you...”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Righteousness by Faith Application

- **The Cause of the Fall:**
  - A church falls when it moves from **Justification by Faith** (reliance on
    Christ) to reliance on human works and traditions.
- **Sanctification and the Covenant:**
  - A fallen system offers external ceremonies rather than internal
    transformation.
  - True Sanctification is God’s work within:
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
    Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
    and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall
    be to me a people.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Lighthouse:**
  - Imagine a lighthouse meant to guide ships to safety.
  - If the keeper replaces the clear light with confusing colored lanterns,
    ships crash onto the rocks.
  - The lighthouse has "fallen" from its purpose; it is now a cause of
    destruction.
- **Application:**
  - A church "falls" when it obscures the clear light of the Gospel with the fog
    of human tradition.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Identifying Babylon

- **Question:** To whom is the term Babylon elsewhere applied?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 17:4, 5 – “And the woman was arrayed in purple and
  scarlet color... And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon
  the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points – The Woman Symbol

- **Scripture Interprets Scripture:**
  - A **Pure Woman** represents God’s true church (Jeremiah 6:2 – “I have
    likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.”).
  - A **Corrupt Woman** (Harlot) represents an apostate system unfaithful to
    Christ.
- **Identifying the System:**
  - Wealthy (“purple and scarlet”) and politically powerful.
  - Historicist view: Identifies this “Mother” as the Papacy—mixing paganism
    with Christianity and assuming God’s prerogatives.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Key Points – The Mystery

- **Mystery of Iniquity:**
  - A counterfeit to the "mystery of godliness" (1 Timothy 3:16).
  - While the mystery of godliness is God becoming man to save, the mystery of
    iniquity is man exalting himself to the place of God.
  - 2 Thessalonians 2:4 – “Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is
    called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple
    of God, shewing himself that he is God.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Unfaithful Wife:**
  - A wife may wear her wedding ring and dress beautifully, but if she secretly
    loves a rival, she is an adulteress.
  - A church may claim the name of Christ, but if she adopts worldly customs and
    seeks state power rather than the Holy Spirit, she is spiritually
    unfaithful.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Friendship with the World

- **Question:** What does the apostle call the church that has become corrupted
  by worldly alliances?
- **Key Text:** James 4:4 – “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that
  the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a
  friend of the world is the enemy of God.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points – Spiritual Adultery

- **Betrothed to Christ:**
  - The church is espoused to one husband, Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2 – “For I
    am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one
    husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.”).
- **Dependence:**
  - Spiritual fornication occurs when the church leans on the "kings of the
    earth" (politics) for support rather than Christ.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - The world operates on force and pride; the Kingdom on love and service.
  - Matthew 6:24 – “No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
    one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
    other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Vine:**
  - Consider a vine that refuses to cling to its trellis.
  - Instead, it creeps along the ground, tangling itself in mud and weeds.
  - It cannot bear good fruit because it has left its source of uplift.
  - **Lesson:** A church that unclasps its hold on Christ to grasp worldly
    politics becomes "earthy" and fruitless.

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Man of Sin

- **Question:** And what is that called which was to reveal the "man of sin," or
  the papacy?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:3 – “Let no man deceive you by any means: for
  that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man
  of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.”

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points – The Falling Away

- **Apostasia (Falling Away):**
  - A defection or revolt from within, not an attack from without.
  - A gradual process of compromise, accepting pagan philosophies to please the
    world.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - This power obscures Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary by establishing
    an earthly priesthood and sacrifice.
  - Daniel 8:12 – “And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by
    reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
    practised, and prospered.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Application – Human Righteousness

- **The Core Error:**
  - The "man of sin" represents the triumph of **human righteousness**—the
    belief that man can forgive sin and merit salvation through rituals.
- **The Truth:**
  - True Righteousness by Faith acknowledges man's bankruptcy.
  - It relies entirely on Christ’s imputed and imparted life for salvation.

## Slide 15 – Q5: The Work of the Harlot

- **Question:** What work was this "mother of harlots" seen to engage in?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 17:6 – “And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of
  the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points – Persecution

- **The Result of Union:**
  - When a church loses the power of love, it resorts to the power of law/force.
- **The Spirit of Cain:**
  - Persecution arises when one's own works are evil and the brother's are
    righteous.
  - 1 John 3:12 – “Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his
    brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his
    brother's righteous.”
- **"Drunken":**
  - Suggests irrationality; persecution suppresses conscience and destroys those
    Christ came to save.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Key Points – Contrast with Christ

- **The Way of Babylon:** "Destroy those who disagree."
- **The Way of Christ:**
  - Matthew 5:44 – “But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
    you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
    you, and persecute you.”
- **The Test:**
  - Romans 8:9 – “Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
    his.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: The Golden Cup

- **Question:** What was in the hand of this woman?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 17:4 – “And the woman was arrayed in purple and
  scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a
  golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her
  fornication.”

## Slide 19 – Q6: Key Points – The Contents

- **External Beauty vs. Internal Poison:**
  - The cup is gold (attractive, authoritative), but the contents are
    abominable.
- **Counterfeit Sanctuary:**
  - Satan uses a counterfeit vessel to dispense false doctrines:
    - Tradition above Scripture.
    - Sunday instead of Sabbath.
    - Immortality of the soul.
    - Salvation by works.

## Slide 20 – Q6: Application – Two Cups

- **The Cup of Christ:**
  - Psalm 116:13 – “I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
    the Lord.”
  - Revelation 22:17 – “...And whosoever will, let him take the water of life
    freely.”
- **The Contrast:**
  - Christ offers water that cleanses; Babylon offers wine that stupifies.

## Slide 21 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Pharmacist:**
  - A pharmacist may take a bottle labeled "Medicine" and fill it with poison.
  - The bottle looks trustworthy, but the contents bring death.
- **Application:**
  - The "Golden Cup" is the church’s prestige.
  - If the doctrine inside contradicts the Bible, it is spiritual poison despite
    the beautiful packaging.

## Slide 22 – Q7: The Effect of the Wine

- **Question:** What effect had this wine (false doctrine) upon those to whom it
  was given?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 17:2 – “With whom the kings of the earth have
  committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk
  with the wine of her fornication.”

## Slide 23 – Q7: Key Points – Spiritual Drunkenness

- **Loss of Discernment:**
  - Spiritual drunkenness removes the ability to distinguish between truth and
    error.
  - People become "dizzy" with excitement or complex theories, ignoring the
    plain "Thus saith the Lord."
- **Global Deception:**
  - "Inhabitants of the earth."
  - Leads to a disregard of God’s Law.
- **The Remedy:**
  - The Second Angel's message is a call to sobriety—to stop imbibing error and
    return to Bible truth.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Daughters of Babylon

- **Question:** This woman is said to be the "mother" of harlots. Are there any
  churches which have sprung from the mother church of Rome, directly or
  indirectly, and which resemble her in doctrine or otherwise?
- **Reference:** (Historical Note: Protestant churches retaining Roman
  elements).

## Slide 25 – Q8: Key Points – Family Relationship

- **The Mother:** The Papacy (Rome).
- **The Daughters:**
  - Churches that came out during the Reformation but did not continue to
    advance.
  - They retained key doctrines of the Mother (e.g., Sunday observance,
    conscious state of the dead).
- **Defining Harlotry:**
  - Occurs when Protestant churches seek the aid of the state or dilute the
    Bible to please the world, just as Rome did.

## Slide 26 – Q8: Key Points – Incomplete Reformation

- **The Path of Light:**
  - God intended the Reformation to be progressive.
  - Proverbs 4:18 – “But the path of the just is as the shining light, that
    shineth more and more unto the perfect day.”
- **Stagnation:**
  - When churches codified their creeds and refused new light, they began to
    resemble the Mother they had left.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Confessions of Fallen Condition

- **Question:** What confessions have been made by leading men, which show that
  they consider the churches to be in a fallen condition?
- **Reference:** (General admission of worldliness and lack of power).

## Slide 28 – Q9: Key Points – Spiritual Decline

- **Loss of Purity:**
  - Quotes describe churches filled with "wicked, unholy" men protected by
    wealth.
  - Covetousness and desire for respectability replaced holiness.
- **The Laodicean Condition:**
  - Revelation 3:17 – “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,
    and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
    miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”

## Slide 29 – Q9: Application – Form vs. Power

- **Righteousness by Faith Application:**
  - A church that tolerates known sin while maintaining a "form" of religion
    denies the Gospel.
  - The true Gospel is the power of God to _liberate_ from sin, not just to
    cover it while the sinner remains in bondage.

## Slide 30 – Q10: Condition in the Last Days

- **Question:** What does Paul say of the condition of the church in the last
  days?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:1–5 – “This know also, that in the last days
  perilous times shall come. For men shall be... lovers of pleasures more than
  lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from
  such turn away.”

## Slide 31 – Q10: Key Points – Denying the Power

- **The Location:**
  - Paul describes those with a "form of godliness"—professed Christians, not
    the secular world.
- **What is the Power?**
  - The Gospel is the power to transform the life.
  - Romans 1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
    power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth...”
- **The Denial:**
  - To claim one is a Christian while rejecting the Spirit's power to give
    victory over sin.

## Slide 32 – Q10: Sanctification and Separation

- **True Religion:**
  - Not just outward ritual, but the circumcision of the heart.
  - Colossians 2:11 – “In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision
    made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the
    circumcision of Christ.”
- **The Command:**
  - "From such turn away." We cannot remain in fellowship with a system that
    denies Christ's power to restore His image in us.

## Slide 33 – Q11: The Habitation of Devils

- **Question:** How does the prophet elsewhere describe the condition of
  Babylon?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 18:2 – “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and
  is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a
  cage of every unclean and hateful bird.”

## Slide 34 – Q11: Key Points – Progressive Degradation

- **Deepening Darkness:**
  - Rejection of truth (Rev 14) leads to utter corruption (Rev 18).
  - When the Holy Spirit is grieved away, other spirits take possession.
  - Matthew 12:45 – “Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
    more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last
    state of that man is worse than the first...”
- **Spiritualism:**
  - "Habitation of devils" points to the rise of demonic deceptions
    (Spiritualism) within fallen Christianity.
  - 1 Timothy 4:1 – “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
    some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and
    doctrines of devils.”

## Slide 35 – Q11: Sanctuary Imagery

- **The Cage:**
  - The church was meant to be a temple for the Holy Ghost.
  - Instead, it becomes a "cage" for unclean birds (symbols of prey/impurity),
    signifying a totally corrupted sanctuary.

## Slide 36 – Q12: The Call to Come Out

- **Question:** Where will many of God's people be found when this cry is at its
  height?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 18:4 – “And I heard another voice from heaven,
  saying, Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and
  that ye receive not of her plagues.”

## Slide 37 – Q12: Key Points – God's People

- **"My People":**
  - God has sincere children _inside_ Babylon who live up to the light they
    have.
  - He loves them too much to let them stay in a crumbling system.
- **Why Separate?**
  - "That ye be not partakers of her sins."
  - Association influences character. Remaining in a system that fights God's
    truth eventually leads to sharing in its guilt.
- **What it Means:**
  - Withdrawing membership/support.
  - Separating from the principles of pride, force, and tradition.

## Slide 38 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Fireman:**
  - If a building is condemned and the foundation is crumbling, a fireman
    shouts, "Get out!"
  - He does this to save the people, not to insult the building.
- **Application:**
  - The message of the Second Angel is a rescue mission for God's people.

## Slide 39 – Q13: The Guide to Truth

- **Question:** In this call to "come out" of Babylon, what message does the
  Lord send to guide His people into the truth for these days?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are
  they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”

## Slide 40 – Q13: Key Points – The Destination

- **From Babylon to Zion:**
  - When God calls people _out_, He calls them _into_ something better: The
    Third Angel's Message.
- **Two Marks of the Remnant:**
  1.  **Commandments of God:** Keeping all ten, including the Sabbath.
  2.  **Faith of Jesus:** Not just faith _in_ Him, but possessing His quality of
      faith.
- **The Contrast:**
  - Babylon = Lawlessness (Wine).
  - Remnant = Lawfulness (Commandments).

## Slide 41 – Q13: Application – Righteousness by Faith

- **The Power to Obey:**
  - We cannot keep the Commandments by our own power.
  - It requires the "Faith of Jesus" dwelling in us.
- **Fulfillment:**
  - When we have His faith, the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in us.
  - Romans 8:4 – “That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
    who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”
