# Bible Study: Riches

## Introduction

The question of wealth—its source, purpose, and peril—touches every human heart. In a world that measures success by bank balances and possessions, Scripture offers a radically different perspective: **true riches are not found in what we possess, but in Whom we trust**. This study explores God's teaching on earthly and heavenly wealth, revealing how the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan plays out in our relationship to material things.

## Core Truths

### God Is the Source of All Wealth

Before we can rightly understand riches, we must settle this foundational truth: every capacity to earn, every opportunity to prosper, every resource we possess flows from God's hand.

> _"But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth."_ (Deuteronomy 8:18)

This truth demolishes human pride. The self-made man is a myth. Our intelligence, health, circumstances, and abilities are divine gifts. Acknowledging God as the source of wealth transforms our relationship to money from ownership to stewardship.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "power" in Deuteronomy 8:18 is _koach_, meaning strength, ability, or force. It's the same word used to describe God's power in creation (Jeremiah 10:12). Our ability to work and earn is itself a creative gift from God.

### Honoring God with Our Substance

If God is the source of all wealth, our response should be worship through giving:

> _"Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase."_ (Proverbs 3:9)

**Firstfruits**: The first and best portion, given before we attend to our own needs. This principle predates the Mosaic law—Abel brought the firstlings of his flock (Genesis 4:4). It demonstrates that God holds first place in our hearts.

This connects directly to the sanctuary service, where offerings were brought to the altar before the worshiper received any benefit. The giving itself was an act of faith and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.

## Deeper Truths

### The Danger of Heart Attachment

Scripture does not condemn wealth itself but warns against a dangerous heart condition:

> _"If riches increase, set not your heart upon them."_ (Psalm 62:10)

The heart that clings to riches cannot cling to Christ. This is not merely about quantity of wealth but quality of attachment. A poor person coveting may be more enslaved than a wealthy person holding possessions loosely.

[Q] **"Is it wrong to be wealthy or to desire financial security?"**

Scripture shows that godly people like Abraham, Job, and Joseph possessed great wealth without condemnation. The issue is not possession but disposition. When wealth becomes our security, our identity, or our god, we have crossed into dangerous territory. Paul's instruction to Timothy addresses the rich without commanding them to abandon their wealth—but to redirect their trust and generosity (1 Timothy 6:17-19).

### Riches Kept to the Owner's Hurt

Solomon, the wisest and wealthiest of kings, observed a troubling pattern:

> _"There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt."_ (Ecclesiastes 5:13)

How can possessions harm their owner? They create:

- **False security** that blinds us to spiritual need
- **Increased anxiety** over preservation and loss
- **Barriers to faith** that prevent wholehearted surrender
- **Eternal loss** when temporal gain becomes ultimate priority

[ILL] Consider a man who inherits a beautiful estate with fertile fields. But instead of farming the land and sharing its abundance, he locks the gates, hoards the seed, and spends his days counting what he has rather than cultivating what could be. The fields grow wild, the seed rots, and he dies alone amid plenty—having turned blessing into curse by his refusal to release what was never truly his.

### The Rich Young Ruler: A Case Study in Spiritual Tragedy

> _"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me. But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions."_ (Matthew 19:21-22)

This young man was moral, sincere, and earnest. He had kept the commandments from his youth. Yet Jesus, with divine perception, identified the idol in his heart. His wealth was not merely something he _had_—it was something he _was_. His identity, security, and hope were bound up in his possessions.

Notice the sequence Christ offered:

1. **Go** — Leave your current position
2. **Sell** — Release your grip on temporal things
3. **Give** — Transform earthly wealth into blessing for others
4. **Come** — Enter relationship with Christ
5. **Follow** — Live in daily dependence and obedience

The young man wanted eternal life on his own terms. He wanted Jesus _plus_ his wealth. But Christ demands absolute lordship. **There is no divided allegiance in the kingdom of God.**

> _"And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto His disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"_ (Mark 10:23)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "hardly" (_dyskolōs_) appears only here in the Gospels. It suggests something painfully difficult, like swallowing with a sore throat. Riches create a friction against faith that makes entrance into the kingdom genuinely arduous—not impossible (verse 27), but requiring supernatural intervention.

## Two Classes of Rich Men

Solomon presents a profound paradox:

> _"There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches."_ (Proverbs 13:7)

### The Rich Fool: Much Goods, Nothing Eternal

> _"The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully... And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater... And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee."_ (Luke 12:16-20)

Notice the pronouns: I, my, I, my, I, I, my, my. Twelve references to self in three sentences. This man's world had shrunk to the dimensions of his own interests. He made plans without consulting the Giver of life. He calculated years without considering eternity.

**The diagnosis:** _"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."_ (Luke 12:21)

**Being rich toward God** involves:

- Recognizing His ownership of all things
- Using resources for His glory and others' good
- Investing in eternal, not merely temporal, returns
- Living with eternity's values in view

### Those Who Make Themselves Poor Yet Have Great Riches

Moses exemplifies this second class:

> _"Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward."_ (Hebrews 11:26)

Moses had access to Egypt's wealth—the greatest empire on earth. Yet he chose identification with God's suffering people. He "made himself poor" by worldly standards, yet possessed what Egypt could never offer: relationship with the living God and an eternal inheritance.

[Q] **"How can reproach be 'greater riches'?"**

Moses operated with eternal accounting. He understood that temporary suffering with God's people outweighs permanent pleasure in sin (Hebrews 11:25). The reproach of Christ connects us to the Savior Himself, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross (Hebrews 12:2). What the world calls loss, heaven calls gain.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Truth in Wealth

The earthly sanctuary taught that **everything valuable must pass through the altar before it can serve God's purpose**. Gold, silver, and precious materials were consecrated before being used in sacred service. Similarly, our wealth must be laid on the altar—surrendered to God—before it can become truly useful in His kingdom.

In the Most Holy Place, the ark contained the law of God, including the tenth commandment: "Thou shalt not covet." Covetousness is the heart's rebellion against God's sovereignty. The investigative judgment examines not merely our outward actions but our heart's deepest loyalties. **What we treasure reveals whom we worship.**

### Righteousness by Faith and Material Possessions

The rich young ruler's tragedy illuminates the impossibility of self-salvation. He had done everything _he could do_—yet one thing remained beyond human effort: the surrender of the heart's idol. Only Christ can deliver us from the love of money. Only His indwelling Spirit can free us from the grip of materialism.

> _"The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it."_ (Proverbs 10:22)

True riches come not through grasping but through receiving God's blessing. This includes material provision received with thankfulness, but more importantly, spiritual wealth that cannot rust or be stolen: peace with God, assurance of salvation, the fruit of the Spirit, and eternal life.

> _"By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches, and honour, and life."_ (Proverbs 22:4)

Note the pathway: **humility** (acknowledging our dependence on God) and **the fear of the Lord** (reverent obedience to His will). These heart postures open the channel for true blessing.

### The Snare of Wanting to Be Rich

Paul identifies the root danger:

> _"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."_ (1 Timothy 6:9)

The phrase "will be rich" describes not mere possession but determined pursuit—those who have set their hearts on wealth acquisition. This desire becomes a snare, leading to a cascade of destructive consequences. The imagery of drowning suggests gradual submersion: the one ensnared does not perceive the danger until escape seems impossible.

[ILL] A bird sees grain scattered on the ground and thinks, "What abundance! What provision!" It does not see the net carefully laid beneath. Each grain enjoyed draws it further in, until the trap springs closed. So materialism scatters its glittering promises, and the soul that feeds on them finds itself imprisoned in "foolish and hurtful lusts."

### Wealth in the Day of Judgment

> _"Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath."_ (Zephaniah 1:18)

[DYK🔎] James's warning to rich oppressors uses startling imagery: "Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days" (James 5:2-3). Gold and silver do not literally rust—yet hoarded wealth undergoes spiritual corrosion. The very things trusted for security become evidence of misplaced priorities in the judgment.

When Christ returns, the currency of earth becomes worthless. No portfolio, property, or bank account will purchase a moment's standing before the Judge of all. **The only currency accepted in heaven is faith working by love** (Galatians 5:6).

## Practical Application

### The Charge to the Wealthy

Paul gives Timothy instructions for wealthy believers that provide a model for all who have material resources:

> _"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy."_ (1 Timothy 6:17)

**Three warnings:**

1. Don't be highminded (wealth does not make you superior)
2. Don't trust in uncertain riches (they cannot save or satisfy)
3. Don't forget God's generosity (He gives richly for enjoyment, not hoarding)

> _"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."_ (1 Timothy 6:18-19)

**Three commands:**

1. Do good actively (use wealth as a tool for blessing)
2. Be ready to distribute (hold possessions loosely)
3. Be willing to communicate (share generously with others)

This approach "lays up" treasure that endures—a foundation not for temporal security but for eternal life.

### True Riches Are Available to All

> _"Hearken, my beloved brethren: Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him?"_ (James 2:5)

The poor of this world can be **rich in faith**. Faith is the currency of heaven, and it is available to all regardless of economic status. Those who love God are heirs of His kingdom—an inheritance beyond calculation:

> _"For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside Thee, what He hath prepared for him that waiteth for Him."_ (Isaiah 64:4)

### Questions for Self-Examination

- Where do I find my security—in God's promises or in bank accounts?
- Could I give away my most valued possession if Christ asked?
- Does my use of money reflect that God is first in my life?
- Am I laying up treasure on earth or in heaven?
- Would I follow Christ if it meant financial loss?

## Appeal

> _"For a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."_ (Luke 12:15)

Friend, what you own does not define you. What owns you does.

The rich young ruler walked away from Jesus sorrowful, clutching possessions that would turn to dust. Moses walked away from Egypt's treasures rejoicing, gaining an eternal inheritance no thief could steal and no rust could corrupt.

Two paths lie before us: the way of grasping that leads to poverty, or the way of releasing that leads to true riches.

**Christ stands ready to receive whatever you place on His altar.** What you surrender, He transforms. What you cling to, you lose. Will you trust Him today with your finances, your possessions, your future? He who gave His life for you asks not for your wealth but for your heart. When He has your heart, everything else follows.

> _"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."_ (Matthew 6:19-21)

Where is your treasure today?
