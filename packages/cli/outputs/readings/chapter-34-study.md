### Q1. What testimony is borne concerning Christ's life on earth?

“Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.” (1 Peter 2:22)

**Answer:**

The Bible presents Jesus Christ as the absolute, spotless Lamb of God. To
understand the magnitude of this testimony, we must look closely at what
constitutes a “sinless life” and why it matters for our salvation.

1.  **The Definition of Sin:** Scripture defines sin as “the transgression of
    the law” (1 John 3:4). To say Christ did “no sin” means He lived in perfect
    harmony with the Ten Commandments, both in letter and in spirit. He loved
    God supremely and His neighbor as Himself.
2.  **Freedom from Guile:** The text notes there was no “guile” (deceit or
    hypocrisy) in His mouth. His outward life perfectly matched His inner
    purity. He was transparent, honest, and true.
3.  **The Sanctuary Type:** In the earthly sanctuary service, the lamb brought
    for a sin offering had to be “without blemish” (Leviticus 4:32). If the
    animal had a spot or defect, it could not atone for sin. Similarly, Christ,
    the Antitype, had to be morally perfect to offer Himself as a sacrifice for
    the world.
4.  **Righteousness by Faith:** Because Christ lived a sinless life, He has a
    perfect righteousness to offer us.
    - **Justification:** When we repent, God accepts Christ’s perfect life as if
      it were our own (2 Corinthians 5:21).
    - **Sanctification:** Christ does not merely cover our past; He imparts His
      sinless life to us by the Holy Spirit, empowering us to overcome as He
      overcame (Revelation 3:21).

- **Term Definition:**
  - **Guile:** Deceit, craftiness, or dishonesty.
  - **Type/Antitype:** A "type" is a symbol or shadow (like the lamb); the
    "antitype" is the reality to which it points (Christ).

[ILL] **The Perfect Mold:** Imagine a potter trying to make a perfect vase. If
the mold itself is cracked or misshapen, every vase produced from it will be
flawed. Adam, the first mold of humanity, became cracked by sin, and we are all
born with that flaw. Christ came as the "Second Adam" (1 Corinthians 15:45)—a
new, perfect mold. He lived without a single crack of sin. By faith, we are
"remolded" into His image.

### Q2. What is true of all other members of the human family?

“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)

**Answer:**

While Christ is unique in His sinlessness, the human condition is universally
marked by failure.

1.  **Universal Need:** There is no distinction; every human being (except
    Christ) has fallen into rebellion against God. We are not sinners merely
    because we commit sins; we commit sins because we are born separated from
    God, with a nature prone to selfishness (Psalm 51:5; Ephesians 2:3).
2.  **Falling Short of Glory:** The “glory of God” is His character (Exodus
    33:18–19; 34:6–7). Since the Law is a transcript of God’s character, to
    “come short of the glory” is to fail to reflect the righteousness required
    by the Law.
3.  **The Great Controversy:** This verse establishes the impossibility of
    self-salvation. Since _all_ have sinned, no human can redeem another. We are
    all bankrupt debtors. This highlights our desperate need for a Savior who
    stands outside the circle of condemnation—Jesus Christ.

- **Term Definition:**
  - **Glory of God:** In a moral sense, this refers to God's character of
    infinite love, justice, and holiness.

[ILL] **The Archer:** The word "sin" in the New Testament (_hamartia_) often
carries the meaning of "missing the mark." Imagine a line of archers trying to
hit a target that represents God's perfect Law. Some may shoot further than
others (moral people vs. criminals), but _all_ fall short of the target. The
arrow that falls one inch short is just as useless as the one that falls ten
yards short. Only Christ hit the bullseye, and He offers to credit His perfect
score to us.

### Q3. With what question did Christ challenge His enemies?

“Which of you convinceth Me of sin?” (John 8:46)

**Answer:**

This challenge is one of the most remarkable statements in history. It
demonstrates Christ’s absolute confidence in His relationship with the Father.

1.  **Public Scrutiny:** Jesus lived His life in the open. He was watched by the
    Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the common people. His enemies were desperate
    to find a legal reason to condemn Him, yet when challenged, they could not
    name a single sin.
2.  **The Testimony of Enemies:** Even Judas, who betrayed Him, confessed, “I
    have betrayed the innocent blood” (Matthew 27:4). Pilate declared, “I find
    in him no fault at all” (John 18:38).
3.  **The Foundation of Faith:** If Jesus had sinned even once, He would have
    needed a Savior Himself. He would have died for His own sins (Ezekiel
    18:20). The fact that He could issue this challenge—and remain
    unanswered—proves He is the qualified Redeemer.

[ILL] **The Diamond:** If you claim to have a flawless diamond, you are not
afraid to hand it to a jeweler with a magnifying glass. Jesus offered His life
to the magnifying glass of His critics. They looked for flaws—pride,
selfishness, impatience—but found only the pure light of God’s love.

### Q4. To what extent was Christ tempted?

“[He] was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.” (Hebrews 4:15)

**Answer:**

To save us, Christ had to meet the enemy on the battlefield where Adam fell and
where we struggle daily.

1.  **Reality of Temptation:** Christ’s temptations were not make-believe. He
    felt the pull of hunger, the sting of rejection, and the pressure to use His
    divine power for selfish relief. He felt the full weight of the struggle,
    yet His will never consented to sin.
2.  **"In All Points":** This does not mean He faced every specific modern
    scenario (e.g., internet addiction), but He faced every _category_ of
    temptation:
    - The lust of the flesh (appetite/passion).
    - The lust of the eyes (presumption/vanity).
    - The pride of life (love of power/self-exaltation). _(See Matthew 4:1–11; 1
      John 2:16)._
3.  **Yet Without Sin:** Temptation itself is not sin. Sin is the act of the
    will consenting to the temptation (James 1:14–15). Jesus proved that a human
    being, connected to God, can be tempted and yet remain obedient.
4.  **Hope for the Believer:** Because He conquered temptation in human flesh,
    He can give us victory. He is a sympathetic High Priest who knows our
    weakness but offers His strength.

[ILL] **The Fortress:** A fortress that has never been attacked doesn't know its
own strength. A fortress that surrenders at the first shot doesn't know the
pressure of a siege. Only the fortress that is attacked with full force and
_never surrenders_ knows the full weight of the battle. We often give in to
temptation early; Christ bore the full pressure of every temptation and never
broke. He knows the weight of the burden better than we do.

### Q5. In His humanity, of what nature did Christ partake?

“Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also
Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him
that had the power of death, that is, the devil.” (Hebrews 2:14)

**Answer:**

This verse teaches the reality of the **Incarnation**—God becoming man.

1.  **Partaking of the Same:** Christ did not take on the nature of angels or of
    unfallen Adam. He took part of the “same” flesh and blood as the “children”
    (us). He entered into the human family with all the hereditary weaknesses
    brought about by four thousand years of sin, yet He did not sin.
2.  **Destroying the Power of Death:** By living a perfect life in human flesh
    and dying a sacrificial death, Christ broke Satan’s claim over humanity.
    Satan claimed that God’s law could not be kept by human beings. Jesus proved
    him a liar.
3.  **The Path of Victory:** Christ conquered Satan not by using His divine
    omnipotence to blast him away, but by using the weapons available to
    humanity: faith, the Word of God, and prayer.

- **Term Definition:**
  - **Incarnation:** The act of the Son of God taking on human nature (flesh) to
    become Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man (John 1:14).

[ILL] **The Rescue Swimmer:** To save a drowning man, a lifeguard cannot stay
dry on the boat. He must dive into the same cold, dark water the victim is in.
He must feel the same currents. Jesus dove into the deep waters of our humanity
to pull us out. He took our nature so He could take our place.

### Q6. How fully did Christ share our common humanity?

“Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren, that
He might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to
make reconciliation for the sins of the people.” (Verse 17)

**Answer:**

1.  **"Like Unto His Brethren":** The Bible emphasizes the closeness of Christ’s
    identification with us. He is not ashamed to call us brethren (Hebrews
    2:11). He accepted the limitations of humanity—He got tired, thirsty,
    hungry, and sorrowful.
2.  **Qualifying as High Priest:** In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ ministers
    on our behalf. To be a faithful High Priest, He must understand the people
    He represents. Because He has walked in our shoes, He can plead for us with
    perfect empathy.
3.  **Reconciliation:** This word implies restoring peace between two estranged
    parties. Christ bridges the gap between a holy God and sinful man because He
    is _both_. He lays one hand on the throne of God and the other on humanity,
    bringing them together.

- **Term Definition:**
  - **High Priest:** The mediator between God and man. In the Old Testament, the
    high priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year to make atonement.
    Christ is our High Priest in heaven now (Hebrews 8:1–2).
  - **Reconciliation:** The restoration of friendly relations; making peace.

### Q7. Where did God, in Christ, condemn sin, and gain the victory for us over temptation and sin?

“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin
in the flesh.” (Romans 8:3)

**Answer:**

This is one of the most powerful verses regarding Righteousness by Faith.

1.  **The Weakness of the Law:** The Law is holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12),
    but it is "weak" in that it cannot justify a sinner nor empower a sinner to
    obey. It acts as a mirror—it reveals dirt, but cannot wash it off. The
    weakness lies in _our_ flesh, which cannot submit to the law (Romans 8:7)
    without divine aid.
2.  **Likeness of Sinful Flesh:** Christ took upon Himself our nature—the nature
    that had been degraded by sin—but He did not partake of its sinfulness in
    character. He entered the enemy's territory.
3.  **Condemned Sin in the Flesh:** By living a perfect, holy life _in the same
    kind of flesh that we have_, Jesus condemned sin. He proved that sin is not
    a necessity of human nature. He demonstrated that humanity, when united with
    Divinity, can keep God’s law.
4.  **The Victory:** Christ didn't just defeat sin in heaven; He defeated it _in
    the flesh_—on our turf. This assures us that "the righteousness of the law
    might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
    Spirit" (Romans 8:4).

[ILL] **The Invader:** Imagine a deadly virus (sin) has infected a city
(humanity/flesh). A great physician (Christ) enters the city and exposes himself
to the infected environment. However, his immune system is so strong that he
generates antibodies that destroy the virus within his own body. He then offers
those antibodies (his Spirit/Grace) to everyone in the city. He conquered the
virus _in the city_, not from outside it.

### Q8. By whose power did Christ live the perfect life?

“I can of Mine own self do nothing.” (John 5:30) “The words that I speak unto
you I speak not of Myself: but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doth the
works.” (John 14:10)

**Answer:**

This reveals the secret of Christ’s victory and the model for our own Christian
life.

1.  **Dependence, Not Independence:** Though Christ was God, He laid aside the
    independent use of His divine attributes while on earth (Philippians 2:5–7).
    He did not use His divinity to make His human life easier. He lived as a
    man, totally dependent on the Father for wisdom, power, and strength.
2.  **The Channel of Power:** Christ was the vessel; the Father was the source.
    Through prayer and the Word, Jesus remained in constant communion with
    heaven.
3.  **Our Example:** This is the heart of **Righteousness by Faith**. We are not
    called to overcome sin by our own grit or willpower. We are called to depend
    on Christ just as He depended on the Father.
    - “Without Me ye can do nothing” (John 15:5).
    - “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me” (Philippians
      4:13).

[ILL] **The Glove:** A glove has no power to pick up a Bible or turn a page. It
is lifeless on its own. But when a living hand fills the glove, it can do work.
Jesus, in His humanity, allowed the Father to "fill the glove" perfectly. Now,
He asks us to be the glove and let _Him_ be the hand living in us.

### Q9. What unselfish purpose did Jesus ever have before Him?

“For I came down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that
sent Me.” (John 6:38)

**Answer:**

The essence of sin is selfishness—placing "my will" above God's. The essence of
righteousness is love—surrendering "my will" to God's.

1.  **The Battle of the Will:** Christ’s entire life was a submission of His
    human will to the divine purpose. This culminated in Gethsemane: “Not my
    will, but thine, be done” (Luke 22:42).
2.  **Service to Others:** Because He sought only the Father's will, Jesus lived
    entirely for others. "Even Christ pleased not Himself" (Romans 15:3).
3.  **Practical Application:** True conversion is the surrender of the will.
    When we stop asking, "What do I want?" and start asking, "Lord, what wilt
    thou have me to do?" (Acts 9:6), we begin to walk in the footsteps of Jesus.
    This surrender is the gateway to the sinless life He offers to impart to us.

- **Term Definition:**
  - **Sanctification:** The daily process of dying to self-will and living to
    God's will, resulting in a character that reflects Jesus.

[ILL] **The Ambassador:** An ambassador in a foreign land does not speak his own
opinions or pursue his own business deals. He speaks only what his King tells
him to speak. If he acts on his own, he ceases to be a true representative.
Jesus was the faithful Ambassador of Heaven, perfectly representing the Father's
character to a lost world.
