## Slide 1 – Q1: The First Promise

- **Question:** Where, in the Bible, is given the first promise of the Saviour
  from sin?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 3:14, 15 – “And the Lord said unto the serpent,... I
  will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed;
  it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Gift of Enmity

- **The Protoevangelium:** This verse is the "First Gospel," given before Adam
  and Eve were expelled from Eden to keep them from despair.
- **The Gift of Enmity:**
  - God promises to "put enmity" (hostility) between the serpent and the woman.
  - By nature, we are at peace with Satan and at war with God.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **A Supernatural Work:** This enmity against sin is a gift of grace. It is the
  first work of the Holy Spirit to make sin repulsive to us. Without this, we
  would be content captives of the devil.

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Two Seeds and Victory

- **The Two Seeds:**
  - The "seed of the serpent" refers to those who cling to sin.
  - The "Seed of the woman" refers to Christ and His people.
- **The Crushed Head:**
  - Satan would "bruise the heel" of Christ (suffering and death at the cross).
  - Christ would crush the serpent's head, destroying the power of death.
  - Hebrews 2:14 – “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
    blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
    might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Snakebite:** Imagine a person bitten by a venomous snake, drifting into
  a deadly sleep. They have no power to resist.
- **The Physician's Role:** A physician arrives not only to give the antidote
  but to wake the patient and give them a hatred for the snake.
- **Spiritual Application:** Without God "putting enmity" in our hearts, we
  would sleep the sleep of eternal death. This enmity is the beginning of our
  fight for holiness.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Line of Restoration

- **Question:** Through whose descendant was the promised restoration to come
  through?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 13:15 – “To thee [Abraham] will I give it, and to thy
  seed for ever.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: The Abrahamic Covenant

- **The Covenant:** A solemn agreement where God promised Abraham land and a
  Seed through whom all nations would be blessed.
- **Restoration:** This was not just about earthly Canaan, but the restoration
  of the earth from sin.
  - Hebrews 11:10 – “For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose
    builder and maker is God.”
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Abraham is the father of the faithful. We
  participate in this promise by faith, not just lineage.
  - Genesis 15:6 – “And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
    righteousness.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Identifying the Seed

- **Question:** Who was this promised seed?
- **Key Text:** Galatians 3:16 – “He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as
  of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Union with Christ

- **Christ the Center:** The ultimate fulfillment of the covenant is one Person:
  Jesus Christ. All God’s promises are "Yes" in Him (2 Corinthians 1:20).
- **Our Connection:** We become heirs only by being connected to Christ.
  - Galatians 3:29 – “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and
    heirs according to the promise.”
- **Application:** We cannot claim victory or eternal life apart from a vital,
  living connection with Jesus. His life in us constitutes us as the "seed."

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Place of Birth

- **Question:** What town was predicted to be the birthplace of the Christ?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 2:4-6 – “And,.. he [Herod] demanded of them where Christ
  should be born. And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea.” (See Micah
  5:2.)

## Slide 10 – Q4: Bethlehem's Significance

- **Bread of Life:** _Bethlehem_ means "House of Bread."
  - John 6:35 – “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
    cometh to me shall never hunger...”
- **God's Humility:**
  - Micah 5:2 notes Bethlehem was "little among the thousands of Judah."
  - God bypassed centers of power (Rome, Jerusalem) to reveal His glory in a
    stable.
  - True greatness is found in self-sacrificing love, not outward display.

## Slide 11 – Q5: The Virgin Birth

- **Question:** Of whom was Christ to be born?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 7:14 – “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,
  and shall call his name Immanuel.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Incarnation

- **The Incarnation:** The Son of God took on human flesh (John 1:14). He was
  not a new personality created at conception, but the eternal Son entering
  humanity.
- **The Second Adam:** 1 Corinthians 15:47 – “The first man is of the earth,
  earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.”
- **Immanuel (God with Us):**
  - He is with us in our nature and temptations (Hebrews 2:14; 4:15).
  - He is with us to empower obedience.
  - God did not send a subordinate; He came Himself.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Cliff Rescue:** If a man sees a friend drowning in a raging sea below a
  cliff, shouting instructions is useless.
- **Diving In:** The rescuer must dive into the very element drowning his friend
  to save him.
- **Christ's Act:** Christ dove into humanity to rescue us from the ocean of
  sin.

## Slide 14 – Q6: The Name of Jesus

- **Question:** What name was Joseph told to give the promised Son when He was
  born?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 1:21 – “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt
  call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their sins.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Saved FROM Sin

- **Meaning:** _Jesus_ means "Jehovah is Salvation."
- **From, Not In:** He saves His people _from_ their sins, not _in_ them.
  - 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
    is the transgression of the law.”
  - To be saved _in_ sin would mean to be saved while still rebelling against
    God.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Justification and Sanctification

- **The Full Scope of Salvation:**
  - **Justification:** Saves from the _penalty_ of sin (guilt) through His
    death.
  - **Sanctification:** Saves from the _power_ of sin (dominion) through His
    indwelling life.
  - **Glorification:** Will save from the _presence_ of sin at His coming.
- **The Promise:** If we submit, He _shall_ save us. We come to Jesus to be
  delivered from sin, not after we have overcome it.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Leper:** A doctor does not tell a leper, "I declare you healthy," while
  leaving the disease to rot the flesh.
- **The True Cure:** A true savior cures the disease.
- **Application:** Jesus does not merely cover sin with a legal fiction; He
  provides the remedy that heals the heart and restores obedience.

## Slide 18 – Q7: The Angel's Message

- **Question:** At His birth, what message did the angel bring to the shepherds
  abiding in the field?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:10, 11 – “And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for,
  behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
  For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ
  the Lord.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: The Gospel and the Sanctuary

- **Universal Good News:** The "good tidings" (Gospel) are for "all
  people"—whosoever will (Revelation 22:17).
- **Christ the Lord:** He is both Messiah (Anointed One) and Divine Ruler.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The shepherds were likely watching flocks destined for temple sacrifices.
  - The Type (sheep) met the Antitype (Lamb of God).
  - John 1:29 – “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
    world.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: The Song of the Angels

- **Question:** What was the song of praise that the host of angels sang that
  night?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:13, 14 – “And suddenly there was with the angel a
  multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the
  highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Results of Redemption

- **Glory to God:** The plan of salvation vindicates God's character against
  Satan's accusations. The cross proves God is love.
- **Peace on Earth:** Sin separates; Christ reconciles.
  - Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
    through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
- **Good Will:** God does not hate the sinner.
  - 2 Peter 3:9 – “The Lord... is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
    should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Isaiah's Prophecy Fulfilled

- **Question:** What important prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled when Christ was
  born?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 9:6 – “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
  given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Government of Life

- **Dual Nature:** A "child born" (humanity) and a "son given" (divinity).
- **Surrender:** The government must be upon _His_ shoulder. This is a test of
  faith: are we carrying our own lives, or letting Him rule?
- **The Exchange:** When He takes the government of our lives, He takes the
  weight of our care and guilt.
  - Matthew 11:30 – “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: His Descriptive Names

- **Question:** What descriptive names did Isaiah give to Him?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 9:6, 7 – “And His name shall be called Wonderful,
  Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of
  the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: The All-Sufficient Saviour

- **Wonderful:** Beyond human comprehension; the mystery of godliness.
- **Counsellor:** Our Advocate in judgment, possessing wisdom for the weary
  (Isaiah 50:4).
- **Mighty God / Everlasting Father:** Proof of His absolute Deity.
  - John 10:30 – “I and my Father are one.”
  - Only One equal with the Lawgiver could redeem the transgressor.
- **Prince of Peace:** The only source of peace for a troubled conscience.

## Slide 26 – Q11: Simeon's Blessing

- **Question:** What did the godly Simeon say when he saw Jesus?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:29-32 – “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
  peace... for mine eyes have seen thy salvation... a light to lighten the
  Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Seeing Salvation

- **Salvation is a Person:** Simeon said, "Mine eyes have seen thy salvation."
  It is not a theory, but knowing Jesus.
- **Light to Gentiles:** Israel was meant to be a light to the world, not a
  closed reservoir.
- **Made Under the Law:** Jesus was presented according to the law.
  - Galatians 4:4-5 – “But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth
    his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them that were under
    the law...”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Anna's Witness

- **Question:** Upon seeing Jesus, what were the words of the aged prophetess
  Anna?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:38 – “And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise
  unto the Lord, and spake of Him to all them that looked for redemption in
  Jerusalem.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: Redemption and Evangelism

- **Redemption:** Means "to buy back" or "ransom."
  - 1 Peter 1:18-19 – “Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things... But with
    the precious blood of Christ...”
- **Witnessing:** As soon as she saw Him, she "spake of Him to all."
  - You cannot behold Christ and remain silent.
  - A genuine experience with Jesus always leads to witnessing.

## Slide 30 – Q13: The Wise Men

- **Question:** What did the Wise Men from the East do when they had found
  Jesus?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 2:11 – “When they were come into the house, they saw the
  young child with Mary His mother, and fell down, and worshipped Him: and when
  they had opened their treasures, they presented unto Him gifts; gold, and
  frankincense, and myrrh.”

## Slide 31 – Q13: Worship and Gifts

- **Worship:** They fell down. Recognizing Christ's divinity humbles the heart.
- **Prophetic Gifts:**
  - **Gold:** Tribute to a King; faith "tried in the fire" (Revelation 3:18).
  - **Frankincense:** Sanctuary incense; fragrance of Christ's righteousness and
    prayer.
  - **Myrrh:** Bitter herb for embalming; pointing to His suffering and death.
- **Giving:** True faith is not empty-handed; we pledge our resources to His
  service.

## Slide 32 – Q14: Flight to Egypt

- **Question:** Why did Joseph flee to Egypt with Jesus and His mother?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 2:13 – “...Arise, and take the young child and His
  mother, and flee into Egypt... for Herod will seek the young child to destroy
  Him.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Conflict and Guidance

- **Divine Guidance:** God speaks to those who listen. Joseph’s prompt obedience
  saved the Child.
- **The Great Controversy:** Behind Herod’s jealousy was Satan’s malice. The
  enemy sought to stop the Kingdom of light.
- **The New Israel:** This fulfilled Hosea 11:1 ("Out of Egypt have I called my
  son"). Christ succeeded where Israel had failed.

## Slide 34 – Q15: The Dragon's Rage

- **Question:** How does John the revelator describe this satanic urge to
  destroy Christ?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 12:4 – “And the dragon stood before the woman which
  was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.”

## Slide 35 – Q15: Spiritual Warfare

- **The Dragon:** Represents Satan, working through the earthly power of Pagan
  Rome (Herod).
- **The Urge to Destroy:** Satan hates Christ.
- **Application:** When "Christ is formed in you" (Galatians 4:19), the dragon
  attempts to destroy that new spiritual life through temptation or persecution.

## Slide 36 – Q16: Herod's Cruelty

- **Question:** By what means did Herod seek to kill Jesus?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 2:16 – “Then Herod... sent forth, and slew all the
  children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years
  old and under.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Two Kingdoms

- **The Fruit of Self:** Herod represents the "self" principle. When self is
  king, it will kill to maintain control.
- **The Contrast:**
  - Herod killed others to save his earthly throne.
  - Christ died Himself to save others for a heavenly throne.
  - The world operates on force; Christ's kingdom operates on self-sacrificing
    love.

## Slide 38 – Q17: The Move to Nazareth

- **Question:** After Herod's death, to what town did Joseph and his family
  move?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 2:23 – “And He came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth:
  that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
  called a Nazarene.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Humility and Preparation

- **Condescension:** Nazareth was despised (John 1:46), yet the Creator lived
  there in poverty and toil. He dignified labor.
- **Divine Education:**
  - He did not attend rabbinical schools.
  - He learned from God's word, nature, and daily duties.
  - We do not need worldly acclaim or high position to be close to God.

## Slide 40 – Q18: Christ's Early Life

- **Question:** How does the Bible describe the early life of Jesus?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Luke 2:40 – “And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
    wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.”
  - Luke 2:51 – “And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was
    subject unto them.”

## Slide 41 – Q18: A Life of Sanctification

- **Subject to Parents:** The Commander of heaven obeyed His earthly parents,
  keeping the Fifth Commandment perfectly.
- **Perfect Development:**
  - Jesus _lived_ for us, weaving a robe of righteousness for children and
    youth.
  - He knows our temptations and can help us (Hebrews 2:18).
- **Imparted Grace:** Because He overcame in the home, He can impart that same
  spirit of obedience to us.

## Slide 42 – Q18: Illustration

- **The Writing Lesson:** A child trying to write a letter may make a mess of
  the ink and paper.
- **The Father's Hand:** The father takes the child's hand in his own and guides
  the pen to form perfect letters.
- **Application:** Christ's life on earth allows Him to guide our hands in
  writing a life of obedience.

## Slide 43 – Q19: Losing Jesus

- **Question:** At the Feast in Jerusalem, how did Joseph and Mary lose Jesus
  when He was twelve years old?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:44-45 – “But they, supposing Him to have been in the
  company, went a day's journey... and when they found him not, they turned back
  again to Jerusalem, seeking Him.”

## Slide 44 – Q19: Losing His Presence

- **Supposition:** They "supposed" He was in the company while they engaged in
  social talk.
- **Application:** We can lose the sense of Christ's presence by becoming
  absorbed in worldly business or careless conversation, even while in the
  "company" of the church.
- **The Remedy:** We must retrace our steps to where we lost Him—usually through
  neglect of prayer—and seek Him with all our hearts.

## Slide 45 – Q20: Finding Jesus

- **Question:** What was Jesus doing when they later found Him?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:46 – “And it came to pass, that after three days they
  found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing
  them, and asking them questions.”

## Slide 46 – Q20: The Father's Business

- **In the Temple:** They found Him in the Sanctuary, focused on spiritual
  things.
- **"About My Father's Business"** (Luke 2:49): Even at twelve, Jesus understood
  His mission.
- **Sanctuary Application:** Jesus is always found in connection with Sanctuary
  work. To find Him today, we look by faith to the Heavenly Sanctuary where He
  ministers as High Priest (Hebrews 8:1-2).

## Slide 47 – Q21: Impact on Leaders

- **Question:** What impact did His questions and answers have upon the
  spiritual leaders of Israel?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:47 – “And all that heard Him were astonished at His
  understanding and answers.”

## Slide 48 – Q21: True Wisdom vs. Tradition

- **Freshness of Truth:** The leaders were used to dry traditions. Jesus spoke
  from a heart in tune with God.
- **Depth of Law:** He showed the spiritual depth of the Law—that it is a law of
  love.
- **Spiritual Pride:** Had the leaders been humble, this Light would have saved
  them. Spiritual pride often blinds us to simple truth.

## Slide 49 – Q22: Summary of Growth

- **Question:** How does Scripture summarize Christ's childhood and youth?
- **Key Text:** Luke 2:52 – “And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in
  favour with God and man.”

## Slide 50 – Q22: Application – Righteousness by Faith

- **A Balanced Life:**
  - **Wisdom:** Intellectual/spiritual growth.
  - **Stature:** Physical health (body as temple).
  - **Favour with God:** Spiritual communion.
  - **Favour with Man:** Social grace and kindness.
- **The Exchange:** This perfect life is what God offers to credit to our
  account (**Justification**) and reproduce in us by His Spirit
  (**Sanctification**).
- **Beholding Him:** 2 Corinthians 3:18 – “But we all... beholding as in a glass
  the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory...”
