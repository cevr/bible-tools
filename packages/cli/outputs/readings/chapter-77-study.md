# Reading 77: Magnified by Christ

## Introduction

The law of God stands at the center of the great controversy between Christ and Satan. While the enemy has worked throughout history to abolish, diminish, or pervert God's commandments, Christ came not to destroy but to magnify the law and make it honorable. This study reveals how Jesus, in both His life and death, demonstrated the eternal nature, spiritual depth, and unchangeable authority of His Father's law—and what this means for those who would follow Him today.

## Core Truths

### God's Purpose for His Law

The prophet Isaiah reveals the divine intention concerning God's law:

> _"The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable."_ (Isaiah 42:21)

**Magnify** means to enlarge, to show the greatness of, to reveal in fuller dimensions. God purposed that His law would not be seen as a mere list of prohibitions, but as a glorious revelation of His own righteous character—worthy of honor and admiration.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "magnify" (_gadal_) is the same word used when Scripture speaks of magnifying the Lord Himself (Psalm 34:3). To magnify God's law is to magnify the Lawgiver, for the law is a transcript of His character.

### Why Magnification Was Necessary

The psalmist reveals the urgent need:

> _"It is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law."_ (Psalm 119:126)

Throughout history, men have attempted to make God's law "void"—emptied of its true meaning, stripped of its binding authority, buried under human tradition. By the time Christ walked the earth, the religious leaders had so overlaid the commandments with their own additions and interpretations that the law's true character was obscured.

Jesus confronted this directly:

> _"Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition."_ (Mark 7:9)

The Pharisees had created elaborate systems of human rules while nullifying the very commandments they claimed to uphold. They honored God with their lips while their hearts were far from Him (Matthew 15:8).

## Deeper Truths

### Christ's Mission: Not to Destroy, but to Fulfill

Jesus spoke plainly about His relationship to the law:

> _"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."_ (Matthew 5:17)

**Fulfil** (_pleroo_ in Greek) means to fill up, to complete, to bring to full expression. Christ did not come to empty the law of its meaning but to fill it with its fullest significance—to demonstrate what perfect obedience looks like when lived out in human flesh.

[Q] **"Doesn't 'fulfill' mean Christ ended the law so we don't need to keep it?"**

This interpretation contradicts Christ's own words in the very next verse: _"Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled"_ (Matthew 5:18). Heaven and earth have not passed away. Christ fulfilled the law by perfectly obeying it and by revealing its deepest spiritual meaning—not by abolishing it. If fulfilling meant abolishing, then Christ also "abolished" the prophets, which no one believes.

### The Spiritual Depth of the Commandments

Jesus proceeded to magnify the law by revealing its spiritual breadth and depth. The religious leaders had reduced the commandments to mere external compliance. Christ showed that God's law reaches to the thoughts and intents of the heart.

**The Sixth Commandment Magnified:**

> _"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment."_ (Matthew 5:21-22)

The apostle John later confirmed: _"Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer"_ (1 John 3:15). Murder begins in the heart with hatred, anger, and contempt. The law condemns not merely the act but the root.

**The Seventh Commandment Magnified:**

> _"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."_ (Matthew 5:27-28)

[ILL] Consider a tree with diseased roots. A gardener might prune the visible dead branches, but the tree remains sick at its core. The Pharisees were religious pruners—trimming external behavior while ignoring the corrupt heart beneath. Christ, the Divine Physician, addresses the root: the thoughts, desires, and affections. He came not merely to restrain the hand from sin, but to cleanse the heart that produces sin.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law Cannot Be Abolished

Paul's reasoning is profound:

> _"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression."_ (Romans 4:15)

If God could simply abolish His law, there would be no more sin, no condemnation, no need for a Savior. Satan has argued from the beginning that God's law is arbitrary, impossible to keep, and should be set aside. If this were true, God could have abolished the law in Eden and spared His Son the cross.

But the law is a transcript of God's eternal, unchanging character. To abolish the law would be to change God Himself. The wages of sin is death because sin is contrary to the very nature of the God who is life.

[DYK🔎] The word "jot" refers to the smallest Hebrew letter (yod), and "tittle" refers to the tiny marks distinguishing one Hebrew letter from another. Christ taught that even the smallest details of God's law would endure as long as heaven and earth exist.

### Christ's Perfect Obedience

Jesus testified of His own life:

> _"I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love."_ (John 15:10)

In His humanity, Christ demonstrated that the law of God can be kept through divine power. He lived a sinless life—not by setting aside the law, but by perfectly fulfilling it. His life is both our example and our hope.

### The Law Magnified in Christ's Death

> _"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:3-4)

The law could not save us—not because of any defect in the law, but because of weakness in our sinful flesh. We had broken the law, and the law justly condemned us. The law demanded death for transgression.

> _"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."_ (Romans 5:6)

Christ bore the curse of the law in our place: _"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us"_ (Galatians 3:13). The fact that the law could curse even the Son of God demonstrates its enduring authority and unchangeable nature. The law that demanded Christ's death did not die with Him—it was magnified by His death.

[ILL] A judge's son is brought before the court, guilty of a great crime. The law demands a heavy penalty. If the judge sets aside the law for his son, he is unjust and the law is dishonored. But if the judge upholds the law and then steps down from the bench to pay the penalty himself, both the law and mercy are magnified. So God in Christ upheld His law's righteous demands while providing the way of salvation for guilty sinners. The cross declares that the law is so holy it cannot be set aside, and that God's love is so great He would rather die than let us perish under its condemnation.

### Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the Ten Commandments were placed within the ark of the covenant in the Most Holy Place, beneath the mercy seat (Exodus 25:21-22). This arrangement beautifully illustrates the gospel:

- **The law** reveals sin and condemns the transgressor
- **The mercy seat** (sprinkled with blood) covers the law and provides atonement
- **The Shekinah glory** above the mercy seat represents God's presence dwelling with His people in mercy

In Christ's heavenly ministry, He stands before the Father as our Advocate, His blood speaking mercy while the law remains unchanged. The investigative judgment now taking place examines whether we have, by faith in Christ, experienced the righteousness of the law fulfilled in us (Romans 8:4).

## Practical Application

This truth calls us to:

### 1. **Examine Our Hearts**

Christ's magnification of the law reveals that external conformity is not enough. Are there seeds of anger, lust, covetousness, or pride in our hearts? The law is spiritual (Romans 7:14), and God looks upon the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).

### 2. **Abandon Self-Righteousness**

The Pharisees thought they kept the law while they had "made it void" through their traditions and superficial compliance. We must not trust in our own righteousness but in Christ alone.

### 3. **Receive Christ's Righteousness**

> _"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:4)

God's purpose is not merely to forgive us but to transform us—to write His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10). Through the indwelling Spirit, the same life that kept the law perfectly in Jesus can keep it in us. This is not human effort but Christ living in us (Galatians 2:20).

### 4. **Honor the Whole Law**

If Christ magnified the law rather than abolishing it, we must honor all ten commandments—including the fourth, which commands the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath. The same Jesus who revealed the spiritual depth of the sixth and seventh commandments also said, _"The sabbath was made for man"_ (Mark 2:27) and kept it Himself throughout His life (Luke 4:16).

## Appeal

> _"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."_ (Matthew 5:18)

Dear friend, the law of God stands forever. It reveals both our need and God's character. Christ came not to lower its standard but to lift us up to meet it—not in our own strength, but by His indwelling life.

Will you come to Jesus today, not as one who seeks to abolish His Father's commandments, but as one who loves them because they reveal the heart of God? Will you invite Him to write His law upon your heart, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in you?

The same Christ who magnified the law in His life and death offers to live out that same obedient life in you. _"I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me"_ (Philippians 4:13). Trust Him. Surrender to Him. Let His law become your delight, and His righteousness your covering.
