# Bible Study: The Sabbath and the Attempt to Change God's Law

## Introduction

Among the most solemn warnings in Bible prophecy is the foretelling of a power that would "think to change times and laws"—the very law of the eternal God. This study examines the prophetic identification of this power, its attempt to alter God's Sabbath commandment, and what this means for faithful believers in earth's final hours.

## Core Truths

### The Prophetic Prediction

The prophet Daniel, writing over 500 years before Christ, identified a religious-political power that would arise from the fragmented Roman Empire and work directly against God's authority:

> _"And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."_ (Daniel 7:25)

Notice the three-fold work of this power:

- **Speaking against God** — claiming divine prerogatives
- **Persecuting God's people** — "wearing out" the saints through centuries of oppression
- **Attempting to change God's law** — specifically "times and laws"

[DYK🔎] The Aramaic word translated "think" in Daniel 7:25 (_sebar_) carries the sense of "intend" or "purpose"—indicating deliberate, calculated action rather than accidental change.

### Paul's Parallel Warning

The apostle Paul, writing to the Thessalonians, amplified Daniel's prophecy with striking detail:

> _"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."_ (2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4)

This "man of sin" would not merely oppose God but **exalt himself above God**—a claim so audacious it demands careful examination.

## Deeper Truths

### How Can Any Power Exalt Itself Above God?

[Q] **"How could any earthly power possibly exalt itself above the Almighty Creator?"**

This is a penetrating question. Consider: a religious authority might institute countless ceremonies and demand strict obedience to them. Yet as long as the people also feel obligated to obey God's commandments, that power remains at most _equal_ with God—not above Him.

The only way to truly exalt oneself **above** God is to:

1. **Change some portion of God's law**
2. **Require obedience to the changed law instead of God's original**
3. **Claim the authority to make such changes**

When people obey a human institution's altered law while setting aside God's plain commandment, they effectively place that institution's authority above God's authority—whether they realize it or not.

### The Sabbath: God's Seal of Authority

Why would the prophesied power target the Sabbath specifically? Because the fourth commandment contains God's seal of authority:

> _"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God... For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."_ (Exodus 20:8-11)

The Sabbath identifies:

- **God's name**: "The LORD thy God"
- **God's title**: Creator ("made heaven and earth")
- **God's territory**: "Heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is"

[DYK🔎] In ancient times, a king's seal contained three elements: his name, his title, and his dominion. The Sabbath commandment alone among the ten contains all three elements identifying Jehovah's authority as Creator and Sovereign of the universe.

### The Testimony of History

The startling admission comes not from Protestant accusation but from Catholic sources themselves. The _Doctrinal Catechism_ records this remarkable exchange:

**Question**: "Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept?"

**Answer**: "Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her—she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, **a change for which there is no scriptural authority**."

[ILL] Imagine a trusted steward in a king's household who, during the king's absence, alters the king's written instructions and then commands the servants to follow the altered version. When questioned, the steward openly admits: "My authority to change the king's orders is proved by the fact that you all obey my changes!" Would this justify the steward—or condemn him? And what of the servants who knowingly obey the altered instructions when they have access to the king's original document?

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Central Issue: Authority

The great controversy between Christ and Satan has always centered on one fundamental question: **Whose authority will be obeyed?**

In Eden, Satan's temptation challenged God's word: "Hath God said?" (Genesis 3:1). The serpent suggested that God's command could be modified, reinterpreted, or set aside.

In these last days, the same battle rages. The Sabbath becomes the testing truth precisely because it answers the question: Will I obey God's explicit command, or will I follow human tradition?

> _"In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."_ (Matthew 15:9)

### Sanctuary Connection

In the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ now ministers as our High Priest, stands the ark containing the ten commandments—the foundation of God's government (Revelation 11:19). The law that the earthly power has "thought to change" remains unchanged in heaven.

During the investigative judgment, now taking place, each case is measured against this unchanging standard:

> _"Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."_ (Revelation 14:7)

This first angel's message echoes the very language of the fourth commandment, calling the world back to worship of the Creator on His appointed day.

### Righteousness by Faith and Sabbath Keeping

[Q] **"Doesn't keeping the Sabbath make salvation a matter of works rather than faith?"**

Never! True Sabbath keeping flows from a heart made new by Christ. We do not keep the Sabbath to _earn_ salvation—that is impossible (Ephesians 2:8-9). Rather, we keep it because:

1. **We love God and desire to obey Him** (John 14:15)
2. **Christ's righteousness within us produces obedience** (Philippians 2:13)
3. **The Sabbath is a sign of sanctification**—God's work in us, not our work for Him (Ezekiel 20:12)

The Sabbath is not our work for God; it is our rest in His completed work—both creation and redemption. We cease from our labors as God ceased from His, trusting wholly in Christ's merits rather than our own efforts.

## Practical Application

This prophetic truth calls us to:

### 1. Search the Scriptures Personally

Like the Bereans, we must examine "whether those things were so" (Acts 17:11). No church tradition, however ancient, can override a plain "Thus saith the Lord."

### 2. Choose Allegiance Consciously

Every Sabbath, we declare by our actions whose authority we acknowledge. There is no neutral ground.

> _"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?"_ (Romans 6:16)

### 3. Trust God for Consequences

Sabbath keeping may bring inconvenience, misunderstanding, or even persecution. But God's promise stands:

> _"Them that honour me I will honour."_ (1 Samuel 2:30)

### 4. Rest in Christ's Power

We keep the Sabbath not by self-effort but by the indwelling life of Christ. He who commanded the Sabbath also empowers its keeping.

## Appeal

> _"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth... saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."_ (Revelation 14:6-7)

Friend, we stand at the climax of the great controversy. The Sabbath is not merely a day—it is a test of loyalty to the Creator. The question is not "What day did my church teach me to keep?" but "What day did God command in His Word?"

Will you, by God's grace, take your stand with those "that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12)? Christ Himself kept the seventh-day Sabbath (Luke 4:16). The apostles kept it (Acts 17:2). The redeemed will keep it throughout eternity (Isaiah 66:23).

The choice before us is simple but solemn: the commandments of men, or the commandments of God. May the Spirit of truth guide you to rest—in Christ, and in His holy Sabbath.
