# Bible Study: The Perpetuity of the Law

## Introduction

The law of God stands at the very heart of the great controversy between good and evil. While Satan has worked through millennia to undermine, abolish, or distort God's eternal standard, Scripture reveals that the law remains—unchanging, perpetual, and central to God's judgment, Christ's character, and the experience of every true believer. This study examines the biblical evidence for the enduring nature of God's law and its vital connection to salvation by faith in Christ.

## Core Truths

### The Law as the Standard of Judgment

Every human being must one day stand before the bar of heaven:

> _"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."_ (2 Corinthians 5:10)

But by what standard will God judge? James answers plainly:

> _"So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."_ (James 2:12)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "law of liberty" appears only in James (1:25; 2:12). Far from being a burden, God's law is the foundation of true freedom—freedom from sin's slavery, freedom to love as God loves.

The law reveals sin and holds all accountable before God:

> _"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."_ (Romans 3:19)

### Universal Sinfulness Exposed

Scripture leaves no room for human pride:

> _"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."_ (Romans 3:23)

> _"What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin."_ (Romans 3:9)

The law is God's mirror—it shows us our true condition. Without it, we would not know what sin is (Romans 7:7). The law does not save, but it reveals our desperate need for a Saviour.

## Deeper Truths

### Faith Establishes the Law

[Q] **"Doesn't faith in Christ abolish the law? Aren't Christians 'free from the law'?"**

Paul anticipated this question and answered it emphatically:

> _"Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."_ (Romans 3:31)

The Greek word translated "establish" (_histēmi_) means to cause to stand, to uphold, to make valid. True faith in Christ does not tear down God's law—it upholds it! How? By providing the only means by which fallen humanity can be brought into harmony with that law through Christ's righteousness.

The converted heart delights in God's standard:

> _"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man."_ (Romans 7:22)

But the unconverted, carnal mind is fundamentally opposed:

> _"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."_ (Romans 8:7)

Here is the great dividing line: the carnal heart rebels against God's law; the renewed heart loves it. This transformation—from rebellion to delight—is the very work of the new covenant, where God promises: _"I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts"_ (Hebrews 8:10).

### Christ's Own Testimony

Jesus Himself declared the law's permanence:

> _"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."_ (Matthew 5:18)

[DYK🔎] A "jot" (Hebrew _yod_) is the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet—a tiny stroke. A "tittle" is a small distinguishing mark between similar Hebrew letters. Christ was saying that even the smallest detail of the law would endure as long as heaven and earth exist.

When asked which commandment was greatest, Jesus summarized the entire law in two principles:

> _"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."_ (Matthew 22:37-40)

[ILL] Picture a great tapestry suspended from two strong hooks on a wall. Remove either hook, and the entire tapestry falls. So it is with God's law: love to God and love to man are the two great principles upon which "hang" the entire moral law. The Ten Commandments are simply the expansion of these two principles—the first four showing how we love God, the last six showing how we love our neighbour. As long as love endures, the law must endure, for the law _is_ love in precept form.

### Christ—The Perfect Law-Keeper

Jesus not only taught the law's perpetuity—He lived it:

> _"And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin."_ (1 John 3:5)

> _"I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love."_ (John 15:10)

Christ's perfect obedience was not merely an example to admire from afar. It was:

1. **The ground of our justification**—His righteous life is imputed (credited) to the believing sinner (Romans 5:19; 2 Corinthians 5:21).
2. **The pattern for our sanctification**—His life is to be imparted to and reproduced in us by His indwelling Spirit (Galatians 2:20).

> _"He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."_ (1 John 2:6)

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law, the Sanctuary, and the Final Conflict

The law of God is central to the sanctuary message. In the earthly tabernacle, the Ten Commandments rested within the ark of the covenant in the Most Holy Place—beneath the mercy seat, where the blood of atonement was sprinkled. This arrangement reveals a profound truth: **mercy and law are not enemies; they meet together in Christ.**

In the heavenly sanctuary, John beheld the same reality:

> _"And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament."_ (Revelation 11:19)

The law remains in the very throne room of the universe. It is the foundation of God's government, the standard of the investigative judgment now proceeding, and the focal point of Satan's final assault.

### The Remnant and the Commandments

Revelation describes the last-day people of God:

> _"And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ."_ (Revelation 12:17)

Notice what provokes Satan's wrath: **commandment-keeping faith.** The remnant church does not earn salvation by obedience, but their faith is demonstrated by obedience. They have received Christ's righteousness by faith, and that faith works by love (Galatians 5:6), producing the fruit of obedience.

[Q] **"Isn't this salvation by works? Isn't emphasizing commandment-keeping legalism?"**

Consider carefully: Scripture never separates saving faith from obedience. True faith always produces corresponding works (James 2:17-26). The question is not whether we will obey, but _how_ and _why_:

- **Legalism** is self-effort to earn God's favour by outward compliance.
- **Righteousness by faith** is Christ living in the believer, producing from within what the law requires without.

> _"For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous."_ (1 John 5:3)

To the heart renewed by grace, obedience is not a burden but a delight—the natural outflow of love for a loving God.

## Practical Application

### How Do We Know We Truly Know God?

John provides a sobering test:

> _"He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."_ (1 John 2:4)

Strong words! But they are words of love, warning us against self-deception. A profession of faith without corresponding obedience is worthless—not because obedience saves, but because genuine faith inevitably produces it.

### How Do We Know We Love God?

> _"By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments."_ (1 John 5:2)

Love is not merely sentiment; it is action. We demonstrate love for God by keeping His commandments; we demonstrate love for the brethren by the same.

### How Do We Experience Blessing?

> _"But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed."_ (James 1:25)

The blessing is not in hearing alone, but in doing. The law is a mirror—we must look, see our need, and then _continue_ in the transforming grace of Christ until His character is reflected in us.

## Appeal

Dear friend, the law of God is not a ladder by which we climb to heaven. It is God's revelation of His own character of love, His standard of righteousness, and the unchanging foundation of His government throughout eternity.

We have all sinned. The law condemns us. But Christ—who kept the law perfectly—offers us His righteousness as a free gift. By faith we receive what we could never earn. And by faith, as we abide in Him, His Spirit writes that same law upon our hearts, transforming us from rebels into sons and daughters who delight to do His will.

The great controversy is nearing its close. Satan wages his fiercest war against those who "keep the commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus." Will you be among them?

> _"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."_ (Matthew 5:18)

Heaven and earth still stand. So does God's eternal law. And so may you—standing in Christ, clothed in His righteousness, delighting in His commandments, and prepared for His soon return.
