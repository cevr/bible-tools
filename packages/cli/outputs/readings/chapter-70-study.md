### Q1. Where must all men appear?

"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may
receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it
be good or bad." 2 Cor. 5:10.

**Answer:** Every human being who has ever lived has an appointment with the
judgment of God. This is not merely a metaphor, but a literal event in the plan
of salvation.

1.  **The Universality of Judgment:** The text says "we must _all_ appear." No
    one is exempt—believer or unbeliever, rich or poor.
2.  **The Basis of Review:** We are judged according to "things done in his
    body." While we are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8), our works
    are the inevitable evidence of whether that faith was genuine. A faith that
    does not produce works of obedience is dead (James 2:20).
3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:** In the earthly sanctuary service, the High
    Priest entered the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement to
    cleanse the sanctuary of recorded sins (Leviticus 16). Similarly, before
    Christ returns, He ministers in the heavenly sanctuary to blot out the sins
    of His people. This is the "investigative judgment," where the records of
    our lives are reviewed before the universe to vindicate God's justice and
    mercy.

_Key Definition:_

- **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly
  sanctuary (begun in 1844, Daniel 8:14) where the lives of professed believers
  are reviewed to see if they are truly in the faith, prior to His second
  coming.

[ILL] **The Courtroom:** Imagine a courtroom where you are the defendant. The
law books are open, and your life is on trial. If you stand alone, your record
of "bad things done" condemns you. But if you have accepted Christ, He stands as
your Advocate (1 John 2:1). He does not argue that you are innocent, but that He
has paid your penalty and that your life, though imperfect, shows a heart
surrendered to Him.

### Q2. What will be the standard in the judgment?

“So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
James 2:12 (Rom. 3:19).

**Answer:** The standard by which character is measured is God's moral law, the
Ten Commandments. James calls it the "law of liberty."

1.  **A Law of Liberty:** To the sinner, the law is a "yoke of bondage" because
    it condemns him. But to the believer who has been forgiven and renewed by
    the Holy Spirit, the law becomes a "law of liberty." Why? Because the Spirit
    writes the law on the heart (Hebrews 8:10), making it a delight to obey. A
    man is free when he wants to do exactly what he ought to do.
2.  **The Standard of Righteousness:** The law is a transcript of God's
    character. Since God does not change (Malachi 3:6), His standard of
    righteousness cannot change. In the judgment, God compares our character
    with the principles of His law to see if we have been restored to His image.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot meet this standard in our own
    strength. Righteousness by Faith means trusting Jesus to forgive our past
    transgressions (Justification) and trusting Him to live His law-keeping life
    through us day by day (Sanctification).

[ILL] **The Mirror:** James compares the law to a mirror (James 1:23). If you
look in a mirror and see dirt on your face, the mirror is doing its job. It
judges your condition. But the mirror cannot wash you. You must go to the water
(Christ and His blood) for cleansing. The law points out the sin; Christ
provides the remedy.

### Q3. In what condition are all men?

“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Rom. 3:23.

**Answer:** The diagnosis of the human race is terminal. Apart from divine
intervention, humanity is lost.

1.  **The Definition of Sin:** The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of
    the law" (1 John 3:4).
2.  **Coming Short:** To "come short of the glory of God" means we have failed
    to reflect His character. We were made in His image, but sin has marred that
    image.
3.  **Total Inability:** Because all have sinned, no human being can save
    themselves. We cannot generate righteousness from a sinful heart any more
    than a polluted fountain can produce pure water (Job 14:4). This establishes
    our absolute need for a Savior.

[ILL] **The Archer:** The Greek word for sin often carries the meaning of
"missing the mark." Imagine an archery contest where the target is absolute
moral perfection. One archer may shoot an arrow further than another (perhaps a
moral person versus a criminal), but _all_ fall short of the target. No one can
hit the bullseye of God's glory without the grace of Christ.

### Q4. How many are included in the "all" who have sinned?

“What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise; for we have before proved
both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin." Rom. 3:9.

**Answer:** Paul emphasizes that there is no privileged class when it comes to
the need for salvation.

1.  **Universal Guilt:** The "Jew" (the religious person with the Bible) and the
    "Gentile" (the person without religious heritage) are in the same boat.
    Religious heritage, church membership, or intellectual knowledge of the
    truth does not exempt a person from the reality of a fallen nature.
2.  **Under Sin:** To be "under sin" means to be under its power and
    condemnation. It is a slavery from which only Christ can emancipate us (John
    8:34-36).

_Key Definition:_

- **Justification:** The legal act where God declares a repentant sinner
  "righteous" not because of their own works, but by crediting Christ’s perfect
  life to their account (Romans 4:5).

### Q5. By what are all men thus proved guilty?

“Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are
under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become
guilty before God." Rom. 3:19.

**Answer:** The function of the law in the work of conversion is to reveal guilt
and silence human excuses.

1.  **Stopping the Mouth:** The natural heart is full of excuses ("I'm not that
    bad," "I try my best"). When the Holy Spirit brings the law home to the
    conscience, all excuses die. We realize we are spiritually bankrupt.
2.  **The Knowledge of Sin:** "By the law is the knowledge of sin" (Romans
    3:20). You cannot know you are crooked without a straight line to measure
    against. The law is that straight line.
3.  **Preparation for Grace:** The law acts as a "schoolmaster" to bring us to
    Christ (Galatians 3:24). Until a man realizes he is guilty and condemned, he
    will never appreciate or seek the Savior. The law wounds so that the Gospel
    can heal.

[ILL] **The X-Ray:** If a man has a broken bone but feels little pain, he may
refuse a doctor. But if an X-ray (the law) reveals the fracture clearly, his
"mouth is stopped." He can no longer deny his condition. The X-ray cannot heal
the bone, but it proves the absolute need for the Physician.

### Q6. What effect does faith in Christ have upon the law?

“Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the
law." Rom. 3:31.

**Answer:** This is one of the most important verses regarding Righteousness by
Faith.

1.  **Not "Void":** To make void means to nullify, abolish, or render useless.
    Paul strictly denies that faith in Jesus removes the obligation to obey
    God's moral law.
2.  **"We Establish the Law":** True faith _establishes_ the law in two ways:
    - **Legally:** We acknowledge that the law's penalty was paid by Christ on
      the cross (satisfying justice).
    - **Experientially:** Faith receives the Holy Spirit, who writes the law
      upon the heart (Hebrews 8:10). A man saved by grace is the only man who
      can truly keep the law, because he does it through the power of Christ,
      not his own effort.
3.  **Gospel Obedience:** The Gospel does not save us _in_ our sins (leaving us
    to break the law), but saves us _from_ our sins (empowering us to keep the
    law).

_Key Definition:_

- **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace within the believer,
  transforming their character to be like Jesus, resulting in obedience to God's
  will (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

[ILL] **The Builder:** If an architect draws a blueprint (the law) and the first
construction crew ruins the building, a Master Builder (Christ) steps in. He
doesn't tear up the blueprint (make void the law); He restores the building to
match the original design perfectly (establishes the law).

### Q7. In what did the apostle Paul delight?

“For I delight in the law of God after the inward man." Rom. 7:22.

**Answer:** Here is the mark of a born-again Christian: an internal change of
attitude toward God's requirements.

1.  **The Inward Man:** This refers to the new nature created by the Holy Spirit
    in conversion.
2.  **Love for the Law:** David said, "O how love I thy law! it is my meditation
    all the day" (Psalm 119:97). To the converted heart, God's law is not a
    burden but a delight because it reflects the character of the God they love.
3.  **The Promise:** God promised in Ezekiel 36:26-27, "A new heart also will I
    give you... and I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
    statutes."

[ILL] **Diet and Health:** To a person addicted to junk food, a diet of pure,
healthy food seems like a punishment. But to a person who has regained their
health and changed their palate, the healthy food is a delight. Conversion
changes our spiritual "palate" so we hunger for righteousness (Matthew 5:6).

### Q8. How does the carnal mind stand related to the law of God?

“Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law
of God, neither indeed can be." Rom. 8:7.

**Answer:** This explains why the unregenerate person cannot obey God, no matter
how hard they try.

1.  **The Carnal Mind:** This is the "fleshly" mind, the natural human nature
    inherited from Adam, separate from the Spirit of God.
2.  **Enmity:** It is not just neutral; it is hostile ("enmity") toward God. It
    resents authority and loves self.
3.  **The Necessity of Rebirth:** Because the carnal mind _cannot_ be subject to
    God's law, education and culture are not enough. We must be "born again"
    (John 3:3). The solution to the carnal mind is the crucifixion of self and
    the indwelling of the Spirit (Galatians 2:20).

_Key Definition:_

- **Carnal Mind:** The mind of the flesh; human nature controlled by sinful
  impulses rather than the Holy Spirit.

[ILL] **Oil and Water:** You can shake a bottle containing oil and water to mix
them, but the moment you stop shaking, they separate. They are contrary by
nature. The carnal mind is like oil—it will not mix with the water of God's law.
The nature itself must be changed.

### Q9. How long did the Saviour say all the law would be in force?

“For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle
shall in no wise pass from the law, till all [Greek, all things] be fulfilled."
Matt. 5:18.

**Answer:** Jesus affirms the perpetuity (eternal nature) of the Ten
Commandments.

1.  **"Till Heaven and Earth Pass":** As long as we are living on this earth,
    God's moral law remains in effect.
2.  **Jot and Tittle:** These were the smallest markings in the Hebrew script.
    Jesus teaches that not even the smallest detail of the moral law is to be
    altered.
3.  **Consistency:** If Christ came to pay the penalty for breaking the law, it
    would be inconsistent for Him to then abolish the law. If the law could have
    been changed, Christ would not have needed to die; the Father could have
    simply adjusted the rules. The death of Christ is the strongest proof that
    the law is immutable.

### Q10. When asked which was the great commandment in the law, what answer did Christ make?

“Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great
commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself." Matt. 22:37-39.

**Answer:** Jesus summarizes the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) into two
fundamental principles.

1.  **The First Table:** The first four commandments (No other gods, no idols,
    no profanity, Sabbath) show us _how_ to love God with all our heart.
2.  **The Second Table:** The last six commandments (honor parents, no killing,
    adultery, stealing, lying, coveting) show us _how_ to love our neighbor.
3.  **Love as the Motive:** Obedience without love is legalism. But love without
    obedience is sentimentalism. True love always manifests itself in keeping
    God's requirements.

### Q11. What did He say hung on these two requirements?

“On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Matt. 22:40.

**Answer:** The two great commandments are not a _replacement_ for the Ten
Commandments, but the _foundation_ of them.

1.  **Hanging the Law:** Just as a door hangs on hinges, the specific
    commandments hang on the principle of love. You cannot remove the door and
    keep the hinges; nor can you keep the hinges and throw away the door.
2.  **Specifics of Love:**
    - If I love God supremely, I will not worship idols (2nd Commandment) or
      forget His Sabbath (4th Commandment).
    - If I love my neighbor as myself, I will not steal from him (8th
      Commandment) or lie to him (9th Commandment).
3.  **The Unity of the Law:** The law is a unit. You cannot break one part
    without violating the principle of love that holds it all together.

[ILL] **The Tree:** Love is the root and the trunk. The Ten Commandments are the
branches. The fruit is the specific acts of kindness and obedience in daily
life. You cannot have the fruit without the branches, and the branches cannot
exist without the root.

### Q12. What does the apostle say about the practice of Christ in keeping the law?

“And ye know that He was manifested to take away our sins; and in Him is no
sin." 1 John 3:5.

**Answer:** Christ is the perfect pattern of righteousness.

1.  **In Him is No Sin:** Jesus lived a life of perfect obedience to the
    Father's will. He was "tempted in all points like as we are, yet without
    sin" (Hebrews 4:15).
2.  **Manifested to Take Away Sin:** He deals with sin in two ways:
    - **Bearing the Penalty:** He took our guilt upon Himself at the cross.
    - **Breaking the Power:** By His indwelling life, He takes away the dominion
      of sin in our hearts.
3.  **Our Righteousness:** Christ’s perfect law-keeping is the only covering
    that enables us to stand in the judgment. We are accepted in the Beloved
    (Ephesians 1:6).

### Q13. What does Christ say of Himself in this respect?

“I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love." John 15:10.

**Answer:** Jesus linked His abiding in the Father's love directly to His
obedience.

1.  **The Example:** Jesus did not obey the Father to _earn_ His love, but
    because He _abode_ in His love.
2.  **The Connection:** Obedience is the natural atmosphere of love.
    Disobedience disrupts the relationship.
3.  **The Source of Power:** Jesus said, "The Son can do nothing of himself"
    (John 5:19). He kept the commandments by depending entirely on the Father's
    power. This is exactly how we are to keep the commandments—by depending
    entirely on Christ's power.

### Q14. If one would abide in Christ, what ought he to do?

“He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He
walked." 1 John 2:6.

**Answer:** The Christian life is a life of imitation through habitation—we
imitate Him because He inhabits us.

1.  **"Even as He Walked":** If Christ walked in obedience to the Ten
    Commandments, those who claim to be His followers must walk the same path.
2.  **Consistency of Profession:** It is a contradiction to say "I abide in
    Christ" while walking in willful disobedience. The fruit must match the vine
    (John 15:5).
3.  **Sanctification:** This walking is a daily process. We learn to walk by
    taking one step at a time, leaning on Jesus.

[ILL] **The Shadow:** If you walk in the sunlight, your shadow follows your
every move. If we are walking in the light of Christ, our lives will shadow His
life. Where He goes, we go. What He does, we do.

### Q15. How does James say one may be blessed in his deeds?

“But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he
being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed
in his deed." James 1:25.

**Answer:** The blessing of the Gospel is found not in merely knowing the truth,
but in living it.

1.  **Looking and Continuing:** It is not a casual glance at the law, but an
    earnest look and a steadfast continuance. This implies a daily relationship
    with God's will.
2.  **Doer of the Work:** This is not salvation by works, but salvation _unto_
    works (Ephesians 2:10). The grace that saves the soul also energizes the
    will to obey.
3.  **Blessed in his Deed:** There is a peace and joy that comes from a clear
    conscience and a life in harmony with God. "Great peace have they which love
    thy law" (Psalm 119:165).

### Q16. What is said of those who profess to know the Lord, and yet do not keep His commandments?

“He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the
truth is not in him." 1 John 2:4.

**Answer:** This is a startlingly strong rebuke to the idea that one can have a
saving relationship with Christ while willfully disregarding His law.

1.  **The Test of Knowing Him:** To "know" God in the Bible is not just
    intellectual awareness; it is intimate relationship (Jeremiah 31:34). You
    cannot be in an intimate relationship with God while rebelling against His
    government.
2.  **Cheap Grace:** There is a false gospel that claims we can be saved while
    clinging to sin. John calls this a lie.
3.  **True Conversion:** A truly converted person may stumble (1 John 2:1), but
    the bent of their life is toward obedience. They do not settle down in sin
    or excuse it.

### Q17. What is the test whereby one may know he has passed from death unto life?

“We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the
brethren." 1 John 3:14.

**Answer:** Love is the evidence of the new birth.

1.  **From Death to Life:** This describes the resurrection of the soul that
    happens at conversion (Ephesians 2:1).
2.  **Loving the Brethren:** The carnal mind is selfish. When a person begins to
    genuinely love others, putting their needs first, it is proof that the
    Spirit of God has entered their heart.

### Q18. How may one be sure he loves the brethren?

“By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep
His commandments." 1 John 5:2.

**Answer:** This verse protects us from a sentimental, humanistic definition of
love.

1.  **Defining Love:** The world defines love as a feeling or tolerance of
    everything. The Bible defines love as seeking the highest good of others
    according to God's will.
2.  **The Link to the Law:** You cannot truly love the children of God if you
    are encouraging them to sin or if you are sinning against them. For example,
    you cannot love your neighbor while committing adultery with his wife
    (violating the 7th commandment). True love keeps the commandments because
    the commandments protect our neighbor.

### Q19. And what is the love of God?

“For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments." 1 John 5:3.

**Answer:** John gives the ultimate definition of loving God.

1.  **Action, Not Just Emotion:** We prove our love to God not merely by singing
    praises, but by aligning our will with His. "If ye love me, keep my
    commandments" (John 14:15).
2.  **Not Grievous:** The verse continues, "and his commandments are not
    grievous." To the heart renewed by grace, God's law is not a heavy burden—it
    is the path of life and safety.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** It is impossible to keep the commandments in our
    own strength without it being "grievous" or impossible. But when Christ
    dwells within, His yoke is easy and His burden is light (Matthew 11:30).

### Q20. What will characterize the "remnant" church?

“And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant
of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus
Christ." Rev. 12:17.

**Answer:** In the last days, God will have a people who stand distinct from the
world and fallen religion.

1.  **The Remnant:** A "remnant" is the last remaining piece of a bolt of
    fabric, identical to the first piece. The end-time church will hold the same
    faith and practice as the apostolic church.
2.  **Two Distinguishing Marks:**
    - **Keep the Commandments of God:** While the world (and much of the
      religious world) makes void the law—especially the Sabbath—the remnant
      will uplift the perpetuity of God's law.
    - **The Testimony of Jesus:** Revelation 19:10 tells us "the testimony of
      Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." This indicates the restoration of the
      prophetic gift.
3.  **The Target of Satan:** The "dragon" (Satan) wars specifically against this
    group because their obedience through faith refutes his claim that God's law
    cannot be kept. They are the "patience of the saints" mentioned in the Third
    Angel's Message (Revelation 14:12).

_Key Definition:_

- **Remnant Church:** The final generation of believers who remain faithful to
  the fullness of biblical truth, including the commandments of God and the
  faith of Jesus, immediately prior to the Second Coming.

[ILL] **The Fortress:** In a time of war, the enemy attacks the fortress that
flies the King's true flag. The Remnant are those who refuse to lower the flag
of God's Law, even when the whole world demands they surrender. They stand firm
not by their own might, but because the Commander (Christ) is inside the
fortress with them.
