### Slide 1 – Righteousness and Life: Introduction

- Open by stating the theme: in God’s plan, true righteousness and real life are
  never separated. Wherever God’s righteousness is present, there is life;
  wherever sin rules, the result is death.
- Point out that this is more than a theory. It’s the difference between
  spiritual life and spiritual death, between eternal life and eternal loss.
- Emphasize: eternal life is found only in Christ, and the righteousness
  required for that life is also only in Christ.
- Clarify that this righteousness is twofold:
  - A **gift** – our title to heaven, our acceptance with God.
  - A **transforming power** – our fitness for heaven, a changed character.
- Explain the journey of the study: we’ll start with the simple promise of John
  3:16, then move into the deeper link between God’s law, Christ’s
  righteousness, and the life He imparts.
- Transition: With that in mind, begin at the most familiar verse in Scripture,
  and listen to it with fresh ears.

---

### Slide 2 – God’s Love and the Promise of Life

- Read John 3:16 slowly. Invite the congregation to follow in their Bibles.
- Highlight four parts:
  - The **motive**: “God so loved the world.” Salvation begins in the heart of a
    loving God.
  - The **gift**: “He gave His only begotten Son” – given to live, die, and rise
    again for us.
  - The **condition**: “whosoever believeth in Him” – not simply agreeing He
    exists, but personally trusting and relying on Him.
  - The **promise**: those who believe “should not perish, but have everlasting
    life.”
- Stress that eternal life is not earned; it is God’s **gift in Christ**,
  received by faith.
- Transition: If life is given through faith in Christ, the next question is:
  what exactly does the gospel reveal about this life and about the
  righteousness that goes with it?

---

### Slide 3 – The Gospel Reveals Righteousness and Life Together

- Read Romans 1:17. Note the key phrase: “The just shall live by faith.”
- Briefly define:
  - **Gospel** – the good news of what God has done and is doing for our
    salvation through Christ (His life, death, resurrection, and priestly
    ministry).
  - **Righteousness of God** – God’s perfect rightness, His holy character and
    way of living, revealed in Christ and in His law.
  - **The just** – those whom God counts righteous because of Christ.
  - **Live by faith** – a continual dependence on Christ instead of our own
    goodness.
- Emphasize: the gospel is not just a way to escape punishment; it shows how God
  can **make sinners truly righteous and give them life** at the same time,
  without compromising His law.
- Transition: If righteousness and life stand together in the gospel, then
  Christ must have done something about death itself. That’s where Paul goes
  next.

---

### Slide 4 – Life and Immortality Brought to Light

- Read 2 Timothy 1:10. Focus on the phrases “abolished death” and “brought life
  and immortality to light.”
- Explain: through Christ’s death and resurrection, the final power of death
  over the believer is broken (Hebrews 2:14–15).
- Clarify that “life and immortality” are:
  - Revealed clearly in the gospel.
  - Promised and guaranteed in Christ, not in ourselves.
- Contrast two conditions:
  - Without Christ, death is the end.
  - In Christ, death is a sleep, awaiting resurrection.
- Read 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and summarize: “the dead in Christ shall rise
  first.”
- Transition: Since life and immortality are bound up with Christ, Scripture
  naturally connects that life with righteousness—the way of living that is in
  harmony with God.

---

### Slide 5 – The Way of Righteousness Is the Way of Life

- Read Proverbs 12:28: “In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway
  thereof there is no death.”
- Explain simply: wherever the way of righteousness is truly walked, the end is
  life—no eternal death for those who walk in that way in Christ.
- Read Proverbs 21:21 and summarize: those who pursue righteousness and mercy
  find life, righteousness, and honor.
- Clarify: this is not talking about human self-righteousness. It is about
  **seeking God’s righteousness**—as Jesus said, “Seek ye first the kingdom of
  God, and His righteousness” (Matthew 6:33).
- Transition: If righteousness leads to life, then sin must lead somewhere very
  different. Paul sets two kingdoms side by side: sin and grace.

---

### Slide 6 – Two Kingdoms: Sin and Grace

- Read Romans 5:21. Ask the congregation to notice the words “reigned unto
  death” and “reign through righteousness unto eternal life.”
- Define briefly:
  - **Sin** – breaking God’s law in thought, word, or deed (1 John 3:4).
  - **Grace** – God’s undeserved favor and His active power to save from sin,
    not to excuse it.
- Contrast the two reigns:
  - When **sin reigns**, the outcome is **death**.
  - When **grace reigns**, it does so **through righteousness** and leads to
    **eternal life**.
- Emphasize: grace does not reign by overlooking sin while we cling to it; grace
  reigns by establishing righteousness in us through Christ (Romans 6:14–18).
- Transition: That raises a vital question: what is this righteousness that
  grace establishes? The Bible points us to God’s law.

---

### Slide 7 – God’s Commandments: Righteousness

- Read Psalm 119:172: “All Thy commandments are righteousness.”
- Explain: God’s law is a written expression of His own righteous character
  (Romans 7:12 – “holy, just, and good”).
- The commandments show us what righteousness looks like in everyday life—how
  love to God and love to man are lived out.
- Note the limitation: the law reveals the standard, but it cannot give us the
  power to meet that standard. It is like a mirror; it shows the dirt, but it
  cannot wash the face.
- Transition: Yet Jesus adds another dimension—He says the commandment is not
  only righteousness, it is actually **life everlasting**.

---

### Slide 8 – God’s Commandment: Life Everlasting

- Read John 12:50: “His commandment is life everlasting.”
- Explain: in God’s design, His commandment is not a pathway to bondage and
  death; it is the way of life. Obedience is life-giving, never life-destroying.
- But our problem is serious: in our fallen state, we cannot truly keep that law
  in our own strength (Romans 8:7–8—the carnal mind is enmity against God and
  not subject to His law).
- So the law does two things:
  - Shows us what life and righteousness look like.
  - Shows us that we lack both in ourselves, and drives us to Christ.
- Transition: If the law defines righteousness, we still need someone who can be
  that righteousness for us and in us. Scripture points us to Christ under a
  very specific name.

---

### Slide 9 – Christ: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS

- Read Jeremiah 23:6: “And this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD
  OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.”
- Emphasize: Christ is not only righteous; He is **our** righteousness. He
  stands in our place, and He also lives in our hearts.
- Briefly outline two aspects:
  - **Justification** – God counts Christ’s perfect obedience and sacrifice as
    ours when we believe (Romans 5:1, 18–19). This is **imputed
    righteousness**—credited to our account.
  - **Sanctification** – Christ, living in the believer by the Holy Spirit,
    reproduces His character in us (Galatians 2:20). This is **imparted
    righteousness**—worked into our experience.
- Stress: both are by grace, through faith in Christ.
- Transition: This is why Jesus can say, in one sentence, that He is the Way
  back to God, the Truth of God, and the Life of God, all at once.

---

### Slide 10 – Christ: The Way, the Truth, and the Life

- Read John 14:6: “I am the way, the truth, and the life.”
- Explain briefly:
  - He is **the Way** – the only access back to the Father and to a life of
    obedience (Hebrews 10:19–20).
  - He is **the Truth** – the full revelation of God’s character of love (John
    1:14, 18).
  - He is **the Life** – the source of both physical and spiritual life (John
    1:4; 1 John 5:11–12).
- Summarize: you cannot have life without Christ, and you cannot have true
  righteousness without Christ. In Him, righteousness and life are united.
- Transition: Jesus even linked the question of “entering into life” with the
  commandments. Let’s look at that conversation with the rich young ruler.

---

### Slide 11 – “If Thou Wilt Enter Into Life”

- Read Matthew 19:17: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.”
- Explain the apparent tension:
  - Jesus connects **entering into life** with **keeping the commandments**.
  - Yet Paul clearly teaches that we are not justified by the works of the law
    (Galatians 2:16; Romans 3:20), and that we are saved by grace through faith
    (Ephesians 2:8–9).
- Clarify the harmony:
  - The commandments describe the **life of love and obedience** that belongs to
    those who are saved (Romans 8:4).
  - The law shows what that “life” looks like; Christ provides both the pardon
    and the power to live it.
- Transition: So how does commandment-keeping actually fit into the gospel of
  righteousness by faith?

---

### Slide 12 – How Commandment-Keeping Fits the Gospel

- Emphasize Jesus’ words in John 15:5: “Without Me ye can do nothing.”
- Explain: no one truly keeps God’s law from the heart until Christ dwells
  within by His Spirit.
- To “enter into life” means to enter into a living relationship with Christ in
  which:
  - His righteousness is **counted to us** (justification).
  - His righteousness is **worked in us** (sanctification).
- Out of that relationship flows a life of obedience—not as a way to earn life,
  but as the natural fruit of faith and love.
- Transition: Paul takes us further: this righteousness is a **gift**, and
  through that gift we do more than survive—we “reign in life.”

---

### Slide 13 – The Gift of Righteousness and Reigning in Life

- Read Romans 5:17.
- Contrast Adam and Christ:
  - By Adam’s offense, death began to reign over the human family.
  - Through Christ, God offers “abundance of grace” and “the gift of
    righteousness.”
- Emphasize the word “receive”: those who **receive** this abundance of grace
  and righteousness “shall reign in life.”
- Transition: But what does it actually look like to “reign in life” now, in a
  fallen world?

---

### Slide 14 – What It Means to “Reign in Life”

- Explain: to “reign in life” does not mean earthly power or prosperity; it
  means sharing Christ’s spiritual victory.
- Highlight three aspects:
  - No longer slaves to sin (Romans 6:12–14) – sin no longer has dominion over
    you.
  - Sharing in Christ’s victory over sin and death—living under His lordship
    instead of sin’s.
  - Enjoying a present fellowship with God that is a foretaste of eternal life.
- Read John 17:3 and summarize: life eternal is to know the only true God and
  Jesus Christ.
- Transition: To keep this balanced, Paul reminds us again: death is earned, but
  life is purely a gift.

---

### Slide 15 – Eternal Life: Wages vs. Gift

- Read Romans 6:23.
- Explain the contrast:
  - **Wages** – what is earned. Sin pays out death; it is the rightful result of
    rebellion.
  - **Gift** – what is not earned. Eternal life is always and only “the gift of
    God.”
- Stress that this gift comes “through Jesus Christ our Lord” – there is no
  other channel.
- Transition: Understanding this helps protect us from two dangerous extremes
  that often appear in discussions about law, grace, righteousness, and life.

---

### Slide 16 – Guarding Against Two Errors

- Name the two errors:
  - **Legalism** – thinking we can earn eternal life by our good works or
    law-keeping.
  - **Lawlessness** (cheap grace) – thinking God gives eternal life while
    leaving us in cherished sin.
- Emphasize: in Christ, the gift of eternal life **includes** the gift of
  righteousness and the restoration of obedience.
- Read Hebrews 8:10: God writes His laws in mind and heart—this is the new
  covenant experience.
- Read Titus 2:11–12: grace not only brings salvation; it teaches us to deny
  ungodliness and to live soberly, righteously, and godly.
- Transition: Now we move from doctrine to experience: how does this work begin
  in a human heart?

---

### Slide 17 – Christ the Source of Every Right Impulse

- Quote the line: “Christ is the source of every right impulse. He is the only
  one that can implant in the heart enmity against sin.”
- Explain: every genuine desire you have to be clean, honest, pure, or to make
  things right, is already the working of Christ’s Spirit (John 16:8).
- Point out: by nature, the human heart does not hate sin (Romans 8:7). Any
  hatred of sin, any discomfort with it, is something Christ has planted.
- Encourage: whenever someone feels a longing for something better spiritually,
  that is evidence that “His Spirit is moving upon [the] heart.”
- Transition: How does Christ deepen that work? He does it by drawing us to the
  cross.

---

### Slide 18 – The Drawing Power of the Cross

- Read John 12:32.
- Explain: Christ was lifted up on the cross in history; today He is lifted up
  in the preaching of the gospel.
- As we behold “the Lamb of God upon the cross of Calvary”:
  - The mystery of redemption begins to unfold.
  - We see that God is not trying to destroy us, but to save us.
  - The goodness of God revealed at the cross leads us to repentance (Romans
    2:4).
- Stress: repentance is not something we work up by ourselves. It is our heart’s
  response to Christ’s love, seen in His suffering for our sins.
- Transition: As Christ draws us, certain changes often begin to appear even
  before we fully understand what is happening.

---

### Slide 19 – Awakening and Conviction

- Explain: many people start to feel ashamed of certain sins. They may give up
  some bad habits or make outward reforms.
- They may not realize this is Christ Himself drawing them.
- When those changes come from a sincere desire to do right, it is the power of
  Christ working:
  - An unseen influence is at work.
  - The conscience is “quickened” – made alive to the difference between right
    and wrong.
- Transition: As Christ continues to draw, something deeper happens. We are
  brought face-to-face with both the cross and the law.

---

### Slide 20 – The Commandment Comes Home to the Conscience

- Read or summarize Zechariah 12:10: looking upon “Him whom they have pierced.”
- Explain: as we look to Christ crucified for our sins:
  - We realize that it was **our** sins that pierced Him.
  - At that moment, “the commandment comes home to the conscience”—the law that
    once seemed external now speaks personally.
- We see two things:
  - The outward wickedness of our life.
  - The deep, inner sin of the soul—selfishness, pride, unbelief.
- Share the questions raised in the EGW passage: What is sin, that it required
  such a sacrifice? Was all this suffering really necessary so that we might
  have everlasting life?
- Transition: When the cross and the commandment meet in our conscience like
  this, the result is genuine repentance and living faith.

---

### Slide 21 – Repentance and Faith: Where Righteousness and Life Meet

- Explain: this experience leads to true conversion:
  - **Real repentance** – “godly sorrow” for sin (2 Corinthians 7:9–10), not
    just fear of consequences.
  - **Real faith** – trusting Christ as the only sufficient Saviour (Acts 4:12).
- At the cross we see:
  - The deadly nature of sin—it cost the life of the Son of God.
  - The boundless love of God—He was willing to pay that price so we might have
    life.
- Emphasize: here, at the cross, righteousness and life meet. Christ’s
  righteousness is offered to us, and eternal life is given as we surrender and
  trust Him.
- Transition: To make this very practical, we can use a simple illustration
  about poison, an X-ray, and an antidote.

---

### Slide 22 – Illustration: The Deadly Poison and the Antidote

- Tell the story briefly and clearly:
  - A man has taken a deadly poison but feels only mildly ill. He assumes he
    will get better on his own.
  - A friend rushes in with an antidote. The man refuses: “I’m not so bad; I’ll
    recover.”
  - The friend then shows an X-ray: the poison has spread throughout his body.
  - The friend explains: “I once drank this same poison. Someone gave His life
    to produce the antidote I now offer you.”
  - Now the sick man sees both the deadliness of the poison and the costliness
    of the cure. His pride breaks. He accepts the antidote with gratitude.
- Transition: This simple story helps us understand how God uses both His law
  and the cross in our salvation.

---

### Slide 23 – Lesson from the Illustration

- Apply the illustration:
  - The **law** is like the X-ray. It does not cure; it reveals. It shows how
    deeply sin has penetrated every part of our life.
  - The **cross** is like the Friend’s sacrifice and the antidote. It shows how
    much it cost God to provide a cure for sin.
- When we see both together:
  - Our true condition is exposed.
  - God’s love is revealed in a way that breaks our pride and self-sufficiency.
- The only reasonable response is to accept the cure: Christ Himself as our
  righteousness and our life.
- Transition: This brings us to the larger backdrop of the great controversy:
  what is God really like? Is His law harsh, or is it woven together with love
  and life?

---

### Slide 24 – God’s Character: Love, Law, and Life

- Affirm: “God is love” (1 John 4:8), and His law is the law of love (Matthew
  22:37–40).
- Connect: His commandments are called “righteousness” (Psalm 119:172) and “life
  everlasting” (John 12:50).
- Explain Satan’s accusation from Genesis 3: God’s law is restrictive, unfair,
  even life-destroying—“Ye shall not surely die.”
- Show how the gospel answers:
  - It is **sin**, not obedience, that brings death (Romans 6:23).
  - The way of righteousness is the way of life (Proverbs 12:28).
  - Christ proves that full loyalty to God’s law is both loving and life-giving;
    His joy was to do the Father’s will (John 15:10–11).
- Transition: God has illustrated this plan of righteousness and life in a
  visual way through the sanctuary service.

---

### Slide 25 – Sanctuary Overview: Righteousness and Life in Three Phases

- Explain briefly: the earthly sanctuary was God’s object lesson of Christ’s
  saving work.
- Outline the three main areas:
  1. **Outer court** – the sacrifice.
  2. **Holy place** – the daily ministry.
  3. **Most holy place** – the day of atonement / judgment.
- Emphasize: in every phase, righteousness and life are provided only “through
  Jesus Christ our Lord” (Romans 6:23).
- Transition: Let’s look at each phase and see how righteousness and life are
  joined there.

---

### Slide 26 – Outer Court: Sacrifice and Imputed Righteousness

- Explain: in the outer court stood the altar of burnt offering, where
  sacrifices were slain.
- This points to Christ’s sacrifice on the cross (John 1:29; Hebrews 9:22).
- At the cross:
  - The penalty of sin is borne by our Substitute.
  - The blood is shed so that sin can be forgiven.
- Here righteousness is **imputed**:
  - The believing sinner is counted righteous, not because of his own deeds, but
    because of Christ’s merits.
  - Our **title to heaven** and eternal life is secured in Him.
- Transition: But God does not stop at forgiving us on paper. He also wants to
  maintain and grow spiritual life in us day by day. That is pictured in the
  holy place.

---

### Slide 27 – Holy Place: Daily Ministry and Imparted Righteousness

- Explain: the daily services in the holy place pointed to Christ’s ongoing
  ministry as our High Priest (Hebrews 7:25; 8:1–2).
- Through this ministry, Christ:
  - Sends the Holy Spirit.
  - Supplies grace and power to obey.
  - Maintains our spiritual life through the means of grace—Word, prayer,
    fellowship, and witness.
- Here righteousness is **imparted**:
  - Christ’s own life is communicated to the believer.
  - A holy character is formed as we abide in Him.
- Transition: Finally, the most holy place service points to the last phase of
  Christ’s work—the judgment and final atonement.

---

### Slide 28 – Most Holy Place: Judgment and a Prepared People

- Explain: the Day of Atonement was the most solemn service, symbolizing the
  investigative judgment and the final blotting out of sin (Daniel 8:14; Hebrews
  9:23–28).
- In this phase:
  - Sins that have been confessed are blotted out from the records of heaven
    (Acts 3:19).
  - God prepares a people who “keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
    Jesus” (Revelation 14:12).
- In this end-time people, righteousness and life are fully united in Christ:
  - They are justified by His blood.
  - They are sanctified by His indwelling Spirit.
  - They are ready for translation at His coming.
- Transition: This leads us directly to the last message that must go to all the
  world before Christ returns—the everlasting gospel.

---

### Slide 29 – The Everlasting Gospel and the End-Time

- Read Revelation 14:6.
- Explain: in the very last days, God sends a worldwide message described as
  “the everlasting gospel.”
- This message includes:
  - A call to “fear God, and give glory to Him” (verse 7) – to honor His
    character and law.
  - A call to worship the Creator.
  - A warning against worshiping the beast and his image (verses 8–11).
- Emphasize: even in the final crisis, the heart of the message is still the
  gospel—God’s way of uniting righteousness and life in Christ.
- Transition: And at the center of this message stands a remnant people
  described in one powerful verse.

---

### Slide 30 – Commandments, Faith, and Life in the Remnant

- Read Revelation 14:12.
- Point out the three elements:
  - **Commandments of God** – righteousness, obedience to His law.
  - **Faith of Jesus** – not only faith in Jesus, but the kind of faith Jesus
    Himself had.
  - **Everlasting gospel** – the promise and power of eternal life in Christ
    (verse 6).
- Explain: here we see righteousness by faith in an end-time setting:
  - A people who live by Christ’s faith.
  - Manifest His obedience.
  - Stand ready for eternal life when He appears.
- Transition: So how can we personally enter into this experience of
  righteousness and life? Let’s make it very practical.

---

### Slide 31 – How to Receive Righteousness and Life (1)

- Step 1: **Look to Christ crucified.**
  - Encourage the congregation: take time to meditate on the cross (John
    3:14–16).
  - Pray, “Lord, show me both the ugliness of my sin and the beauty of Your
    love.”
- Step 2: **Respond to His drawing.**
  - When you sense conviction of sin or a desire to change, recognize: it is
    Christ drawing you by His Spirit.
  - Do not harden your heart; surrender your will (Hebrews 3:7–8).
- Transition: As we respond, the next step is to deal honestly with sin before
  God.

---

### Slide 32 – How to Receive Righteousness and Life (2)

- Step 3: **Confess and forsake sin.**
  - Encourage honest, specific confession to God (1 John 1:9).
  - Ask not only for pardon but for power to turn away (Proverbs 28:13).
- Step 4: **Believe His promise of righteousness and life.**
  - Take God at His word that Christ is **your** righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6; 1
    Corinthians 1:30).
  - Believe that eternal life is already yours in Christ (1 John 5:11–13), even
    while He continues to purify and transform you.
- Transition: Then this faith must be carried into daily life—a continual walk
  in newness of life.

---

### Slide 33 – How to Receive Righteousness and Life (3)

- Step 5: **Walk in newness of life.**
  - Each day, reckon yourself dead to sin and alive unto God, and yield yourself
    to Christ (Romans 6:11–13).
  - Let His Spirit write the law in your heart (Hebrews 8:10), making obedience
    a delight, not a burden.
- Emphasize: in this experience, obedience is the fruit of love, not the price
  we pay for life (John 14:15).
- Summarize: this is righteousness by faith in daily practice—a continuous
  reception of Christ’s righteousness, leading to a life that is truly alive in
  Him.
- Transition: As we close, bring all these themes together in a personal appeal.

---

### Slide 34 – Appeal: Christ Your Righteousness and Your Life

- Summarize the message:
  - God has united righteousness and life in one Person—Jesus Christ.
  - The law shows us what righteousness is.
  - The cross shows us what our unrighteousness cost.
  - The gospel shows us how God freely gives both righteousness and eternal life
    to all who believe.
- Assure the congregation: you do not need to make yourself righteous before
  coming to Christ. Every right desire in your heart is already His Spirit
  drawing you.
- Invite them to see Christ as both:
  - Their **righteousness** – their only hope of acceptance with God.
  - Their **life** – the source of power to live in obedience and love.
- Transition: Now call for a clear, personal response.

---

### Slide 35 – Appeal: Your Personal Decision

- Invite a definite decision:
  - “Will you today choose to step onto ‘the way of righteousness’ where ‘there
    is no death’ (Proverbs 12:28)?”
  - “Will you let Christ be to you ‘THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS’ (Jeremiah
    23:6)?”
- Encourage those present to come just as they are, with no reservations, and to
  place their trust wholly in the crucified and risen Saviour.
- Suggest a response:
  - Raise a hand, stand, or come forward—as the setting allows—to signify, “I
    choose Christ as my righteousness and my life.”
- Close with a prayer focus:
  - Ask God to seal decisions.
  - Ask Him to unite righteousness and life in each heart through Jesus Christ
    our Lord.
