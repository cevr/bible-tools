# Reading 127: Forgiving One Another

## Introduction

Forgiveness stands at the very heart of the gospel. It is both a gift we receive from God and a grace we are called to extend to others. Yet perhaps no aspect of Christian living proves more difficult in daily practice. This study reveals that our capacity to forgive others is inseparably linked to our experience of God's forgiveness—and that harboring unforgiveness actually blocks the flow of divine mercy into our own lives.

## Core Truths

### Forgiveness and Prayer Are Inseparable

Jesus places forgiveness at the center of effective prayer:

> _"And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."_ (Mark 11:25)

Notice the directness of Christ's instruction. He does not say "consider forgiving" or "try to forgive eventually." The command is immediate: **when you stand praying, forgive.** Prayer and unforgiveness cannot coexist in the same heart.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "if ye have aught against any" uses the Greek word _ti_ (anything) and _tinos_ (anyone)—emphasizing that no grievance is too small and no offender is excluded from our duty to forgive.

### God Cannot Pardon the Unforgiving

> _"But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."_ (Mark 11:26)

This is among the most solemn statements in Scripture. God's forgiveness flows freely to all who repent—but it cannot remain with those who refuse to pass it on. The channel that receives must also give, or it becomes clogged and useless.

[Q] **"Isn't this teaching salvation by works? Are we earning God's forgiveness by forgiving others?"**

Not at all. God's forgiveness is always a free gift, received by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8–9). But unforgiveness reveals a heart that has never truly received that gift. The person who grasps how much they have been forgiven cannot help but forgive others. An unforgiving spirit proves that we have not yet understood—or accepted—the mercy extended to us. As 1 John 4:20 states: _"If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar."_

### The Measure We Use

> _"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."_ (Matthew 6:12)

In the Lord's Prayer, we actually invite God to use our treatment of others as the standard for His treatment of us. This is the only petition in the entire prayer to which Jesus adds a comment:

> _"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."_ (Matthew 6:14–15)

Why does Christ single out this petition for additional emphasis? Because He knows how prone we are to desire mercy for ourselves while demanding justice for others.

## Deeper Truths

### The Limitless Standard: Seventy Times Seven

Peter thought he was being generous when he proposed forgiving seven times:

> _"Then came Peter to Him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."_ (Matthew 18:21–22)

The rabbis of Jesus' day taught that forgiving three times was sufficient. Peter doubled that and added one more for good measure. Surely the Master would commend such generosity!

But Jesus' answer—**seventy times seven**—was not meant as a literal count of 490. It was a Hebrew idiom for "without limit." Christ calls us to stop counting altogether.

[DYK🔎] The number seventy times seven (490) has deep prophetic significance in Daniel 9:24, where it represents the period of Israel's probation. Jesus may be hinting that just as God extended repeated opportunities to His covenant people, so we must extend repeated grace to those who wrong us.

### The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant

To drive home this truth, Jesus told one of His most sobering parables (Matthew 18:23–35):

**The Debts:**

- The first servant owed **ten thousand talents**—an astronomical sum. One talent equaled about 6,000 denarii (a denarius was a day's wage). Ten thousand talents would be approximately 60 million days' wages—an unpayable debt representing multiple lifetimes of labor.
- The second servant owed **one hundred pence** (denarii)—about 100 days' wages. A real debt, but manageable—and infinitely smaller than the first.

**The Response:**

- The king, moved with compassion, **forgave the entire debt** of the first servant.
- That same servant, moments later, seized his fellow servant by the throat, demanding payment of the tiny debt, and cast him into prison.

[ILL] Imagine a man drowning in debt—millions of dollars, completely beyond hope of repayment. His creditor, with astonishing generosity, tears up the contract and declares him free. That same afternoon, this forgiven man encounters a neighbor who owes him twenty dollars. He grabs him by the collar and has him arrested. How would we judge such behavior? Yet this is precisely what we do when we accept God's infinite forgiveness while refusing to forgive the comparatively small offenses others commit against us.

### The Heart of the Matter

> _"So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."_ (Matthew 18:35)

Jesus emphasizes: **from your hearts.** God is not interested in mere formalities—the cold, mechanical words "I forgive you" spoken while harboring resentment. True forgiveness releases the offender completely, just as God releases us.

Some say, "I can forgive, but I cannot forget." While we may not erase memories, the question is: do we hold onto them as weapons? Do we rehearse offenses and nurture grudges? This is not forgiveness but a counterfeit.

> _"Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord."_ (Leviticus 19:18)

> _"Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the Judge standeth before the door."_ (James 5:9)

[Q] **"But what about justice? Shouldn't wrongdoers face consequences?"**

Forgiveness does not mean excusing sin or pretending harm didn't occur. It means releasing our right to personal vengeance and trusting God to handle justice in His way and time. Paul clarifies: _"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord"_ (Romans 12:19). We can forgive while still maintaining appropriate boundaries and allowing natural consequences to take their course. Forgiveness frees _us_ from the poison of bitterness while leaving justice in God's hands.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Forgiveness Reflects God's Character

The entire great controversy centers on Satan's accusations against God's character and government. Satan claims God is arbitrary, severe, and unforgiving. Every time we extend mercy to those who wrong us, we demonstrate the true character of the God we serve.

> _"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."_ (Colossians 3:13)

Our standard is nothing less than Christ Himself. And how did Christ forgive? While we were yet enemies (Romans 5:8). Without demanding restitution first. Completely and eternally.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the repentant sinner brought his sacrifice to the outer court. There, at the altar of burnt offering, his sin was symbolically transferred to the innocent victim. But the priest then carried the blood into the holy place, representing Christ's ongoing ministry of applying His sacrifice to our lives.

**Forgiveness follows this pattern:**

- **Outer court (justification)**: God's legal pardon, freely given through Christ's sacrifice
- **Holy place (sanctification)**: The ongoing work of the Spirit, transforming our hearts to reflect God's forgiving nature
- **Most holy place (final atonement)**: The complete removal of sin's record and the sealing of a character fully reflecting Christ

We cannot claim the benefits of Christ's blood while refusing to let that blood transform our character. The same mercy that cleanses us must flow through us to others.

### Righteousness by Faith and Forgiveness

Here is a profound truth: **we cannot generate true forgiveness by human effort.** We may force ourselves to say the words, but only Christ living within can produce the genuine article.

> _"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."_ (Galatians 2:20)

When we find ourselves unable to forgive—when the wound is too deep, the offense too great—this is our invitation to surrender more fully to Christ. We confess our inability and ask Him to forgive _through_ us. This is righteousness by faith in action: not striving to manufacture a virtue we lack, but receiving from Christ the very grace we need.

## Practical Application

### The Spirit of Restoration

> _"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."_ (Galatians 6:1)

When dealing with those who have sinned, our goal is **restoration, not punishment**. Notice the qualifications:

- "Ye which are spiritual"—only those walking with God can properly restore others
- "In the spirit of meekness"—humility, not superiority
- "Considering thyself"—remembering our own vulnerability to sin

### Comfort After Confession

> _"So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."_ (2 Corinthians 2:7)

When someone confesses their wrong, our response should include active comfort. Satan seeks to crush the repentant soul with excessive guilt. We must counteract this by assuring them of forgiveness and helping them move forward.

### Mercy with Cheerfulness

> _"He that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness."_ (Romans 12:8)

Grudging, reluctant forgiveness is hardly forgiveness at all. God calls us to extend mercy **cheerfully**—with genuine joy, not begrudging obligation.

### Practical Steps for Forgiving

1. **Acknowledge the hurt honestly** before God—don't minimize or pretend it didn't matter
2. **Recognize the debt God has forgiven you**—meditate on the parable of the unforgiving servant
3. **Choose to release the offender**—this is an act of will, not a feeling
4. **Ask Christ to forgive through you**—invite His Spirit to produce what you cannot manufacture
5. **Refuse to rehearse the offense**—when memories arise, consciously release them to God
6. **Pray for the offender**—it is nearly impossible to hold hatred toward someone you genuinely pray for
7. **Look for opportunities to bless**—active kindness helps cement the forgiveness in your heart

## Appeal

> _"Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee?"_ (Matthew 18:33)

Friend, is there someone you have not forgiven? Perhaps a parent who wounded you deeply. A spouse who betrayed trust. A friend who abandoned you. A church member who spoke harsh words. The wound may be real, the offense genuine. But consider: what debt has God forgiven _you_?

Every sin we have ever committed was an infinite offense against the holy God of the universe. Every transgression helped nail Christ to the cross. Yet He looks upon us with compassion and says, "I forgive you freely. Go and do likewise."

Unforgiveness is a prison—but you hold the key. The one you refuse to forgive may not even know it; they go about their lives while you remain bound in bitterness. Today, Christ invites you to release them—and in doing so, to release yourself.

You cannot do this in your own strength. But as you surrender to Christ, asking Him to live His forgiving life through you, He will accomplish what seems impossible. The same Jesus who prayed, _"Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do"_ (Luke 23:34), will pray that prayer through you.

Will you let Him?

> _"And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."_ (Ephesians 4:32)
