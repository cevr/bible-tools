# Bible Study: The Change of the Sabbath

## Introduction

One of the most significant questions in Christianity concerns the Sabbath: Why do most Christians observe Sunday when the Bible clearly commands the seventh day? This study examines biblical and historical evidence revealing that Christ upheld every detail of God's law, and traces how the change from Sabbath to Sunday occurred—not by divine authority, but by human presumption. Understanding this history carries profound implications for worship and allegiance in the final conflict between truth and error.

## Core Truths

### Christ's Relationship to the Law

The prophet Isaiah foretold the Messiah's attitude toward God's moral law:

> _"The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the law, and make it honorable."_ (Isaiah 42:21)

**Magnify** means to enlarge, expand, and exalt—not diminish or abolish. Christ came to reveal the law's true depth and beauty, showing its spiritual dimensions reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart (Matthew 5:21–28).

Jesus Himself declared the permanence of every detail:

> _"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."_ (Matthew 5:18)

[DYK🔎] A "jot" (Hebrew _yod_) is the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet—similar to an apostrophe. A "tittle" is a tiny stroke distinguishing one Hebrew letter from another. Christ used the smallest possible elements to emphasize that nothing in God's law would be altered.

### The Weight of Teaching and Example

Christ warned about the consequences of diminishing any commandment:

> _"Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."_ (Matthew 5:19)

Notice the double responsibility: **doing** and **teaching**. Those who lead others away from God's commandments bear a solemn accountability.

### Love Upholds All Ten Commandments

When asked about the greatest commandment, Jesus summarized the law in two principles of love—but notice His conclusion:

> _"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."_ (Matthew 22:40)

**Hang** does not mean "replace." A door hangs on its hinges, but removing the hinges does not preserve the door—it destroys its function. Love is the principle that animates all ten commandments; the specific commands reveal how love is expressed toward God (first four) and toward man (last six).

The fourth commandment—"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8)—hangs on love for God, just as the other nine hang on love for God or neighbor.

## Deeper Truths

### The Prophecy of Attempted Change

Since Christ clearly upheld the Sabbath and taught His followers to do likewise (Matthew 24:20), how did the change to Sunday observance arise?

The prophet Daniel foresaw a power that would presume to alter God's sacred institutions:

> _"And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time."_ (Daniel 7:25)

Notice the precise language: this power would **think** to change God's times and laws—it would presume to do so, but actual change is impossible. God's law remains eternally binding in heaven regardless of human decrees (Psalm 119:89; Matthew 5:18).

[Q] **"Doesn't 'times and laws' refer to secular calendar systems or civil law?"**

Consider the context: this power speaks "against the Most High" and persecutes "the saints of the Most High." The "times and laws" belong to "the Most High"—they are God's sacred times and God's holy law. The only commandment dealing with sacred time is the fourth: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." This is the precise target of the prophecy.

### Historical Fulfillment: The Entrance of Sunday

The historical record confirms the gradual displacement of the biblical Sabbath:

**Constantine's Sunday Law (321 AD):**

> "Let all the judges and town people, and the occupation of all trades rest on the venerable day of the sun; but let those who are situated in the country, freely and at full liberty attend to the business of agriculture."

[DYK🔎] Constantine's decree never mentions Christianity, Christ, or the resurrection. It calls Sunday the "venerable day of the sun" (_venerabilis dies solis_)—a title from pagan sun worship. Constantine himself remained a worshiper of the sun god Sol Invictus and was not baptized until his deathbed. This was a civil law accommodating sun worship, not a divine command.

**The Council of Laodicea (364 AD):**

This church council decreed: "Christians ought not to Judaize, and to rest in the Sabbath, but to work in that day... if they shall be found to Judaize, let them be accursed from Christ."

Notice the progression: first a civil law made Sunday rest convenient; then a church council condemned Sabbath-keeping as heresy. Human authority—not divine revelation—drove this change.

### Rome's Own Testimony

The Roman Catholic Church openly claims responsibility for this change:

> "Question: How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and holy days?
> Answer: By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants allow of; and therefore they fondly contradict themselves by keeping Sunday strictly, and breaking most other feasts commanded by the same church." —_Abridgement of Christian Doctrine_

> "Question: Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to institute festivals of precept?
> Answer: Had she not such power, she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, **a change for which there is no scriptural authority**." —_Doctrinal Catechism_

[DYK🔎] Rome claims the Sunday change as the _mark_ of her ecclesiastical authority—proof that her tradition supersedes Scripture. This is not Protestant accusation; it is Rome's own boast.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Question of Authority

At the heart of the Sabbath question lies a deeper issue: **By what authority do we worship?**

> _"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey?"_ (Romans 6:16)

Every act of worship involves allegiance. When we observe the seventh-day Sabbath, we acknowledge the Creator's authority—"for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth" (Exodus 20:11). When we observe Sunday on the authority of church tradition, we acknowledge a different source of religious law.

Jesus warned of worship disconnected from divine command:

> _"But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."_ (Matthew 15:9)

This is solemn: worship offered sincerely but based on human tradition rather than divine command is **vain**—empty, profitless. God cannot accept what He has not authorized, regardless of the worshiper's sincerity.

### The Elijah Message

[ILL] In Elijah's day, Israel had not abandoned worship entirely—they had _blended_ worship of Jehovah with worship of Baal, the sun god. They thought they could honor both. Elijah's question cut through this confusion:

> _"How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word."_ (1 Kings 18:21)

The word "halt" means to limp, to be lame—trying to walk in two directions at once. Israel's silence revealed their divided hearts.

Today the same question presses: If the Lord is God, follow His Sabbath. But if Rome has authority to change God's law, then follow her Sunday. **There is no middle ground.** Attempted neutrality is itself a choice—a choice to follow human tradition while professing to follow Christ.

### The Sabbath and Sanctuary Truth

The Sabbath connects directly to the heavenly sanctuary where Christ ministers. In the Most Holy Place stands the ark containing God's law—including the fourth commandment unchanged (Revelation 11:19). Heaven's judgment proceeds from this unchanging standard.

The great controversy centers on whether God's law can be kept, whether His government is just, and whether His commands are reasonable. Satan has argued that the law is too strict, that humans cannot obey, and that God should change His requirements. By tampering with the Sabbath through human agency, Satan has sought to vindicate his accusations.

God's final generation will demonstrate that His law can be kept through Christ's enabling grace—that the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus go together (Revelation 14:12). The Sabbath becomes a test of loyalty, revealing whether we submit to God's authority or human presumption.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Sabbath

[Q] **"Isn't Sabbath-keeping legalism? Shouldn't we rest in Christ rather than a day?"**

True Sabbath observance is the _opposite_ of legalism. The Sabbath commemorates God's completed work in creation—we rest because He finished the work (Genesis 2:2–3). The Sabbath also points forward to God's completed work in redemption—we rest in Christ's finished sacrifice and ongoing ministry.

Legalism says, "I must earn God's favor through my works." True Sabbath-keeping says, "I cease from my works and trust in His." The Sabbath is a sign of sanctification—God making us holy:

> _"Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."_ (Ezekiel 20:12)

Resting in Christ and resting on His Sabbath are not competing ideas—they are complementary expressions of the same faith.

## Practical Application

### For Those Discovering This Truth

If you have kept Sunday in ignorance, believing it honored God, He has been gracious to you. But having learned the truth, you now face a decision. Jesus said:

> _"If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth."_ (John 9:41)

Light brings responsibility. The question is not "What have I always done?" but "What does God's Word say?"

### For Those Already Keeping the Sabbath

Remember that Sabbath observance without Sabbath _rest_—rest in Christ's righteousness—is mere legalism. The day is blessed because of the relationship it represents. Make the Sabbath a delight (Isaiah 58:13–14), entering by faith into God's rest (Hebrews 4:9–11).

### For All Believers

The Sabbath truth prepares us to stand in the final crisis when Sunday observance becomes a universal requirement. Those who understand the principles involved—who know _why_ the Sabbath matters—will not be shaken. They will choose to "obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

This truth calls us to:

1. **Study** the Sabbath question thoroughly from Scripture
2. **Decide** whom we will serve—God's Word or human tradition
3. **Act** on conviction, trusting Christ for strength and wisdom
4. **Share** this truth with others who are sincere but uninformed

## Appeal

> _"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."_ (Isaiah 8:20)

The evidence is clear: Christ honored and upheld the Sabbath. He never changed it. The change came through human authority—first pagan, then papal—claiming power to alter what God established at creation and wrote with His own finger on tables of stone.

How long will you halt between two opinions? If the Lord be God—if His Word is supreme—then follow Him, keep His Sabbath, and trust His righteousness. But if human tradition has authority to overrule divine command, then follow that tradition and bear its mark.

There is no neutrality in this conflict. The God who created you, who redeemed you by His blood, and who sanctifies you by His Spirit, calls you to complete loyalty. He asks not for your own strength—He offers His. He asks not for perfection before acceptance—He accepts you and then perfects you. He simply asks: **Will you trust Me? Will you obey Me? Will you be Mine?**

> _"If ye love me, keep my commandments."_ (John 14:15)
