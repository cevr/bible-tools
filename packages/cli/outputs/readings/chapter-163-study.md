# Bible Study: Exaltation

## Introduction

The great controversy between Christ and Satan hinges upon one central question: Who shall be exalted? This study reveals the divine pathway to true honor—a pathway that runs directly opposite to the world's wisdom. God alone deserves supreme exaltation, yet in His astonishing grace, He invites fallen humanity to share in His glory through the only door that opens upward: the gate of humility.

## Core Truths

### God Alone Deserves Supreme Exaltation

Scripture declares with unmistakable clarity that the Creator God occupies the throne above all existence:

> _"For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods."_ (Psalm 97:9)

> _"Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee."_ (Nehemiah 9:6)

**Why God alone?** Because He alone is the Creator and Sustainer of all things. Every breath we draw, every heartbeat, every star that burns in the heavens—all depend moment by moment upon His upholding power. Exaltation belongs to Him by right of creation and preservation.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "exalted" (_rum_) carries the meaning of being "lifted high" or "raised up"—the same root used when Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness (Numbers 21:9), foreshadowing Christ's exaltation on the cross (John 3:14).

### Christ's Pathway to Exaltation

The Son of God demonstrates the divine principle of exaltation through His own experience:

> _"The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour."_ (Acts 5:30-31)

Notice the sequence: **death on a tree**—then **exaltation to God's right hand**. Christ did not grasp at equality with God (Philippians 2:6); He emptied Himself, took the form of a servant, and humbled Himself unto death—"even the death of the cross" (Philippians 2:7-8). _Therefore_ God highly exalted Him.

This is the eternal law of the universe: **the way down is the way up.**

## Deeper Truths

### The Foundation of True Humility

What produces genuine humility in the human heart? Scripture reveals the answer:

> _"Charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up."_ (1 Corinthians 13:4)

**Love**—divine love shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5)—is the foundation of all true humility. Self-exaltation is, at its root, a love problem. When we love self supremely, we naturally seek our own glory. When Christ's love fills us, we naturally seek the glory of others and of God.

[Q] **"But isn't it natural to want recognition and honor?"**

Yes—and this is precisely the problem. Our fallen nature craves exaltation. But Jesus calls us to become "as this little child" (Matthew 18:4). A small child does not calculate his worth by comparison with others or seek status. He simply trusts, depends, and receives. This childlike spirit—not childish foolishness, but childlike trust and humility—marks the citizen of heaven.

### God's Merciful Means of Keeping Us Humble

Sometimes God permits trials specifically to protect us from the deadly poison of self-exaltation:

> _"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."_ (2 Corinthians 12:7)

Paul's "thorn" was a mercy in disguise. Without it, even this great apostle might have been destroyed by pride. God's discipline is not cruelty—it is love. He wounds our pride to heal our souls.

[ILL] Consider a farmer who carefully prunes his fruit tree. To the untrained eye, it looks like destruction—branches cut away, limbs shortened. But the farmer knows that unpruned trees grow wild and produce little fruit. The pruning knife, though painful, produces abundant harvest. So God prunes our pride that we might bear much fruit (John 15:2).

### The Weapons Against Self-Exaltation

How is the stronghold of pride to be conquered?

> _"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."_ (2 Corinthians 10:4-5)

Paul identifies these spiritual weapons in Ephesians 6:13-17:

- **The girdle of truth**—binding our lives with God's Word
- **The breastplate of righteousness**—Christ's character covering our hearts
- **The sandals of peace**—standing firm in reconciliation with God
- **The shield of faith**—deflecting Satan's fiery darts
- **The helmet of salvation**—protecting the mind with assurance
- **The sword of the Spirit**—God's Word wielded offensively

[DYK🔎] The Roman soldier's girdle was not merely decorative—it gathered the loose robes for battle and held the scabbard. Without it, the soldier was tangled and defenseless. So truth holds everything together in the Christian's warfare against pride.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Origin of Self-Exaltation

The cosmic conflict began with one being's determination to exalt himself:

> _"For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High."_ (Isaiah 14:13-14)

Five times Lucifer said "**I will**"—and in that self-centered determination, sin was born. Self-exaltation is not merely a character flaw; it is the very essence of rebellion against God. It is Satan's own spirit transplanted into human hearts.

### The Climax of Self-Exaltation in History

Scripture reveals that this satanic principle would find its fullest expression in an earthly system:

> _"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."_ (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4)

Here is self-exaltation carried to its ultimate extreme—a religious power claiming divine prerogatives, presuming to change God's eternal law (Daniel 7:25), and receiving the worship that belongs to the Creator alone. This is the papacy, the "man of sin," whose spirit of self-exaltation stands in direct contrast to the humble Lamb who was slain.

[DYK🔎] The papal title "Vicar of Christ" claims the right to stand in Christ's place on earth. Yet Scripture reveals that Christ Himself is our only Mediator (1 Timothy 2:5), and the Holy Spirit—not any human pontiff—is His representative (John 14:16-17, 26).

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest never entered the Most Holy Place in his own name or by his own merit. He came clothed in garments of glory and beauty representing Christ, bearing the blood of the sacrifice, with incense burning to represent the merits of the Redeemer.

**Humility** was the constant lesson. Even the high priest was merely a representative—pointing forward to the true High Priest who now ministers in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 8:1-2).

We approach God today the same way: not in our own righteousness, not exalting our own works, but hidden in Christ, covered by His merits, dependent entirely upon His intercession. This is righteousness by faith—the death of self-exaltation and the life of Christ-dependence.

## Practical Application

### The Daily Battle Against Pride

Self-exaltation is not conquered once for all; it must be surrendered moment by moment. Consider these practical steps:

1. **Begin each day with submission**: Before your feet touch the floor, surrender your heart to God. Say with purpose: "Not my will, but Thine be done" (Luke 22:42).

2. **Practice giving honor to others**: "In lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves" (Philippians 2:3). Actively look for opportunities to lift others up.

3. **Welcome correction**: A humble heart receives reproof as a gift. "Reproofs of instruction are the way of life" (Proverbs 6:23).

4. **Guard your thoughts**: "Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:5). When pride suggests, "I deserve recognition," answer with Scripture: "What hast thou that thou didst not receive?" (1 Corinthians 4:7).

5. **Seek glory only in God's favor**: "In thy favor our horn shall be exalted" (Psalm 89:17). The approval of heaven is worth infinitely more than the applause of earth.

[Q] **"What if I struggle with feelings of inferiority rather than pride?"**

False humility and proud self-deprecation are also forms of self-focus. True humility is not thinking less of yourself—it is thinking of yourself less. When Christ fills the vision, we neither exalt nor despise ourselves; we simply forget ourselves in loving service to God and others. Our worth is found not in our achievements or failures, but in the infinite price paid for our redemption (1 Corinthians 6:20).

## Appeal

> _"Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it."_ (Psalm 37:34)

The humble shall be exalted—not in this world's fleeting honors, but in the eternal kingdom. When the proud are brought low and every "high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God" is cast down, then those who humbled themselves as little children shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father (Matthew 13:43).

Will you choose today the path of humility? Will you lay down the weapons of self-promotion and take up the armor of God? The way up is the way down. The cross before the crown. Death to self before resurrection to glory.

Jesus walked this path before you. He invites you to follow:

> _"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls."_ (Matthew 11:29)

In His lowliness is your rest. In His exaltation is your hope. Trust Him today.
