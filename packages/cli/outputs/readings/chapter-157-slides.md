## Slide 1 – Q1: The Warning Against Covetousness

- **Question:** In what way has the Lord spoken of covetousness?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:15 – “And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of
  covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things
  which he possesseth.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Definition & Deception)

- **A Double Warning:**
  - Jesus says both "Take heed" and "beware," suggesting a subtle, deceptive
    foe.
  - It violates the Tenth Commandment regarding inward desire.
  - Exodus 20:17 – “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
    covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his
    ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.”
- **The Definition:**
  - Strong, self-centered desire for what belongs to another.
  - Excessive love for material gain; the worship of "self" over God.
- **The Great Deception:**
  - The world defines success by ownership (bank accounts, goods).
  - Christ defines life by relationship with God and character development.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points (The Root of Sin)

- **The Original Sin:**
  - Covetousness began with Lucifer seeking God’s position.
  - Isaiah 14:13–14 – “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into
    heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the
    most High.”
- **The Contrast:**
  - Covetousness is the opposite of the spirit of Christ.
  - 2 Corinthians 8:9 – “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that,
    though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his
    poverty might be rich.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **Saltwater Thirst:**
  - Covetousness is like a shipwrecked sailor drinking saltwater.
  - It looks like water, but it cannot quench thirst.
  - Drinking it only dehydrates the body further and increases the agony.
  - **Lesson:** The more a lover of money gets, the more he wants, until his
    spiritual life completely dries up.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Rich Fool

- **Question:** What showed this principle to be strong in the rich man who had
  already more than he knew how well to take care of?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:18, 19 – “And he said, This will I do: I will pull down
  my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my
  goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many
  years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (Self-Centeredness)

- **The Language of Self:**
  - Note the repetition: "I will do," "I will pull down," "my barns," "my
    goods," "my soul."
  - His universe revolved entirely around himself.
  - He viewed abundance as a means for pampering self, not blessing others.
- **The Fatal Mistake:**
  - He confused his "goods" with his "good."
  - He planned for earth but made no provision for eternity.
- **Forgetting the Source:**
  - He failed to acknowledge God as the Giver of the harvest.
  - When we forget God is the Owner, we begin to hoard.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Dead Sea:**
  - The Sea of Galilee receives water and flows out; it teems with life.
  - The Dead Sea receives water but has no outlet; it keeps every drop.
  - **Result:** The water is stagnant, salty, and dead.
  - **Lesson:** The heart that hoards God's blessings without flowing out to
    others becomes spiritually dead.

## Slide 8 – Q3: God’s Judgment

- **Question:** But what did God say to him?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:20 – “But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy
  soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be, which thou
  hast provided?”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Judgment & Accountability)

- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - Life is a probation; we do not know when our names will come up in review.
  - Hebrews 9:27 – “And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
    the judgment.”
- **Accountability:**
  - "Thy soul shall be required" implies a debt. We are stewards, not owners.
  - We must give an account of whether we used God's goods for self or for His
    kingdom.
- **The Futility of Hoarding:**
  - Wealth cannot cross the border of death.
  - 1 Timothy 6:7 – “For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain
    we can carry nothing out.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: The Application

- **Question:** What application of this parable did the Saviour make?
- **Key Text:** Luke 12:21 – “So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and
  is not rich toward God.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Rich Toward God)

- **True Riches:**
  - Being "rich toward God" means possessing faith and love.
  - Revelation 3:18 – “I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that
    thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed...”
  - It involves investing means in God’s work to save souls (Matthew 6:19–21).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The justified believer knows he is bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:20).
  - The Holy Spirit replaces the "stony heart" of selfishness with a "heart of
    flesh."
  - Ezekiel 36:26 – “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I
    put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and
    I will give you an heart of flesh.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Covetousness as Idolatry

- **Question:** What does the apostle call covetousness?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:5 – “Mortify therefore your members which are upon
  the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence,
  and covetousness, which is idolatry.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points (Idolatry Defined)

- **The Definition of Idolatry:**
  - Giving supreme love, trust, and service to any created thing rather than
    God.
- **The Modern Idol:**
  - A man may not bow to a statue, but if he loves money or career more than
    obeying God, he is an idolater.
  - Matthew 6:24 – “No man can serve two masters... Ye cannot serve God and
    mammon.”
- **Breaking the Commandments:**
  - Covetousness (10th Commandment) ultimately breaks the 1st Commandment.
  - Exodus 20:3 – “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Monkey's Trap:**
  - Hunters place a nut inside a jar with a narrow neck.
  - The monkey grabs the nut but cannot pull its fist out.
  - To be free, it must let go of the nut.
  - Because it refuses to let go, it remains trapped and is captured.
  - **Lesson:** Sinners are often trapped by the devil because they refuse to
    let go of the world's trinkets.

## Slide 15 – Q6: The Consequences

- **Question:** What does he say the things here enumerated have brought upon
  mankind?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:6 – “For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh
  on the children of disobedience.”

## Slide 16 – Q6: Key Points (Wrath & Sanctuary Cleansing)

- **The Wrath of God:**
  - God’s necessary reaction against sin, which destroys His creation.
  - This culminates in the seven last plagues (Revelation 15:1).
- **Sanctuary Truth:**
  - Christ is ministering in the heavenly sanctuary to _remove_ sins from our
    record and lives.
  - Clinging to covetousness refuses the remedy.
- **Sanctification:**
  - Justification forgives the past.
  - Sanctification involves the Spirit rooting out deep-seated selfishness so we
    can stand in the judgment.

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Example of Judas

- **Question:** What did Judas' covetousness lead him to do?
- **Key Text:** Mark 14:10, 11 – “And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went
  unto the chief priests, to betray Him to them. And when they heard it, they
  were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might
  conveniently betray Him.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (The Progression of Sin)

- **Small Beginnings:**
  - Judas started by pilfering from the money bag, cherishing a secret sin (John
    12:6).
- **Hardening the Heart:**
  - Continued sin seared his conscience; love of money crowded out love for
    Jesus.
- **The Final Act:**
  - He sold the Lord for the price of a slave.
  - Exodus 21:32 – “If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall
    give unto their master thirty shekels of silver...”
- **Lesson:** If the love of the world is not expelled by Christ, it will lead
  us to betray Him.

## Slide 19 – Q8: God’s View of the Covetous

- **Question:** How does the lord regard the covetous man?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 10:3 – “For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and
  blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Key Points (Abhorring Evil)

- **Meaning of "Abhor":**
  - To regard with extreme repugnance or loathing.
- **God’s Nature vs. Covetousness:**
  - God is love (1 John 4:8); His nature is self-sacrificing.
  - Covetousness is self-seeking and incompatible with heaven.
- **World vs. God:**
  - The world "blesseth the covetous" (praises the ruthless rich).
  - The Lord "abhorreth" them.
  - We must take our standard from the Sanctuary, not society.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Qualifications for Leadership

- **Question:** Then can God trust such men to bear responsibilities in His
  work?
- **Key Text:** Exodus 18:21 – “Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the
  people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and
  place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds,
  rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Key Points (Leadership Standards)

- **Required Character:**
  - 1. Fear God (Reverence).
  - 2. Men of Truth (Integrity).
  - 3. Hating Covetousness (Not just avoiding, but hating it).
- **Why This Requirement?**
  - Lovers of money will compromise truth for gain (like Balaam).
  - Leaders must make decisions based on principle, not profit.
- **A Work of Grace:**
  - Only the grace of Christ can make a human heart genuinely _hate_
    selfishness.

## Slide 23 – Q10: The Danger of Wealth

- **Question:** What is certain to follow the desire to be rich?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:9 – “But they that will be rich fall into temptation
  and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in
  destruction and perdition.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Key Points (The Snare)

- **The "Will" to be Rich:**
  - The danger is the determination to be rich.
  - This pursuit leads to compromises: dishonesty, Sabbath-breaking, neglect of
    prayer.
- **Destruction:**
  - The imagery is of drowning; cares and lusts pull the man under.
- **The Remedy:**
  - Godliness with contentment.
  - 1 Timothy 6:6 – “But godliness with contentment is great gain.”
  - Seek first the Kingdom of God (Matthew 6:33).

## Slide 25 – Q11: Last Day Sins

- **Question:** Will covetousness be one of the specially prevalent sins of the
  last days?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:1, 2 – “This know also, that in the last days
  perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves,
  covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers...”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Key Points (The Laodicean State)

- **Prophetic Fulfillment:**
  - "Lovers of own selves" and "covetous" top the list of last-day sins.
- **The Laodicean Condition:**
  - Revelation 3:17 – “Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,
    and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
    miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.”
  - Materialism blinds the church to its spiritual nakedness.
- **The Call:**
  - We must come out of Babylon's spirit of greed.

## Slide 27 – Q12: The Judgment of Wealth

- **Question:** What will these selfish ones be doing for themselves?
- **Key Text:** James 5:3 – “Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of
  them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as It were fire.
  Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points (The Witness Against Us)

- **Cankered Gold:**
  - Unused wealth "rusts" spiritually.
  - Money that should have supported the gospel becomes a witness against the
    hoarder.
- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - The books of record show how we used entrusted means.
  - Hoarded wealth testifies to selfishness while God's cause suffered.
- **Irony:**
  - Men heap treasure for safety in the last days, but that treasure becomes the
    fuel for their destruction.

## Slide 29 – Q13: Instruction to the Rich

- **Question:** What admonition does the apostle give to the rich?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:17, 18 – “Charge them that are rich in this world,
  that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living
  God... that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to
  distribute, willing to communicate.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points (The Antidote)

- **Shift in Trust:**
  - Do not trust in the gift, but in the Giver.
- **Action:**
  - Be "ready to distribute" and "willing to communicate" (share).
- **Practical Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Active benevolence breaks the hold of selfishness.
  - It is Christ's love flowing through the believer to the world.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Flowing Stream:**
  - Water that flows rapidly remains clear and pure.
  - Water that stops flowing becomes a swamp.
  - **Lesson:** To keep the heart pure, the stream of benevolence must be kept
    flowing. We give because Christ is in us, and His nature is to give.

## Slide 32 – Q14: The Law of Giving

- **Question:** What does the Lord say of giving?
- **Key Text:** Acts 20:35 – “I have showed you all things, how that so laboring
  ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how
  He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.”

## Slide 33 – Q14: Key Points (The Blessed Life)

- **The Law of Life:**
  - God gives life and breath; nature (sun, rain, plants) exists to give.
  - Only the fallen human heart seeks to "get."
- **The Blessing:**
  - Self-forgetful giving brings a joy that the covetous never know—the joy of
    being like Jesus.
- **Sanctuary Reflection:**
  - The Cross is the supreme example.
  - When we give, we enter into fellowship with His sufferings and love.

## Slide 34 – Q15: Ownership

- **Question:** To whom does the money we have belong?
- **Key Text:** Haggai 2:8 – “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith
  the Lord of hosts.”

## Slide 35 – Q15: Key Points (Stewardship Foundation)

- **God's Ownership:**
  - We created nothing and own nothing.
  - Deuteronomy 8:18 – “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he
    that giveth thee power to get wealth...”
- **Stewardship Defined:**
  - The responsible management of resources that belong to someone else.
- **Practical Application:**
  - Returning tithe and giving offerings acknowledges God's sovereignty.
  - Malachi 3:8 – “Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say,
    Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.”

## Slide 36 – Q16: Managing God’s Treasures

- **Question:** Men are simply stewards of God's treasures. (Luke 16:1-8). As
  such, what does the Lord admonish us to do?
- **Key Text 1:** Luke 16:9 – “And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of
  the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
  everlasting habitations.”
- **Key Text 2:** 1 Peter 4:10 – “As every man hath received the gift, even so
  minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of
  God.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Key Points (Investing in Eternity)

- **Friends for Eternity:**
  - Use means to spread the gospel (Bibles, missions, churches).
  - When we die ("fail"), souls saved through our sacrifice will welcome us into
    heaven.
- **Manifold Grace:**
  - Whether money, talent, or time, we are channels of God's grace.
  - We must "minister" (serve) these gifts to others.

## Slide 38 – Q17: The Spirit of Sacrifice

- **Question:** How does God regard the spirit of sacrifice?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 4:18, 19 – “I am full, having received of
  Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a
  sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God. But my God shall supply all your
  need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points (Worship & Promise)

- **Sanctuary Language:**
  - Paul calls the gift "an odor of a sweet smell."
  - Acts of self-denial and generosity are viewed by Heaven as acts of worship.
- **The Conditional Promise:**
  - "God shall supply all your need" (v. 19) is promised to those who sacrifice
    (v. 18).
  - When we take care of God's business, He takes care of ours.

## Slide 40 – Q18: The Gathering of the Saints

- **Question:** Whom will Christ gather to Himself when He comes?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 50:4, 5 – “He shall call to the heavens from above, and to
  the earth, that He may judge His people. Gather My saints together unto Me;
  those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”

## Slide 41 – Q18: Key Points (Covenant & Final Test)

- **Covenant by Sacrifice:**
  - Ratified by Christ's sacrifice.
  - We enter it by becoming "living sacrifices" (Romans 12:1).
- **Total Surrender:**
  - There is no Christianity without sacrifice; we must lay all on the altar.
- **The Final Test:**
  - In the last days, economic sanctions will come (Revelation 13:17 – no buying
    or selling).
  - Only those who have cut dependence on worldly treasure and made a "covenant
    by sacrifice" will stand.

## Slide 42 – Q19: Joint Heirs

- **Question:** Heaven gave its choicest Treasure to redeem us. (1 Peter 1:18,
  19). Will we not partake of the same spirit, if we are God's children?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:17 – “And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
  joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also
  glorified together.”

## Slide 43 – Q19: Key Points (Victory in Christ)

- **Joint Heirs:**
  - To share His inheritance, we must share His spirit.
  - We cannot possess Christ's character while retaining the world's spirit.
- **Suffering with Him:**
  - Saying "no" to selfish desires to say "yes" to the needs of others.
- **Victory:**
  - 2 Corinthians 5:14 – “For the love of Christ constraineth us...”
  - This is the triumph of Righteousness by Faith: Christ living His
    self-sacrificing life in us.
