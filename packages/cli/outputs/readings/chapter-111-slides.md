## Slide 1 – Q1: Paul’s Great Desire

- **Question:** When writing to the Philippians, what desire did the apostle
  Paul express?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 1:23 – “For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a
  desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **A Heart Surrendered:**
  - Paul describes being in a “strait,” meaning he is hemmed in by two powerful,
    opposing motivations.
  - His personal desire was to leave behind the trials and weariness of this
    life to reach the ultimate goal: union with Christ.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - This longing reveals the intimacy of **Righteousness by Faith**.
  - To the believer, Christ is not a distant figure but a personal friend and
    the source of life.
- **The Meaning of “Depart”:**
  - The Greek word used here refers to unmooring a ship or striking down a tent.
  - Paul viewed his body as a temporary tabernacle (2 Corinthians 5:1 – “For we
    know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
    building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Sailor’s Longing:**
  - Imagine a sailor at sea, battling storms and danger for months.
  - As the ship nears the harbor, he sees the lights of his home.
  - He has a duty to the ship, but his heart desperately desires to “depart” and
    be with his family.
  - His desire is not to drown in the water (death itself), but to reach the
    destination where his loved ones wait.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Two Conditions

- **Question:** What were the two conditions between which the apostle was thus
  in difficulty?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 1:21 – “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is
  gain.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (To Live is Christ)

- **The Dilemma:**
  - The two conditions pressing on Paul were **life** (continued ministry) and
    **death** (rest from labor).
- **“To Live is Christ” (Sanctification):**
  - This is a concise summary of **Sanctification**: the Holy Spirit imparting
    Christ’s character to the believer.
  - Paul’s life was not his own; Jesus lived through him.
  - Galatians 2:20 – “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
    live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points (To Die is Gain)

- **“To Die is Gain”:**
  - This does not mean immediate entry into heaven.
  - For a man who had been stoned, beaten, and imprisoned, death meant the
    “gain” of absolute rest.
  - It meant the cessation of burdens and the sealing of his life’s testimony.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Worker and the Whistle:**
  - Consider a laborer working in a scorching field, dedicated to his master
    (“to live is Christ”).
  - However, his body aches and he is exhausted.
  - When the evening whistle blows (“to die”), it represents “gain.”
  - He does not hate the work, but he longs for the rest and the wages secured
    at the end of the day.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Meaning of “Depart”

- **Question:** What does he mean by the words “to depart”?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 4:6 – “For I am now ready to be offered, and the time
  of my departure is at hand.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points

- **Physical Death as a Journey:**
  - Paul refers to his impending physical death.
  - Biblical death is often likened to sleep or a departure, not the final end.
  - It is the exit from this world of sin; the arrival depends on the
    resurrection.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Paul speaks of being “offered” (poured out).
  - In the **Sanctuary** service, the drink offering was poured out around the
    altar, symbolizing a life fully consumed in service to God.
  - Paul viewed his death as a final act of worship.

## Slide 10 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Unmooring:**
  - The Greek word for “departure” (_analusis_) describes unmooring a ship to
    set sail.
  - When a ship leaves the dock, it disappears from the sight of those on shore,
    but it has not ceased to exist.
  - It is simply voyaging toward the next port.
  - Death is the unmooring from the shores of this sinful earth.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Magnifying Christ

- **Question:** What was sure to the cause of Christ, whether Paul lived or
  died?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 1:20 – “According to my earnest expectation and my
  hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as
  always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by
  life, or by death.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Key Points

- **Christ Magnified:**
  - Paul’s supreme objective was the glory of Jesus, not his own survival.
  - **By Life:** Preaching the Gospel and proving God’s power to keep a man from
    sinning.
  - **By Death:** A martyr’s unwavering faith testifies to the reality of the
    Truth.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - Satan claims men serve God only for selfish gain (Job 1:9 – “Then Satan
    answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?”).
  - When a believer is willing to die rather than disobey, Satan’s accusations
    are refuted.

## Slide 13 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Telescope:**
  - A telescope does not generate its own light; it catches the light of a
    distant star and magnifies it.
  - Paul realized his body was like a telescope.
  - Whether standing tall (life) or being broken down (death), as long as the
    lens focused on Jesus, the world would see Christ clearly.

## Slide 14 – Q5: Expressing the Sentiment

- **Question:** In what other words does he express the same sentiment?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 1:21 – “For to me to live is Christ, and to die is
  gain.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Key Points

- **Two Aspects of “Gain”:**
  1.  **Gain to Paul:** Relief from the “thorn in the flesh” and the struggle
      against darkness.
  2.  **Gain to the Cause:** The blood of martyrs is the seed of the church; his
      death would seal his testimony.
- **The Secured Reward:**
  - The gain is not becoming a disembodied spirit, but finishing the race.
  - 2 Timothy 4:8 – “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of
    righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that
    day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.”

## Slide 16 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Artist’s Masterpiece:**
  - When an artist finishes a masterpiece, he lays down his brush.
  - The work is done; he gains the satisfaction of completion.
  - Paul’s life was a canvas; death was merely laying down the brush because the
    picture of Christ in his character was complete.

## Slide 17 – Q6: Inclined to Life

- **Question:** What, then, inclined Paul to the side of life?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 1:24 – “Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more
  needful for you.”

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **Love for the Church:**
  - Paul chose to live because the believers still needed his guidance and
    encouragement.
- **Application of Righteousness by Faith:**
  - True faith works by love (Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither
    circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh
    by love.”).
  - A justified man does not live for himself.
  - Like Jesus, who left heaven to minister, Paul postponed his own relief to
    serve others.

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Mother’s Vigil:**
  - A mother sitting by a sick child is desperate for sleep.
  - Her body screams for rest, yet she stays awake.
  - Her presence is “more needful” for the child.
  - Paul chose to “stay awake” in this world of suffering for the sake of his
    spiritual children.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Inclined to Depart

- **Question:** What inclined him to prefer to depart, or lay down this life?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 1:23 – “For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a
  desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.”

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **Desire for Presence:**
  - Paul knew that while in the mortal body, he was “absent from the Lord” in a
    literal sense (2 Corinthians 5:6).
  - He links departure (death) with being with Christ because there is no
    conscious interval between them for the believer.
- **The Hope of Glory:**
  - Paul longed for the mortal to put on immortality (1 Corinthians 15:53).
  - This longing for God’s presence is the mark of a converted heart.

## Slide 22 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Long Journey Home:**
  - If a man travels a long distance to see his king, the journey is exhausting.
  - He desires the journey to end _so that_ he may see the king.
  - The end of the journey (death) is the necessary step to the meeting
    (resurrection).

## Slide 23 – Q8: Timing of Reunion

- **Question:** How long after his departure before he would be with Christ?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord himself shall descend from
  heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of
  God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”

## Slide 24 – Q8: Key Points

- **Reunion at the Second Coming:**
  - Paul consistently pointed to “that day” (the Resurrection) as the time of
    reward.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:17 – “Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught
    up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
    shall we ever be with the Lord.”
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - Christ is currently interceding in the Heavenly Sanctuary.
  - We do not go to Him individually at death; He comes for us collectively when
    His work is finished.

## Slide 25 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Alarm Clock:**
  - When you sleep at night, hours pass without your knowledge.
  - The moment you fall asleep and the moment the alarm rings seem connected,
    though separated by time.
  - So it is with death and the resurrection: the next conscious moment after
    death is the return of Christ.

## Slide 26 – Q9: The “Far Better” Choice

- **Question:** If none go to be with Christ till after the resurrection, how
  would it have been better for Paul, so far as he was concerned, to depart
  then, rather than live on?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 9:5 – “For the living know that they shall die: but
  the dead know not any thing...”

## Slide 27 – Q9: Key Points

- **The Nature of Death:**
  - Death is a state of unconsciousness where thoughts perish (Psalm 146:4 –
    “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his
    thoughts perish.”).
- **Subjective Time:**
  - If Paul died in the first century, he rests in sleep.
  - To him, the time between death and the resurrection feels like the twinkling
    of an eye.
  - He effectively bypasses centuries of history and persecution.
- **The Victory:**
  - He rests from his labors immediately, and his next waking moment is the
    glorious Resurrection.

## Slide 28 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Surgery:**
  - When a patient goes under anesthesia, surgery may take hours.
  - To the patient, they close their eyes and instantly wake up in recovery.
  - They skipped the waiting and the pain.
  - For Paul, death was the anesthesia; the Resurrection is waking up in the
    recovery of eternal life.
