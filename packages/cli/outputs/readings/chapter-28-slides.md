## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Will for the Believer

- **Question:** Has God made known His will concerning the condition of His
  people?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
  sanctification.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Understanding Sanctification

- **God’s Purpose:**
  - God is not satisfied with merely forgiving us; He intends to transform us.
  - Just as a builder designs a house to be inhabited, God designs the human
    soul to be a dwelling place for His Spirit (Romans 8:29).
- **Definition of Sanctification:**
  - It is the ongoing work of God’s grace.
  - The believer is separated from sin and dedicated entirely to God.
  - The result is a character that reflects the holiness of Christ (1
    Thessalonians 5:23).
- **The Standard:**
  - The standard is nothing less than the character of God Himself, as revealed
    in His law and the life of Jesus.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Vessel in the Palace:**
  - Imagine a cup in a royal palace.
  - **Justification:** The King declares the cup belongs to Him.
  - **Sanctification:** The cup is washed clean and set aside _solely_ for the
    King’s use.
  - It must never hold common or unclean things again; it is dedicated
    exclusively to the King.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Source of Power

- **Question:** Can man accomplish this work for himself?
- **Key Text:** John 15:5 – “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth
  in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can
  do nothing.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Foundation of Righteousness by Faith

- **Total Dependence:**
  - A branch cannot generate its own sap; it must receive it from the vine.
  - We cannot manufacture righteousness; we depend on a vital connection with
    Jesus for every impulse of goodness.
- **Fruit, Not Root:**
  - A holy life is the _fruit_ of salvation, not the _root_.
  - We do not sanctify ourselves to be accepted; we are accepted through Christ,
    and His life produces sanctification (Galatians 2:20).
- **The Meaning of “Nothing”:**
  - Jesus does not say we can do "a little" without Him.
  - Any obedience attempted apart from the indwelling Christ is merely
    legalism—an outward form without saving power.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Glove:**
  - A glove lying on a table has the shape of a hand but no life or power.
  - It cannot pick up a Bible or shake a hand on its own.
  - Only when a living hand fills the glove can it work.
  - **Lesson:** We are the glove; Christ is the hand. Sanctification is simply
    His life moving within us.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Medium of Change

- **Question:** Through what medium is this change wrought?
- **Key Text:** John 17:19 – “And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they
  also might be sanctified through the truth.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: The Power of the Word

- **The Agent of Cleansing:**
  - The Bible is "quick, and powerful" (Hebrews 4:12 – “For the word of God is
    quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword...” ).
  - When received by faith, the Word changes the nature of the receiver (1 Peter
    1:23).
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the priest washed at the laver before entering the
    Holy Place.
  - Today, Christ our High Priest washes His church "with the washing of water
    by the word" (Ephesians 5:26).
- **Experimental Knowledge:**
  - It is not enough to intellectually know the truth.
  - We must be "sanctified through" it—allowing it to conquer our prejudices and
    govern our conscience.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Our Attitude Toward Truth

- **Question:** In order to enjoy sanctification, what attitude must one assume
  toward the truth?
- **Key Text:** 2 Thessalonians 2:13 – “But we are bound to give thanks alway to
  God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning
  chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
  truth.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Divine Power and Human Choice

- **Sanctification of the Spirit (God’s Part):**
  - The Holy Spirit applies the blood of Christ to the conscience.
  - He empowers the human will to do right (Ezekiel 36:27).
- **Belief of the Truth (Man’s Part):**
  - This is not a passive nod, but an active, grasping faith.
  - We must accept God’s warnings and promises as a reality for _us_ personally.
- **The Balance:**
  - God provides the grace; man exercises the faith.
  - God will not sanctify us against our will; we must choose to believe and
    act.

## Slide 11 – Q5: Acknowledgment vs. Obedience

- **Question:** But is a simple acknowledgment of God's requirements enough to
  secure this desirable boon?
- **Key Text:** 1 Peter 1:2 – “Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the
  Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of
  the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Goal of the Gospel

- **Unto Obedience:**
  - The purpose of the Gospel is to bring us back into harmony with God’s Law.
  - **Justification** (declared righteous) leads to **Sanctification** (made
    righteous), resulting in loving obedience (Romans 8:3–4).
- **Sprinkling of the Blood (Sanctuary Theme):**
  - In the sanctuary, blood ratified the covenant.
  - Our obedience is always mingled with the merits of Christ; even our best
    works need His covering to be acceptable.
- **Faith Works:**
  - Faith that does not lead to obedience is dead (James 2:26 – “For as the body
    without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”).

## Slide 13 – Q6: The Necessary Change

- **Question:** What change is necessary to make us branches of the Vine?
- **Key Text:** 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a
  new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: The New Birth

- **Radical Transformation:**
  - Christianity is not a modification of the old nature; it is the implantation
    of a new one.
  - "Old things" (love of sin, selfishness) die; "new things" (love for God,
    purity) take their place.
- **The Heart Work:**
  - The stony heart is removed, and a heart of flesh is given (Ezekiel 36:26).
  - **Conversion:** A turning around—turning the back to the world and the face
    toward God.

## Slide 15 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Caterpillar:**
  - A caterpillar does not learn to fly by taking classes or trying harder to
    jump.
  - It must undergo a _metamorphosis_ to become a butterfly.
  - It becomes a "new creature."
  - **Lesson:** The sinner must be born again to live the life of a saint.

## Slide 16 – Q7: Extent of Sanctification

- **Question:** Then how much of the individual is affected by sanctification?
- **Key Text:** 1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “And the very God of peace sanctify you
  wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved
  blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Wholeness and Health

- **Spirit:** The higher powers of the mind, conscience, and connection with
  God.
- **Soul:** The affections, emotions, and personality.
- **Body:** The physical dwelling place of the Holy Spirit.
- **Health Reform:**
  - We cannot pollute the body (alcohol, tobacco, unclean foods) and expect the
    mind to be fully sanctified.
  - Physical habits affect spiritual perception.
  - To prepare for the coming of the Lord, the body must be subject to the laws
    of life.

## Slide 18 – Q8: The Prerequisite

- **Question:** Before we can enjoy this great honor, what must we have?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 15:33 – “The fear of the Lord is the instruction of
  wisdom; and before honor is humility.”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Humility and Christ’s Example

- **Emptying Self:**
  - We cannot be filled with Christ while we are full of self.
  - Spiritual growth begins by recognizing our own spiritual poverty (Matthew
    5:3).
- **The Stairway:**
  - In the Kingdom of Heaven, to go up, one must go down into the valley of
    humiliation.
- **Christ’s Example:**
  - Jesus "humbled himself, and became obedient unto death" (Philippians 2:8).
    We follow by reckoning our old self dead.

## Slide 20 – Q9: Our Duty and Focus

- **Question:** When united to Christ, what is our duty?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:1, 2 – “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those
  things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set
  your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: The Heavenly Sanctuary

- **Focus on the Intercessor:**
  - Paul directs our eyes to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ sits at the
    right hand of God (Hebrews 8:1–2).
- **The Expulsive Power of a New Affection:**
  - We overcome love for the world by seeing the greater beauty of Jesus and His
    work in heaven.
  - Since we are "risen with Him" (Romans 6:4), our citizenship is in heaven.

## Slide 22 – Q10: The Grace of Meekness

- **Question:** Besides humility, what other grace is necessary?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 4:1, 2 – “I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord,
  beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, With
  all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in
  love.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Walking Worthy

- **Meekness Defined:**
  - Not weakness, but strength under control.
  - The ability to endure injury without resentment and submit to God without
    murmuring.
- **Consistency:**
  - It is inconsistent to claim to be a child of the King while displaying a
    proud or harsh spirit.
  - The strongest proof of Christianity is a loving and lovable Christian.

## Slide 24 – Q11: The Mind of Christ

- **Question:** In all things, what should be our mind?
- **Key Text:** Philippians 2:5 – “Let this mind be in you, which was also in
  Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Imparted Righteousness

- **More than Imitation:**
  - Sanctification is not just acting like Jesus; it is having His thoughts and
    Spirit imparted to us.
- **Self-Renunciation:**
  - The "mind of Christ" is the spirit of self-sacrificing love.
  - It seeks the glory of God and the good of others rather than
    self-advancement.

## Slide 26 – Q12: The Surrender of the Will

- **Question:** Then what response can be sincerely made?
- **Key Text:** Luke 22:42 – “Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this
  cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.”

## Slide 27 – Q12: The Battleground of the Soul

- **The Governing Power:**
  - The will is the governing power of human nature. God asks for our will, not
    just our feelings.
- **Gethsemane:**
  - Jesus conquered by surrendering His human desire for safety to the divine
    plan of redemption.
- **Victory:**
  - When we can sincerely say, "Not my will, but Thine," the battle is won.
  - God then works in us "to will and to do of his good pleasure" (Philippians
    2:13).

## Slide 28 – Q13: God’s Response to Surrender

- **Question:** When in this attitude, what will God do for the petitioner?
- **Key Text:** John 9:31 – “Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if
  any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: Harmony in Prayer

- **The Barrier of Sin:**
  - Those who _cherish_ sin and rebellion cut off the channel of communication
    (Psalm 66:18 – “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear
    me”).
- **Alignment:**
  - Prayer is not intended to change God’s mind, but to bring us into harmony
    with Him.
  - When we do His will, our prayers align with His purposes, and He opens
    heaven’s storehouse.

## Slide 30 – Q14: Obedience and Answered Prayer

- **Question:** In what words does the apostle express the same sentiment?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:22 – “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because
  we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.”

## Slide 31 – Q14: Confidence Toward God

- **The Link:**
  - There is an inseparable link between obedience and answered prayer.
  - A clear conscience gives us "confidence toward God" (1 John 3:21).
- **Pleasing Him:**
  - Sanctification involves doing things simply because they please our Father.
  - He who turns away his ear from the law, even his prayer shall be abomination
    (Proverbs 28:9).

## Slide 32 – Q15: The Reward of Love

- **Question:** What will the lord do for those who love Him sufficiently to
  keep His words?
- **Key Text:** John 14:23 – “Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love
  me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto
  him, and make our abode with him.”

## Slide 33 – Q15: The Indwelling Presence

- **Love is the Motive:**
  - True obedience springs from love, not fear.
  - "If a man love Me, he _will_ keep My words."
- **The Mystery of the Gospel:**
  - The reward is the personal indwelling of the Father and Son through the
    Spirit.
  - "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27).

## Slide 34 – Q16: The State of the Indwelled Believer

- **Question:** In what condition are those in whom Christ dwells?
- **Key Texts:**
  - Romans 8:10 – “And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but
    the Spirit is life because of righteousness.”
  - Psalm 119:172 – “...for all thy commandments are righteousness.”
  - Deuteronomy 6:25 – “And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do
    all these commandments...”

## Slide 35 – Q16: Righteousness by Faith and the Law

- **Dead to Sin, Alive to Righteousness:**
  - The old nature is reckoned dead; the Spirit brings new life.
- **The Definition of Righteousness:**
  - Scripture defines righteousness as **God's commandments**.
- **Christ Living the Law:**
  - If Christ (Living Righteousness) dwells in us, He will live out the
    principles of the Law in our lives.
  - **Righteousness by Faith** does not abolish the law; it establishes it in
    the heart (Romans 3:31).

## Slide 36 – Q17: How to Be Transformed

- **Question:** How is this state of things brought about?
- **Key Text:** Romans 12:2 – “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye
  transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good,
  and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”

## Slide 37 – Q17: Non-Conformity and Renewal

- **Not Conformed:**
  - The world tries to press us into its mold (fashion, amusement, ambition).
  - The Christian refuses to fit this mold.
- **Transformed:**
  - The Greek word is _metamorphoo_ (metamorphosis)—an inner change working
    outward.
- **Renewing the Mind:**
  - This occurs through prayer and studying Scripture.
  - By beholding Christ, we are changed (2 Corinthians 3:18).

## Slide 38 – Q18: Living in His Name

- **Question:** Then what will we be able to do?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:17 – “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all
  in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.”

## Slide 39 – Q18: A Representative Life

- **In His Name:**
  - To do something "in the name of" Jesus means to act with His authority and
    consistent with His character.
- **Consistency:**
  - There is no division between "religious" and "secular" life.
  - **The Test:** Before any action or amusement, ask: "Can I do this in the
    name of Jesus? Can I ask His blessing upon it?"

## Slide 40 – Q19: Sanctification of the Body

- **Question:** To what extent must our deeds be done with reference to God's
  glory?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 10:31 – “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or
  whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”

## Slide 41 – Q19: Practical Holiness

- **The Body Temple:**
  - Even biological functions like eating and drinking must be sanctified.
  - A clouded brain (from poor diet or stimulants) cannot perfectly discern
    God’s will.
- **Temperance:**
  - We eat to live and serve God; we do not live to serve appetite.
  - True temperance is total abstinence from the harmful and moderate use of the
    good.

## Slide 42 – Q20: The Body as a Sacrifice

- **Question:** Why should we be so careful of our bodies?
- **Key Text:** Romans 12:1 – “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies
  of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
  God, which is your reasonable service.”

## Slide 43 – Q20: A Living Sacrifice

- **Sanctuary Imagery:**
  - God could not accept a blemished sacrifice in the Old Testament (Malachi
    1:8).
  - We are to present our bodies "holy and acceptable" to God.
- **Reasonable Service:**
  - We are bought with a price.
  - We "die daily" to self-interest, but live physically to serve Him.

## Slide 44 – Q20: Illustration

- **The Machine:**
  - If a master craftsman entrusts you with a delicate, expensive machine for
    his work, you insult him if you damage it with sand or neglect.
  - God has entrusted us with the delicate machinery of the body and mind.
  - We honor Him by keeping it in peak condition for His service.

## Slide 45 – Q21: The Cost of Discipleship

- **Question:** How much must we give up to become a true disciple of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Luke 14:33 – “So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh
  not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.”

## Slide 46 – Q21: Forsaking All

- **Stewardship vs. Ownership:**
  - We renounce _ownership_ of everything.
  - Our house, money, talents, and family belong to God; we are merely managers
    (stewards) for Him.
- **Idols:**
  - Any cherished sin or possession valued more than Christ becomes an idol.
  - These idols block the work of sanctification.

## Slide 47 – Q22: The Yoke of Christ

- **Question:** After forsaking all of self, what must we accept, in order to
  learn of Christ?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 11:29 – “Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I
  am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”

## Slide 48 – Q22: Partnership and Rest

- **The Yoke:**
  - A yoke joins two oxen to pull a load together. It implies submission and
    partnership.
- **Yoked with Jesus:**
  - We do not pull the load alone; Christ bears the heavy end of the burden.
- **Rest in Submission:**
  - The hardest life is one fighting against conscience.
  - The most restful life is one fully surrendered to God's will.

## Slide 49 – Q23: Supreme Love

- **Question:** How large a place in our affections should the love of Christ
  occupy?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 10:37 – “He that loveth father or mother more than me is
  not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
  worthy of me.”

## Slide 50 – Q23: The Throne of the Heart

- **First Commandment:**
  - "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."
  - Even valid human loves (family) become idolatry if placed above obedience to
    Christ.
- **Testing Truth:**
  - Following the truth sometimes causes division.
  - The sanctified believer chooses Jesus above all earthly ties, trusting Him
    with the consequences.

## Slide 51 – Q24: The Consequence of Holiness

- **Question:** If we thus follow Christ, what will be the result?
- **Key Text:** John 15:20 – “Remember the word that I said unto you, The
  servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will
  also persecute you...”

## Slide 52 – Q24: Conflict and Controversy

- **The Friction of Light:**
  - Holiness exposes sin; darkness hates the light.
  - If we live like Jesus, the world will treat us as it treated Jesus.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - We are in a war. The dragon makes war with the remnant who keep the
    commandments of God (Revelation 12:17).
  - Trials are badges of our discipleship.

## Slide 53 – Q25: Security in Christ

- **Question:** But will this persecution separate us from Christ or His love?
- **Key Text:** Romans 8:38-39 – “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor
  life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers... shall be able to separate
  us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

## Slide 54 – Q25: The Final Triumph

- **Eternal Security in Relationship:**
  - No external force—no enemy, government, or hardship—can rip us from His
    hand.
  - Only our own choice to leave can separate us.
- **Victory:**
  - The sanctified life begins with God's will and ends with inseparable union
    with God's love.
  - God’s people will be secure, sealed, and safe in His presence forever.

## Slide 55 – Q25: Illustration

- **The Anchor:**
  - A ship in a storm may be tossed by waves and wind.
  - But if the anchor holds fast within the harbor, the ship is safe.
  - **Our Hope:** Our anchor is Christ, who has entered "within the veil" of the
    heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 6:19).
  - Nothing can cut that line but our own choice to let go.
