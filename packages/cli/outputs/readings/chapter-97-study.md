### Q1. In what words does the Bible describe the bondage of Israel in Egypt?

“And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and
their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage." Exodus 2:23. Compare with
James 5:1-4.

**Answer:**

The history of Israel in Egypt is more than a historical record; it is a grand
type of the spiritual condition of humanity. The "sighing" and "crying" of
Israel represent the desperate state of the sinner under the cruel taskmaster of
sin and Satan.

1.  **The Hardship of Sin:** Just as Pharaoh set taskmasters to afflict Israel
    with burdens (Exodus 1:11), sin imposes a crushing weight upon the
    conscience. The service of Satan promises pleasure but pays in misery and
    death (Romans 6:23).
2.  **The Cry for Deliverance:** Freedom begins with the realization of our
    hopeless condition. Before a sinner can be justified (declared righteous),
    he must realize he is condemned. The cry of Israel "came up unto God,"
    showing that God is attentive to the sorrows of the oppressed.
3.  **God’s Justice:** The reference to James 5:1–4 reminds us that God takes
    note of social injustice and economic oppression. The "hire of the
    laborers... which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth." God is the defender
    of the weak.

**[ILL]** A man stuck in quicksand cannot pull himself out by his own hair. The
more he struggles, the deeper he sinks. He must cry out for a savior standing on
solid ground. So it is with the sinner; he cannot free himself from the "bondage
of corruption" (Romans 8:21) but must cry out to the Deliverer.

### Q2. Who heard their cries for help?

“God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with
Isaac, and with Jacob." Exodus 2:24.

**Answer:**

God’s response to human suffering is rooted in His faithfulness to His own word.

1.  **The Covenant Defined:** A **Covenant** is a solemn binding agreement or
    promise. Here, it refers to the _Everlasting Covenant_ God made with the
    patriarchs—the promise of land, seed (Christ), and blessing to all nations
    (Genesis 12:3; Galatians 3:16).
2.  **The Basis of Salvation:** God did not save Israel because they were
    righteous or deserving—they were often idolatrous in Egypt (Ezekiel 20:7–8).
    He saved them because He "remembered His covenant."
    - **Grace:** Salvation is founded on God’s promise and character, not human
      merit.
3.  **The Sanctuary Connection:** The prayers of the saints ascend to God like
    incense. In the earthly sanctuary, the altar of incense represented the
    intercession of Christ mingling with the prayers of His people (Revelation
    8:3–4). God hears because He has provided a Mediator.

**[ILL]** If a child is lost in a crowd and cries out, many people may hear a
noise, but the mother hears the voice of her own child. God hears the groaning
of the sinner not merely as a distant Judge, but as a Father remembering His
promise to save.

### Q3. What did God tell Moses to do?

” Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and
I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. Come now
therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my
people the children of Israel out of Egypt." Exodus 3:9, 10.

**Answer:**

God uses human instrumentalities to accomplish His divine purposes.

1.  **The Divine Initiative:** God says, "I have seen," "I have heard," and "I
    will send." The plan of salvation originated in the heart of God before the
    foundation of the world (1 Peter 1:19–20).
2.  **Moses as a Type of Christ:** Moses was sent to break the chains of
    physical slavery. Christ was sent by the Father to break the spiritual
    chains of sin.
    - Moses left the palace of Egypt to identify with his suffering brethren
      (Hebrews 11:24–25).
    - Christ left the courts of heaven to become one with humanity and suffer
      for us (Philippians 2:5–8).
3.  **The Purpose of Freedom:** God did not bring them out just to wander
    aimlessly; He brought them out to bring them _in_ to the Promised Land.

**[ILL]** A lifeguard does not jump into the stormy sea just to swim alongside
the drowning man. He jumps in to seize him and bring him to shore. Christ came
to "seek and to save that which was lost" (Luke 19:10).

---

### Q4. In giving His law to His people, how did God describe Himself?

“I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of
the house of bondage." Exodus 20:2.

**Answer:**

This introduction to the Ten Commandments establishes the relationship between
the **Law** and the **Gospel**.

1.  **Redemption Precedes Obedience:** Notice the order. God did not say, "Keep
    my law, and then I will save you from Egypt." He saved them _first_, by
    grace and power, and _then_ gave them His law as the standard of life for a
    redeemed people.
2.  **The Motive for Obedience:** We obey the law of God not to _be_ saved, but
    because we _are_ saved. "If ye love me, keep my commandments" (John 14:15).
3.  **Law of Liberty:** The Ten Commandments are not a set of arbitrary
    restrictions but a description of the character of the God who sets us free.
    True liberty is found only in harmony with God’s law (Psalm 119:45; James
    1:25).
    - **Sin is Bondage:** Breaking the law leads to slavery.
    - **Obedience is Freedom:** Keeping the law, through the power of Christ,
      ensures liberty.

**[ILL]** A train is only free to run fast and effectively when it stays on the
tracks. If it "liberates" itself from the tracks, it becomes a wreck in the mud.
God’s law provides the tracks for human happiness and true freedom.

### Q5. What did God do to protect Israel against slavery?

“And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and
serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from
thee. And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go
away empty: thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy
floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed
thee thou shalt give unto him. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman
in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command
thee this thing to day." Deuteronomy 15:12-15. "Thou shalt neither vex a
stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt." Exodus
22:21; (See 2 Corinthians 1:2-4.)

**Answer:**

God instituted laws to prevent perpetual slavery and poverty among His people,
teaching that those who have received mercy must show mercy.

1.  **The Principle of Empathy:** God commands kindness based on shared
    experience: "For ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers"
    (Exodus 23:9).
2.  **Practical Righteousness:** It was not enough to wish the freed servant
    well; the master had to supply him "liberally" with resources.
    - This reflects **Imparted Righteousness**: God does not just declare us
      free (Justification); He equips us with the graces of His Spirit
      (Sanctification) so we can live successfully.
3.  **The Comfort of God:** The reference to 2 Corinthians 1:2–4 teaches that we
    comfort others with the comfort we have received from God. Our past trials,
    when healed by Christ, become a ministry to others.

**[ILL]** If a man has been rescued from a burning building by a firefighter, he
will not stand by idly while he sees his neighbor's house on fire. The memory of
his own rescue compels him to help. So the Christian, remembering his
deliverance from sin, seeks to lift up the fallen.

### Q6. What was one of the reasons that Israel should keep the Sabbath?

“And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord
thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out
arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day."
Deuteronomy 5:15.

**Answer:**

The Sabbath is a dual memorial: it commemorates Creation (Exodus 20:11) and
Redemption (Deuteronomy 5:15).

1.  **Sign of Sanctification:** "Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep... that ye may
    know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you" (Exodus 31:13).
    - **Sanctification:** The process by which God makes a believer holy and
      free from the power of sin.
2.  **Rest from Works:** In Egypt, there was no rest; it was endless labor. The
    Sabbath signifies that we cease from our own works for salvation and rest in
    the finished work of Christ (Hebrews 4:9–10).
3.  **The Author of Liberty:** By keeping the Sabbath, the believer acknowledges
    God as both the Creator who made him and the Redeemer who bought him back
    from the slavery of sin.

**[ILL]** A slave has no control over his time; his master owns every hour. When
God gave Israel the Sabbath, He was saying, "You are no longer slaves to
Pharaoh; you are free men and women who have the privilege of time with the King
of the Universe."

---

### Q7. What proclamation was made every fifty years?

” And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the
land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye
shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto
his family." Leviticus 25:10.

**Answer:**

The Jubilee year was the crowning climax of the ceremonial system regarding land
and liberty.

1.  **The Day of Atonement Connection:** The Jubilee was proclaimed by the
    trumpet blast _only_ on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 25:9).
    - **Theological Meaning:** Liberty is based on Atonement. There is no true
      freedom until the sin problem is dealt with. When the High Priest
      completed the cleansing of the sanctuary (a type of the final judgment),
      the people were declared free.
2.  **Total Restoration:**
    - Debts were canceled.
    - Slaves were freed.
    - Land returned to original owners.
    - This points forward to the **Earth Made New**, where the redeemed will
      receive their inheritance, sin will be eradicated, and "the creation
      itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption" (Romans
      8:21).

**[ILL]** Imagine a man who has lost his home to debt and sold himself into
labor to pay it off. He lives in hopelessness. But then a trumpet sounds! The
ledger is burned, the deed to his home is returned to his hand, and his chains
are struck off. That is the Jubilee—a picture of what Christ does for us.

### Q8. Because Israel failed to do this, became oppressive and forsook the Sabbath, what did God do?

“Therefore thus saith the Lord; Ye have not harkened unto Me, in proclaiming
liberty, everyone to his brother, and every man to his neighbour; behold, I
proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and
to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the
earth." Jeremiah 34:17. (See also Jeremiah 17:24-27; 2 Chronicles 36:19-21.)

**Answer:**

The refusal to grant liberty to others resulted in the loss of liberty for the
nation.

1.  **The Law of Reciprocity:** "For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be
    judged" (Matthew 7:2). If we refuse to forgive and free others, we
    demonstrate that we have not truly received the spirit of freedom from God.
2.  **Consequences of Apostasy:** God did not arbitrarily destroy them. By
    rejecting His law of love and liberty, they removed themselves from His
    protection. They chose the "liberty" to sin, which God ironically granted
    them—liberty to the sword and famine.
3.  **The Babylon Connection:** Because they did not keep the Sabbath rest and
    did not release their brethren, they were sent into the bondage of Babylon
    for 70 years to let the land enjoy her Sabbaths (2 Chronicles 36:21).

**[ILL]** If a diver cuts the air hose that connects him to the surface because
he wants "freedom" from the tube, he finds only the "freedom" to drown. Israel
cut their connection to God's law and found only destruction.

---

### Q9. What fault did the God of heaven find with Israel's religious gatherings?

“Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.
Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of
wickedness." Isaiah 58:3, 4.

**Answer:**

God exposes the hollowness of external religion that lacks internal
transformation.

1.  **Formalism:** The people were going through the motions of
    religion—fasting, looking sad, afflicting their souls—but their characters
    remained unchanged. They were harsh, greedy, and argumentative.
2.  **Sanctification is Practical:** God is not interested in a "form of
    godliness" that denies the power thereof (2 Timothy 3:5). True Christianity
    affects how we treat our employees ("exact all your labors") and our
    neighbors.
3.  **The Great Controversy:** Satan delights in having people perform religious
    rituals while retaining a spirit of hatred, for this misrepresents the
    character of God to the world.

**[ILL]** A painted fire gives no heat. A painted banquet satisfies no hunger. A
religion that is only outward show—without the warmth of love and justice—is
dead and offensive to God.

---

### Q10. What does God set forth as the fast acceptable to Him?

“Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to
undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break
every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the
poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover
him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?" Verses 6.7.

**Answer:**

The "true fast" is a life of self-denying love and active benevolence.

1.  **Spiritual Liberation:** "To loose the bands of wickedness." This is the
    work of the Gospel. We are to help loose the bands of error and sin from the
    minds of others by sharing the truth.
2.  **Physical Ministry:** This passage is the marching order for medical
    missionary work and welfare ministry. We are to care for the physical needs
    of humanity as a wedge to reach their souls.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith in Action:** This is not salvation by works.
    Rather, it is the inevitable _fruit_ of a heart in which Christ dwells. When
    the law is written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10), the life naturally flows out
    in service to others.

**[ILL]** A fruit tree does not bear apples to prove it is an apple tree; it
bears apples because of the life sap flowing through it. A Christian does these
good works not to buy heaven, but because the life of Jesus flows through them.

---

### Q11. Why did Christ come to this world?

“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the
gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at
liberty them that are bruised." Luke 4:18.

**Answer:**

Jesus applied this prophecy from Isaiah 61 directly to Himself, outlining His
mission.

1.  **The Anointed One:** "Messiah" and "Christ" both mean "The Anointed One."
    In the sanctuary, the High Priest was anointed for ministry. Christ is our
    High Priest, anointed to minister salvation.
2.  **Fourfold Ministry:**
    - _Preach the Gospel:_ Good news to the spiritually destitute.
    - _Heal the Brokenhearted:_ Restoration of the inner emotions and spirit.
    - _Deliver Captives:_ Freedom from the slavery of Satan and bad habits.
    - _Sight to the Blind:_ Opening eyes to the truth of God’s word.
3.  **The "Bruised":** Sin bruises the soul. Christ came not to condemn the
    bruised reed, but to restore it (Isaiah 42:3).

**[ILL]** A prison warden keeps people in; a liberator breaks them out. Satan is
the warden of this world; Christ is the Liberator who holds the keys of hell and
death (Revelation 1:18).

---

### Q12. In what condition are those who commit sin?

“Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." John 8:34.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Nature of the Bondage:** The Greek word for "servant" here is
    _doulos_—a slave. A man may think he is "free" to do as he pleases when he
    sins, but he is actually obeying the dictates of a cruel master, the carnal
    nature.
2.  **The Inability of the Will:** By repeated sinning, the will becomes
    enslaved. The sinner may want to do good, but "how to perform that which is
    good I find not" (Romans 7:18). This is why human effort alone is
    insufficient for salvation.
3.  **The Need for a New Master:** We cannot just stop serving sin; we must
    switch masters. "But now being made free from sin, and become servants to
    God" (Romans 6:22).

**[ILL]** A drug addict may claim he is free to take the drug whenever he wants.
But let him try to _stop_, and he discovers he is bound with chains he cannot
break. Every sin is a link in a chain we forge ourselves.

---

### Q13. Why was Christ's name to be called "Jesus”?

“And thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their
sins." Matthew 1:21.

**Answer:**

The name Jesus (Joshua/Yeshua) means "Jehovah is Salvation."

1.  **Saved FROM, not IN:** This is a critical distinction. Christ does not save
    us _in_ our sins (allowing us to continue sinning with impunity), but _from_
    our sins.
    - He saves from the _penalty_ of sin (Justification).
    - He saves from the _power_ of sin (Sanctification).
    - He will eventually save from the _presence_ of sin (Glorification).
2.  **Victory is Promised:** The text implies that sin is an enemy that can be
    defeated. The Gospel is the power of God to break the dominion of sin in the
    life of the believer (Romans 1:16).

**[ILL]** If a doctor says he "saved" a patient from cancer, it doesn't mean the
patient still has cancer but the doctor ignores it. It means the cancer has been
removed. Jesus is the Great Physician who removes the cancer of sin from the
soul.

---

### Q14. What lies at the root of all sin?

“When lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin." James 1:15. "I had not known
lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." Romans 7:7.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Heart of the Matter:** Sin is not just an external act; it begins in
    the mind. **Lust** (unlawful desire/covetousness) is the seed.
2.  **The Function of the Law:** The Tenth Commandment ("Thou shalt not covet")
    probes the thoughts and intents of the heart. It shows that God requires
    purity in the "inward parts" (Psalm 51:6).
3.  **The Sanctuary Sequence:**
    - _Courtyard:_ Where the act is committed.
    - _Holy Place:_ The mind/heart where the thought is formed.
    - Jesus taught that hate is murder and lust is adultery (Matthew 5:21–28).
      To be truly free, the heart must be cleansed.

**[ILL]** You can cut the top off a weed, but if the root remains, it will grow
back. External reformation (changing habits) without internal regeneration
(changing the heart) leaves the root of sin intact. Only Christ can dig out the
root.

---

### Q15. Which passage of Scripture reveals that all men should have an equality of human rights?

“Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Leviticus 19:18.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Royal Law:** James calls this the "royal law" (James 2:8). It destroys
    caste, racism, and slavery. It places every human being on equal footing
    before God.
2.  **Self-Preservation as a Standard:** We instinctively look after our own
    needs, rights, and happiness. The Bible commands that we extend that same
    care to every other person.
3.  **The End of Selfishness:** If this law were universally obeyed, there would
    be no oppression. This can only be fulfilled by the love of God shed abroad
    in our hearts by the Holy Ghost (Romans 5:5).

**[ILL]** In a physical body, the hand does not hoard blood for itself; it works
to feed the mouth, which feeds the stomach, which nourishes the hand. If one
part suffers, all suffer. "Love thy neighbor" means recognizing we are all part
of the same human family under God.

---

### Q16. What rule of life has Christ Himself given to guide us in such unselfish living?

“Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." Matthew
7:12.

**Answer:**

Commonly called the "Golden Rule," this summarizes the second table of the Ten
Commandments (duty to man).

1.  **Positive Action:** Many philosophies say, "Do not do to others what hurts
    you." Jesus made it positive: "DO unto others." It requires active kindness,
    not just passive harmlessness.
2.  **The Test of Conduct:** In any situation, simply ask: "If our positions
    were reversed, how would I want to be treated?" This cuts through all
    self-deception and bias.
3.  **The Law and the Prophets:** Jesus said this principle is the sum of the
    Old Testament ethical teaching.

**[ILL]** If you were hungry, you would want food. If you were accused, you
would want a fair hearing. If you were in error, you would want to be corrected
gently. The Golden Rule compels us to offer this same grace to others.

---

### Q17. Who alone can remove the selfishness from the hearts of men?

“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Acts 4:12.(See also 1 John
1:9.)

**Answer:**

1.  **The Exclusivity of Christ:** Education, politics, philosophy, and science
    can improve external conditions, but they cannot change the human heart.
    Only Jesus Christ has the power to break the power of selfishness.
2.  **The Process (1 John 1:9):**
    - _Confession:_ We admit our sin.
    - _Faithfulness:_ He is faithful to forgive (Justification).
    - _Cleansing:_ He cleanses us from all unrighteousness (Sanctification).
3.  **A New Creation:** Salvation is not a modification of the old nature; it is
    the impartation of a new nature—the life of Christ Himself (Galatians 2:20).

**[ILL]** You can scrub a pig, spray it with perfume, and put a ribbon on it,
but it remains a pig and will return to the mud. To change its nature, you would
have to perform a miracle. Christ performs the miracle of turning a selfish
heart into a loving one.

---

### Q18. Who, alone, then, is able to give to men genuine freedom?

“If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." John 8:36.

**Answer:**

1.  **"Indeed" means "Truly":** Political freedom is valuable, but a man can be
    politically free and yet a slave to alcohol, anger, or fear. Christ offers
    freedom that circumstances cannot touch.
2.  **The Role of the Son:** As the Son of God, Jesus remains in the "house"
    forever. Slaves (sinners) have no permanent place. The Son has the authority
    to emancipate the slaves and make them sons and daughters of God (John
    1:12).
3.  **Freedom to Obey:** This freedom is not the liberty to sin, but the power
    to do right. "I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts" (Psalm
    119:45).

**[ILL]** A bird is only free when it flies in the air—the environment it was
designed for. Put it underwater, and it is not "free"; it dies. Man was designed
for holiness. We are only "free indeed" when we are living in harmony with God's
character.

---

### Q19. What was the attitude of Christ toward unbelievers?

“If any man hear My words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to
judge the world, but to save the world." John 12:47.

**Answer:**

1.  **Freedom of Conscience:** Christ never forced anyone to follow Him. He
    invited, He drew, He reasoned, but He never compelled.
2.  **God's Government:** The government of God is based on love, and love
    cannot be forced. Force is the principle of Satan's kingdom.
3.  **The Time of Judgment:** While there is a future day of judgment (Acts
    17:31), during the time of probation, Christ’s role is Savior. We should
    adopt this same attitude—seeking to win souls, not condemning those who
    disagree.

**[ILL]** The sun shines on the good and the evil alike. It does not withhold
its light from a wicked man's field. So Christ offers His light to all, leaving
them free to accept or reject it.

---

### Q20. What attitude did Jesus say should control all of His disciples?

“But Jesus... saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule
over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise
authority upon them. But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be
great among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be the
chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." Mark
10:42-45.

**Answer:**

1.  **The Upside-Down Kingdom:** In the world, greatness is determined by how
    many people serve you. In Christ's kingdom, greatness is determined by how
    many people _you_ serve.
2.  **Servant Leadership:** Jesus broke the cycle of power and oppression. He
    washed His disciples' feet (John 13), taking the form of a servant.
3.  **The Ransom:** The ultimate act of service was the Cross. Christ gave His
    life to buy our freedom. If the Master is a servant, the disciples cannot be
    tyrants. This forbids all ecclesiastical or spiritual tyranny in the church.

**[ILL]** A pyramid stands on its broad base, with the peak at the top. The
worldly system puts the leader at the peak, supported by the masses. Jesus
inverted the pyramid, placing Himself at the bottom, bearing the weight of the
world.

---

### Q21. Wherever the Spirit of God is guiding in men's lives, what is always present?

“Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
liberty." 2 Corinthians 3:17.

**Answer:**

1.  **Internal Liberty:** The Holy Spirit brings liberty from the condemnation
    of the law and the power of sin.
2.  **The New Covenant:** Contextually, Paul is contrasting the "letter" (law
    written on stone without grace) which kills, with the "Spirit" (law written
    on the heart) which gives life.
3.  **Voluntary Obedience:** When the Spirit dwells within, obedience is not a
    forced drudgery but a delight. We do not refrain from sin because we are
    afraid of hell, but because we love God.

**[ILL]** A hired servant works because he has to; he watches the clock. A son
works in his father’s vineyard because he has an interest in the family business
and loves his father. The Spirit turns servants into sons (Galatians 4:6–7).

---

### Q22. What kind of worship can alone be acceptable to God?

“But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the
Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God
is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth."
John 4:23, 24.

**Answer:**

1.  **In Spirit:** Worship must spring from a heart renewed by the Holy Spirit.
    It is not merely about correct forms, liturgies, or buildings. It involves
    the engagement of the heart and affections.
2.  **In Truth:** Worship must be grounded in God’s revealed Word. Sincerity
    alone is not enough (one can be sincerely wrong); we must worship according
    to the truth of Scripture.
3.  **The Balance:**
    - _Spirit without Truth_ leads to fanaticism and emotionalism.
    - _Truth without Spirit_ leads to cold formalism and legalism.
    - God seeks the balance: a heart set on fire by the Holy Spirit, guided by
      the unchangeable compass of Truth.

**[ILL]** To have a living body, you need a skeleton (structure/truth) and the
breath of life (spirit). A skeleton without breath is a corpse; breath without a
body is a ghost. True worship requires the structure of Bible truth animated by
the life of the Spirit.
