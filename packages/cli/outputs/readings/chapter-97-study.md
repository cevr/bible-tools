# Reading 97: The Author of Liberty

## Introduction

Liberty is not a modern invention or political philosophy—it is the very heart of God's character. From Israel's deliverance from Egyptian bondage to Christ's mission to "set at liberty them that are bruised," Scripture reveals a God who hates oppression and desires freedom for His children. Yet the deepest freedom God offers is not merely physical or political—it is freedom from the bondage of sin itself, a liberty that only Christ can give.

## Core Truths

### God Hears the Cries of the Oppressed

The children of Israel "sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God" (Exodus 2:23). This was no casual mention—Scripture says "God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant" (Exodus 2:24).

The God of heaven is not indifferent to suffering. When His children groan under oppression, He hears. He acts.

> "Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt." (Exodus 3:10)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "groaning" (נְאָקָה, ne'aqah) in Exodus 2:24 describes a deep, agonized cry—the same word used when creation itself "groaneth and travaileth" under the curse of sin (Romans 8:22). God responds to such cries with redemption.

James echoes this principle: "Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth" (James 5:4). The God who delivered Israel still hears the oppressed today.

### God Identifies Himself as the Liberator

When God introduced His holy law at Sinai, He did not first say "I am the Creator" or "I am the Almighty." He said:

> "I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." (Exodus 20:2)

God's very identity, in the preface to His commandments, is bound up with liberation. He is the God who sets captives free.

### God's Laws Protected Against Oppression

God did not merely deliver Israel once—He built safeguards into their national life to prevent them from becoming oppressors themselves:

**The Seven-Year Release**: "If thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty" (Deuteronomy 15:12-14).

**Protection of Strangers**: "Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt" (Exodus 22:21).

The reason given is striking: "Thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee" (Deuteronomy 15:15). Those who have received mercy must show mercy. Those who have been liberated must not become oppressors.

[ILL] Consider a man rescued from drowning who later becomes a lifeguard. When he sees another struggling in the water, does he not feel a special urgency to help? The memory of his own helplessness compels compassion. So God calls His people to remember their bondage—not to forget it—that they might deal tenderly with the vulnerable.

### The Sabbath: A Memorial of Liberty

Why did God command Israel to keep the Sabbath? One reason often overlooked:

> "And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day." (Deuteronomy 5:15)

The Sabbath is a weekly reminder that God liberates. Every seventh day, masters and servants alike were to rest—the slave had the same right to Sabbath rest as the king. No other ancient society had such a law.

[DYK🔎] In ancient Egypt, slaves worked seven days a week with no rest. The Sabbath was God's revolutionary declaration that human beings are not machines—they bear God's image and deserve rest and dignity. The Sabbath is thus both a creation ordinance and a liberation ordinance.

### The Year of Jubilee: Liberty Proclaimed

> "And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you." (Leviticus 25:10)

Every fifty years, at the sound of the trumpet on the Day of Atonement, all Hebrew slaves were freed and all ancestral lands returned to their original families. No debt could enslave a family forever. No loss was permanent. God built a "reset" into Israel's economy to prevent permanent poverty and oppression.

[DYK🔎] The words "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof" (Leviticus 25:10) are inscribed on the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. America's founders recognized—at least in principle—that true liberty originates with the God of Scripture.

## Deeper Truths

### When Liberty Is Rejected, Judgment Comes

Israel failed to observe the jubilee and Sabbath releases. They became oppressors:

> "Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye fast for strife and debate." (Isaiah 58:3-4)

They maintained religious forms while practicing economic oppression. God's response was severe:

> "Ye have not hearkened unto Me, in proclaiming liberty, everyone to his brother... behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine." (Jeremiah 34:17)

[Q] **"Why would God punish Israel so severely for economic practices?"**

Because oppression contradicts God's character. A people claiming to worship the God of Exodus while grinding the faces of the poor bear false witness against Him. They misrepresent the Liberator as an oppressor. Such hypocrisy brings judgment not only because it harms others, but because it blasphemes God's name before watching nations.

### True Religion: Breaking Every Yoke

What does God actually desire from His people?

> "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?" (Isaiah 58:6)

True worship is inseparable from justice. The fast acceptable to God involves:

- Loosing bands of wickedness
- Undoing heavy burdens
- Setting the oppressed free
- Breaking every yoke
- Feeding the hungry
- Housing the poor
- Clothing the naked

Religion that ignores human suffering is not true religion, whatever its theological correctness.

### Christ: The Ultimate Liberator

When Jesus announced His ministry in Nazareth, He read from Isaiah:

> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised." (Luke 4:18)

Then He declared: "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears" (Luke 4:21). Jesus is the fulfillment of every jubilee, every Sabbath release, every deliverance from Egypt. He is the Author of liberty.

### The Deepest Bondage: Sin

Yet Jesus came to address a bondage deeper than political oppression:

> "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." (John 8:34)

Sin is slavery. Every person who commits sin becomes a slave to it. The chains may be invisible, but they are unbreakable by human strength. Lust conceives and brings forth sin (James 1:15). Selfishness—wanting for self what belongs to others—lies at the root: "I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet" (Romans 7:7).

This is why Jesus was named "Jesus"—"for He shall save His people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21). Not merely from sin's penalty, but from sin's power. Not merely forgiveness, but freedom.

[ILL] A man may be released from prison yet remain enslaved to the habits that imprisoned him. He is legally free but experientially bound. So many profess Christ's forgiveness yet remain captive to anger, lust, pride, or selfishness. True salvation breaks not only the legal penalty but the experiential power of sin.

> "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." (John 8:36)

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Liberty and the Character of God

The great controversy between Christ and Satan is fundamentally about God's character. Satan has charged God with tyranny—claiming God's law is arbitrary, His requirements oppressive, His rule a form of bondage.

Every act of liberation in Scripture answers these charges. God freed Israel from Egypt. God built protections against oppression into His law. God proclaimed jubilee. God sent His Son to set captives free. The God of the Bible is not a tyrant—He is the Author of liberty.

### The Sanctuary and Freedom from Sin

In the earthly sanctuary, the jubilee trumpet sounded on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 25:9). This was no coincidence. The Day of Atonement—when Israel's sins were ultimately removed from the camp—was the very day when liberty was proclaimed.

The connection is profound: true liberty comes through atonement. Only when sin is dealt with—confessed, forsaken, and cleansed—can genuine freedom exist. This is why Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary is so vital. He is not merely forgiving sins; He is cleansing His people from sin, preparing a people who keep the commandments of God through His indwelling power.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "liberty" (דְּרוֹר, deror) in Leviticus 25:10 appears only seven times in the Old Testament. It carries the idea of "flowing freely"—like water released from a dam or a bird released from a cage. This is the freedom Christ offers.

### The Golden Rule: Foundation of Human Rights

> "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." (Leviticus 19:18)

This simple command, expanded by Jesus as "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matthew 7:12), is the foundation of all genuine human rights. If every person treated others as they wished to be treated, oppression would cease.

But here is the difficulty: human beings are naturally selfish. We cannot generate this love by effort or education. Only Christ can remove selfishness from the heart:

> "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." (Acts 4:12)

### Where the Spirit Is, Liberty Follows

> "Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." (2 Corinthians 3:17)

Wherever God's Spirit truly works, freedom increases. Not lawlessness—for the Spirit writes God's law on the heart (Hebrews 10:16)—but genuine liberty from sin's dominion, from fear, from selfishness. The fruit of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance) creates communities where oppression cannot thrive.

### Christ's Method: Service, Not Dominion

> "Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: and whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many." (Mark 10:43-45)

The kingdoms of this world operate by dominion and authority exercised over others. Christ's kingdom operates by service. His followers do not coerce, compel, or force. They serve. They give. They lay down their lives.

[Q] **"But didn't God command Israel to wage war and establish a theocracy?"**

God worked with Israel in their historical situation, progressively revealing His character. Yet even then, He built protections for the vulnerable, commanded Sabbath rest for all, and prohibited permanent enslavement of His people. The fuller revelation in Christ shows God's ultimate method: "If any man hear My words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world" (John 12:47). God does not force conscience. True worship must be "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24)—voluntary, not coerced.

## Practical Application

### Examine Your Own Bondages

Before focusing on others' oppression, ask: What sin holds me in bondage? What habit, attitude, or desire rules me rather than Christ? Christ came to set you free—not merely forgiven but genuinely liberated. Bring your chains to Him daily, trusting His power to break them.

### Remember Your Deliverance

Like Israel, we must remember our bondage. When tempted to judge others harshly, remember where Christ found you. When inclined to be hard on those struggling with sin, recall your own struggles—and continuing need of grace. "Ye were strangers in the land of Egypt."

### Practice the True Fast

Do you fast for strife and debate—maintaining religious forms while ignoring suffering around you? God calls us to loose bands of wickedness, undo heavy burdens, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, clothe the naked. True religion touches human need.

### Treat Others as You Wish to Be Treated

This golden rule, empowered by Christ's indwelling Spirit, transforms every relationship. In your home, workplace, church, and community—ask: How would I wish to be treated? Then do so.

### Preserve Liberty of Conscience

Christ does not coerce belief. Neither should His followers. In matters of faith and worship, persuasion is proper; compulsion is not. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."

## Appeal

_"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed."_ (John 8:36)

God has revealed Himself as the Author of liberty—delivering Israel from Egypt, building safeguards against oppression into His law, proclaiming jubilee, and sending His Son to set captives free. The same God offers you freedom today.

Are you in bondage to sin? Christ came to break those chains. Are you burdened by guilt? He offers full and free forgiveness. Are you enslaved by habit, appetite, or passion? His Spirit can write His law of love on your heart, giving you power to overcome.

The trumpet of jubilee has sounded. Liberty is proclaimed. Will you accept the freedom Christ offers—freedom not to sin, but from sin? Will you let the Son make you free indeed?

Come to Him today. Surrender every chain. Trust His power to liberate. And having received liberty, go forth to loose the bands of wickedness, undo heavy burdens, and let the oppressed go free—that the God of Exodus may be glorified in you.
