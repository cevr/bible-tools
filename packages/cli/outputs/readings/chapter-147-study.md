### Q1. Is the Lord indifferent to the condition of the poor?

**"The Lord heareth the poor." Psalm 69:33.** **See also Psalm 72:12.**

**Answer:**

The Scriptures reveal a God who is intimately acquainted with the sufferings of
the destitute. Far from being indifferent, the Lord identifies Himself as the
special guardian and vindicator of the weak.

- **The Character of God:** God’s nature is love (1 John 4:8). His law is a
  transcript of His character, and the essence of that law is love toward God
  and love toward our neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40). Therefore, indifference to
  suffering is impossible for God. He hears the cry of the poor even when human
  ears are deaf to their pleas.
- **The Poor in Spirit:** While this text speaks of physical poverty, it also
  applies to the _poor in spirit_ (Matthew 5:3). Those who recognize their
  spiritual bankruptcy—having no righteousness of their own—are the ones the
  Lord hears most distinctly.
  - **Justification:** This is the legal declaration by God that a repentant
    sinner is righteous. It is only when we admit we are "poor" (destitute of
    merit) that we can receive the wealth of Christ’s righteousness imputed to
    us (Romans 3:24; Revelation 3:17–18).
- **The Sanctuary Truth:** In the earthly sanctuary, the offering of the poor
  (two turtledoves) was accepted just as readily as the bullock of the rich
  (Leviticus 5:7). This foreshadowed the cross, where the ground is level, and
  Christ’s blood is of infinite value for every soul regardless of earthly
  station.

[ILL] **The King's Ear:** Imagine a great King sitting on a throne surrounded by
powerful advisors and loud fanfare. Suddenly, he holds up a hand to silence the
music because, amidst the noise, he hears the faint cry of a child in distress
outside the palace gates. The world ignores the poor because of the noise of
commerce and pleasure, but the King of the Universe has an ear tuned
specifically to the frequency of human need.

### Q2. What was our Saviour's attitude toward the poor?

**"He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor." Luke 4:18.**
**"Whensoever ye will ye may do them good." Mark 14:7.** **Read also Acts
20:35.**

**Answer:**

Christ’s attitude toward the poor was not merely one of sympathy, but of
identification and active service. He did not stand apart and throw coins; He
came down and touched them.

- **Christ’s Earthly Station:** The Majesty of heaven voluntarily became poor so
  that we, through His poverty, might be rich (2 Corinthians 8:9). He was born
  in a manger and had nowhere to lay His head (Luke 9:58). This allows Him to be
  a merciful High Priest who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities
  (Hebrews 4:15).
- **The Gospel Commission:** Jesus highlights that the Gospel is specifically
  for the poor. The world courts the wealthy and powerful, but the Kingdom of
  Grace is often most readily received by the poor of this world, rich in faith
  (James 2:5).
- **Practical Righteousness:** Jesus taught that true religion cannot be
  separated from practical benevolence. We cannot claim to have His
  righteousness _imparted_ to us (sanctification) if we do not share His spirit
  of self-sacrificing love for the needy.
  - **Sanctification:** The ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to transform the
    believer’s character into the likeness of Christ. If Christ went about doing
    good (Acts 10:38), a sanctified believer will inevitably do the same.

[ILL] **The Physician's Visit:** A doctor who only writes prescriptions from a
distant office does little comfort to a dying patient. But the Great Physician
came to the bedside of humanity. He took the fevered hand of the sick and the
dirty hand of the leper. His attitude was not "Go and be warmed," but "Come and
be healed."

### Q3. What promises are made to those who consider the poor?

**"Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the
time of trouble. The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be
blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his
enemies. The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt
make all his bed in his sickness." Psalm 41:1–3.**

**Answer:**

God binds His promises of protection to the practice of mercy. This passage
outlines a reciprocal principle in God’s government: "Blessed are the merciful:
for they shall obtain mercy" (Matthew 5:7).

- **Deliverance in the Time of Trouble:** The phrase "time of trouble" has
  prophetic significance for Adventists (Daniel 12:1). Those who have learned to
  show mercy to others will find God a refuge when the world plunges into the
  final crisis. Their bread and water will be sure (Isaiah 33:16).
- **Preservation and Strength:** The promise extends to physical health and
  sustenance. While not a guarantee of immunity from all suffering, it is a
  covenant that God will sustain the bed of the sick believer, providing
  supernatural comfort and strength.
- **A Reflection of the Atonement:**
  - **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation. Just as we hope for God to cover
    our nakedness with Christ’s righteousness in the judgment, we show our
    appreciation of that grace by covering the physical nakedness of the poor
    now.

[ILL] **The Boomerang of Blessing:** Kindness is like a seed sown in the soil.
It may disappear from sight for a time, but under God’s providence, it
eventually springs up to bear fruit. When we alleviate the suffering of others,
we are banking up treasures of mercy that will return to us in our own hour of
need.

### Q4. When one gives to the poor, how does the Lord consider the act?

**"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord: and that which he hath
given will He pay him again." Proverbs 19:17.**

**Answer:**

This is a startling financial principle of the Kingdom of Heaven. God considers
a gift to the needy as a direct loan to Himself.

- **God as Guarantor:** When you give to someone who cannot repay you, God steps
  in and assumes the debt. He pledges His own honor to repay the kindness. The
  Creator of the universe makes Himself a debtor to the charitable human being.
- **Righteousness by Faith Application:** This is not "buying" heaven. We are
  saved by grace through faith, not of works (Ephesians 2:8–9). However,
  _genuine faith works by love_ (Galatians 5:6). A heart that truly trusts God
  with its eternal salvation will also trust God with its temporal means,
  believing that He will repay as He has promised.
- **Stewardship:** We are not owners of our wealth, but stewards. When we use
  the Master's goods to help the Master's children, we are fulfilling the
  purpose of our stewardship (1 Peter 4:10).

[ILL] **The Safe Deposit:** If you deposit money in a failing earthly bank, you
may lose it all. But Proverbs 19:17 describes a deposit into the Bank of Heaven.
The security is the throne of God, and the interest rate is eternal. Giving to
the poor is transferring funds from a temporary account to an eternal one.

---

### Q5. Will the Lord bear in mind His promise to repay these acts of kindness?

**"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which ye
have showed toward His name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do
minister." Hebrews 6:10.**

**Answer:**

God’s justice ensures that He cannot forget a labor of love. To forget would be
"unrighteous," and there is no unrighteousness in Him (Psalm 92:15).

- **The Books of Record:** In the heavenly sanctuary, there is a "book of
  remembrance" written before Him for those who fear the Lord (Malachi 3:16).
  Every act of self-denial, every secret kindness, and every cup of cold water
  given in Christ’s name is recorded there.
- **Ministering to His Name:** Notice the verse says the work is shown "toward
  His name." When we help the poor, we are honoring the family name of God. We
  are acting as His representatives on earth.
- **Perseverance:** The text mentions those who _have_ ministered and _do_
  minister. It implies a lifestyle of service, not just a one-time act. This
  consistency is the fruit of the Holy Spirit dwelling within (Galatians 5:22).

[ILL] **The Accurate Accountant:** An earthly accountant might lose a receipt or
forget an entry. But the recording angels are exact. Not a single coin given in
sacrifice, nor a single moment spent comforting the sorrowing, is omitted from
the records of the courts of heaven.

---

### Q6. If one turns a deaf ear to the pressing cry of those in need, how will the Lord regard him?

**"Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself,
but shall not be heard." Proverbs 21:13.**

**Answer:**

This solemn warning illustrates the danger of selfishness. It is a spiritual law
that the measure we use for others will be measured to us (Matthew 7:2).

- **The Danger of Hard-Heartedness:** If we harden our hearts against our
  brother, we are unwittingly hardening our hearts against the Holy Spirit.
- **The Condition of Answered Prayer:** While salvation is free, communion with
  God and the privilege of answered prayer are affected by our conduct. "If I
  regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me" (Psalm 66:18).
  Neglecting the poor when we have the power to help is a sin of omission.
- **Connection to the Judgment:** In the investigative judgment, our lives are
  reviewed. If the record shows a life of selfishness and indifference to human
  woe, it reveals a heart that was never truly broken by the love of Christ.
  Such a person is unfit for a heaven of love.

[ILL] **The Clogged Pipe:** Imagine a pipe connected to a water source. If the
outflow is blocked, the inflow eventually stops. We are channels of God’s grace.
If we refuse to let blessings flow out to others, we block the channel, and the
fresh water from heaven can no longer flow into us.

---

### Q7. Who are specially mentioned as those who should be cared for?

**"Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
plead for the widow." Isaiah 1:17.**

**Answer:**

God specifically highlights the most vulnerable groups in ancient society—those
with no legal protector.

- **The Widow and Fatherless:** In biblical times, these had no social safety
  net. God declares Himself their Defender (Psalm 68:5) and commissions His
  people to be His hands and feet in providing that defense.
- **Relieving the Oppressed:** This involves more than just charity; it involves
  _seeking judgment_ (justice). It means standing up for those who are being
  treated unfairly or exploited.
- **The Lesson of Conversion:** The text begins with "Learn to do well." This
  suggests that doing good is a discipline to be learned in the school of
  Christ. It is the practical side of repentance ("Wash you, make you clean,"
  Isaiah 1:16). We turn from sin (justification) and learn to do well
  (sanctification).

[ILL] **The Courtroom Advocate:** A widow stands in court with no money for a
lawyer, facing a powerful accuser. She is helpless. Then, a respected advocate
steps in and says, "I will take her case for free." This is what Christians are
called to do for the vulnerable, just as Christ stood up for us when we were
helpless against the accusations of Satan.

---

### Q8. How is such a work designated in the New Testament?

**"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the
fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from
the world." James 1:27.**

**Answer:**

The Apostle James provides a definition of "pure religion" that focuses entirely
on practical holiness and benevolence, rather than ceremonial observance.

- **Two Pillars of True Faith:**
  1.  **Benevolence:** Visiting the afflicted (active love).
  2.  **Purity:** Keeping unspotted from the world (separation from sin).
- **Harmony of Faith and Works:** Righteousness by Faith is not a license for
  laziness or sin. It is a transformative power. Christ within us (the hope of
  glory) will always produce a character that loves the unlovable and hates sin.
- **"Visiting":** The Greek word implies inspecting with the intent to help. It
  is not a social call, but a ministry of relief.
- **Unspotted from the World:** This refers to moral purity. We must go _into_
  the world to help the poor, but we must not let the spirit of the world
  (greed, selfishness, pride) enter _into_ us.

[ILL] **The Surgeon's Gloves:** A surgeon must touch the sick patient to heal
them, yet he must remain sterile to avoid infection. Similarly, the Christian
must touch the suffering world to heal it, yet remain "unspotted" by its sinful
principles through the power of the Holy Spirit.

---

### Q9. What kind of a fast would God have His people hold?

**"Is not this the fast that I have chosen? ... Is it not to deal thy bread to
the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when
thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from
thine own flesh?" Isaiah 58:6, 7.**

**Answer:**

Isaiah 58 is a chapter of special importance to the Remnant people, linking the
work of restoration with the Sabbath. Here, God contrasts a fast of empty ritual
with a fast of self-denial for the sake of others.

- **True Fasting:** God is not pleased with mere abstaining from food while the
  heart remains selfish and quarrelsome (see verses 3–4). The fast God chooses
  is to deny the self in order to give to the needy. It is sacrificing our own
  comfort to comfort others.
- **"Thine Own Flesh":** This reminds us of the solidarity of the human race.
  Every suffering human is our brother or sister by creation. To ignore them is
  to deny our common humanity.
- **Medical Missionary Work:** This passage is the charter for medical
  missionary work and humanitarian service. It is the "right arm" of the Third
  Angel's Message, preparing the way for the gospel to reach hearts.

[ILL] **The Emergency Ration:** During a war, a soldier might fast (skip a meal)
not for a religious ritual, but to give his rations to a starving child he
meets. That act of self-denial is the "fast" Isaiah describes—denying self to
sustain another.

---

### Q10. What promise is for those who do this work?

**"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall
say, Here I am." Isaiah 58:9.**

**Answer:**

This is one of the most powerful promises of immediate access to God found in
Scripture.

- **Restored Communion:** Sin separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2). Selfishness
  is the essence of sin. When we, through the grace of Christ, crucify
  selfishness and embrace the law of love, that barrier is removed. The channel
  of communication is open.
- **"Here I Am":** This indicates the immediate presence of God. It is the same
  language used by faithful servants like Abraham and Moses when God called
  them. Here, God uses it to respond to _us_.
- **The Condition:** The "Then" at the beginning of the verse links this promise
  directly to the previous verses about helping the poor and oppressed.

[ILL] **The Open Line:** Imagine a dedicated phone line to the President that is
usually disconnected because of a breach of protocol. When the protocol (the law
of love) is restored, the line lights up instantly. When we align our will with
God's will to save and help others, we are on the "line" with Heaven.

---

### Q11. Will such have darkness and discouragements?

**"And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul;
then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday."
Isaiah 58:10.**

**Answer:**

The promise here is for spiritual and mental clarity. "Drawing out thy soul"
implies more than just handing out bread; it means giving of one's sympathy and
heart.

- **Cure for Spiritual Depression:** Many Christians suffer from spiritual
  darkness and doubt because they are focused inward. The remedy prescribed here
  is to look outward to the needs of others. In trying to comfort others, we
  ourselves are comforted (2 Corinthians 1:4).
- **Light in Darkness:** In a world of moral confusion, those who practice the
  love of Christ will have light. They will understand duty and truth more
  clearly because they are walking in the light of Christ's example.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Faith is strengthened by exercise. As we step out
  to help others, trusting in God to supply the means, our faith grows, and the
  "darkness" of doubt vanishes.

[ILL] **The Gloomy Room:** If a room is dark and musty, you can try to sweep out
the darkness, but it won't work. The only way to remove darkness is to open the
curtains and let the light in. Serving others opens the curtains of the soul,
allowing the Sun of Righteousness to flood the heart.

### Q12. And what may he be sure of?

**"And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought,
and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a
spring of water, whose waters fail not." Isaiah 58:11.**

**Answer:**

This verse paints a picture of abundant spiritual vitality and unceasing
guidance.

- **Divine Guidance:** "The Lord shall guide thee continually." Those who are
  busy doing the Lord's work will have the Lord's supervision. They need not
  worry about where to go or what to do; the Shepherd leads the flock that
  follows Him in service.
- **Satisfaction in Drought:** When the world is spiritually or physically dry
  (times of crisis), the charitable soul will be satisfied. God possesses
  resources that the world knows nothing of.
- **A Watered Garden:**
  - **Sanctuary Imagery:** In the East, a watered garden was a place of delight
    and fruitfulness. The "spring of water" represents the Holy Spirit (John
    7:38–39).
  - **Ministry:** We are to be springs, not just reservoirs. A reservoir holds
    water; a spring lets it flow through. As long as we pour out to others, the
    source will never fail us.

[ILL] **The Stream vs. The Swamp:** A stream stays fresh and clear because it
has an inlet and an outlet. A swamp has an inlet but no outlet; the water
stagnates. To have a vibrant Christian life, we must be a stream, letting God's
blessings flow through us to the poor.

---

### Q13. In view of the promises to those who carry out these things, whose example ought all to follow?

**"I was a father to the poor; and the cause which I knew not I searched out."
Job 29:16.**

**Answer:**

Job is presented as a model of practical righteousness. His charity was not
passive; it was proactive.

- **"I Searched Out":** Job did not wait for the poor to come and beg at his
  door. He went looking for needs to meet. This requires a heart that is
  actively seeking to be a blessing.
- **"A Father to the Poor":** This implies a relationship of protection,
  provision, and ongoing care, not just a cold, one-time transaction.
- **Duty to Investigate:** The "cause which I knew not" implies that we should
  investigate claims to ensure we are helping wisely and truly relieving
  suffering, rather than acting on impulse or ignoring problems because we don't
  know the details.

[ILL] **The Search and Rescue Team:** A rescue team doesn't sit at headquarters
waiting for the lost hiker to knock on the door. They go out into the wilderness
to find him. The Christian is called to be on God’s search and rescue team for
the poor and needy.

---

### Q14. What did the Saviour enjoin upon the rich young man, that he might have treasure in heaven?

**"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and
give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow
Me." Matthew 19:21.**

**Answer:**

This story strikes at the heart of idolatry. The rich young ruler kept the
letter of the law, but he lacked the spirit of the law, which is
self-sacrificing love.

- **"If Thou Wilt Be Perfect":** The word "perfect" (_teleios_) means complete
  or mature. The young man was incomplete; he was holding on to an idol (wealth)
  that blocked his full surrender to God.
- **The Great Exchange:** Jesus offered him a trade: earthly treasure
  (temporary, burdensome) for heavenly treasure (eternal, glorious). The
  condition was to use the earthly wealth to bless the poor.
- **Follow Me:** Giving away money was not enough; he had to follow Jesus.
  Righteousness comes from following Christ, not just philanthropy. But he could
  not follow Christ while dragging his idol of gold.
- **RBF Lesson:** We cannot be justified by faith while willfully holding onto
  an idol. Faith implies a full surrender of the life to God.

[ILL] **The Sinking Ship:** A man is on a sinking ship with a heavy bag of gold
strapped to his waist. A rescue rope is thrown to him. To grab the rope
(salvation/following Christ), he must let go of the gold. He cannot have both.

---

### Q15. What will the Saviour say to the saints when the time comes for them to inherit the kingdom?

**"For I was an hungered, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty and ye gave Me
drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me in; naked, and ye clothed Me; I was
sick, and ye visited Me; I was in prison, and ye came unto Me." Matthew
25:35, 36.**

**Answer:**

In the parable of the sheep and the goats, the final judgment turns on the
evidence of love in the life of the believer.

- **Evidence of Faith:** These works do not earn heaven (for we are saved by
  grace), but they demonstrate the reality of the faith professed. A faith that
  does not produce love is dead (James 2:17).
- **The Identification:** Jesus identifies Himself fully with the suffering. He
  does not say, "You helped the poor," but "You helped _Me_."
- **Sanctuary/Judgment:** This scene depicts the Executive Judgment. The
  investigative phase has passed, and now the King separates the saved from the
  lost. The "sheep" are those who have the character of the Shepherd.

[ILL] **The King in Disguise:** There are old stories of kings dressing as
beggars to walk among their people and see who was truly kind. Jesus tells us
this is reality. He comes to us daily in the form of the struggling widow, the
hungry child, or the lonely outcast. How we treat them is how we treat the King.

---

### Q16. When the righteous shall ask in surprise when they performed these good deeds, what will the Saviour say unto them?

**"And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, In as
much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done
it unto Me." Matthew 25:40.**

**Answer:**

The surprise of the righteous is significant. It shows that their works were not
done for show or to "earn points" for heaven. They helped because it was in
their nature to help—the new nature they received from Christ.

- **Unconscious Righteousness:** The righteous did not keep a scorecard. Their
  love was spontaneous and natural, flowing from a heart renewed by the Holy
  Spirit. This is the true experience of Sanctification—when obedience becomes
  natural because the law is written on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
- **"The Least of These":** Christ values the person the world despises. To
  serve the "least" requires humility, stripping away pride.
- **Christ's Representation:** As our High Priest in heaven, Christ bears the
  names of His people on His breastplate. What touches them, touches Him.

[ILL] **The Healthy Tree:** An apple tree does not grunt and strain and say, "I
must produce an apple today so the farmer will like me." It produces apples
naturally because it is an apple tree with life in its roots. The righteous
produce good works naturally because they are rooted in Christ.

---

### Q17. Is it true, then, that if we neglect a poor saint in any degree, we thus neglect the Saviour?

**"Then shall He answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, In as much as ye
did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me." Matthew 25:45.**

**Answer:**

Yes, it is true. This is the fearful counterpart to the previous promise.
Neglect of the poor is accounted as neglect of Christ.

- **Sins of Omission:** The "goats" on the left hand are not accused of murder
  or theft. They are condemned for _what they did not do_. They simply lived for
  themselves. They left Christ hungry, thirsty, and naked by ignoring His
  suffering children.
- **The Solidarity of the Body:** "For we are members of his body, of his flesh,
  and of his bones" (Ephesians 5:30). You cannot hurt a man's finger without
  hurting the man. You cannot ignore the needs of Christ's body (the church and
  suffering humanity) without rejecting the Head (Christ).
- **Final Appeal:** We are called to look closely at "their cases" (as the note
  below says). We must not turn away. The love of Christ constraineth us (2
  Corinthians 5:14) to act.

[ILL] **The Closed Door:** If a weary traveler knocks at your door in a storm,
and you look through the peephole, see his distress, and lock the bolt, you have
rejected him. Jesus says, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock" (Revelation
3:20). Often, He knocks with the hand of the poor. To lock them out is to lock
Him out.

---

**NOTE.**—It thus follows that whoever turns his face from the earnest appeals
of the worthy poor, or even neglects, through lack of interest, to look up their
cases, reproaches and dishonors his Lord.
