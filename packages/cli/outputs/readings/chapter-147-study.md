# Bible Study: The Poor and Our Duty Toward Them

## Introduction

Few subjects reveal the heart of God more clearly than His tender regard for the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the oppressed. Throughout Scripture, the treatment of society's most vulnerable members serves as a test of genuine faith—not merely what we profess to believe, but how we live out the love of Christ. This study reveals that ministry to the poor is not optional charity but essential Christianity, woven into the very fabric of "pure religion" and directly connected to our relationship with Christ Himself.

## Core Truths

### God's Heart for the Poor

The Scriptures declare with unmistakable clarity that the Lord is not indifferent to human suffering:

> _"The Lord heareth the poor."_ (Psalm 69:33)

> _"For He shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper."_ (Psalm 72:12)

**Poverty** in Scripture refers not merely to lack of money, but to all forms of helplessness—those without resources, influence, or advocates. God positions Himself as their defender and listener when others turn away.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "poor" (_ani_) in Psalm 69:33 carries the meaning of "afflicted" or "humble"—those brought low by circumstances beyond their control. God's ear is especially attuned to those whom the world overlooks.

### Christ's Example: The Poor Central to His Mission

When Jesus announced His earthly ministry, He quoted Isaiah's prophecy:

> _"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor."_ (Luke 4:18)

Notice: preaching to the poor was not incidental—it was the _first_ purpose listed in Christ's divine commission. The gospel is especially good news to those who have nothing in this world, for they are offered everything in Christ.

Jesus further declared:

> _"For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good."_ (Mark 14:7)

This was not fatalism about poverty's permanence, but an invitation to constant ministry. There will never be a shortage of opportunities to serve.

[ILL] Consider a wealthy king who, rather than remaining in his palace, puts on the garments of a servant and goes out into the streets to bind up wounds and feed the hungry. The people marvel—why would one so exalted stoop so low? Yet this is precisely what Christ did. He left heaven's glory to minister to the poorest of earth, and He calls us to follow in His steps (Acts 20:35; 1 Peter 2:21).

## Deeper Truths

### A Divine Exchange: Lending to the Lord

One of Scripture's most remarkable statements elevates care for the poor to a sacred transaction with God Himself:

> _"He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will He pay him again."_ (Proverbs 19:17)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "lendeth" (_lavah_) implies a binding agreement. When we give to the poor, God considers Himself personally obligated to repay us—not grudgingly, but with divine generosity. The Creator of the universe becomes our debtor!

This is not a prosperity gospel scheme, but a principle of the kingdom: what we release into God's hands for the blessing of others, He multiplies back to us in ways we cannot foresee (Luke 6:38).

> _"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward His name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister."_ (Hebrews 6:10)

[Q] **"But I have so little myself—how can I give to others?"**

The widow's two mites remind us that God measures generosity not by amount, but by proportion and heart (Mark 12:41–44). A cup of cold water given in Christ's name is precious in heaven's sight (Matthew 10:42). God never asks us to give what we do not have; He asks us to share what we do have, trusting Him for the rest.

### The Serious Warning: Stopping Our Ears

Scripture contains solemn warnings for those who ignore the poor:

> _"Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard."_ (Proverbs 21:13)

This is a fearful principle: the measure we extend to others returns to us. If we close our hearts to human need, we cannot expect God to hear us in our own extremity. This is not vindictiveness on God's part, but the natural law of sowing and reaping (Galatians 6:7).

### Those Specially Marked for Our Care

God singles out specific groups deserving protection:

> _"Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow."_ (Isaiah 1:17)

- **The fatherless**: Children without parental protection
- **The widow**: Women without husbands or providers
- **The oppressed**: Those crushed by injustice or circumstance

The New Testament confirms this priority:

> _"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world."_ (James 1:27)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "visit" (_episkeptomai_) means far more than a social call—it implies inspection, care, and practical relief. It is the same word used of God "visiting" His people to deliver them (Luke 1:68). True religion involves active, personal engagement with human suffering.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Fast God Has Chosen

In Isaiah 58, God rebukes religious formalism that neglects practical mercy:

> _"Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?"_ (Isaiah 58:6, 7)

Notice the progression: God connects justice, liberation, feeding, housing, and clothing all in one breath. These are not separate programs but one integrated response to human need.

**To the one who ministers thus, God promises:**

1. **Answered prayer**: _"Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am."_ (Isaiah 58:9)

2. **Light in darkness**: _"Then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday."_ (Isaiah 58:10)

3. **Continual guidance**: _"And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not."_ (Isaiah 58:11)

[ILL] A watered garden in the desert stands as an oasis of life amid barrenness. So shall the believer who cares for the poor become—refreshed continually from an unfailing spring, blessing all around with the overflow of God's grace. Such souls never run dry because their source is heaven itself.

### Connection to Righteousness by Faith

How does this relate to righteousness by faith? Some fear that emphasizing good works contradicts salvation by grace. But genuine faith always produces fruit (James 2:17–18). We do not earn salvation by caring for the poor; rather, care for the poor is the _evidence_ that Christ dwells within.

When the love of Christ fills the heart, it flows outward to others. The same faith that receives Christ's imputed righteousness also receives His imparted love—and love must act. As Ellen White wrote: "The completeness of Christian character is attained when the impulse to help and bless others springs constantly from within" (_Acts of the Apostles_, p. 551).

### The Sanctuary Principle

In the earthly sanctuary, the sin offering's blood was applied to bring atonement—but the offerer also shared the sacrifice with the priest, and provision was always made for the poor who could not afford costly animals (Leviticus 5:7, 11). God ensured no one was excluded from mercy by poverty.

In the Most Holy Place ministry, Christ our High Priest intercedes for a people being perfected in love—love demonstrated in how they treat "the least of these." The investigative judgment does not merely examine doctrinal beliefs, but whether faith has worked by love (Matthew 25:31–46; Galatians 5:6).

## The Test of the Judgment

### Christ Identifies with the Poor

The most startling revelation comes in Christ's description of the final judgment:

> _"For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me."_ (Matthew 25:35, 36)

When the righteous ask in astonishment when they served Christ so directly, He answers:

> _"Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."_ (Matthew 25:40)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "the least of these" (_elachistos_) refers to those regarded as smallest, most insignificant, or of lowest status. Jesus elevates them to a position of highest honor: ministering to them is ministering to the King of kings Himself.

**Conversely, to the lost:**

> _"Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me."_ (Matthew 25:45)

This is the solemn reality: Christ so identifies with suffering humanity that He considers our treatment of the poor as treatment of Himself. To neglect a poor saint, through callousness or mere lack of interest, is to neglect—and dishonor—our Lord.

[Q] **"Does this mean we must help every person who asks, without discernment?"**

Scripture calls for wisdom (Matthew 10:16). We are to "consider" the poor thoughtfully (Psalm 41:1), investigate cases we "know not" (Job 29:16), and give as each has need (Acts 4:35). Discernment protects both giver and receiver, but it never becomes an excuse for indifference. Better to err on the side of generosity than to turn away from Christ Himself.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for Daily Life

1. **Open your eyes**: Poverty exists in your community—perhaps hidden, perhaps visible. Ask God to show you the needs around you. Do not "hide yourself from your own flesh" (Isaiah 58:7).

2. **Give systematically**: Beyond impulse charity, consider how your resources can regularly bless the poor—through church benevolence funds, support for widows and orphans, or direct personal ministry.

3. **Give personally**: Money is needed, but so is presence. "Visit" the sick, the imprisoned, the lonely. Your time may be more valuable than your check.

4. **Advocate for justice**: Plead the cause of those who cannot plead for themselves (Proverbs 31:8–9). Speak against oppression wherever you encounter it.

5. **Examine your heart**: Is there hardness toward certain groups—the homeless, the immigrant, the prisoner? Christ identifies with them all.

6. **Follow Job's example**: _"I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out."_ (Job 29:16) Do not wait for need to find you—search it out.

7. **Remember the rich young ruler**: Jesus invited him to trade earthly wealth for heavenly treasure by giving to the poor (Matthew 19:21). What might Christ be asking you to release?

## Appeal

_"Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble."_ (Psalm 41:1)

Dear friend, the treatment of the poor is not peripheral to Christianity—it is central. Our Lord made it a test of genuine faith and a criterion of the final judgment. In the poor and suffering, He meets us incognito, inviting us to minister to Him.

Will you today ask God to open your eyes to the needs around you? Will you commit to be a channel of His blessing to "the least of these"? Every act of kindness is a loan to the Lord—and He has promised to repay.

The spring that flows outward never runs dry. The soul that blesses others is blessed. The hand that opens to the poor opens heaven's storehouse upon itself.

Let us follow Christ, who "though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich" (2 Corinthians 8:9). His example is our pattern; His love is our power; His promise is our assurance.

_"Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."_
