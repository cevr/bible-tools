## Slide 1 – Q1: God’s Care for the Poor

- Question: Does the Lord care whether or not we are prompt in paying the poor?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 24:14, 15 – “Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that
  is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are
  in thy land within thy gates: at his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither
  shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it:
  lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Principles of Justice

- **God Defends the Vulnerable:**
  - The stranger and the poor often lack power to enforce their rights.
  - God steps in as their Defender (Psalm 68:5 – “A father of the fatherless,
    and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.”).
- **Promptness is a Moral Duty:**
  - Delaying payment is not just an error; Scripture calls it _oppression_.
  - For those living hand-to-mouth, delayed wages mean delayed food.
  - Withholding dues violates the commandment against stealing.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:**
  - The distress of the unpaid worker rises to heaven like the blood of Abel.
  - In the Sanctuary, God hears the cries of the earth; He is not indifferent to
    injustice.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Sanctification and Illustration

- **Sanctification in Business:**
  - Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit making the believer holy in
    character.
  - A man cannot be a true Christian on Sabbath while being a tyrant on Monday.
  - The life of Christ produces mercy and promptness in obligations.
- **Illustration:**
  - A wealthy farmer hires a neighbor but delays payment at sunset because he is
    tired, thinking the money is safe.
  - The neighbor goes home empty-handed, unable to buy milk for his children.
  - The farmer has not just delayed payment; he has crushed a spirit.
  - The Christian’s ledger is kept in the books of heaven.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Prophecy of the Last Days

- Question: What is said of the hire of the laborers which is kept back by the
  rich men of the last days?
- Key Text: James 5:4 – “Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down
  your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them
  which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Judgment and Faith

- **The Lord of Sabaoth:**
  - This title means "Lord of Hosts" (armies).
  - The God of the universe is ready to battle on behalf of the defrauded.
- **The Investigative Judgment:**
  - The cries have "entered into the ears of the Lord."
  - In the judgment prior to Christ's return, every act of fraud stands as a
    witness against the soul unless confessed.
- **Righteousness by Faith vs. Fraud:**
  - Faith without works is dead (James 2:17).
  - Righteousness by Faith is not a cloak to cover sin; it writes the law of
    love on the heart (Hebrews 8:10).
  - A heart filled with Christ cannot exploit another human being.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Unheard Prayer:**
  - Imagine a man praying loudly in a prayer meeting, asking for God’s blessing.
  - However, the sound of his prayer is drowned out in heaven by the "noise" of
    coins he withheld from his employees.
  - God hears the cry of injustice louder than the profession of piety.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Company of Defrauders

- Question: With whom are they classed who defraud the laborer of his hire?
- Key Text: Malachi 3:5 – “And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will
  be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and
  against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his
  wages.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Doctrinal Points

- **The Company They Keep:**
  - God lists financial oppressors alongside:
    - **Sorcerers:** Rebellion against God.
    - **Adulterers:** Destroyers of the family.
    - **False Swearers:** Perjurers and liars.
- **The Severity of the Sin:**
  - We may view stinginess as a minor flaw, but God sees selfishness as the root
    of all sin.
  - Robbing a laborer demonstrates a character devoid of God's love.
- **Swift Witness:**
  - In the final judgment, God does not need a jury.
  - He is the witness to the secret dealings of business life.
- **Justification and Life:**
  - True justification (being declared righteous) is always followed by a
    changed life that turns away from oppression.

## Slide 9 – Q4: Entrance to the Holy City

- Question: Will any of these enter the new Jerusalem?
- Key Text: Revelation 22:15 – “For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and
  whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a
  lie.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Fitness for Heaven

- **"Maketh a Lie":**
  - Withholding wages and embezzlement are practical lies.
  - These actions claim, "This money is mine," when it belongs to another.
- **Character Transformation:**
  - Salvation is by grace, but grace transforms the character to fit heaven.
  - A cheater would bring the seed of discord into a perfect universe.
  - **Atonement** involves cleansing the sinner from the _desire_ to sin.
- **The Seal of God:**
  - The 144,000 are described as having "no guile" (deceit) in their mouths
    (Revelation 14:5).
  - Absolute honesty is a mark of God's remnant.

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Counterfeit Coin:**
  - A counterfeit coin may pass unnoticed in a dark alley.
  - Under the bright light of a bank teller’s lamp, it is rejected.
  - Shady business deals pass in the darkness of human ignorance.
  - In the light of God's glory at the New Jerusalem, only the pure gold of a
    Christ-like character will pass.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Reproof of Stinginess

- Question: How does the Bible reprove those who stint their laborers?
- Key Text: 1 Timothy 5:18 – “For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the
  ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.”
- Key Text: Leviticus 19:13 – “Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob
  him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until
  the morning.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Biblical Principles & Sanctuary

- **The Lesson of the Ox:**
  - If God requires generosity toward a working animal, how much more toward
    human beings created in His image?
- **Robbery Defined:**
  - Keeping money past the due time is theft in God's sight, even without a mask
    or gun.
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, a **trespass offering** was required for sins
    against property (Leviticus 6:1–6).
  - This offering required **restitution** (principal + 20%).
  - True repentance involves making things right with our fellow man.

## Slide 14 – Q6: Responsibility for Trust

- Question: Are we responsible for the loss by theft of goods that were
  entrusted to our care?
- Key Text: Exodus 22:8, 12, 13 – “If the thief be not found, then the master of
  the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his
  hand unto his neighbor's goods. ... And if it be stolen from him, he shall
  make restitution unto the owner thereof. If it be torn in pieces, then let him
  bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Stewardship Principles

- **Accountability:**
  - If we agree to keep a neighbor's goods, we become the guardian.
  - We bear the loss if theft occurs due to our lack of watchfulness.
- **Evidence of Innocence:**
  - God is reasonable; if an unavoidable accident occurs (like a beast tearing
    the animal), evidence clears the guardian.
- **Spiritual Application:**
  - We are stewards of God's goods (time, talents, bodies).
  - If we are careless and allow the enemy to steal our affections, we are
    accountable to the Judge.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Borrowed Car:**
  - If you borrow a friend’s car, leave it unlocked with keys in the ignition,
    and it is stolen, you are responsible.
  - You cannot simply blame the thief; your negligence paved the way.
  - We must be vigilant in our duties to God and man.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Negligence and Debt

- Question: Do we become debtors through our own negligence?
- Key Text: Exodus 22:6 – “If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the
  stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field be consumed therewith; he
  that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: The Law of Negligence

- **Carelessness is Sin:**
  - A lawful act (lighting a fire) becomes a sin if carelessness harms another.
  - The man did not _intend_ to burn the crops, but his lack of care caused the
    loss.
- **Restitution Required:**
  - Sorrow is not enough; the loss must be repaid.
- **The Golden Rule:**
  - Matthew 7:12 – “All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
    ye even so to them.”
  - If our property were destroyed, we would desire compensation; love requires
    us to do the same.
- **Sanctification:**
  - A sanctified mind is thoughtful, not reckless.

## Slide 19 – Q8: Restitution for Injury

- Question: If a man wantonly or with malice aforethought, commits injury or
  entails loss, what redress is required of him?
- Key Text: Exodus 22:5 – “If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten,
  and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best
  of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make
  restitution.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Restitution and the Gospel

- **Best for Best:**
  - The offender must pay from the _best_ of his own field, not with inferior
    produce.
  - This ensures the victim is fully restored and the offender feels the cost.
- **Gospel Parallel:**
  - Adam's sin robbed God of a perfect humanity.
  - Christ, the Second Adam, made "restitution" not with a blemished sacrifice,
    but by offering Himself.
  - He gave the **Best of Heaven** to satisfy the law and redeem the lost
    possession.

## Slide 21 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Broken Window:**
  - If a boy breaks a neighbor’s window in anger, gluing the shards together is
    not enough.
  - The father must pay for a brand new pane of glass, restoring it fully.
  - True restitution restores what was lost.

## Slide 22 – Q9: Borrowed Property

- Question: Does God's code hold us responsible for what we borrow?
- Key Text: Exodus 22:14, 15 – “And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and
  it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make
  it good. But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it
  be a hired thing, it came for his hire.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: The Sacred Trust

- **Full Responsibility:**
  - The borrower acts as the insurer of the item.
  - If it breaks while the owner is absent, the borrower must replace it.
- **Debt of Honor:**
  - We must be more careful with others' property than with our own.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - We have "borrowed" life and breath from God.
  - We are bought with a price (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).
  - We are responsible for how we use this borrowed life.

## Slide 24 – Q10: Usury and Interest

- Question: What is said concerning those who lend upon usury?
- Key Text: Deuteronomy 23:19 – “Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother,
  usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury.”

## Slide 25 – Q10: Financial Principles

- **Usury Defined:**
  - In context, this referred to charging interest to the poor who borrowed for
    survival.
  - Profiting from another's distress is a sin.
- **Financial Freedom:**
  - Proverbs 22:7 – “The borrower is servant to the lender.” God desires His
    people to be free.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - A trusting heart relies on God for provision rather than squeezing the
    vulnerable to increase wealth.
  - The Christian spirit lends, "hoping for nothing again" (Luke 6:35).

## Slide 26 – Q11: Deeds of Kindness

- Question: Do we owe one another even deeds of kindness?
- Key Text: Exodus 23:4, 5 – “If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going
  astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. If thou see the ass of
  him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him,
  thou shalt surely help with him.”

## Slide 27 – Q11: Loving the Enemy

- **Active Benevolence:**
  - Obligation extends beyond financial honesty to active help.
  - This anticipates Jesus' command to "Love your enemies" (Matthew 5:44).
- **Overcoming Evil with Good:**
  - Ignoring the animal because it belongs to an enemy harbors the spirit of
    hatred.
  - Helping the animal breaks down the wall of hostility.
- **Illustration:**
  - Two neighbors are feuding. One sees the other's cow heading toward a
    dangerous ravine.
  - The natural heart says, "Let it fall."
  - The heart where Christ dwells says, "I must save it." This is the fruit of
    the Spirit.

## Slide 28 – Q12: The Summary of Duty

- Question: How does the apostle Paul cover the whole subject?
- Key Text: Romans 13:7, 8 – “Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to
  whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom
  honor. Owe no many anything, but to love one another.”

## Slide 29 – Q12: The Infinite Debt

- **Pay What You Owe:**
  - Christians must be marked by integrity in taxes, respect, and debts.
  - Aim to live within means: "Owe no man anything."
- **The Debt of Love:**
  - The only debt we can never fully pay off is love.
  - Because Christ loved us infinitely, we are under eternal obligation to love
    others.
- **Gospel Conclusion:**
  - **Justification** clears our debt of sin before God.
  - **Sanctification** empowers us to live honest, generous lives.
  - When Christ dwells in the heart, He makes us honest and kind.

## Slide 30 – Q12: Final Illustration

- **The Vessel of the Heart:**
  - A jar with holes cannot hold water; the blessing runs out.
  - Dishonesty, fraud, and hatred are "holes" in the Christian character.
  - We must ask the Great Potter to mend the vessel so we can be full of His
    love.
  - We should owe nothing but love to those around us.
