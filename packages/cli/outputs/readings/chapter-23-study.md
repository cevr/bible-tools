# Bible Study: Evidences of Acceptance with God

## Introduction

How can a person know they are truly accepted by God? This vital question touches the very heart of Christian assurance. Many sincere souls live in uncertainty, wondering if their conversion is genuine or if God has truly received them. Scripture provides clear evidences—not based on feeling alone, but on the transforming work of the Spirit and the fruit that flows from union with Christ.

## Core Truths

### The Basis of Acceptance

God's acceptance is not based on nationality, social standing, or human merit. Peter declared this truth after witnessing the conversion of Cornelius:

> _"In every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him."_ (Acts 10:35)

**Fearing God** means reverent submission to His will. **Working righteousness** does not mean earning salvation by good deeds, but living rightly as a fruit of genuine faith.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "worketh righteousness" in Acts 10:35 describes the _result_ of acceptance, not its _cause_. The Greek verb tense indicates continuous action—a lifestyle flowing from relationship with God, not isolated acts to gain His favor.

### The Problem: Man Cannot Produce Righteousness

Here lies humanity's great dilemma:

> _"The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."_ (Romans 8:7)

The natural heart is not merely weak toward God—it is actively hostile. Like a compass pointing always to itself, the unconverted nature cannot orient toward heaven. This is why moral reformation alone can never bring acceptance with God.

[Q] **"But can't sincere effort and good intentions make a person acceptable to God?"**

God asked Cain, _"If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted?"_ (Genesis 4:7). Yet Cain's problem was not lack of effort but lack of faith. He brought his own works (the fruit of the ground) rather than the appointed sacrifice pointing to Christ. Human effort, however sincere, cannot substitute for the righteousness that comes through faith in Christ's sacrifice.

## Deeper Truths

### The New Birth: God's Solution

Since man cannot produce righteousness, God provides a complete transformation:

> _"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."_ (John 3:3)

> _"If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."_ (2 Corinthians 5:17)

This is not reformation but _regeneration_—not patching the old garment but receiving an entirely new nature.

**New birth** (Greek: _gennao anothen_): To be born "from above"—a divine work creating new spiritual life where none existed before (1 Peter 1:23).

### The Agent of Transformation

> _"That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."_ (John 3:6)

> _"It is the Spirit that quickeneth."_ (John 6:63)

The Holy Spirit is the active agent in regeneration. No human can manufacture this change—it is entirely God's work in the surrendered heart.

> _"If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His."_ (Romans 8:9)

[ILL] Consider a caterpillar becoming a butterfly. The creature does not improve its crawling skills until it learns to fly. Rather, a complete transformation occurs within the chrysalis—the old nature dissolved, an entirely new creature emerging. So it is with the new birth: God does not improve our old nature but gives us an entirely new one through the Spirit.

### Forgiveness: Grace, Not Wages

When the convicted sinner first experiences forgiveness, how precious it becomes! But on what basis is it given?

> _"In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace."_ (Ephesians 1:7)

The prodigal son understood this:

> _"Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."_ (Luke 15:18-19)

Forgiveness is not earned—it flows from the riches of God's grace. Even our faith does not merit salvation; all merit belongs to Christ, whom we receive by faith (Romans 4:1-5).

## The Evidences of Acceptance

### Evidence 1: The Witness of the Spirit

Can a person be accepted by God and not know it? Scripture answers clearly:

> _"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God."_ (Romans 8:16)

> _"Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit."_ (1 John 4:13)

This is not mere emotion but a deep, settled assurance—the Spirit's testimony confirming our adoption into God's family.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "witness" (_summartureo_) is a legal term meaning "to testify together with." The Holy Spirit joins His testimony with our spirit, providing dual confirmation of our acceptance—like two witnesses establishing a matter (Deuteronomy 19:15).

### Evidence 2: Peace with God

> _"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (Romans 5:1)

Before conversion, we were enemies of God (Romans 5:10). Now, through justification by faith, the war is over. This peace is not merely peaceful feelings but an objective change in relationship—we have been reconciled to God.

> _"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you."_ (John 14:27)

Christ's peace differs from worldly peace. The world offers peace through favorable circumstances; Christ gives peace _in spite of_ circumstances.

[Q] **"But I still face troubles and trials. Does this mean I'm not truly accepted?"**

Jesus was clear:

> _"In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world."_ (John 16:33)

Tribulation is not evidence of rejection—it is the normal experience of believers in a fallen world. The evidence of acceptance is peace _during_ tribulation, not the absence of it.

### Evidence 3: Delight in God's Law

One of the surest evidences of the new birth is a transformed attitude toward God's commandments:

> _"For I delight in the law of God after the inward man."_ (Romans 7:22)

> _"His delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night."_ (Psalm 1:2)

The carnal mind sees God's law as restrictive bondage. The renewed mind sees it as the transcript of God's character—a delight to study and obey.

[ILL] A young man in love does not consider it bondage to spend time with his beloved. Her wishes are not burdensome requirements but opportunities to please her. So the converted heart regards God's commandments—not as heavy chains but as expressions of a loving relationship.

### Evidence 4: The Fruit of the Spirit

> _"By their fruits ye shall know them."_ (Matthew 7:20)

> _"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance."_ (Galatians 5:22-23)

These qualities cannot be manufactured by human effort:

> _"As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me."_ (John 15:4)

**Fruit** grows naturally from vital connection to the source of life. A branch does not strain to produce grapes—it simply abides in the vine, and fruit follows. So the Christian abiding in Christ will naturally manifest His character.

[DYK🔎] Notice Paul speaks of "the fruit" (singular) of the Spirit, not "fruits" (plural). These nine qualities are not separate achievements to pursue but one unified fruit—the character of Christ—manifested in various expressions. Where the Spirit dwells, all these qualities begin to develop together.

### Evidence 5: Hearts That Burn

The disciples on the Emmaus road experienced something remarkable:

> _"Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked with us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?"_ (Luke 24:32)

When Christ opens the Scriptures to the believing heart, there is a responsive warmth—an inner recognition that this is truth, this is life, this is Christ Himself speaking.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

The evidences of acceptance parallel the believer's journey through the sanctuary:

**The Altar of Sacrifice (Outer Court):** Here we first encounter the Lamb of God. Forgiveness flows from His blood (Ephesians 1:7). The guilty conscience finds peace through Christ's atoning death. This is justification—the beginning of our acceptance.

**The Holy Place (Daily Ministry):** The table of showbread represents Christ as the Bread of Life nourishing our souls. The candlestick represents the Holy Spirit illuminating Scripture. The altar of incense represents prayer and communion with God. Here the evidence of acceptance deepens—delight in God's Word, the Spirit's witness, growing fruit of character.

**The Most Holy Place (Final Atonement):** Christ's present ministry involves not only forgiving sins but _blotting them out_—removing the very record and root of sin from the believer's experience. The final generation will be sealed, reflecting Christ's character fully, standing without fault before God's throne (Revelation 14:5).

### The Great Controversy Perspective

Satan's great accusation is that God's law cannot be kept, that human beings cannot truly be transformed, that acceptance with God is impossible. Every genuinely converted soul is a living refutation of this lie.

When the Spirit transforms a heart to _delight_ in God's law—when love, joy, and peace replace selfishness, anxiety, and strife—heaven demonstrates that God's government of love is sustainable, His law is just, and His grace is sufficient to save completely.

### Righteousness by Faith: The Heart of Acceptance

The evidences of acceptance are not works we perform to gain God's favor. They are the natural results of Christ living in us:

- **Justification** (imputed righteousness): Christ's perfect life credited to our account the moment we believe
- **Sanctification** (imparted righteousness): Christ's character progressively formed within us as we abide in Him

Both are received by faith. Both are Christ's work, not ours. The branch does not struggle to produce fruit—it simply remains connected to the vine.

> _"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."_ (Galatians 2:20)

## Practical Application

### How to Cultivate Assurance

1. **Ground your assurance in Scripture, not feelings.** Feelings fluctuate; God's promises remain constant. When doubts arise, return to verses like Romans 8:16 and 1 John 4:13.

2. **Examine your fruit honestly.** Do you see love, joy, and peace growing in your life? Not perfection, but direction—are you moving toward Christlikeness?

3. **Maintain vital connection with Christ.** Spend time in His Word daily. The disciples' hearts burned when Christ opened the Scriptures. Seek that same experience through prayerful Bible study.

4. **Open the door when He knocks.** Christ promises:

> _"If any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me."_ (Revelation 3:20)

5. **Let His peace guard your heart.** In the midst of tribulation, claim the promise:

> _"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."_ (Philippians 4:7)

### When Doubts Come

[Q] **"I don't always feel accepted. Does this mean I'm not truly converted?"**

The evidences of acceptance are not constant emotional highs but abiding realities. The Spirit witnesses to our adoption; peace with God is our legal standing; delight in God's law characterizes the new nature; fruit grows from the vine. These may be more or less perceptible at different times, but they remain true for all who abide in Christ.

When doubts arise, do not look inward for assurance—look upward to Christ. Our acceptance rests on His finished work and present intercession, not on the steadiness of our feelings.

## Appeal

_"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me."_ (Revelation 3:20)

Dear friend, do you long for the assurance of acceptance with God? The evidences are clear: the Spirit's witness, peace with God, delight in His law, and the fruit of Christlike character. These are not achievements to strive for but gifts to receive—the natural results of opening your heart to Christ.

If you have never experienced the new birth, today is the day to invite Christ in. If you are a believer struggling with doubt, return to the simple practice of abiding in the Vine. Read His Word. Commune with Him in prayer. Trust His promises more than your fluctuating feelings.

The same Christ who walked with the disciples to Emmaus desires to walk with you today—opening the Scriptures, warming your heart, revealing Himself as your Savior, Friend, and Lord. Will you open the door?
