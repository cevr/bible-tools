## Slide 1 – Q1: Acceptance with God

- Question: Who are accepted of God?
- Key Text: Acts 10:35 – “But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh
  righteousness, is accepted with him.”
- Key Text: Genesis 4:7 – “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and
  if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his
  desire, and thou shalt rule over him.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **Not Arbitrary:** God does not show partiality based on nationality or social
  standing.
- **The Source of Righteousness:**
  - True righteousness is not self-generated; our own works are insufficient.
  - Isaiah 64:6 – “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
    righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our
    iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.”
- **Fearing God:**
  - To fear God is to have reverential awe and a willingness to obey
    (Ecclesiastes 12:13 – “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear
    God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.”).
- **Faith and Acceptance:**
  - God looks at the heart. When a person responds to the Holy Spirit with
    faith, God accepts that faith.
  - It is Christ’s righteousness that makes any human work acceptable.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Mirror and the Sun:**
  - Imagine a mirror. It is dark by nature and cannot generate light on its own.
  - If the mirror turns toward the sun, it "works" light by reflecting it.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - A believer "works righteousness" not by creating it from within.
  - We work righteousness by turning our hearts toward the Sun of Righteousness
    (Malachi 4:2) and reflecting His character.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Necessary Transformation

- Question: Since by nature man cannot "work righteousness," the carnal mind
  being "enmity against God" (Rom. 8:7), what transformation is necessary?
- Key Text: 1 Peter 1:23 – “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
  incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
  creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points (The New Birth)

- **The Problem—The Carnal Mind:**
  - Human nature separated from God is selfish and rebellious.
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **The Solution—The New Birth:**
  - A superficial "turning over a new leaf" is not enough.
  - Jesus taught that we must be born again (John 3:7).
  - The "old man" of sin must die, and a "new man" is created in righteousness
    (Ephesians 4:24).
- **The Seed of Life:**
  - The new life is planted by the Word of God ("incorruptible seed").
  - Receiving Bible promises by faith brings the life of God into the soul.

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Sculpture vs. The Living:**
  - A stone sculpture can be painted and polished, but it remains cold and
    lifeless stone.
  - It can never become a human being merely by improvement; it would require a
    miracle to turn stone into flesh.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - A sinner cannot be improved into a saint.
  - We must be "born again" by the creative power of God to become a "new
    creature."

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Agency of the New Birth

- Question: By what agency is the new birth produced?
- Key Text: John 3:6 – “That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which
  is born of the Spirit is spirit.”
- Key Text: John 6:63 – “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
  nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”
- Key Text: Romans 8:9 – “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so
  be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
  Christ, he is none of his.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points (The Holy Spirit)

- **The Spirit Quickeneth:**
  - To "quicken" means to make alive.
  - The Holy Spirit moves upon the chaos of the human heart to bring spiritual
    life, just as He moved at Creation.
- **The Spirit of Christ:**
  - The Holy Spirit brings the personal presence of Jesus into the believer's
    life.
  - To have the Spirit is to have the mind of Christ (Philippians 2:5).
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, water was used for cleansing.
  - This typified the "washing of regeneration" by the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5).
  - The Spirit applies the cleansing blood of Christ to the conscience.

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Radio and Electricity:**
  - A radio may have all the correct parts and be tuned to the right frequency.
  - Without electricity, it produces no sound.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - A Christian brings the "machinery" of the mind and body.
  - It is the electricity—the Holy Spirit—that powers the life and produces the
    music of the Gospel.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Forgiveness as Grace

- Question: How precious is forgiveness to the burdened soul at conversion! Is
  this rich boon conferred as a thing that is due, or as a pure act of grace or
  unmerited favor?
- Key Text: Ephesians 1:7 – “In whom we have redemption through his blood, the
  forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace.”
- Key Text: Luke 15:18, 19 – “I will arise and go to my father, and will say
  unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, And am no
  more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Grace & Justification)

- **Not by Works:**
  - Like the prodigal son, we are accepted before we can "work" as a servant.
  - We are "justified freely by His grace" (Romans 3:24).
- **Through His Blood (Sanctuary Connection):**
  - Grace is free to us, but it cost Heaven everything.
  - Christ is the Lamb of God (John 1:29) who paid the penalty of the law.
- **Definition of Justification:**
  - God’s legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous.
  - He treats the sinner as if he had never sinned, crediting Christ's perfect
    life to his account (Romans 4:5).

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Paid Fine:**
  - If a man commits a crime and faces a million-dollar fine he cannot pay, he
    is hopeless.
  - If a wealthy friend pays the fine, the judge can legally set the man free.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The freedom is a gift to the criminal, but the cost was real to the friend.
  - Christ paid our debt on the cross so we could receive the
    receipt—forgiveness—as a free gift.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Relation to God

- Question: What relation exists between God and believers?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 6:16 – “...I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and
  I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 6:18 – “And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be
  my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Key Points (Adoption & Sanctuary)

- **Adoption:**
  - We are not merely subjects; we are adopted children of a Father.
  - Romans 8:15 – “For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
    but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.”
- **Mutual Possession:**
  - God pledges His omnipotence to protect us; we pledge our loyalty to Him.
- **Sanctuary Connection:**
  - God’s purpose: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them"
    (Exodus 25:8).
  - Through the Spirit, the believer’s body becomes the temple of the living God
    (1 Corinthians 6:19).

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Adopted Child:**
  - A king may pity a street urchin and give him a coin.
  - But if the king adopts him, signs the papers, and brings him into the
    palace, the relationship changes entirely.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The child now has a right to the resources of the father.
  - By faith, we are that child.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Consciousness of Relationship

- Question: Can such relation exist and one not be conscious of it?
- Key Text: Romans 8:16 – “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit,
  that we are the children of God.”
- Key Text: 1 John 4:13 – “Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us,
  because he hath given us of his Spirit.”
- Key Text: John 14:17 – “Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot
  receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him; for
  he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points (Assurance)

- **The Witness of the Spirit:**
  - The Spirit gives internal assurance of acceptance, often through Scripture.
  - When we read a promise, the Spirit helps us believe, "This is for me."
- **Knowing Him:**
  - Righteousness by faith is a personal, interactive knowledge of God.
  - Jesus said the world does not know the Spirit, but "ye know Him."
- **Evidence of Change:**
  - We know we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren (1
    John 3:14).
  - Our desires change from worldly things to spiritual things.

## Slide 18 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Heavy Backpack:**
  - If a person carries a heavy backpack of rocks and someone suddenly cuts the
    straps, the person _knows_ the difference.
  - They feel the immediate relief.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - When the burden of sin is rolled away at the foot of the cross, the soul
    knows the relief of forgiveness.

## Slide 19 – Q7: Results of Acceptance

- Question: What does the knowledge of our acceptance with God bring?
- Key Text: Romans 5:1 – “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
  God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 20 – Q7: Key Points (Peace with God)

- **End of Hostilities:**
  - Sin is a state of war against God's government.
  - When we accept Christ's righteousness, the war ends. We are no longer
    "enemies" (Romans 5:10).
- **Relief from Guilt:**
  - Justification removes the ground of guilt because Christ has taken the
    penalty.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Peace comes only by _faith_.
  - Looking to our own works brings anxiety; looking to Christ's finished work
    brings peace.

## Slide 21 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Pardoned Soldier:**
  - Imagine a soldier who fought against a rightful king, living in fear of
    capture and punishment.
  - He receives a royal pardon and an invitation to the king's table.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The fear vanishes, replaced by gratitude.
  - This is the peace of the justified soul.

## Slide 22 – Q8: Nature of True Peace

- Question: Of what nature is the peace of the believer?
- Key Text: John 14:27 – “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not
  as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither
  let it be afraid.”

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points (Divine Peace)

- **Not External:**
  - Worldly peace depends on circumstances (money, health, absence of conflict).
- **Internal and Divine:**
  - Christ's peace ("My peace") is a deep trust in the Father.
  - It exists _regardless_ of external trouble.
- **Fruit of the Spirit:**
  - Peace is a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22).
  - It is the tranquility of a heart that has nothing to hide from God.

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **The Ocean Depths:**
  - The surface of the ocean may be raging with waves during a hurricane.
  - Deep below the surface, the waters remain perfectly still.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The Christian's life may have storms on the surface (troubles, persecution).
  - Deep in the soul, there is the stillness of God.

## Slide 25 – Q9: Peace and Tribulation

- Question: Will those who have this peace be free from tribulation?
- Key Text: John 16:33 – “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye
  might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good
  cheer; I have overcome the world.”

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points (Victory in Conflict)

- **The Reality of Conflict:**
  - "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution" (2
    Timothy 3:12).
  - Tribulation refines the character (1 Peter 1:6-7).
- **Good Cheer:**
  - We rejoice not because pain is gone, but because the Victory is won.
  - Christ has "overcome the world," and His victory becomes ours by faith (1
    John 5:4).
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - Suffering drives us to the Sanctuary—to the throne of grace—to find help in
    time of need.

## Slide 27 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Polished Diamond:**
  - A diamond is shaped and polished by friction.
  - Without the friction of the grinding wheel, it remains a rough stone.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - God uses the friction of tribulation to polish His people into jewels for
    His kingdom.

## Slide 28 – Q10: Delight in God's Law

- Question: What will be one of the delights of the converted man?
- Key Text: Romans 7:22 – “For I delight in the law of God after the inward
  man.”
- Key Text: Psalm 1:2 – “But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his
  law doth he meditate day and night.”

## Slide 29 – Q10: Key Points (Sanctification)

- **The Law Written on the Heart:**
  - In the New Covenant, God puts His laws in our minds and writes them in our
    hearts (Hebrews 8:10).
  - Obedience becomes a delight, not a burden.
- **Character Alignment:**
  - The law is a transcript of God’s character.
  - Loving Christ leads to loving His law (Psalm 40:8).
- **Righteousness by Faith vs. Legalism:**
  - Legalism: Keeping the law to earn salvation (Impossible).
  - Faith: Keeping the law because the heart has been changed by salvation.

## Slide 30 – Q10: Illustration

- **Prisoner vs. Husband:**
  - A prisoner obeys the guard out of fear of punishment ("spirit of bondage").
  - A loving husband remains faithful to his wife out of love, not fear of jail.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The converted heart delights in God's law because it loves the Lawgiver.

## Slide 31 – Q11: Identifying True Believers

- Question: How may true believers be identified?
- Key Text: Matthew 7:20 – “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.”
- Key Text: Matthew 7:21 – “Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
  enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
  which is in heaven.”

## Slide 32 – Q11: Key Points (Fruit & Judgment)

- **Fruit as Evidence:**
  - Good works do not save us, but a saved person will naturally produce good
    works.
  - Profession is nothing without possession.
- **Doing the Will of God:**
  - Genuine faith always leads to obedience (James 2:17).
  - Salvation is by grace, but it is a salvation _that works_.
- **Investigative Judgment:**
  - In the judgment, our lives (fruits) testify whether our faith was genuine or
    counterfeit.

## Slide 33 – Q11: Illustration

- **The Apple Tree Sign:**
  - If an orchard tree has a sign saying "Apple Tree" but is covered in thorns
    and has no apples, the sign is a lie.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - A Christian is identified not by the "sign" they wear (church membership).
  - They are identified by the fruit they bear (character).

## Slide 34 – Q12: The Fruit of the Spirit

- Question: What is the fruit of the Spirit?
- Key Text: Galatians 5:22, 23 – “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
  peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance:
  against such there is no law.”

## Slide 35 – Q12: Key Points (Character of Christ)

- **Singular Fruit:**
  - The word "fruit" is singular.
  - All these virtues are one clustered whole—the character of Christ.
- **"Against Such There is No Law":**
  - These traits are the definition of law-keeping (Romans 13:10).
  - When these are present, the law is being kept from the heart.
- **Temperance (Self-Control):**
  - Control of the will over appetite and passion.
  - Vital for Righteousness by Faith: the body is brought into subjection to the
    sanctified mind.

## Slide 36 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Prism and Light:**
  - White light passing through a prism breaks into a rainbow of colors.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - The "fruit of the Spirit" is like white light.
  - When it shines through a human life, it breaks into the beautiful colors of
    love, joy, peace, patience, etc.

## Slide 37 – Q13: Dependence on Christ

- Question: Can one bear this fruit of himself?
- Key Text: John 15:4 – “Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear
  fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
  in me.”

## Slide 38 – Q13: Key Points (Abiding in Him)

- **Absolute Dependence:**
  - A branch cut from the trunk cannot produce fruit; it withers.
  - We cannot produce one act of genuine righteousness apart from Christ.
- **Abiding:**
  - The secret of victory is not trying harder, but "abiding" closer.
  - We receive His life through prayer and the Word.
- **Imparted Righteousness:**
  - Just as sap flows from vine to branch, the Holy Spirit flows from Christ to
    us.
  - "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
    liveth in me" (Galatians 2:20).

## Slide 39 – Q13: Illustration

- **The Diver's Air Hose:**
  - A diver underwater depends entirely on the air hose connected to the
    surface.
  - If he pinches the hose to "breathe on his own," he dies.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - We must remain connected to Christ, our life-source, every moment to live
    the Christian life.

## Slide 40 – Q14: Experience of the Disciples

- Question: What was the experience of the two disciples who talked with Jesus
  on the way to Emmaus?
- Key Text: Luke 24:32 – “And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn
  within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the
  scriptures?”

## Slide 41 – Q14: Key Points (The Word of God)

- **The Word Illumined:**
  - Jesus "opened to them the Scriptures."
  - When the Spirit illuminates the Word, it becomes the living voice of God.
- **The Burning Heart:**
  - Represents warmed affections and love for God.
  - This is the antidote to the "lukewarm" condition of Laodicea (Revelation
    3:15-16).
- **Christ Centered:**
  - The disciples burned when Jesus showed them things "concerning Himself"
    (Luke 24:27).
  - All Scripture centers on the Cross and Christ's ministry.

## Slide 42 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Iron Poker:**
  - A cold iron poker placed in a blazing fire soon becomes hot and glows red.
  - It takes on the nature of the fire.
- **Spiritual Lesson:**
  - When we spend time in the fire of God's Word, our cold hearts are warmed and
    begin to glow with His love.

## Slide 43 – Q15: The Blessed Experience

- Question: What blessed experience may all have?
- Key Text: Revelation 3:20 – “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any
  man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
  him, and he with me.”
- Key Text: Philippians 4:7 – “And the peace of God, which passeth all
  understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.”

## Slide 44 – Q15: Key Points (Indwelling Christ)

- **The Divine Knock:**
  - Addressed to Laodicea (the church of the judgment hour).
  - Christ knocks, but the will (the door) must be opened by us.
- **Intimate Fellowship:**
  - To "sup" implies deep friendship.
  - Christ sustains us as the Bread of Life.
- **Peace that Guards:**
  - Peace acts as a garrison (military guard).
  - It protects our hearts and minds from fear and doubt.

## Slide 45 – Q15: Illustration & Conclusion

- **The Handle on the Inside:**
  - Holman Hunt's painting of Jesus knocking has no handle on the outside of the
    door.
  - Only you can open your heart to Jesus.
- **Conclusion:**
  - Acceptance is a fact based on God's promise.
  - By surrendering, trusting, and abiding, we have the assurance that we are
    His children.
