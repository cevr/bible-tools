## Slide 1 – Righteousness and Life: Introduction

- Theme: In God’s plan, true righteousness and real life are always joined.
- Wherever true righteousness is, there is life; where sin rules, there is
  death.
- Eternal life is found only in Christ.
- The righteousness needed for that life is only in Christ.
- This righteousness is:
  - A gift – our title to heaven.
  - A transforming power – our fitness for heaven.
- We will move from John 3:16 to the deeper link between God’s law, Christ’s
  righteousness, and the life He gives.

---

## Slide 2 – God’s Love and the Promise of Life

- Theme: Eternal life comes from God’s love through His Son.
- Key Text: John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
  begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
  everlasting life.”
- God’s motive: “God so loved the world.”
- God’s gift: His “only begotten Son” – to live, die, and rise for us.
- The condition: “whosoever believeth in Him” – personal trust and reliance on
  Christ.
- The promise: Believers “should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
- Eternal life is a gift in Christ, received by faith, not earned.

---

## Slide 3 – The Gospel Reveals Righteousness and Life Together

- Theme: The gospel joins righteousness and life.
- Key Text: Romans 1:17 – “For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from
  faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.”
- Gospel = good news of what God has done and is doing for our salvation through
  Christ.
- “Righteousness of God” = God’s perfect rightness, seen in Christ and His law.
- “Just” = those God counts righteous because of Christ.
- “Live by faith” = daily dependence on Christ, not our own goodness.
- The gospel shows how God can make sinners truly righteous and give them life
  at the same time.

---

## Slide 4 – Life and Immortality Brought to Light

- Theme: Christ breaks death’s power and reveals immortality.
- Key Text: 2 Timothy 1:10 – “[Christ] hath abolished death, and hath brought
  life and immortality to light through the gospel.”
- Through Christ’s death and resurrection, death’s final power over believers is
  broken.
- Life and immortality are made clear, promised, and guaranteed in Christ.
- Without Christ, death is the end; in Christ, death is a sleep before
  resurrection.
- Supporting Text: 1 Thessalonians 4:16 – “For the Lord Himself shall descend
  from heaven with a shout… and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”

---

## Slide 5 – The Way of Righteousness Is the Way of Life

- Theme: The Bible directly links righteousness and life.
- Key Text: Proverbs 12:28 – “In the way of righteousness is life; and in the
  pathway thereof there is no death.”
- Where the way of righteousness is followed, the result is life and “no death”
  in the ultimate sense.
- Key Text: Proverbs 21:21 – “He that followeth after righteousness and mercy
  findeth life, righteousness, and honour.”
- Those who pursue righteousness and mercy find:
  - Life
  - Righteousness
  - Honour
- This is not human self-righteousness, but seeking God’s righteousness (Matthew
  6:33).

---

## Slide 6 – Two Kingdoms: Sin and Grace

- Theme: Two rulers, two paths, two outcomes.
- Key Text: Romans 5:21 – “That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might
  grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- Sin = breaking God’s law (1 John 3:4) – it reigns unto death.
- Grace = God’s undeserved favor and saving power – it reigns through
  righteousness.
- When sin reigns, the result is death.
- When grace reigns, it produces righteousness and leads to eternal life.
- Grace does not excuse sin; it establishes righteousness in us through Christ
  (Romans 6:14–18).

---

## Slide 7 – God’s Commandments: Righteousness

- Theme: God’s law defines righteousness.
- Key Text: Psalms 119:172 – “My tongue shall speak of Thy word: for all Thy
  commandments are righteousness.”
- The law is a written expression of God’s righteous character (Romans 7:12).
- It shows what righteousness looks like in practical life (Romans 3:20).
- The law reveals the standard but cannot give us the power to meet it.

---

## Slide 8 – God’s Commandment: Life Everlasting

- Theme: God’s commandment is a pathway of life.
- Key Text: John 12:50 – “And I know that His commandment is life everlasting:
  whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto Me, so I speak.”
- God’s commandment is not a way of death but a way of life.
- To walk in the commandments is to walk in the way of life.
- Our problem: in our fallen state we cannot keep the law in our own strength
  (Romans 8:7–8).
- The law shows our need; Christ provides the righteousness the law demands.

---

## Slide 9 – Christ: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS

- Theme: Christ Himself is our righteousness.
- Key Text: Jeremiah 23:6 – “And this is His name whereby He shall be called,
  THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.”
- Christ is not only righteous; He is our righteousness.
- Justification: God counts Christ’s obedience and sacrifice as ours when we
  believe (Romans 5:1, 18–19).
  - Imputed righteousness – credited to us as a gift.
- Sanctification: Christ, living in us by the Spirit, reproduces His character
  in us (Galatians 2:20).
  - Imparted righteousness – worked into our lives.

---

## Slide 10 – Christ: The Way, the Truth, and the Life

- Theme: Christ is both righteousness and life.
- Key Text: John 14:6 – “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the
  life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.”
- He is the Way – the only road back to God and obedience (Hebrews 10:19–20).
- He is the Truth – the full revelation of God’s character (John 1:14, 18).
- He is the Life – source of physical and spiritual life (John 1:4; 1 John
  5:11–12).
- You cannot have life without Christ; you cannot have true righteousness
  without Christ—He is both.

---

## Slide 11 – “If Thou Wilt Enter Into Life”

- Theme: Commandments and life in Jesus’ teaching.
- Key Text: Matthew 19:17 – “And He said unto him, Why callest thou Me good?
  there is none good but One, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
  keep the commandments.”
- Jesus links entering into life with keeping the commandments.
- Yet we are not justified by law-keeping (Galatians 2:16; Romans 3:20).
- We are saved by grace through faith in Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8–9).
- The commandments describe the life of love and obedience that belongs to the
  saved (Romans 8:4).

---

## Slide 12 – How Commandment-Keeping Fits the Gospel

- Theme: Obedience as the fruit of Christ within.
- No one truly keeps God’s law until Christ dwells in the heart (John 15:5).
- To “enter into life” is to enter a relationship where:
  - Christ’s righteousness is counted to us (justification).
  - Christ’s righteousness is worked in us (sanctification).
- Result: a life of obedience that flows from faith and love, not self-effort.

---

## Slide 13 – The Gift of Righteousness and Reigning in Life

- Theme: From Adam’s death to Christ’s life.
- Key Text: Romans 5:17 – “For if by one man's offence death reigned by one;
  much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of
  righteousness shall reign in life by One, Jesus Christ.”
- Adam’s sin brought death and a reign of sin over humanity.
- In Christ, God offers:
  - Abundance of grace.
  - The gift of righteousness.
- Those who receive this gift “shall reign in life” by Christ, not merely exist.

---

## Slide 14 – What It Means to “Reign in Life”

- Theme: Sharing Christ’s victory now.
- “Reign in life” includes:
  - No longer slaves to sin (Romans 6:12–14).
  - Sharing in Christ’s victory over sin and death.
  - Living in fellowship with Him now as a foretaste of eternal life.
- Key Text: John 17:3 – “And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee the
  only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.”

---

## Slide 15 – Eternal Life: Wages vs. Gift

- Theme: Death is earned; life is given.
- Key Text: Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is
  eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- Wages are earned; death is what sin earns.
- Eternal life is never earned; it is “the gift of God.”
- This gift comes only “through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

---

## Slide 16 – Guarding Against Two Errors

- Theme: Legalism and lawlessness exposed.
- Error 1 – Legalism: thinking we can earn life by good works.
- Error 2 – Lawlessness: thinking God gives life while leaving us in cherished
  sin.
- In Christ, the gift of eternal life includes:
  - The gift of righteousness.
  - Restoration of obedience to God’s law.
- Key Text: Hebrews 8:10 – “I will put My laws into their mind, and write them
  in their hearts…”
- Key Text: Titus 2:11–12 – “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation…
  teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
  soberly, righteously, and godly…”

---

## Slide 17 – Christ the Source of Every Right Impulse

- Theme: How the experience of righteousness begins.
- Quote: “Christ is the source of every right impulse. He is the only one that
  can implant in the heart enmity against sin.”
- Every genuine desire to be clean, honest, and pure is the Spirit of Christ
  working (John 16:8).
- Enmity against sin is not natural to us (Romans 8:7); Christ must plant it.
- Whenever you long for something better, it is evidence “His Spirit is moving
  upon [your] heart.”

---

## Slide 18 – The Drawing Power of the Cross

- Theme: Christ draws by love, not force.
- Key Text: John 12:32 – “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
  men unto Me.”
- Christ was lifted up:
  - On the cross in history.
  - In the preaching of the gospel today.
- As we behold “the Lamb of God upon the cross of Calvary”:
  - The mystery of redemption begins to unfold.
  - The goodness of God leads us to repentance (Romans 2:4).
  - His love softens the heart, impresses the mind, and inspires contrition.
- Repentance is our heart’s response to Christ’s love revealed at the cross.

---

## Slide 19 – Awakening and Conviction

- Theme: Early steps of transformation.
- People may become ashamed of sin and give up bad habits without knowing Christ
  is drawing them.
- If reforms come from a sincere desire to do right:
  - It is the power of Christ drawing them.
  - An unseen influence is working; conscience is “quickened” (made alive).

---

## Slide 20 – The Commandment Comes Home to the Conscience

- Theme: Seeing sin and love together.
- As Christ draws us to look upon His cross:
  - We behold “Him whom [our] sins have pierced” (Zechariah 12:10).
  - “The commandment comes home to the conscience.”
- We see:
  - The wickedness of our life.
  - The deep-seated sin of the soul—selfishness, pride, unbelief.
- We begin to ask:
  - What is sin, that it required such a sacrifice?
  - Was all this suffering demanded so we might have everlasting life?

---

## Slide 21 – Repentance and Faith: Where Righteousness and Life Meet

- Theme: Heart surrender to the crucified Saviour.
- This experience leads to:
  - Real repentance – “godly sorrow” that works repentance (2 Corinthians
    7:9–10).
  - Real faith – trusting Christ as the only sufficient Saviour (Acts 4:12).
- At the cross we see:
  - The deadly nature of sin.
  - The boundless love of God.
- Here righteousness and life meet, drawing us to surrender and trust.

---

## Slide 22 – Illustration: The Deadly Poison and the Antidote

- Theme: How law and cross work together.
- A man is dying of poison; he feels only mildly sick and thinks he will
  recover.
- A friend brings an antidote; the man at first refuses—“I’m not so bad.”
- The friend shows an X-ray: the poison is spreading everywhere.
- The friend explains: “I once drank this poison; Someone gave His life to
  produce this antidote.”
- Now the man sees:
  - How deadly the poison is.
  - How costly the cure was.
  - His pride breaks; he gratefully takes the antidote.

---

## Slide 23 – Lesson from the Illustration

- Theme: Accepting the only cure—Christ.
- The law is like the X-ray – it shows how deep sin goes.
- The cross is like the Friend’s sacrifice – it shows the cost of our salvation.
- Seeing both together:
  - Exposes our true condition.
  - Reveals God’s love.
- This leads us to accept the only cure: Christ Himself as our righteousness and
  our life.

---

## Slide 24 – God’s Character: Love, Law, and Life

- Theme: The great controversy over God’s law.
- God is love (1 John 4:8), and His law is the law of love (Matthew 22:37–40).
- His commandments are “righteousness” (Psalms 119:172) and “life everlasting”
  (John 12:50).
- Satan’s charge: God’s law is harsh and life-destroying (Genesis 3:1–5).
- The gospel answers:
  - Sin, not obedience, brings death (Romans 6:23).
  - The way of righteousness is the way of life (Proverbs 12:28).
  - Christ proves that full loyalty to God’s law is loving and life-giving (John
    15:10–11).

---

## Slide 25 – Sanctuary Overview: Righteousness and Life in Three Phases

- Theme: The sanctuary as a picture of Christ’s saving work.
- The earthly sanctuary pointed to Christ’s ministry:
  1. Outer court – sacrifice.
  2. Holy place – daily ministry.
  3. Most holy place – day of atonement/judgment.
- In every phase, righteousness and life come through Jesus Christ our Lord
  (Romans 6:23).

---

## Slide 26 – Outer Court: Sacrifice and Imputed Righteousness

- Theme: The cross and our title to life.
- Outer court (altar of burnt offering):
  - Points to Christ’s sacrifice on the cross (John 1:29; Hebrews 9:22).
  - The penalty of sin is borne by the Substitute.
- Here, righteousness is imputed:
  - The believer who trusts in Christ’s blood is counted righteous.
  - Our title to heaven and eternal life is secured in Him.

---

## Slide 27 – Holy Place: Daily Ministry and Imparted Righteousness

- Theme: Christ maintaining spiritual life now.
- Holy place (daily service):
  - Points to Christ’s present ministry as our High Priest (Hebrews 7:25;
    8:1–2).
- Here Christ:
  - Sends the Holy Spirit.
  - Gives power to obey.
  - Maintains our spiritual life through Word, prayer, and witness.
- Righteousness is imparted:
  - Christ’s life is communicated to us.
  - A holy character is formed in communion with Him.

---

## Slide 28 – Most Holy Place: Judgment and a Prepared People

- Theme: Final atonement and the uniting of righteousness and life.
- Most holy place (day of atonement):
  - Points to the investigative judgment and final atonement (Daniel 8:14;
    Hebrews 9:23–28).
- Here:
  - Sins are blotted out from the record (Acts 3:19).
  - God prepares a people who “keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
    Jesus” (Revelation 14:12).
- In them, righteousness and life are fully united in Christ.

---

## Slide 29 – The Everlasting Gospel and the End-Time

- Theme: Righteousness by faith in the last message.
- Key Text: Revelation 14:6 – “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of
  heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
  earth…”
- The last message includes:
  - The everlasting gospel.
  - A call to “fear God, and give glory to Him” (Revelation 14:7).
  - A warning against worshiping the beast and his image.

---

## Slide 30 – Commandments, Faith, and Life in the Remnant

- Theme: End-time people who unite righteousness and faith.
- Key Text: Revelation 14:12 – “Here is the patience of the saints: here are
  they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”
- Once again we see:
  - Righteousness – commandment keeping.
  - Faith – the faith of Jesus.
  - Life – the everlasting gospel.
- This is righteousness by faith in an end-time setting:
  - A people who live by Christ’s faith.
  - Manifest His obedience.
  - Are ready for eternal life.

---

## Slide 31 – How to Receive Righteousness and Life (1)

- Theme: Practical steps of response.
- 1. Look to Christ crucified:
  - Spend time contemplating His sacrifice (John 3:14–16).
  - Ask God to show you both the ugliness of sin and the beauty of His love.
- 2. Respond to His drawing:
  - When you feel conviction or a desire to change, recognize Christ is drawing
    you.
  - Do not resist; surrender your will (Hebrews 3:7–8).

---

## Slide 32 – How to Receive Righteousness and Life (2)

- 3. Confess and forsake sin:
  - Confess your sins honestly to God (1 John 1:9).
  - Ask for both pardon and power to turn from them (Proverbs 28:13).
- 4. Believe His promise of righteousness and life:
  - Take God at His word that Christ is your righteousness (Jeremiah 23:6; 1
    Corinthians 1:30).
  - Believe that eternal life is yours in Christ (1 John 5:11–13), even as He
    continues to change you.

---

## Slide 33 – How to Receive Righteousness and Life (3)

- 5. Walk in newness of life:
  - Yield yourself daily to Christ (Romans 6:11–13).
  - Let His Spirit write the law in your heart (Hebrews 8:10).
  - Obedience becomes the fruit of love, not the price of life (John 14:15).
- This is a continual experience of righteousness by faith, leading to life.

---

## Slide 34 – Appeal: Christ Your Righteousness and Your Life

- Theme: A call to choose the way of righteousness and life.
- God has united righteousness and life in one Person—Jesus Christ.
  - The law shows what righteousness is.
  - The cross shows what our unrighteousness cost.
  - The gospel shows how God freely gives both righteousness and eternal life to
    all who believe.
- You do not need to make yourself righteous before coming to Him.
- Every right desire you feel is already His Spirit drawing you.

---

## Slide 35 – Appeal: Your Personal Decision

- Come just as you are and look to the crucified and risen Saviour.
- Accept Him as:
  - Your righteousness – your only hope of acceptance with God.
  - Your life – the source of power to live in obedience and love.
- Question for decision:
  - Will you today choose to step onto “the way of righteousness” where “there
    is no death” (Proverbs 12:28)?
  - Will you let Christ be to you “THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS” (Jeremiah 23:6)?
