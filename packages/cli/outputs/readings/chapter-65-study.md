# Bible Study: Events Connected with the Millennium

## Introduction

The millennium—a thousand-year period between Christ's second coming and the final destruction of sin—stands as one of Scripture's most profound yet misunderstood teachings. This period is not, as many suppose, a golden age of earthly peace or a "second chance" for the lost. Rather, it is a solemn interlude in which God vindicates His character before the universe, the saints participate in judgment, and Satan is left to contemplate the ruin his rebellion has wrought. Understanding the millennium rightly prepares us for the climactic events that will usher in eternity.

## Core Truths

### The Glorious Return of Christ

The millennium begins with the most magnificent event in human history—the personal, visible, audible return of Jesus Christ.

> _"For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17)

Christ's return cannot be counterfeited. It will be:

- **Visible**: _"Every eye shall see Him"_ (Revelation 1:7)
- **Audible**: With a shout, the archangel's voice, and the trump of God (1 Thessalonians 4:16)
- **Glorious**: _"In His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels"_ (Luke 9:26)
- **Unexpected**: _"In such an hour as ye think not"_ (Matthew 24:44)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "meet" in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 (_apantēsis_) was a technical term used when citizens went out to formally welcome a returning king or dignitary and escort him back into the city. The redeemed meet Christ in the air not to remain there, but to accompany Him—first to heaven, then eventually back to a renewed earth.

### Six Events Marking the Beginning of the Millennium

Scripture reveals a precise sequence of events at Christ's return:

1. **The righteous dead are raised** (1 Thessalonians 4:16)
2. **The righteous living are transformed** (1 Corinthians 15:51-53; Philippians 3:21)
3. **All the righteous are caught up together** to meet the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:17)
4. **The saints are taken to heaven** (John 14:1-3)
5. **The living wicked are destroyed** by the brightness of His coming (2 Thessalonians 2:8)
6. **Satan is bound** to this desolate earth (Revelation 20:1-3)

> _"In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."_ (John 14:2, 3)

[Q] **"Will believers remain on earth during the millennium?"**

Many teach that Christ will reign on earth for a thousand years of peace. But Scripture is clear: Christ takes His people to the mansions He has prepared in His _Father's house_—heaven itself. The saints are "caught up... to meet the Lord in the air" and are then taken to where He has gone to prepare a place. During the millennium, they are in heaven, not on earth (Revelation 20:4, 6; John 14:2, 3).

## Deeper Truths

### The Earth: Desolate and Void

What becomes of our world during the millennium? The prophet Jeremiah provides a startling answer:

> _"I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by His fierce anger."_ (Jeremiah 4:23, 25, 26)

The Hebrew phrase _tohu va-bohu_ ("without form, and void") is the same expression used in Genesis 1:2 to describe the earth before creation. The millennium returns the earth, in a sense, to primeval chaos—dark, broken, uninhabited.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "bottomless pit" in Revelation 20:1-3 translates the Greek _abyssos_, the same word used in the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) for the "deep" of Genesis 1:2. Satan is cast into the same chaotic emptiness that existed before creation—a fitting prison for the author of destruction.

### Satan's Binding Explained

> _"And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years."_ (Revelation 20:1, 2)

How is Satan "bound"? Not by literal chains, for spirits are not restrained by physical fetters. He is bound by _circumstances_:

- The righteous are in heaven—beyond his reach
- The wicked are dead—no one to tempt
- The earth lies desolate—nowhere to work his deceptions

For a thousand years, the great deceiver must wander the ruins of his own rebellion, with nothing to do but contemplate the devastation sin has wrought. He who "walked about, seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8) now finds himself utterly impotent.

[ILL] Consider a hunter who has spent his life stalking prey in a vast forest. One day, every animal vanishes—not a single creature remains. His traps are useless, his cunning means nothing. Though he is free to roam, he is bound by the emptiness around him. So Satan, prince of this world, finds himself "bound" in a world emptied of every soul he might deceive.

### The Saints in Heaven: The Work of Judgment

What are the redeemed doing during this thousand years?

> _"And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them... and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."_ (Revelation 20:4)

> _"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?... Know ye not that we shall judge angels?"_ (1 Corinthians 6:2, 3)

This is not a judgment to determine who is saved—that decision was made at Christ's coming. Rather, the saints review the records of the lost and of fallen angels, seeing for themselves the justice of God's decisions. Every question about why loved ones were lost, every doubt about God's fairness, will be answered. The universe will be satisfied that God has been just, merciful, and true.

[Q] **"Isn't it cruel for the saved to review the cases of the lost?"**

This is not vindictive curiosity, but necessary vindication. God opens His books so that every intelligent being can see that He did everything possible to save each soul. The saints will recognize that the lost chose their own destiny. This transparency is essential for eternal peace—no shadow of doubt about God's character will remain.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Millennium in the Sanctuary Framework

The millennium corresponds to the final phase of the Day of Atonement pattern:

- **Before the millennium** (probationary time): Christ ministers in the heavenly sanctuary, applying His blood on behalf of repentant sinners—intercession and cleansing.
- **At the millennium's beginning**: The investigative judgment concludes; Christ leaves the sanctuary to gather His people; the wicked receive their just sentence.
- **During the millennium**: The saints in heaven participate in the review of judgment (Revelation 20:4)—the universe examines God's verdicts.
- **At the millennium's close**: Sentence is executed; sin is eradicated; the sanctuary is fully cleansed, never to be defiled again.

The scapegoat (Azazel) of Leviticus 16, upon whom the sins of Israel were placed after the sanctuary was cleansed, foreshadows Satan bearing ultimate responsibility for the sins he instigated—left alone in the wilderness of a ruined earth.

[DYK🔎] In the ancient Day of Atonement, the scapegoat was not sacrificed—it was led into the wilderness to perish alone, bearing the guilt of sins it had incited. This typifies Satan's fate: not an atoning sacrifice, but a banishment and final destruction as the instigator of all rebellion.

### Righteousness by Faith and Eternal Security

The millennium reveals that salvation is _entirely_ Christ's work. The saints do not earn entrance to heaven by their performance during the thousand years—they enter at its beginning, by grace through faith, clothed in Christ's righteousness. Their participation in judgment is a privilege of redeemed children, not a probationary test.

> _"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power."_ (Revelation 20:6)

Those who have trusted Christ and received His imputed and imparted righteousness have no fear of the second death. Their destiny is sealed—not by their merit, but by His.

## The Close of the Millennium

### The Wicked Raised and Satan Loosed

> _"But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished."_ (Revelation 20:5)

At the end of the thousand years, the wicked of all ages are resurrected in the second resurrection. Satan, now with subjects to deceive once more, is "loosed out of his prison" (Revelation 20:7). His binding was by circumstance; their resurrection frees him to work again.

### The Final Assault on the Holy City

> _"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."_ (Revelation 20:9)

The New Jerusalem, the "beloved city," descends from heaven (Revelation 21:2). Satan rallies the resurrected wicked—"the number of whom is as the sand of the sea"—for one last desperate attack on God's throne. Here, at last, the entire universe beholds the contrast:

- Inside the city: the redeemed, the angels, the Lamb
- Outside: the unrepentant, led by the rebel who first said, "I will be like the Most High" (Isaiah 14:14)

[Q] **"Will every sinner receive the same punishment?"**

Scripture is clear that God judges according to deeds (Romans 2:6; Revelation 20:12). The degree of suffering will be proportionate to the light rejected and the evil committed. Yet the final result for all the lost is the same: utter destruction—the second death (Revelation 20:14, 15).

### The Purifying Fire and the New Earth

> _"Fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."_ (Revelation 20:9)

> _"The day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch."_ (Malachi 4:1)

> _"The heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men... the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."_ (2 Peter 3:7, 10)

The same fire that destroys the wicked purifies the earth. From the ashes of the old creation, God fashions a new heaven and a new earth:

> _"Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."_ (2 Peter 3:13)

[ILL] When a refiner purifies gold, intense fire is not the enemy of the precious metal—it is its deliverer, burning away every impurity. So the fire of God's judgment destroys all that is vile, leaving only what is pure and eternal.

## Practical Application

### What the Millennium Means for Us Today

1. **Now is the only time to choose.** There is no second chance during or after the millennium. The wicked dead remain lost; the righteous dead remain saved. Our probation ends before the millennium begins.

2. **Christ's return is real and imminent.** We are to live in daily readiness, knowing that "in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh" (Matthew 24:44).

3. **We can trust God's justice.** The millennium's work of judgment assures us that no injustice will mar eternity. Every doubt will be resolved; every tear wiped away.

4. **Sin will not rise a second time.** The universe, having witnessed the full outworking of rebellion, will be eternally immune to its lies. "Affliction shall not rise up the second time" (Nahum 1:9).

5. **Victory is certain in Christ.** Those who trust in Jesus have nothing to fear from the second death. Eternal life is not a distant hope—it is a present possession for all who believe (John 5:24).

## Appeal

> _"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years."_ (Revelation 20:6)

Friend, the millennium is not a time for conversion—it is the aftermath of probation's close. The choice must be made now, while mercy lingers. Will you be among those who meet Christ in the air, who dwell in the mansions He has prepared, who review the records of judgment and then inherit the new earth forever?

Or will you be found outside the beloved city, swept away in the final fire?

The invitation stands open:

> _"The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."_ (Revelation 22:17)

Choose Christ today. His righteousness is your only hope. His return is your only deliverance. His eternity is your only home.
