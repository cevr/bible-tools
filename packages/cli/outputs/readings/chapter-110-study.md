# Bible Study: The Thief on the Cross

## Introduction

The thief on the cross stands as one of Scripture's most powerful testimonies to the grace of God and the accessibility of salvation—even at the very hour of death. Yet this passage has also been widely misunderstood, often used to teach doctrines that contradict the broader witness of Scripture. A careful, reverent examination reveals not confusion, but beautiful harmony—and a profound hope anchored in Christ's second coming.

## Core Truths

### The Thief's Request and Christ's Promise

In the darkest hour of Calvary, one of the criminals crucified beside Jesus made an extraordinary confession of faith:

> _"And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom."_ (Luke 23:42)

Notice carefully what the thief asked. He did not request to go to Paradise immediately. He asked to be **remembered when Christ came into His kingdom**—a future event. The thief understood, perhaps better than many today, that Christ's kingdom was yet to come.

Christ's response was immediate and gracious:

> _"Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise."_ (Luke 23:43)

[DYK🔎] The original Greek manuscripts contained no punctuation—no commas, periods, or quotation marks. Punctuation was added centuries later by translators and editors. The placement of the comma in Luke 23:43 is a matter of translation choice, not divine inspiration.

### Where Is Paradise?

Scripture itself defines Paradise:

> _"To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God."_ (Revelation 2:7)

> _"And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life."_ (Revelation 22:1, 2)

The tree of life grows on either side of the river that proceeds from **the throne of God**. Paradise, therefore, is not merely "heaven" in some vague sense—it is the very dwelling place of God the Father.

### The Problem: Christ Had Not Yet Ascended

If Jesus promised the thief they would be together in Paradise that very day, we must examine what happened next:

> _"Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day."_ (1 Corinthians 15:3, 4)

Christ was in the tomb Friday night, all day Sabbath, and rose early Sunday morning—**three days** after the crucifixion. And on that resurrection morning, what did He say to Mary?

> _"Jesus saith unto her, Touch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father."_ (John 20:17)

Here is the crucial point: **Three days after the promise to the thief, Jesus declared He had not yet been to His Father**—and Paradise, as we have seen, is where the Father's throne resides.

[Q] **"Didn't Jesus contradict Himself? He promised Paradise 'today' but hadn't gone there?"**

Not at all. Our Lord cannot lie (Titus 1:2; Hebrews 6:18). If He said He had not yet ascended to the Father on Sunday morning, then He certainly was not in Paradise on Friday. The apparent contradiction lies not in Christ's words, but in **where translators placed the comma**. Move the comma from before "today" to after it, and the passage reads:

_"Verily I say unto thee today, thou shalt be with Me in Paradise."_

Now the promise harmonizes perfectly with all Scripture. Jesus emphasized **the day of His promise**, not the day of its fulfillment.

## Deeper Truths

### The Significance of "Today"

Why would Christ use the word "today" in this emphatic way?

Consider the scene at Calvary. Jesus had proclaimed His coming kingdom (Luke 19:12–15). Now He hung dying, mocked by soldiers, ridiculed by rulers:

> _"And they platted a crown of thorns, and put it upon His head... and mocked Him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!"_ (Matthew 27:29)

> _"He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross."_ (Matthew 27:42)

Even His own disciples had fled in terror and doubt. In that hour of apparent defeat, when every visible sign said Jesus was a failed Messiah, the dying thief believed. He saw beyond the cross to the crown.

And Jesus, in His own agony, gave him assurance: **"Today—this very day when all seems lost, when I appear defeated, when My kingdom seems impossible—I give you My word: you shall be with Me in Paradise."**

[ILL] Imagine a king sentenced to death by rebels. As he is led to execution, one loyal subject cries out, "Remember me when you reclaim your throne!" The king, though bound and condemned, replies, "Today I promise you—you will share my kingdom." The promise is given _now_, though the kingdom comes _later_. So it was with Christ and the thief.

This emphatic use of "today" was common in Scripture:

> _"Return... I will render double unto thee... Turn you... even today do I declare..."_ (Zechariah 9:12)

The word emphasizes the **moment of promise**, not the moment of fulfillment.

### When Will the Righteous Be With Christ?

Scripture is abundantly clear on this question:

> _"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."_ (John 14:3)

Jesus promised to take His people to be with Him **at His second coming**—not at death.

> _"For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17)

The dead in Christ **rise first**—they are not already in heaven. Only at the resurrection and the second coming are believers taken to be with the Lord forever.

[DYK🔎] The word "resurrection" (Greek: _anastasis_) means literally "a standing up again." It presupposes that the dead are not conscious in some other realm, but await the call of Christ to rise from the grave.

### The State of the Dead

The thief, like all who die in faith, rests in the grave awaiting the resurrection:

> _"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing... their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished."_ (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6)

> _"His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish."_ (Psalm 146:4)

The thief is not consciously in Paradise now. He sleeps in Jesus, awaiting that glorious morning when Christ shall call him forth—and he shall find himself, in what seems to him but a moment, in the presence of his Lord.

[Q] **"But doesn't this make the promise seem less immediate or comforting?"**

Not at all! For those who sleep in death, there is no awareness of passing time. To the thief, the next conscious moment after closing his eyes in death will be the voice of Christ calling him to life—and Paradise will seem to have come that very day. The promise loses nothing; it gains the full weight of Scripture's testimony.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Salvation by Grace Through Faith

The thief on the cross demonstrates the pure gospel. He could not be baptized. He could not perform good works. He could not make restitution for his crimes. He had only his faith—and Christ accepted him fully.

> _"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast."_ (Ephesians 2:8, 9)

This does not mean works are unimportant. Had the thief lived, his faith would have produced fruit (James 2:17–18). But in his dying hour, he received what every sinner receives: righteousness by faith in Christ alone.

### Christ's Ministry for Us

Even while dying, Jesus was performing His priestly work—receiving sinners, giving assurance, and pointing to the kingdom. His sacrifice on the cross opened the way to Paradise; His resurrection confirmed His power to bring us there; His second coming will complete the promise.

The sanctuary truth reminds us: Christ died on the cross (outer court), rose and ascended to minister on our behalf (holy place), and will complete His work of judgment and restoration (most holy place) before bringing His people home.

## Practical Application

This study calls us to:

1. **Trust Christ's promises**, even when circumstances seem hopeless. The thief believed when all human evidence said Jesus was defeated.

2. **Interpret Scripture with Scripture**. One verse, isolated from its context, can be misunderstood. But when we let the Bible explain itself, harmony emerges.

3. **Rest in the blessed hope**. Our loved ones who sleep in Jesus are safe. They await the same glorious resurrection that awaits us—not as disembodied spirits, but as whole, immortal beings in the presence of God.

4. **Share the true gospel**. Salvation is by grace through faith, not by human effort. It is available to the greatest sinner at the last hour—but it is also the power of God unto a transformed life for those who have time to live it.

## Appeal

> _"For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17)

The penitent thief made his request in faith, and Christ honored it with an unbreakable promise. That same Savior extends the same promise to you today. Will you trust Him? Will you say, as the thief did, "Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy kingdom"?

If you will believe—today—you have Christ's own word: you shall be with Him in Paradise.
