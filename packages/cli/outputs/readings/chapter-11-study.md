# Bible Study: The Divinity of Christ

## Introduction

The divinity of Jesus Christ stands as the cornerstone of Christian faith. If Christ is merely a good man or a created being, His sacrifice cannot save us; but if He is truly God manifest in the flesh, then His atoning work possesses infinite value, and we have a Saviour mighty to save to the uttermost. Scripture reveals Christ as fully divine—the eternal Son of God who became man to redeem fallen humanity and now ministers as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.

## Core Truths

### Christ Is Addressed as God in Scripture

The Father Himself addresses the Son with the title reserved only for Deity:

> _"But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom."_ (Hebrews 1:8)

This remarkable declaration comes not from human lips but from the Father speaking to the Son. The throne is eternal—"for ever and ever"—indicating that Christ's divine kingship knows neither beginning nor end.

The prophet Isaiah, looking forward seven centuries to the birth of the Messiah, gave Him names that belong only to God:

> _"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."_ (Isaiah 9:6)

**The mighty God. The everlasting Father.** These are not titles bestowed upon any created being. They declare unmistakably that the Child born in Bethlehem would be none other than God Himself.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew phrase translated "mighty God" in Isaiah 9:6 is _El Gibbor_—the same term used of Jehovah in Isaiah 10:21. The Jews who heard this prophecy understood it as claiming divine identity for the Messiah.

### Christ Existed Before His Incarnation

On the night before His crucifixion, Jesus prayed:

> _"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was."_ (John 17:5)

Christ did not begin to exist at Bethlehem. He possessed glory with the Father before creation itself. John's Gospel opens with this foundational truth:

> _"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God."_ (John 1:1-2)

Notice the three-fold declaration: The Word **was** (eternally existing), the Word was **with God** (distinct personhood), and the Word **was God** (identical in nature and essence). This is not a created being who became divine; this is the eternal God who later became man.

## Deeper Truths

### The Mystery of the Incarnation

How did the eternal Son of God become man? The angel Gabriel revealed the sacred mystery to Mary:

> _"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."_ (Luke 1:35)

The incarnation was effected by the Holy Spirit. The divine nature was united with human nature in a way that transcends human comprehension. Paul calls it "the mystery of godliness":

> _"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."_ (1 Timothy 3:16)

[Q] **"Did Christ's incarnation diminish or annul His divinity?"**

Not at all. Paul declares that even in His human form, _"in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily"_ (Colossians 2:9). Christ did not cease to be God when He became man. Rather, Deity and humanity were mysteriously united in one Person. He veiled His glory but did not surrender His divine nature. The babe in the manger was still the Creator of the universe; the carpenter of Nazareth was still the One who upholds all things by the word of His power.

[ILL] Consider how water can exist as ice, yet remain fully water in its essential nature. The form changes, but the substance remains. So Christ, in taking human form, did not cease to be God. He who filled the universe with His presence was contained in a human body—yet remained infinite. The incarnation did not diminish Deity; it revealed it in a form humanity could approach without being consumed.

### Christ's Oneness with the Father

Jesus made a claim that enraged His Jewish opponents:

> _"I and My Father are one."_ (John 10:30)

What did He mean by this oneness? He explained it Himself in His High Priestly prayer:

> _"Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are."_ (John 17:11)

This oneness is not a merger of identity (the Father and Son are distinct Persons), but a perfect unity of purpose, will, character, and work. They share the same divine nature, the same attributes, the same goals. What the Father wills, the Son wills. What the Father loves, the Son loves. What the Father works, the Son works.

[DYK🔎] When Jesus said "I and My Father are one," the Jews picked up stones to kill Him. When He asked why, they answered: "For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God" (John 10:33). The Jews understood exactly what Jesus was claiming—and rejected it. We must either accept His claim or reject it; what we cannot do is dismiss it as merely claiming to be a good teacher.

### Five Proofs of Christ's Divinity

Scripture demonstrates Christ's divinity through multiple lines of evidence:

**1. His Creative Power**

> _"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him."_ (Colossians 1:16)

> _"All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."_ (John 1:3)

Creation is the exclusive work of God. "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Genesis 1:1). Yet Scripture assigns creation to Christ. Therefore, Christ is God.

**2. His Power Over Death**

> _"And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth."_ (John 11:43-44)

Only God has power over life and death. Jesus did not pray for Lazarus to be raised—He commanded it with divine authority. Death itself obeyed His voice.

**3. His Power to Lay Down and Take Up His Life**

> _"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again."_ (John 10:17)

No mere man can choose to die and then raise himself. This power belongs only to One who possesses life in Himself—the self-existent God.

**4. His Recognition as God**

The Father addresses Him as God (Hebrews 1:8). Isaiah prophesied Him as "The mighty God" (Isaiah 9:6). Thomas, seeing the risen Christ, exclaimed, "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28)—and Jesus accepted this worship without correction.

**5. His Atoning Sacrifice**

> _"He hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin... he shall bear their iniquities."_ (Isaiah 53:10-11)

The atonement itself required a divine Saviour. Only an infinite sacrifice could pay for infinite guilt. Only God could bear the weight of a world's sin and survive. The cross demonstrates not merely Christ's love, but His essential deity—for only God could accomplish such a work.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Why the Divinity of Christ Matters

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the divinity of Christ is a central battlefield. If Satan can convince humanity that Christ is merely a created being—an exalted angel, a good man, a prophet—then the entire plan of salvation collapses.

Consider: If Christ is not God, then:

- His sacrifice is finite and cannot atone for all humanity
- His blood has no more value than any other martyr's
- His promises are merely human and may fail
- His present intercession in heaven has no efficacy
- His soon return has no power to transform us

But if Christ is truly God manifest in the flesh, then:

- His sacrifice is infinite and covers all sin
- His blood has divine value and cleanses completely
- His promises are backed by omnipotent power
- His intercession in the heavenly sanctuary is effectual
- His coming will bring transformation and eternal life

### The Sanctuary Connection

Christ's divinity is essential to His present work as our High Priest. The earthly sanctuary had human priests who served as types; but the heavenly sanctuary has a divine-human Priest who serves as the Antitype.

> _"For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."_ (Hebrews 4:15)

Because Christ is God, His priesthood is eternal—"after the order of Melchisedec" (Hebrews 7:17). Because Christ is man, He sympathizes with our weaknesses. Because He is both, He can fully represent us before God and fully represent God to us.

[ILL] Imagine a bridge spanning a great chasm. One end must rest firmly on one side; the other end must rest firmly on the other side. If either end fails to touch solid ground, the bridge cannot bear traffic. Christ is the bridge between God and man. His divine nature rests in heaven; His human nature touches earth. Because He is fully both, He can bear the weight of humanity's need and carry us safely to the Father.

## Practical Application

### Coming Boldly to the Throne

Because Christ is divine, we may come to Him with absolute confidence:

> _"Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."_ (Hebrews 4:16)

This truth transforms our prayer life. We do not approach a distant, uncaring deity. We come to One who knows our frame, who has walked our path, who was tempted in all points as we are—yet who possesses infinite power to help.

**Mercy** covers our past—the sins committed, the failures endured.
**Grace to help** covers our present—the temptations faced, the battles fought.

### Trusting His Power to Save

If Christ is God, then nothing is too hard for Him. No sin is too great for His cleansing blood. No habit is too strong for His delivering power. No character is too marred for His transforming grace.

> _"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."_ (Hebrews 7:25)

**To the uttermost**—completely, perfectly, finally. This is the scope of His saving power because this is the magnitude of His divine nature.

## Appeal

Beloved, the divinity of Christ is not a cold theological fact for academic debate. It is the foundation of your hope, the ground of your salvation, the certainty of your victory.

> _"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth."_ (John 1:14)

The Eternal Word became flesh for you. The Creator became a creature to redeem you. The Mighty God became a helpless babe that you might become a child of God.

Will you not bow before Him today—not merely as teacher, not merely as example, but as your Lord and your God? Will you not trust His infinite power to save you from every sin? Will you not come boldly to His throne, knowing that He who died for you now lives to intercede for you?

He who is "The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" invites you now: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).
