### Q1. Upon what subject does Paul treat in 2 Cor. 5:1-8?

**"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
(2 Corinthians 5:1)**

**Answer:** The apostle Paul is here treating the subject of the Christian’s
hope regarding the future state, specifically contrasting our present, temporary
condition with the future, eternal reward. He uses the metaphor of a dwelling
place to describe the human body.

- **The Earthly House (The Tabernacle):** Paul calls our present body a
  "tabernacle" (or tent). In the Bible, a tent represents something temporary,
  movable, and fragile, much like the portable sanctuary in the wilderness. It
  is subject to wear, tear, and eventually "dissolution" (death).
- **The Building of God:** This refers to the glorified, immortal body that
  believers will receive. Unlike a tent, a "building" implies permanence and
  stability. This body is "not made with hands," meaning it is a direct creation
  of God, untainted by human heritage or the degradation of sin.

**Theological Insight:** This text establishes the reality of the **Great
Controversy** played out in the human vessel. Currently, we suffer the physical
results of sin (mortality), but God has a plan not merely to save a "ghost" or
"spirit," but to restore the whole person—body, soul, and spirit (1
Thessalonians 5:23). The plan of salvation includes the physical restoration of
man.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a family living in a flimsy tent while they
build a magnificent stone mansion nearby. The tent is cramped, lets in the rain,
and shakes in the wind. The family does not want to be homeless (naked), but
they long to move out of the tent and into the solid mansion. The Christian life
is like living in that tent; we do not love the frailty of the tent, but we
eagerly await the permanent home God has prepared.

### Q2. While we are here "in our earthly house," in "this tabernacle," that is in this present mortal state, what is our condition?

**"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house
which is from heaven... For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being
burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality
might be swallowed up of life." (2 Corinthians 5:2, 4)**

**Answer:** Our present condition is one of "groaning" and being "burdened."
This burden is twofold:

1.  **Physical Frailty:** We are subject to sickness, pain, aging, and death.
    The "earthly house" is decaying.
2.  **The Burden of Sin:** The pioneer Adventist understanding emphasizes that
    the believer groans not just because of physical pain, but because of the
    conflict with sin. As Romans 8:23 indicates, we groan waiting for the
    "redemption of our body."

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:** While we wait for the physical change,
God provides a spiritual remedy. Though the _body_ is weak, the _character_ is
being renewed.

- **Justification:** We are accepted by God now, despite our mortal state
  (Romans 5:1).
- **Sanctification:** The Spirit of God dwells in this frail "tent" to produce
  the fruits of righteousness. The fact that we "groan" under the burden of sin
  is actually a sign of spiritual life; the carnal mind does not struggle
  against sin, but the spiritual mind longs for full deliverance from it (Romans
  7:24).

**Definitions:**

- **Mortality:** The state of being subject to death; having a life that can
  end.
- **Sanctification:** The daily work of God's grace to purify the heart and
  empower the believer to overcome sin.

### Q3. Where else does the apostle express the same fact?

**"For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together
until now." (Romans 8:22)**

**Answer:** Paul broadens the scope in Romans 8. It is not just the individual
believer who suffers, but the entire creation. Since the fall of Adam, the earth
itself has been under the curse of sin (Genesis 3:17–18). The "groaning" is a
universal cry for restoration.

**Key Point:** This proves that the "groaning" in 2 Corinthians 5 is not a
desire to die and become a disembodied spirit, but a desire for the
**Resurrection** and the restoration of all things. The believer looks forward
to the day when "there shall be no more curse" (Revelation 22:3).

---

### Q4. How many conditions, or states of being, does the apostle bring to view?

**Answer:** The apostle Paul identifies three distinct conditions:

1.  **Clothed (Mortal):** The present state. We are alive but in a "tabernacle"
    subject to death and sin.
2.  **Unclothed (Naked):** The state of death. In Scripture, death is often
    likened to sleep or nakedness because the personality is preserved in God's
    memory, but the individual has no conscious agency or body.
3.  **Clothed Upon (Immortal):** The future state. This occurs when "mortality
    is swallowed up of life." This is the "house from heaven"—the glorified,
    resurrected body.

**Theological Distinction:** This tri-fold distinction refutes the idea that we
immediately enter glory at death. If death were the entrance to the "house from
heaven," Paul would not call it being "unclothed" or "naked." He views the
middle state (death) as a disruption caused by sin, not the goal of the
Christian life.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Consider a seed (the present life). When you plant it,
the seed decomposes (death/nakedness). But the farmer does not plant the seed
for the sake of decomposition; he plants it for the sake of the new plant that
springs up (resurrection/clothed upon). The "naked" state in the ground is
necessary but temporary; the goal is the harvest.

---

### Q5. Which one of these conditions did the apostle wait for and desire?

**"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house
which is from heaven." (2 Corinthians 5:2)**

**Answer:** Paul clearly desired the **third condition**: to be "clothed upon."
His hope was not fixed on the grave (the second condition), nor on remaining in
this world of suffering (the first condition). His eyes were fixed on the "house
which is from heaven."

**Sanctuary Connection:** Just as the High Priest in the earthly sanctuary came
out to bless the people after the work of atonement was finished, Christ (our
High Priest) will come out of the heavenly temple to bless His people with
immortality. Paul was looking for this event—the Blessed Hope (Titus 2:13).

---

### Q6. What disclaimer does he utter concerning the second or middle state?

**"Not for that we would be unclothed." (2 Corinthians 5:4)**

**Answer:** This is a critical text for understanding the state of the dead.
Paul explicitly states that he does _not_ desire to be "unclothed." Being a
disembodied spirit (if such were possible) or sleeping in the dust was not his
hope.

If the popular view were true—that death instantly liberates the soul to a
higher, more glorious existence—Paul would have desired to be "unclothed."
Instead, he shrinks from death. He views death as "the last enemy" (1
Corinthians 15:26). His desire is for _life_, specifically the life that comes
through the resurrection.

---

### Q7. How is it proved that Paul looked forward to the resurrection, when he expressed a desire to be clothed upon with the house from heaven?

**"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the
Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to
wit, the redemption of our body." (Romans 8:23)**

**Answer:** The parallel is unmistakable. In 2 Corinthians 5, Paul desires to be
"clothed upon." In Romans 8, he defines this waiting as waiting for "the
redemption of our body."

**The "Firstfruits" and Righteousness by Faith:** Paul mentions having the
"firstfruits of the Spirit."

- **The Earnest:** The Holy Spirit given to us now is the down payment (earnest)
  of our future inheritance (2 Corinthians 5:5).
- **Present Victory:** While we wait for the _redemption of the body_ (future),
  we experience the _redemption of the soul_ from the power of sin right now.
  The Spirit that will one day raise our bodies (Romans 8:11) is the same Spirit
  that enables us to keep God's commandments and overcome sin today. We have the
  character of heaven before we receive the body of heaven.

**Definition:**

- **Adoption:** In the Roman context, this referred to the formal, public
  declaration of sonship and inheritance. While we are God's children now by
  faith, the "redemption of the body" is the public revelation of the sons of
  God to the universe.

---

### Q8. When is the body to be redeemed?

**"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice
of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise
first." (1 Thessalonians 4:16)** (See also Phil. 3:20, 21)

**Answer:** The body is redeemed at the **Second Coming of Christ**. It does not
happen at the moment of death. The Bible consistently places the reward of the
righteous at the return of Jesus, not at the individual's funeral.

**Scriptural Support:**

- **Philippians 3:20-21:** Christ will "change our vile body, that it may be
  fashioned like unto his glorious body."
- **John 14:3:** "I will come again, and receive you unto myself."

This aligns with the sanctuary cycle: The High Priest (Jesus) must finish His
work of judgment/cleansing in the Most Holy Place before He returns to earth to
gather His people.

### Q9. When is mortality to be swallowed up of life?

**"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put
on immortality." (1 Corinthians 15:51-53)**

**Answer:** Mortality is swallowed up of life "at the last trump," which signals
the resurrection.

**Important Doctrine:** This passage teaches that humans do not possess
**immortality** inherently.

- **The Soul:** The Bible teaches the soul that sinneth, it shall die (Ezekiel
  18:4).
- **God Alone:** Only God has inherent immortality (1 Timothy 6:16).
- **The Gift:** We "put on" immortality as a gift from Christ at the
  resurrection. Until then, we are "mortal."

**[ILL] Illustration:** A diver puts on an oxygen tank and a wetsuit to survive
underwater. He is not naturally amphibious; he needs the equipment to survive in
that element. Similarly, humans are not naturally immortal. To live in eternity,
we must "put on" the nature of Christ—His righteousness now (character) and His
immortality then (body).

### Q10. If the house from heaven is the future redeemed immortal body, how can it be said that, "we have" it?

**"And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life
is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of
God hath not life." (1 John 5:11-12)**

**Answer:** We "have" it by faith and by promise, secured in Jesus Christ.

1.  **Title Deed:** When you buy a house, you receive the deed before you
    physically move in. The deed guarantees the house is yours. Faith is "the
    substance of things hoped for" (Hebrews 11:1). Because we are in Christ, and
    He is risen and glorified, our future is as secure as if we were already
    there.
2.  **Hid in Christ:** Colossians 3:3 says, "For ye are dead, and your life is
    hid with Christ in God." Our eternal life is currently safe-guarded in the
    person of Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary. When He appears, our life will
    appear with Him.

**Righteousness by Faith Application:** Just as we accept Christ's righteousness
as our own (Justification) even though we are still growing in grace, we accept
His promise of the resurrection body as a present reality. We stand on the sure
word of God.

---

### Q11. When, only, is a person fitted to be present with the Lord?

**Answer:** A person is only fitted to be physically present with the Lord when
they are **redeemed from all that is mortal and corruptible** (1 Cor. 15:50; 1
Thess. 4:17).

**Theological Depth:** "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God" (1
Corinthians 15:50). Our current bodies, degraded by sin, cannot stand in the
consuming fire of God's presence.

- **Preparation of Character:** We must be fitted _spiritually_ now
  (sanctification), having the law of God written on our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).
- **Preparation of Body:** We must be fitted _physically_ at the resurrection
  (glorification).

God will not bring us into His immediate presence until sin is completely
blotted out from our record (in the judgment) and from our nature (at the
coming).

---

### Q12. To what condition, then, does the apostle refer by the words (2 Cor. 5:6), "At home in the body?

**Answer:** He refers to the **first condition** spoken of in verse 1: our
present, mortal life on earth.

To be "at home in the body" means to be living in this current world, walking by
faith and not by sight (v. 7). It implies a state where we are physically
separated from the visible presence of Jesus, who is currently ministering in
the Heavenly Sanctuary.

---

### Q13. To what condition does he refer by the expression, "To be present with the Lord?

**Answer:** He refers to the **third condition**: the resurrection state, when
we are clothed with the house from heaven.

**Explanation of "Absent from the body, present with the Lord":** Paul is
contrasting the two _positive_ states of existence:

1.  Serving God here by faith (in the body).
2.  Serving God there by sight (present with the Lord).

He omits the middle state (death) in this specific phrase because, to the
believer, there is no conscious interval.

- **The Believer's Perspective:** A Christian closes their eyes in death. The
  very next split-second of their consciousness is the sound of the trumpet and
  the face of Jesus. The thousands of years that may pass in the grave are as
  nothing to the sleeper.
- **The Logic:** Paul is willing to be "absent from the body" (leave this mortal
  state) _so that_ he may be "present with the Lord." He knows that leaving this
  life is the necessary precursor to receiving the eternal reward, even if a
  sleep intervenes. His confidence is that death cannot separate him from God's
  love (Romans 8:38-39) and that the next conscious moment is glory.

**Summary:** The text is not a geography of the soul, but a statement of
preference: Paul prefers the eternal presence of Christ over the trials of this
mortal life.
