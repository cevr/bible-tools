# Reading 112: Absent from the Body—Understanding Paul's Hope

## Introduction

Few passages of Scripture have been more misunderstood than 2 Corinthians 5:1-8, where Paul speaks of being "absent from the body" and "present with the Lord." Many assume this teaches that believers enter heaven immediately at death as disembodied spirits. But careful study reveals that Paul is teaching something far more glorious—the resurrection hope that anchors the Christian faith. Let us allow Scripture to interpret Scripture and discover the apostle's true meaning.

## Core Truths

### The Three States Paul Describes

In 2 Corinthians 5:1-4, Paul outlines three distinct conditions of human existence:

**First State—Clothed with the Earthly House:**

> _"For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."_ (2 Corinthians 5:1)

This "earthly house" or "tabernacle" refers to our present mortal body—frail, subject to decay, and burdened by sin's effects.

**Second State—Unclothed or Naked:**

> _"If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked."_ (2 Corinthians 5:3)

This intermediate state represents death—when the body lies in the grave, and the person has no conscious existence.

**Third State—Clothed Upon with the Heavenly House:**

> _"For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."_ (2 Corinthians 5:4)

This is the resurrection body—immortal, incorruptible, eternal.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "tabernacle" (_skēnos_) literally means a tent—a temporary, portable dwelling. Paul deliberately chose this word to emphasize the temporary nature of our present mortal existence, in contrast to the permanent "building of God" we shall receive.

### What Paul Actually Desired

Notice carefully what Paul longed for—and what he did _not_ desire:

> _"For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven."_ (2 Corinthians 5:2)

Paul's earnest desire was **to be clothed upon**—not to be a naked, disembodied spirit, but to receive the glorified resurrection body.

> _"Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."_ (2 Corinthians 5:4)

Paul explicitly **disclaims** any desire for the "unclothed" state of death. He does not wish to exist as a disembodied soul. His hope is resurrection—when mortality is "swallowed up of life."

[Q] **"But doesn't Paul say he desires 'to be absent from the body and present with the Lord'? Doesn't this mean immediate presence with Christ at death?"**

Let us read the full context. Paul expresses a _preference_—given the two positive states (this mortal life versus the resurrection life), he would rather be with the Lord in the glorified state than remain in this groaning, burdened existence. But nothing in the passage suggests these two states are immediately connected. The intermediate state of death (being "unclothed") may intervene—and indeed, Paul expressly does _not_ desire this state. His hope leaps over death to the resurrection morning.

## Deeper Truths

### The Parallel in Romans 8

Paul expressed the same longing in his letter to the Romans:

> _"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."_ (Romans 8:23)

Notice the clear parallel:

| 2 Corinthians 5                  | Romans 8                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| "We groan, earnestly desiring"   | "We groan within ourselves, waiting" |
| "To be clothed upon"             | "The redemption of our body"         |
| "Mortality swallowed up of life" | "The adoption"                       |

Both passages point to the same event—the resurrection and glorification of the body at Christ's return.

### When Does This Transformation Occur?

Scripture is explicit:

> _"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

> _"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."_ (1 Corinthians 15:51-52)

The "house from heaven," the glorified immortal body, is received **at the resurrection**, not at death.

[ILL] Consider a traveler journeying to a distant homeland. He lives temporarily in a tent (his mortal body), which grows worn and tattered. He longs not to be homeless and exposed (death), but to arrive at his father's house and receive a permanent dwelling (the resurrection body). The journey may include a period of sleep (death in the grave), but his hope and desire fix upon the destination—the eternal home. So Paul's hope leaped over death to the glorious morning of resurrection.

### The Problem with the Immortal Soul Theory

If Paul believed in a conscious, disembodied immortal soul that immediately enters heaven at death, his language becomes contradictory:

1. **Why would Paul call death being "unclothed" or "naked"?** If the soul is conscious and in heaven, it is hardly naked—it has simply changed dwelling places.

2. **Why would Paul disclaim any desire for this state?** If death meant instant heavenly bliss, why would he say, "not for that we would be unclothed"?

3. **Why would Paul groan for the redemption of the body?** If the soul is already in glory, what urgent need exists for bodily resurrection?

4. **How could the "house from heaven" be said to be "eternal in the heavens" if believers already possess immortal souls?** This house is _future_—we do not yet have it except by faith and promise.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "we have a building of God" (2 Corinthians 5:1) uses the Greek present tense, but this is a "present of certainty"—expressing absolute assurance of a future promise. Compare 1 John 5:11: "God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son." We "have" eternal life by faith now, though its full manifestation awaits the resurrection.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Resurrection—God's Answer to Death

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, death is the enemy's final weapon—the "king of terrors" (Job 18:14). Satan would have us believe either that death ends all, or that we possess inherent immortality and need no Saviour from the grave.

But God's answer is the resurrection. The grave is not the end; neither is it the immediate entrance to glory. It is a "sleep" from which Christ alone can awaken us.

> _"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death."_ (1 Corinthians 15:26)

The resurrection morning vindicates God's plan of salvation and defeats Satan's lie that "ye shall not surely die" (Genesis 3:4).

### Sanctuary Connections

In the earthly sanctuary, the high priest bore the names of all Israel upon his heart when he entered the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement (Exodus 28:29). The people waited outside, their fate bound up with his ministry within.

So Christ, our High Priest, has entered the heavenly sanctuary. His people "groan" in this present state, awaiting His return. When He emerges from the Most Holy Place, He will come "the second time without sin unto salvation" (Hebrews 9:28)—and then, and only then, will His waiting people be "clothed upon" with immortality.

Paul's hope—and ours—is not a disembodied, ghostly existence, but a bodily resurrection at Christ's glorious appearing.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Resurrection Hope

Paul's confidence in the resurrection rested not on any inherent immortality, but on his union with Christ:

> _"He that hath the Son hath life."_ (1 John 5:12)

This life is _in Christ_, received by faith. We are "accepted in the beloved" (Ephesians 1:6), and our eternal destiny is secured by His merits, not our own. The resurrection body is the final gift of grace—Christ's righteousness made visible in glorified, immortal flesh.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for the Grieving

This truth brings comfort without deception. Our loved ones who sleep in Jesus are not suffering, not in purgatory, not hovering as spirits. They rest peacefully, awaiting the voice of the Life-giver. We sorrow, but "not as others which have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13), for we shall see them again—not as ghosts, but as glorified, immortal beings.

### What This Means for Daily Living

If our hope is in the resurrection, then:

1. **We need not fear death**—it is but a sleep from which Christ will awaken us.
2. **We must not be deceived by spiritualism**—no "spirits of the dead" can communicate with us; such phenomena are satanic deceptions.
3. **We live by faith, not sight**—we "have" the promise now, though its fulfillment awaits the last trumpet.
4. **We long for Christ's return**—this is the "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13) that animates all Christian living.

### What This Means for Our Witness

When we share the truth about death and resurrection, we give people something far better than the pagan notion of disembodied immortality. We offer:

- **Rest for the weary**—death is sleep, not endless consciousness.
- **Hope for the mourning**—reunion is certain at the resurrection.
- **Protection from deception**—spiritualism loses its power when we understand the state of the dead.
- **Christ as the center**—our immortality depends entirely on Him.

## Appeal

> _"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16-18)

Dear friend, is your hope anchored in Christ and His resurrection? Do you long, as Paul longed, not for a ghostly existence, but for the glorious transformation when "this mortal shall put on immortality"?

Place your faith in the risen Saviour. He has conquered death; He holds the keys of the grave; and He is coming again to awaken all who sleep in Him. Let this blessed hope steady your heart through every trial, and comfort you in every sorrow, until that morning breaks and the shadows flee away.
