### Q1. In what condition was man created?

"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that Thou
visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels." Heb. 2:6, 7.

**Answer:** The psalmist and the apostle Paul both marvel at the creation of
man. While man was created with dignity and crowned with "glory and honor"
(verse 7), he was created in a condition **"a little lower"** than the angels.
This distinction is vital for understanding human nature:

1.  **Dependent, Not Divine:** Unlike God, man is not self-existent. Unlike the
    angels, man is of the earth, earthy.
2.  **Innocent but Mutable:** Adam came from the hand of the Creator perfect in
    form and innocent in character, yet he was subject to change. He was not
    created with a nature that could not sin, nor with a life that could not
    end.
3.  **The Need for Visitation:** The text asks why God "visitest" him. This
    implies that man needs constant communion with God to sustain his spiritual
    and physical life.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:** This text establishes our utter
dependence on God from the very beginning. If unfallen Adam was "lower than the
angels" and needed God's visitation to sustain him, how much more does fallen
man need the indwelling Christ! We possess no inherent power to sustain our own
righteousness or life.

[ILL] **The Vine and the Branch.** Jesus illustrated this dependence in John 15.
A branch is created to bear fruit, but it is "lower" than the vine stock because
it has no root of its own. It must remain connected to the vine to live. If Adam
needed this connection before sin, we surely need it now to produce any fruit of
righteousness.

### Q2. What is the nature of angels?

“But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the
resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage; neither
can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children
of God, being the children of the resurrection." Luke 20:35, 36.

**Answer:** Jesus explains the nature of angels to highlight what human beings
are _not_ in their present state.

- **Angels cannot die:** They possess a nature not subject to death by natural
  decay (though they are created beings).
- **Angels are spirits:** They do not marry or procreate.

**Key Doctrine:** This verse proves that human beings are **not yet** equal to
angels. We currently marry, and we certainly die. We only become "equal unto the
angels" in the specific sense of being unable to "die any more" **after** the
resurrection. This confirms that man does not possess natural immortality now;
it is a gift reserved for those "accounted worthy" at the resurrection.

**Sanctuary Insight:** The judgment (symbolized by the Day of Atonement)
determines who is "accounted worthy" to obtain that world. This worthiness is
not based on our own merits, but on the merits of Christ credited to us
(Justification) and the work of the Spirit in us (Sanctification).

### Q3. What are angels called?

“And of the angels he saith, Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a
flame of fire." Heb. 1:7.

**Answer:** Angels are defined here as **spirits** and **ministers**.

- **Nature:** They are non-corporeal spirit beings, described as a "flame of
  fire," indicating their purity, power, and swiftness in executing God’s will.
- **Function:** They are God’s "ministers" (servants). Hebrews 1:14 further
  clarifies that they are sent forth to minister _for_ them who shall be heirs
  of salvation.

This stands in contrast to man, who was formed of the "dust of the ground"
(Genesis 2:7). While angels are "spirits," man has a spirit (breath of life) but
_is_ a soul (a physical person).

[ILL] **The Messenger and the Message.** A King has swift messengers (angels)
who carry his decrees to the farthest provinces. The citizens of those provinces
(humans) live on the land and till the soil. The messenger is distinct from the
citizen. We must not confuse the nature of the messenger (spirit) with the
nature of the citizen (flesh and blood).

---

### Q4. What is the difference between the two Adams?

“And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam
was made a quickening spirit." 1 Cor. 15:45.

**Answer:** This verse presents the two heads of the human race, contrasting
their nature and their function:

1.  **The First Adam (Living Soul):** He was natural, earthly, and the father of
    the human race. Through his disobedience, he brought sin and death to all
    his descendants. He had life, but he could not _give_ life to others once he
    lost his connection with God.
2.  **The Last Adam (Christ):** He is a **"quickening spirit."** The word
    _quicken_ in old English means "to make alive" or "to give life" (John
    5:21).

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:** This is the heart of the Gospel. We are
born into the family of the first Adam—heirs of brokenness, sinful tendencies,
and death. We have no power to generate righteousness. To be saved, we must be
"born again" into the family of the Second Adam.

- **Adam 1** passes on a condemnation and a carnal nature.
- **Adam 2** (Christ) imparts His righteousness and life-giving power. He does
  not just _have_ life; He _is_ the source of life that revives the dead sinner
  (Ephesians 2:1, 5).

---

### Q5. Adam was made a living soul; but was he not a spiritual man?

“Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and
afterward that which is spiritual." 1 Cor. 15:46.

**Answer:** Paul establishes a sequence: **Natural first, then Spiritual.**

- **Natural:** Adam was created with a natural body, dependent on food and
  breath. His life was contingent.
- **Spiritual:** This refers to the higher order of life that is imperishable,
  which Christ brings.

While Adam was innocent and had spiritual communion with God, his constitution
was "natural" (of the earth). He was on probation. Had he passed the test, he
would have eaten of the Tree of Life and seemingly been confirmed in a higher
state. Because he fell, we all start as "natural" men. We must be transformed by
the Spirit of God to become spiritual men (Romans 8:9).

**Definition:**

- **Natural Man:** The unregenerate human, governed by earthly senses and self
  (1 Corinthians 2:14).
- **Spiritual Man:** The believer renewed by the Holy Ghost, governed by the
  mind of Christ.

---

### Q6. When does man become a spiritual being?

“It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body, There is a natural
body, and there is a spiritual body." 1 Cor. 15:44.

**Answer:** In the context of 1 Corinthians 15, man becomes a "spiritual being"
in the fullest sense **at the resurrection**.

- **Sown Natural:** When we die, we are buried as a "natural body"—frail,
  mortal, and subject to decay.
- **Raised Spiritual:** At the second coming, the righteous are raised with a
  body fitted for eternal life—immortal and incorruptible.

**Clarification:** While we must be spiritually _minded_ now (Romans 8:6) to
belong to Christ, our physical nature remains "natural" and mortal until Jesus
returns. We do not possess a ghostly, immaterial nature that floats away at
death; rather, we await the redemption of our _bodies_ (Romans 8:23).

---

### Q7. To what does the sowing refer?

“That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die." 1 Cor. 15:36.

**Answer:** The "sowing" refers to **death and burial**. Just as a seed must
fall into the ground and die to produce a new stalk, our mortal bodies must be
laid down in death (or changed at translation) before we can receive the
immortal, glorified body.

**Practical Lesson:** This removes the fear of death for the Christian. The
grave is not a place of hopelessness, but a furrow where the seed is planted,
awaiting the spring morning of the Resurrection.

[ILL] **The Grain of Wheat.** A dry grain of wheat looks lifeless. If you keep
it on a shelf, it remains a dry seed. But if you bury it, it seems to be lost.
Yet, from that "death" comes a vibrant green stalk. So it is with the believer.
We die in weakness; we are raised in power.

---

### Q8. How is man's nature defined?

“Shall mortal man be more just than God?" Job 4:17.

**Answer:** The Bible explicitly defines man as **mortal**.

- **Definition:** _Mortal_ (from the Latin _mortalis_) means "subject to death,"
  "destined to die," or "perishable."
- **Implication:** If man is mortal, he is not immortal. The two terms are
  opposites. Nowhere in Scripture is the phrase "immortal soul" found. The Bible
  consistently teaches that man is a candidate for immortality, not a possessor
  of it by birth.

**Righteousness by Faith Connection:** Acknowledging our mortality creates
humility. We are frail and passing; God is eternal. This realization drives us
to trust in His strength rather than our own permanence. "Lord, make me to know
mine end... that I may know how frail I am" (Psalm 39:4).

---

### Q9. What is God's nature?

“Now unto the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor
and glory forever and ever. Amen." 1 Tim. 1:17.

**Answer:** God’s nature is **immortal**.

- **Definition:** _Immortal_ means "not subject to death," "deathless," and
  "having life in oneself."
- **The Distinction:** Immortality is an attribute of Deity, just like
  omnipotence or omnipresence. Man creates idols when he attributes to himself
  powers that belong only to God. God alone is the "Fountain of Life" (Psalm
  36:9).

---

### Q10. Of what was man formed in the beginning?

“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground." Gen. 2:7.

**Answer:** Man was formed from the **dust of the ground** (elements of the
earth).

1.  **Material Origin:** We are chemical and biological beings composed of the
    same elements found in the soil (carbon, oxygen, calcium, etc.).
2.  **Humility:** "For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (Genesis
    3:19). There is no "divine spark" or uncreated entity inside man that is
    essentially god-like. We are shaped clay.

**The Potter and the Clay:** God is the Potter; we are the clay (Isaiah 64:8).
The clay has no value until the Potter shapes it. Our value comes entirely from
the Creator's touch and design.

---

### Q11. What act made him a living soul?

“And [God] breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
living soul." Gen. 2:7.

**Answer:** Creation was a two-step process:

1.  **Form:** God formed the body from dust (lifeless corpse).
2.  **Breath:** God breathed into it the "breath of life" (vitalizing
    principle).
3.  **Result:** Man _became_ a living soul.

**Crucial Definition:** The text does _not_ say man was "given" a soul, as if
the soul were a separate entity placed inside a cage. It says man **BECAME** a
living soul.

- **Equation:** Dust + Breath = Living Soul.
- **Reversal:** Dust - Breath = Dead Soul (or simply, a corpse).

**Term:** _Soul_ (Hebrew: _Nephesh_) here simply means a living person, a
breathing creature, or an individual.

[ILL] **The Wooden Box.** If you take boards and nails and hammer them together,
you _make_ a box. The box is the result of the union of boards and nails. If you
pull the nails out and separate the boards, where does the "box" go? It doesn't
fly away to a box-heaven. It simply ceases to be a box. So it is with the soul:
it is the union of body and breath.

---

### Q12. Are others besides man called "living souls" in the Bible?

“And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea, and it became as the
blood of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea." Rev. 16:3. (See
Gen. 1:30, margin.)

**Answer:** Yes. The Bible uses the same term (_nephesh chayyah_ or "living
soul") for animals.

- **Genesis 1:20, 30:** The marginal reading often renders "life" as "living
  soul" regarding fish and beasts.
- **Revelation 16:3:** Marine life are called "living souls."

**The Point:** Possessing a "soul" in the biblical sense does not prove
immortality, for animals are souls, and they die. The difference between man and
beast is not that man has an immortal soul and the beast does not; the
difference is that man is made in the **image of God** (mental and moral
capacity) and has been offered the gift of eternal life through Christ.

---

### Q13. Do other creatures besides man have the "breath of life?

“And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of foul, and of cattle, and
of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every
man; all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry
land, died." Gen. 7:21, 22.

**Answer:** Yes. The "breath of life" (Hebrew: _Ruach_ or _Neshamah_) is the
animating life force found in all air-breathing creatures.

- It is the biological spark that powers the lungs and heart.
- God is the author of all life, animal and human.

---

### Q14. Is theirs the same breath as man’s?

“As the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a
man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity." Ecc. 3:19.

**Answer:** Solomon, the wisest man, declares that they have **"all one
breath."**

- Physiologically, the life force in a man is the same type of life force as in
  a lion or a sheep.
- "No pre-eminence" refers to the mechanics of life and death: both breathe air,
  both die when breath ceases, and both return to dust.

**Significance:** Man’s superiority is not in having a different kind of
"spirit" that survives death, but in his created purpose (to reflect God) and
his destiny (to be redeemed by Christ).

---

### Q15. The breath of life from God was breathed into man's nostrils in the beginning. What does Job call that which is in the nostrils?

“All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils." Job
27:3.

**Answer:** Job uses the terms **"breath"** and **"spirit"** interchangeably.

- "Spirit of God" in the nostrils refers to the breath of life given by God.
- **Definition:** The word _Spirit_ (Hebrew: _Ruach_) in this context means
  "breath," "wind," or the invisible energy of life. It does not refer to a
  disembodied conscious ghost.

---

### Q16. When man gives up the spirit, what becomes of it?

“Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return
unto God who gave it." Eccl. 12:7.

**Answer:** At death, creation is reversed:

1.  **Dust:** Returns to the earth (decomposition).
2.  **Spirit:** Returns to God.

**Explanation:** The "spirit" that returns to God is the "breath of life" or
life power (Job 27:3).

- It returns to God because it belongs to Him; it was loaned to man.
- This applies to all men (and animals), righteous and wicked. It is not the
  conscious personality traveling to heaven, but the power of life returning to
  the Source.

**Sanctuary/Judgment Context:** While the life-power returns to God, the
character/record of the man remains "hid" in the books of heaven, awaiting the
Judgment. The person "sleeps" in the dust until the resurrection.

[ILL] **The Electric Light.** When you turn off a switch, the light goes out.
The electricity returns to the power lines/grid (the source). The light bulb
(the body) remains cold and dark. The "light" (consciousness/soul) doesn't go
anywhere—it simply ceases to exist until the switch is flipped again
(Resurrection).

---

### Q17. Can one have the spirit of life with him eternally, unless he has Christ?

“He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not
life." 1 John 5:12.

**Answer:** No. This is the definitive test of the Christian faith.

- **The Source:** Life is not intrinsic to man; it is in the Son.
- **The Condition:** We must "have" the Son to "have" the life.
- **The Verdict:** He who does not have the Son, _does not have life._

**The Gospel of Righteousness by Faith:** If man were naturally immortal, he
would not need Christ for eternal life—he would only need Christ for happiness.
But the Bible teaches that the sinner has forfeited his right to exist. Christ's
death buys back our existence. Justification is the legal title to this life;
Sanctification is the fitness for it. Both are found only _in Him_.

---

### Q18. Why were the first guilty pair driven from the tree of life?

“And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and
eat, and live forever." Gen. 3:22.

**Answer:** They were driven out to prevent them from becoming **immortal
sinners**.

- God’s mercy is seen even in judgment. To allow man to eat of the Tree of Life
  while in a state of rebellion would have immortalized sin. It would have
  created an eternal hell on earth—sinners living forever in misery and
  wickedness.
- God blocked the way so that death could eventually put an end to sin's misery.

---

### Q19. What was done to keep man away from the tree of life?

“So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden
cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the
tree of life." Gen. 3:24.

**Answer:** God placed a guard of **cherubim** (angels) and a **flaming sword**
(representing divine justice/glory) to bar access.

- This signifies that man, in his natural, sinful state, has no access to
  immortality.
- Access can only be restored through the breaking of that body and the shedding
  of that blood which the sword of justice eventually fell upon—Jesus Christ.

---

### Q20. How are all men in the natural state regarded?

“We all... were by nature the children of wrath, even as others." Eph. 2:3.

**Answer:** By nature, born of Adam, we are "children of wrath."

- This means we are legally subject to the penalty of the broken law.
- Our natural tendencies are self-centered and opposed to God's law (Romans
  8:7).
- We do not possess a spark of divinity that saves us; we are in a desperate
  state requiring rescue.

---

### Q21. If the wrath of God abides on a person, of what does it deprive him?

“He that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
on him." John 3:36.

**Answer:** The wrath of God deprives the sinner of **life**.

- The text says he "shall not see life."
- This confirms the doctrine of Conditional Immortality: The punishment for
  ultimate rejection of God is not eternal life in torment, but the _loss_ of
  life (eternal death).

**Sanctuary Truth:** Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God. Just as the
glory of God in the Most Holy Place would consume a sinner, the "wrath" of God
is simply His consuming purity reacting against sin. If we cling to sin, we are
consumed with it.

---

### Q22. Through whom is the sinner saved from wrath?

“Much more then, being now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath
through Him." Rom. 5:9.

**Answer:** We are saved **through Jesus Christ** and His blood.

- **Justification:** We are declared righteous because Christ took the "wrath"
  (the death penalty) that belonged to us.
- **Substitution:** He died the death we deserve, that we might live the life He
  deserves.

**RBF Emphasis:** We are not saved by making ourselves good, but by being
"justified by His blood." This is the only shelter from the wrath against sin.

---

### Q23. When the sinner has been converted, what then is his prospect for life?

“For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is
our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory." Col.
3:3, 4.

**Answer:** The believer's life is currently **"hid with Christ."**

- **Now:** We are legally "dead" to the old self, and our title to eternal life
  is secured in the Sanctuary above where Christ ministers. We do not yet
  possess immortality in our bodies.
- **Then:** When Christ appears (Second Coming), that hidden life will be
  revealed, and we will appear in glory.

[ILL] **The Deposit.** A father puts a large sum of money in the bank for his
child. The child does not carry the cash in his pocket—it is "hid" in the bank,
safe. The child is rich, yet he waits for the day of maturity to possess it
fully. Our immortality is deposited in Christ, safe from the devil, waiting for
the Day of the Lord.

---

### Q24. The word immortal occurs but once in the English Bible (1 Tim. 1:17) , and is there applied to God; is any other said to have immortality?

“Who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords: who
only hath immortality." 1 Tim. 6:15, 16.

**Answer:** The Scripture is emphatic: God **"ONLY hath immortality."**

- This is the most direct refutation of the doctrine of the "natural immortality
  of the soul."
- If God _only_ has it, man _does not_ have it.
- Man can only obtain it by union with God.

---

### Q25. How is this desirable boon brought to light?

“But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath
abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the
gospel." 2 Tim 1:10.

**Answer:** Immortality is brought to light **through the gospel.**

- It is not a philosophical truth or a natural fact. It is a revelation of the
  Good News.
- Jesus "abolished death" (broke its permanent hold) and revealed that eternal
  life is a gift of grace, not a natural possession.

---

### Q26. How does man obtain immortality?

“To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and
immortality, eternal life." Rom. 2:7.

**Answer:** Man obtains it by **seeking** for it.

- **Logic:** We do not seek for what we already have. If we were born immortal,
  we would not need to seek it.
- **Method:** We seek it by "patient continuance in well doing." This is
  **Righteousness by Faith** in action—faith that works by love (Galatians 5:6).
  It is not earning life by works, but the perseverance of a faith that clings
  to Christ, the Life-Giver.

---

### Q27. When will the faithful receive immortality?

“Behold, I show you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
changed." 1 Cor. 15:51, 52.

**Answer:** We receive immortality **at the last trump** (The Second Coming).

- **The Dead:** Raised incorruptible (unable to decay).
- **The Living:** Changed from mortal to immortal in a moment.
- Until this moment, the dead are asleep in the grave, and the living are
  mortal.

---

### Q28. What is then to be swallowed up?

“So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall
have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory." 1 Cor. 15:54.

**Answer:** **Death** is swallowed up in victory.

- This marks the final defeat of the enemy.
- "Corruptible puts on incorruption"—this is the change of clothing. We trade
  the rags of mortality for the robes of immortality.

---

### Q29. How is this victory gained?

“But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ." 1 Cor. 15:51.

**Answer:** The victory is a **gift from God through Jesus Christ.** (Note: The
text quoted is 1 Cor 15:57).

- We do not achieve immortality; we receive it.
- We do not conquer death; Christ conquered it for us.

**Conclusion:** The doctrine of man's nature magnifies Christ. It strips man of
his pride (natural immortality) and places all hope in the Redeemer. It
clarifies the Sanctuary message: Christ is pleading His blood to give life to
those who have forfeited it. To have Him is to have everything; to lose Him is
to lose existence itself. "Choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live"
(Deut. 30:19).
