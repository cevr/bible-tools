# Reading 103: What is Man?

## Introduction

The question "What is man?" is among the most profound inquiries of Scripture. Understanding our true nature—how God made us, what we are now, and what He intends us to become—lies at the heart of the gospel. This study examines the biblical teaching on human nature, revealing that immortality is not something we inherently possess, but a gift God offers through Jesus Christ.

## Core Truths

### Man's Original Creation

Scripture reveals that man was created in a unique position—neither as high as angels nor as low as mere animals:

> _"What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than the angels."_ (Hebrews 2:6, 7)

The process of man's creation involved two distinct elements:

1. **Material component**: _"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground."_ (Genesis 2:7a)
2. **Life-giving power**: _"And [God] breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."_ (Genesis 2:7b)

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew phrase "living soul" (nephesh chayyah) is the same term used for animals in Genesis 1:30 (see marginal reading). Scripture uses this phrase for all breathing creatures, not as a distinguishing mark of humans alone.

### The Nature of the "Breath of Life"

What exactly did God breathe into Adam? Job provides clarity:

> _"All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils."_ (Job 27:3)

This "breath" or "spirit" (the Hebrew word _ruach_ can mean breath, wind, or spirit) is the animating life-force from God. Importantly, this same breath sustains all living creatures:

> _"All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died."_ (Genesis 7:21, 22)

> _"As the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast."_ (Ecclesiastes 3:19)

[Q] **"Doesn't having a 'soul' make humans different from animals?"**

The Bible teaches that both humans and animals are called "living souls" and share the same breath of life. The distinction of humanity lies not in possessing a different kind of soul, but in being made in God's image (Genesis 1:27)—with moral capacity, rational thought, and the ability to commune with the Creator. Revelation 16:3 explicitly calls sea creatures "living souls," using the same terminology applied to Adam.

### Man's Nature: Mortal, Not Immortal

Scripture clearly defines human nature as mortal:

> _"Shall mortal man be more just than God?"_ (Job 4:17)

**Mortal**: Subject to death; liable to die.

By contrast, God's nature is described as immortal:

> _"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever."_ (1 Timothy 1:17)

**Immortal**: Exempt from liability to die; deathless.

[DYK🔎] The word "immortal" appears only once in the English Bible (1 Timothy 1:17), and it is applied to God alone. The related word "immortality" appears five times, and in each case it is something God possesses, Christ brings to light, or believers must seek—never something humans naturally have.

## Deeper Truths

### The Two Adams: Natural and Spiritual

Paul draws a profound contrast between the first Adam and Christ, the "last Adam":

> _"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."_ (1 Corinthians 15:45)

**Living soul** (Greek: _psyche zosa_): A living creature, animated by the breath of life.
**Quickening spirit** (Greek: _pneuma zoopoioun_): A life-giving spirit, able to impart eternal life to others.

> _"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."_ (1 Corinthians 15:46)

[ILL] Consider the difference between a candle and the sun. A candle gives light, but only as long as its wax lasts—it is dependent, limited, and eventually burns out. The sun, however, is itself a source of light, giving warmth and life to everything around it. Adam was like the candle—alive, but only by borrowed breath that could be extinguished. Christ is like the sun—the very Source of life, able to impart immortality to all who come to Him.

### When Does Man Become Spiritual?

Paul answers definitively:

> _"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."_ (1 Corinthians 15:44)

The "sowing" refers to death and burial:

> _"That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die."_ (1 Corinthians 15:36)

At the resurrection, the righteous receive a spiritual body equal to the angels:

> _"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."_ (Luke 20:36)

Man does not possess the undying, spiritual nature of angels now. This transformation awaits the resurrection, when the redeemed receive bodies that cannot die.

### What Happens at Death?

When a person dies, the process of creation is reversed:

> _"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."_ (Ecclesiastes 12:7)

The "spirit" (breath of life) returns to God, its original Source. The body returns to dust. The "living soul" simply ceases to exist until God reunites breath and body at the resurrection.

[Q] **"Doesn't Ecclesiastes 12:7 prove that a conscious spirit goes to heaven at death?"**

The text says the spirit returns to God "who gave it"—the same breath God gave at creation. This breath returns to God whether a person is righteous or wicked (all die the same death physically). It is not a conscious entity, but the life-principle that animated the body. Job calls it "the spirit of God in my nostrils" (Job 27:3)—clearly referring to breath, not a thinking being. A righteous person's spirit returns to God just as a wicked person's does; the difference lies in what God does with each at the resurrection.

### Why Man Was Barred from the Tree of Life

After sin entered, God took decisive action:

> _"And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever."_ (Genesis 3:22)

> _"So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."_ (Genesis 3:24)

[DYK🔎] If Adam and Eve already possessed immortal souls, why would God need to guard the tree of life? The very act of barring access to this tree reveals that continued life depended on continued access to its fruit. God, in mercy, prevented sinful humanity from living forever in a state of misery and rebellion.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Lie in Eden and Its Consequences

In the garden, Satan made a bold assertion:

> _"Ye shall not surely die."_ (Genesis 3:4)

This was a direct contradiction of God's word: _"Thou shalt surely die"_ (Genesis 2:17). The idea that humans possess an immortal soul that cannot die is the echo of the serpent's lie. This deception has fueled:

- Spiritualism and communication with supposed spirits of the dead
- The doctrine of eternal torment in hell
- Prayers to saints and veneration of the departed
- Reincarnation and other pagan beliefs

The Bible's teaching on human nature—that the dead sleep unconsciously until the resurrection—protects against these deceptions.

### Life Only in Christ

The sanctuary service illustrates this truth beautifully. In the courtyard, the sacrifice died—representing Christ's death for us. But the blood was taken into the sanctuary, representing Christ's ongoing ministry to impart the benefits of His sacrifice. Life is not inherent in the sinner; it flows continually from Christ, our High Priest:

> _"He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."_ (1 John 5:12)

> _"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory."_ (Colossians 3:3, 4)

Eternal life is not a natural possession but a gift received through faith in Jesus and retained only through connection with Him. As the branch must remain connected to the vine to live (John 15:4–6), so we must remain connected to Christ, the Source of all life.

### Immortality: A Future Gift, Not a Present Possession

Who alone possesses immortality?

> _"Who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath immortality."_ (1 Timothy 6:15, 16)

How is immortality obtained?

> _"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life."_ (Romans 2:7)

One does not seek what one already possesses. Believers are to seek immortality because they do not yet have it.

When will believers receive immortality?

> _"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."_ (1 Corinthians 15:51, 52)

> _"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."_ (1 Corinthians 15:54)

The victory comes not through human effort but through Christ:

> _"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (1 Corinthians 15:57)

## Practical Application

Understanding our true nature has profound implications for daily Christian living:

### 1. **Dependence on Christ**

Since we have no life in ourselves, we must daily—moment by moment—depend on Jesus for spiritual life. The Christian life is not self-improvement but Christ-connection.

### 2. **Hope in the Resurrection**

Our hope for eternal life rests not in a supposed immortal soul surviving death, but in the sure promise of resurrection when Jesus returns. This hope anchors us through grief and loss.

### 3. **Protection from Deception**

Knowing that the dead "know not any thing" (Ecclesiastes 9:5) shields us from spiritualism's deceptions. No departed loved one is truly communicating from beyond; such appearances are demonic counterfeits.

### 4. **Urgency of Decision**

If immortality is conditional—a gift to be received, not a possession to be assumed—then our response to Christ matters eternally. There is no second chance after death, no purgatory for delayed preparation. Now is the time to be "hid with Christ in God."

### 5. **Motivation for Health**

The body is not a prison for an immortal soul but the very temple where God dwells through His Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19). Caring for body and mind honors the Creator who formed us and calls us to present our bodies as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1).

## Appeal

> _"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)

What is man? A creature formed from dust, animated by God's breath, and deeply loved by the Creator. We were made for immortality, but sin brought death. Yet God has not abandoned His purpose. Through Jesus Christ, life and immortality are brought to light (2 Timothy 1:10).

The question now is not merely "What is man?" but "What will you do with the Man Christ Jesus?" He alone has life to give. He alone can transform your mortal nature into immortal glory at His coming.

Will you receive Him today as your life, your hope, your all? Will you trust not in any supposed inherent immortality, but in the One who only hath immortality and freely offers it to all who believe?

_"And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son."_ (1 John 5:11)
