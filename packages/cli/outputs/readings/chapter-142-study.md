# Bible Study: Reverence for the House of God

## Introduction

When we gather for worship, do we truly understand where we stand? The place where God meets with His people is not ordinary ground—it is sanctified by His presence. This study explores the biblical call to reverence in God's house, connecting the earthly sanctuary with the heavenly reality and showing how true worship shapes the character of those preparing for Christ's return.

## Core Truths

### All That Is Devoted to God Is Sacred

The foundation of reverence begins with understanding that everything set apart for God's service takes on a holy character:

> _"Every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord."_ (Leviticus 27:28)

**Devoted** (Hebrew: _cherem_): Something irrevocably given to God, separated from common use, and belonging entirely to Him.

This principle extends beyond physical objects to places, times, and even our own bodies when consecrated to His service. What we dedicate to God is no longer ours to treat carelessly.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word translated "devoted" (_cherem_) carries the idea of something placed under a sacred ban—removed entirely from the secular realm. This same word describes the spoils of Jericho that Achan wrongfully took, showing how seriously God views the misuse of devoted things (Joshua 7:1).

### Christ's Example of Holy Jealousy

Jesus demonstrated the proper attitude toward His Father's house in the cleansing of the temple:

> _"And He taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves."_ (Mark 11:17)

The gentle Saviour who blessed little children and forgave sinners was moved to righteous action when God's house was desecrated. This was not anger out of control—it was holy jealousy for His Father's honor.

Notice what Christ did:

- **Cast out** those buying and selling
- **Overthrew** the tables of money changers
- **Would not suffer** anyone to carry common vessels through the temple

[Q] **"Wasn't Jesus being harsh and unloving?"**

Christ's action was the deepest expression of love—both for His Father's honor and for the people being robbed of true worship. The merchants had turned the Court of the Gentiles into a marketplace, making it impossible for sincere seekers to pray. Commercial noise replaced the voice of God. Jesus acted to restore what worship was meant to be: communion between heaven and earth.

## Deeper Truths

### A House of Prayer for All Nations

Some might argue that Christ's words applied only to the Jewish temple, now destroyed. But the prophecy He quoted extends far beyond ancient Jerusalem:

> _"Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon Mine altar; for Mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people."_ (Isaiah 56:7)

Isaiah's prophecy specifically mentions "the sons of the stranger"—Gentile believers who would join themselves to the Lord. This is not merely the temple of Solomon or Herod, but God's dwelling place among His people throughout all ages.

Malachi confirms this worldwide application:

> _"For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same My name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto My name, and a pure offering."_ (Malachi 1:11)

**In every place**—from humble chapels in remote villages to great cathedrals in cities—wherever God's people gather sincerely in His name, that place becomes sacred ground.

[ILL] Consider a visiting dignitary who comes to your home. Would you not prepare carefully? Would you conduct yourself with special care and courtesy? How much more when the King of the universe condescends to meet with His people! The place where heaven touches earth deserves our highest respect.

### The Presence That Sanctifies

What makes any place holy? Not the building materials, the architecture, or human tradition—but the presence of God Himself.

> _"For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them."_ (Matthew 18:20)

Christ promises His personal presence wherever His people assemble in His name. This transforms an ordinary room into a sanctuary.

Joshua learned this principle at Jericho:

> _"And the Captain of the Lord's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy."_ (Joshua 5:15)

The ground was not inherently sacred—it became holy because the Commander of heaven's armies stood there. So it is with every place where God meets with His people.

[DYK🔎] The command to remove sandals appears three times in Scripture: to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:5), to Joshua at Jericho, and symbolically in the tabernacle service where priests ministered barefoot. The bare foot touching holy ground represented direct, unmediated contact with the sacred—nothing between the worshipper and God's presence.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

This teaching connects directly with the sanctuary message. God's presence dwelt in the earthly tabernacle and temple, and His glory filled the Most Holy Place. The same God who required reverence in the earthly sanctuary now ministers in the heavenly sanctuary:

- **Outer court** (sacrifice): Christ's blood was shed to make reconciliation possible
- **Holy place** (daily ministry): Christ intercedes for His people continually
- **Most Holy Place** (judgment): Christ now ministers in the final phase of atonement

If reverence was required in the earthly type, how much more in our worship that connects with the heavenly reality? When we gather for worship, we join the angels in the courts above. The writer of Hebrews reminds us:

> _"Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear."_ (Hebrews 12:28)

### Why Irreverence Matters in the Great Controversy

In the cosmic conflict between Christ and Satan, one central issue is whether God's law and character deserve honor. Satan has consistently sought to diminish reverence for God and all that pertains to Him.

Notice that God linked Sabbath observance directly with sanctuary reverence:

> _"Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the Lord."_ (Leviticus 19:30)

Both the Sabbath and the sanctuary point to God as Creator and Redeemer. Both call us to step out of the common and into the sacred. Irreverence toward either reflects a diminished view of God Himself.

[Q] **"But doesn't God care more about the heart than outward behavior?"**

He cares about both—because outward behavior reveals and shapes the heart. The Preacher counsels:

> _"Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God."_ (Ecclesiastes 5:1)

This expression means to walk carefully, deliberately, with conscious attention. True heart worship expresses itself in reverent conduct. And careless conduct, over time, erodes heart reverence. The two cannot be separated.

### The Danger of Polluting God's House

God warned through Jeremiah of the consequences when His people brought "abominations" into His house:

> _"For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight, saith the Lord: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to pollute it."_ (Jeremiah 7:30)

Israel's casual attitude toward the sanctuary reflected their casual attitude toward God Himself—and eventually led to their rejection as His chosen people.

[ILL] A pure spring of water can be polluted gradually—a little sediment here, some debris there—until what was once crystal clear becomes unfit to drink. So irreverence creeps into God's house little by little: casual conversation that could wait, business conducted during sacred hours, entertainment replacing worship, until the very atmosphere that should draw souls to heaven becomes indistinguishable from the world.

## Practical Application

### How to Cultivate Reverence

David provides our model:

> _"But as for me, I will come into Thy house in the multitude of Thy mercy: and in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy temple."_ (Psalm 5:7)

Notice David's approach:

1. **Personal resolve**: "As for me"—regardless of what others do
2. **Humble dependence**: "In the multitude of Thy mercy"—not presuming on his own worthiness
3. **Holy fear**: "In Thy fear"—not terror, but profound respect for who God is

The psalmist declares:

> _"God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about Him."_ (Psalm 89:7)

### Specific Applications for Today

**Before worship:**

- Prepare your heart through prayer and Scripture
- Arrive early enough to quiet your mind
- Remember that Christ has promised to meet with you

**During worship:**

- Give full attention to God, not to phones or distractions
- Participate actively in praise, prayer, and study
- Maintain a spirit of expectation—God desires to speak to you

**Regarding God's house:**

- Reserve business discussions for appropriate times and places
- Guard against casual conversation that belongs outside
- On the Sabbath especially, let the house of God be devoted to its sacred purpose

[Q] **"Isn't this just legalism—focusing on externals?"**

True reverence is never legalism. Legalism is outward conformity without heart transformation. True reverence flows from a heart captured by God's love and overwhelmed by His majesty. The more we understand who God is, the more natural reverence becomes—not as a burden, but as the only appropriate response to His glory.

## Righteousness by Faith and Reverence

Here is a vital connection: We cannot manufacture true reverence any more than we can manufacture righteousness. Both must come from Christ.

When Isaiah saw the Lord "high and lifted up," his response was not self-improvement but confession: _"Woe is me! for I am undone"_ (Isaiah 6:5). Only after the live coal from the altar touched his lips—symbolizing Christ's cleansing work—could he respond, _"Here am I; send me"_ (Isaiah 6:8).

So it is with us. As we behold Christ in His sanctuary ministry, as we understand what it cost Him to make us welcome in God's presence, as His love fills our hearts—reverence becomes natural, even joyful. We do not work up reverence; we receive it as we receive Him.

## Appeal

_"God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about Him."_ (Psalm 89:7)

Dear friend, how do you approach God's house? Do you come with hurried feet and distracted mind, or with the quiet expectation that the King of the universe has promised to meet you there?

Christ is ministering now in the heavenly sanctuary. When His people gather below, heaven bends low to earth. Angels are present. The Holy Spirit moves upon hearts. Sacred things are transacted that will echo into eternity.

Will you not purpose, with David, to come into God's house with reverence and godly fear? Not as a burden, but as a privilege—for the God who fills the heavens condescends to dwell with those of humble and contrite heart (Isaiah 57:15).

Let us prepare our hearts. Let us guard our conduct. Let us approach the Most High with the reverence He deserves—for in doing so, we are being fitted for the day when we shall worship before His throne, where reverence will be the atmosphere of eternity.
