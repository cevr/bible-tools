# Reading 135: Submission—The Path to True Freedom

## Introduction

Submission is one of the most misunderstood and resisted concepts in Scripture, yet it lies at the very heart of the gospel. In a world that exalts self-assertion and independence, God calls His people to a different way—a way that paradoxically leads to true freedom, power, and exaltation. This study explores what biblical submission really means, why God requires it, and how it transforms every relationship in the believer's life.

## Core Truths

### The Foundation: Submission to God

The apostle James gives us the starting point for all submission:

> _"Submit yourselves therefore to God."_ (James 4:7)

**Submission** means the voluntary yielding of one's will to another's authority. It is not forced compliance but willing surrender born of trust and love.

But why should we submit to God? Isaiah provides the compelling answer:

> _"Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and His Maker... I have made the earth, and created man upon it... There is no God else beside Me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside Me. Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else."_ (Isaiah 45:11-22)

We owe submission to God because:

1. **He is our Creator**—He made us and therefore has rightful authority over us
2. **He is holy**—His character is the standard of all righteousness
3. **He is just**—His requirements are fair and good
4. **He is our only Saviour**—no one else can deliver us from sin

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "submit" (_kanah_) carries the idea of humbling oneself willingly, like bending the knee. It suggests not defeat but deliberate honor—the posture of a loyal subject before a beloved king.

### What True Submission Looks Like

Paul reveals what submission to God actually involves:

> _"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ."_ (2 Corinthians 10:5)

True submission involves:

- **Casting down imaginations**—rejecting thoughts and reasonings that contradict God's Word
- **Humbling every "high thing"**—no area of life remains autonomous from God
- **Bringing thoughts captive**—the very seat of decision-making yielded to Christ

This is not merely outward conformity but an inward revolution. The mind itself—the command center of the soul—is surrendered to Christ's authority.

[Q] **"Doesn't this sound like God wants mindless robots who don't think for themselves?"**

Not at all. God desires our minds to be _enlightened_, not _emptied_. The believer who submits to God is promised to be _"filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding"_ (Colossians 1:9). Submission to God does not diminish the mind—it liberates it from error and fills it with divine wisdom. The unsanctified mind is actually in bondage to self-deception; the submitted mind is truly free.

## Deeper Truths

### Submission and Sanctification

What exactly is God's will for us? Paul states it plainly:

> _"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:3)

**Sanctification** means to be set apart and made holy—progressively transformed into the image of Christ. Peter expands this:

> _"Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God."_ (1 Peter 4:1-2)

Here is a profound truth: suffering in the flesh—dying to self and its desires—results in _ceasing from sin_. This is not sinless perfection by human effort but the transformation that comes when self is crucified and Christ lives within.

The one who truly submits to God:

- No longer lives to fleshly lusts
- Lives according to the will of God
- Walks not after the flesh but after the Spirit

Paul confirms this connection:

> _"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."_ (Romans 8:4)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "fulfilled in us" (Greek: _plerōthē_) indicates that God's righteous requirements are not merely met _for_ us legally, but actually _realized in_ us practically through the Spirit's power. This is righteousness by faith—Christ's righteousness both credited to our account and worked out in our daily lives.

### The Body: A Living Sacrifice

Submission extends to our physical bodies:

> _"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."_ (Romans 12:1)

> _"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection."_ (1 Corinthians 9:27)

> _"Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."_ (1 Corinthians 6:20)

Paul uses athletic imagery—"I keep under my body"—like an athlete training for competition. Our appetites, habits, and physical inclinations must be brought under the control of sanctified reason and divine will.

[ILL] A wild horse has great power but is useless until broken and trained. Once submitted to the rider's guidance, that same power becomes purposeful and effective. So it is with our bodies and minds: unsubmitted, they run wild and accomplish nothing eternal; submitted to God, they become instruments of righteousness with tremendous power for good.

### The Tongue: The Ultimate Test

James identifies the most difficult area of submission:

> _"The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison."_ (James 3:8)

> _"If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body."_ (James 3:2)

[DYK🔎] James says "no _man_" can tame the tongue—emphasizing human impossibility. But what is impossible with men is possible with God (Luke 18:27). The untameable tongue becomes tameable only through complete submission to Christ's indwelling power.

The tongue reveals the heart. If we can govern our speech—speaking only what is true, kind, necessary, and God-glorifying—we have mastered the citadel of self. This is why the submitted soul prays Christ's prayer:

> _"Thy will be done."_ (Matthew 6:10)

---

## Christ Our Example

How was submission perfectly exemplified? In Christ Himself:

> _"He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."_ (Philippians 2:8)

> _"He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth."_ (Isaiah 53:7)

Consider the wonder: the Creator of the universe submitted to His own creatures. The King of kings allowed Himself to be bound, beaten, and crucified. He who could have called legions of angels to His defense instead remained silent.

[Q] **"Wasn't Christ's submission unique—something we cannot really imitate?"**

Christ's substitutionary death was indeed unique—He alone could die for the sins of the world. But His _spirit_ of submission is our pattern. Peter says we are to "arm ourselves with the same mind" (1 Peter 4:1). Paul tells us to "let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 2:5). Christ's submission was our example, and His indwelling Spirit makes such submission possible in us.

## Submission to Human Authorities

### Civil Government

Scripture extends the principle of submission to earthly authorities:

> _"Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates."_ (Titus 3:1)

> _"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God."_ (Romans 13:1-2)

> _"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake... for so is the will of God."_ (1 Peter 2:13-15)

Why does God require this? Because civil government is part of God's ordained order. Even imperfect governments serve divine purposes in restraining evil and maintaining social order.

### The Vital Exception

[Q] **"Does this mean Christians must obey government even when it commands sin?"**

Peter himself answers this critical question:

> _"We ought to obey God rather than men."_ (Acts 5:29)

> _"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye."_ (Acts 4:19)

When human law conflicts with divine law, God's authority takes precedence. The three Hebrew worthies—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—exemplified this principle. When commanded to worship an idol, they respectfully but firmly refused:

> _"Be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."_ (Daniel 3:18)

They submitted to the consequence (the fiery furnace) while refusing to sin against God. This is faithful submission properly understood.

### The True Scope of Civil Obedience

What does obedience to civil authority actually mean in practice?

> _"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."_ (Romans 13:9)

Civil law, at its best, reflects moral law—the second table of the Ten Commandments dealing with our duty to fellow humans. Christians are to be model citizens, fulfilling civic duties and demonstrating that godliness produces the most law-abiding, helpful, and trustworthy members of society.

## Submission in Relationships

### Mutual Submission Among Believers

> _"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility."_ (1 Peter 5:5)

This mutual submission cultivates humility—a virtue precious to God. Scripture declares that God "giveth grace to the humble" and "in due time" will exalt them (1 Peter 5:5-6).

[ILL] Water always flows to the lowest place. So does God's grace. The proud heart, lifted up in self-sufficiency, cannot receive what God freely offers. But the humble heart, lowered in submission, becomes a reservoir filled with divine blessing.

### Marriage: Mutual Honor, Not Domination

The wife is called to a specific expression of submission:

> _"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands."_ (Colossians 3:18)

Titus expands what this means practically: _"To be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands."_ (Titus 2:4-5)

[Q] **"Does wifely submission permit husbands to dominate and mistreat their wives?"**

Absolutely not. The same passage immediately constrains husbands:

> _"Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them."_ (Colossians 3:19)

> _"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it."_ (Ephesians 5:25)

A husband who truly loves as Christ loves does not dominate—he serves, protects, and sacrifices. Christ's love was self-giving, not self-serving. Any interpretation that justifies abuse or tyranny misses the mutual respect Scripture establishes.

Furthermore, wifely submission has a qualifier:

> _"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, **as it is fit in the Lord**."_ (Colossians 3:18)

Submission is "fit" only within the boundaries of righteousness. A wife is never required to follow a husband into sin.

### Children and Parents

> _"Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."_ (Colossians 3:20)

This submission is part of God's order for the home, training children in the way of godly authority before they can fully understand divine authority.

### Servants and Masters

> _"Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God."_ (Colossians 3:22)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "in singleness of heart, fearing God" transforms the nature of work. Even the most mundane tasks become acts of worship when performed with undivided devotion to God. The Christian worker serves not merely for wages or approval but as unto the Lord.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Submission: The Heart of the Great Controversy

The great controversy began when Lucifer refused submission to God. He exalted himself, claiming equality with the Most High (Isaiah 14:12-14). Pride—the refusal to submit—is the original sin and the root of every sin since.

In contrast, Christ demonstrated perfect submission even unto death. The Father's plan of salvation required the Son's willing obedience. In Gethsemane, we hear the ultimate prayer of submission:

> _"Not My will, but Thine, be done."_ (Luke 22:42)

Every human being faces this same choice: Will I submit to God's authority, or assert my own? The redeemed are those who, like Christ, choose the Father's will over self-will.

### The Sanctuary and Submission

In the earthly sanctuary, submission was demonstrated at the altar of sacrifice in the outer court. The sinner brought an animal, laid hands upon its head, confessed sins, and then took its life. This pointed forward to Christ's ultimate submission at Calvary.

In the Holy Place, the priest daily ministered—maintaining the lamps, offering incense, presenting the shewbread. Each service required careful obedience to God's specific instructions. Careless deviation brought death, as Nadab and Abihu discovered (Leviticus 10:1-2).

In the Most Holy Place, on the Day of Atonement, the high priest entered with utmost reverence and precision. This foreshadowed our Lord's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary, where He now intercedes for us. Those who will be found faithful when Christ completes His work are those who have learned full submission to God.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "atonement" (_kaphar_) includes the idea of covering and reconciliation. Through submission to God's plan of salvation, we are brought back into harmony—"at-one-ment"—with our Creator.

### Righteousness by Faith and Submission

Here is the vital connection: **true submission to God IS righteousness by faith in action.**

We cannot submit in our own strength. The carnal mind is "not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be" (Romans 8:7). Self cannot crucify self. Only as Christ dwells in us by faith can genuine submission become possible.

When we surrender to God—confessing our inability and claiming Christ's power—His Spirit works within us both to will and to do of His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13). The righteousness of the law is then "fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Romans 8:4).

This is not legalism. Legalism is trying to obey God in human strength to earn favor. Righteousness by faith is receiving Christ's power to obey because we already have His favor through grace.

## Practical Application

What does a life of submission look like in daily practice?

### In Your Relationship with God:

- **Morning surrender**: Begin each day with the prayer, "Lord, Thy will be done in me today"
- **Scripture meditation**: Let God's Word shape your thinking rather than worldly influences
- **Instant obedience**: When the Spirit convicts, respond without argument or delay
- **Thought governance**: Practice bringing wandering or rebellious thoughts captive to Christ

### In Your Relationships:

- **Honor authority**: Submit to government, employers, and church leaders where not contrary to God's law
- **Practice humility**: Consider others' interests, not only your own (Philippians 2:4)
- **Guard your tongue**: Speak only what builds up and honors God
- **In marriage**: Husbands—love sacrificially; wives—honor respectfully
- **As parents**: Exercise loving authority that reflects God's character
- **As children**: Obey cheerfully, recognizing parents as God's representatives

### When Faced with Conflict:

- Distinguish between God's clear commands and human preferences
- Be willing to suffer rather than sin
- Maintain respectful demeanor even when you cannot comply
- Trust God with the consequences of faithful obedience

## Appeal

Beloved, submission is not weakness—it is strength rightly channeled. It is not servility—it is nobility rightly expressed. The truly great in God's kingdom are those who have learned to say with their Lord, "Not my will, but Thine, be done."

> _"Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time."_ (1 Peter 5:6)

The same God who called you is faithful to complete His work in you. He does not ask for perfection before you begin—He asks for surrender, and then He supplies the power. Will you today cast down every imagination, every proud reasoning, every stubborn resistance, and bring your whole being into glad submission to the One who loves you and gave Himself for you?

Christ submitted even unto death that you might live. Can you not submit unto life that you might reign with Him eternally?

_"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you."_ (James 4:7-8)
