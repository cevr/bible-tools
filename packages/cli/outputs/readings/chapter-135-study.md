### Q1. To whom do we owe unqualified submission?

**“Submit yourselves therefore to God.” James 4:7.**

**Answer:** The only Being in the universe to whom a free moral agent owes
absolute, unqualified submission is the Creator Himself. This submission is the
foundation of the Christian life and the secret to victory in the Great
Controversy between Christ and Satan.

- **The Nature of Submission:** To submit means to yield one’s will to the
  authority and wisdom of another. In a spiritual sense, it is the act of
  surrendering our independence to God, acknowledging His sovereignty over our
  lives.
- **The Prerequisite for Victory:** The verse continues, "Resist the devil, and
  he will flee from you." We cannot successfully resist the enemy while we are
  in rebellion against the General of heaven. Submission to God places us under
  His protection and power.
- **Voluntary Love:** God does not force the will. He desires a submission born
  of love and trust, not terror. We yield to Him because we trust His character.

**Term Definition:**

- **Sovereignty:** The supreme authority and right of God to rule over His
  creation (Psalm 103:19).

**[ILL]** A patient on an operating table must submit completely to the surgeon.
If the patient tries to guide the surgeon's hand or fights against the
anesthesia, the healing work cannot be done. We must lie still in the hands of
the Great Physician so He can cut away the cancer of sin.

### Q2. Why are we under obligation to submit to God?

**“Thus saith the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and His Maker, ...I have made
the earth, and created man upon it... There is no God else beside Me; a just God
and a Saviour; there is none beside Me. Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the
ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.” Isa. 45:11-22.**

**Answer:** Our obligation to submit to God rests on two mighty pillars:
Creation and Redemption. We belong to Him by double right—He made us, and He
bought us.

1.  **Creation Rights:** He "created man upon it." As the Architect of humanity,
    He alone knows how the human mechanism acts and reacts. He knows that sin
    destroys us, while obedience allows us to function as intended.
2.  **Redemption Rights:** He is "a just God and a Saviour." When we had sold
    ourselves into the slavery of sin, He purchased us back with the infinite
    price of the blood of Christ (1 Corinthians 6:20; 1 Peter 1:18–19).
3.  **His Character:** He is the "Holy One of Israel." In the sanctuary service,
    the holiness of God was revealed. Because He is holy and just, His rule is
    not a tyranny but a kingdom of righteousness. To submit to Him is to align
    oneself with the only power that is truly good.

**[ILL]** An inventor who creates a complex machine has the right to write the
instruction manual. If the machine malfunctions, it must be submitted to the
maker for repair. We are broken by sin, and only our Maker can restore us.

---

### Q3. What constitutes submission to God?

**“Casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against
the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience
of Christ.” 2 Cor. 10:5.**

**Answer:** True submission is not merely an outward bowing of the knee; it is
an inward surrender of the mind and the will. The warfare of the Christian is
not against flesh and blood, but against the "imaginations" and pride that
fortify the heart against the Holy Spirit.

- **The Battleground of the Mind:** The "high things" mentioned here are pride,
  self-righteousness, and human philosophy that claim we do not need a Saviour.
  Submission casts these down.
- **Captivity to Christ:** This is the essence of Righteousness by Faith. We do
  not fight sinful thoughts in our own strength; we bring them to Christ. We
  exchange our chaotic, sinful thoughts for His pure, obedient mind (Philippians
  2:5).
- **The Work of the Spirit:** We cannot empty our own minds of evil. We must
  welcome the Holy Spirit, who brings the presence of Christ to dwell within.
  When Christ enters the citadel of the mind, the enemy is cast out.

**[ILL]** In ancient warfare, a besieged city would eventually lower its flags
and open its gates to the conqueror, surrendering control of its strongholds. We
must open the gates of our mind to Jesus, handing Him the keys to every room in
the heart—even the secret closets we wish to keep hidden.

---

### Q4. What will be the condition of one who is thus submissive to God?

**He will be “filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual
understanding.” Col. 1:9.**

**Answer:** Submission is the gateway to spiritual sight. A rebellious heart is
always a blinded heart. When we cease fighting against God, the "noise" of
self-will quiets down, and we can hear the Still Small Voice.

- **Spiritual Understanding:** This is not mere intellectual knowledge of
  theology; it is an experiential knowledge of God (John 17:3). It is the
  difference between knowing _about_ the Sanctuary and _entering_ the Sanctuary
  by faith to meet the High Priest.
- **Wisdom:** Wisdom is the practical application of knowledge. The submissive
  soul knows how to apply the law of God to daily life because the law is being
  written on their heart.

**[ILL]** A lake with a turbulent surface cannot reflect the sky. Only when the
wind ceases and the waters are still (submissive) can the lake perfectly mirror
the blue heavens above. So it is with the soul; only in the calm of submission
can we reflect the image of Christ.

---

### Q5. What is the will of God?

**“For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.” 1 Thess. 4:3.
“Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves
likewise with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased
from sin; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the
lusts of men, but to the will of God.” 1 Peter 4:1, 2.**

**Answer:** God’s will for humanity is not mysterious; it is our complete
restoration to holiness. He wills that we be free from the dominion of sin.

- **Sanctification Defined:** Sanctification is the work of God’s grace by which
  the believer is separated from sin and dedicated to God, becoming holy in
  character and life (1 Thessalonians 5:23). It is a progressive work of a
  lifetime.
- **Ceasing from Sin:** The text says the one who suffers in the flesh (dies to
  self) has "ceased from sin." This is the promise of the Gospel—not just
  forgiveness for the past (Justification), but power over sin in the present.
- **God's Will is Power:** In the creation, God spoke, and it was done. If it is
  God's _will_ that we be sanctified, then all the power of the Godhead is
  pledged to accomplish that work in us, if we but submit (Jude 24).

**[ILL]** A block of marble does not carve itself. It submits to the chisel of
the sculptor. The sculptor's will is to bring a beautiful image out of the
stone. The cutting is painful, but every stroke is for the purpose of
"sanctification"—setting the image free from the rough stone.

---

### Q6. What is fulfilled in us when we live not in the flesh?

**“That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after
the flesh, but after the Spirit.” Rom. 8:4.**

**Answer:** This is one of the most powerful verses on Righteousness by Faith in
the Bible. It teaches that the Law of God is not abolished, but rather
_fulfilled_ in the life of the believer through the indwelling of Christ.

1.  **"In Us," Not "By Us":** Note that the righteousness is fulfilled _in_ us
    (passive). It is Christ's righteousness, imparted to us by the Spirit, that
    enables us to keep the law. We do not keep the law to be saved; we are saved
    by Christ so that the law might be fulfilled in our character.
2.  **The Two Walks:**
    - _Walking after the flesh:_ Relying on human strength and following human
      desires (legalism or license).
    - _Walking after the Spirit:_ Relying on the indwelling life of Christ.
3.  **The New Covenant:** The promise of the New Covenant is, "I will put my
    laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10). When
    we submit to the Spirit, the requirement of the law (Love to God and man)
    becomes our nature.

**Term Definition:**

- **Imparted Righteousness:** The righteousness of Christ actually formed within
  the believer by the Holy Spirit, resulting in obedience and a changed life.

**[ILL]** You can try to tape apples onto a dead branch, but they will rot and
fall. That is works-righteousness. But if the branch is grafted into a living
apple tree, the sap flows through it, and it produces apples naturally. That is
the righteousness of the law fulfilled _in_ us through union with Christ.

---

### Q7. Then what is the course of one who is submissive to God?

**He walks after the Spirit, i.e., brings forth the “fruit of the Spirit” (Gal.
5:22-24), or in other words, fulfills “the righteousness of the law,” which
constitutes the will of God. 1 Peter 4:2.**

**Answer:** The submissive life is a fruitful life. Submission is not a passive
state of doing nothing; it is an active connection with the Source of life,
resulting in visible changes in character.

- **The Fruit vs. The Works:** The Bible contrasts the "works" of the flesh
  (manufactured by self) with the "fruit" of the Spirit (grown by God). Love,
  joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and
  temperance are the natural outflow of a life submitted to God.
- **Harmony with the Law:** There is no conflict between the Fruit of the Spirit
  and the Law of God. "Against such there is no law" (Galatians 5:23). To walk
  in the Spirit is to walk in the path of the Ten Commandments.

---

### Q8. What should we bring into subjection to God?

**“But I keep under my body and bring it into subjection.” 1 Cor. 9:27. “I
beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
service.” Rom. 12:1. “Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ.” 2 Cor. 10:5. “Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are
God’s.” 1 Cor. 6:20.**

**Answer:** Submission must be total, encompassing the entire being: physical,
mental, and spiritual.

1.  **The Body (Health Reform):** Paul speaks of keeping the body under
    subjection. Our physical appetites (food, drink, passions) must be
    controlled by a sanctified reason. If the lower nature rules the higher
    nature, we cannot serve God perfectly. The body is the temple of the Holy
    Spirit; we must care for it so God can dwell therein.
2.  **The Mind:** As noted in Q3, our thoughts must be brought to Christ.
3.  **The Spirit:** Our affections and worship belong to God.
4.  **A Living Sacrifice:** In the ancient sanctuary, the animal was brought
    dead to the altar. In the New Covenant, we climb onto the altar _alive_, to
    live for God.

**[ILL]** A rider on a powerful horse must keep the reins tight. The horse (the
body/appetites) is useful and strong, but if it takes the bit in its teeth and
runs wild, it will destroy the rider. The sanctified will, empowered by God,
holds the reins.

---

### Q9. Which member of the body requires the greatest exertion, together with the grace of God, to bring into submission?

**“The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.” “If
any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle
the whole body.” James 3:8, 2.**

**Answer:** The tongue is the indicator of the heart's condition. Because "out
of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (Matthew 12:34), the tongue is
the most difficult member to control.

- **Human Inability:** James says "the tongue can no man tame." Human willpower
  alone is insufficient to control sharp words, gossip, or dishonesty.
- **Divine Power:** While _man_ cannot tame it, _God_ can. When the heart is
  cleansed by the blood of Christ, the speech becomes pure.
- **The Test of Perfection:** The verse suggests that victory over the tongue is
  the mark of Christian maturity ("a perfect man"). If the grace of God can
  control the tongue, it has conquered the whole citadel of the soul.

**[ILL]** James compares the tongue to a small rudder on a huge ship. Though
small, it directs the entire vessel. If the rudder is controlled by the Captain
(Christ), the ship reaches the safe harbor. If the rudder is loose, the ship
crashes.

---

### Q10. What is the prayer of one who is submissive to God?

**“Thy will be done.” Matt. 6:10.**

**Answer:** This is the prayer of the Kingdom. It was the prayer of Jesus in
Gethsemane: "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). It is the surrender
of personal preference, trusting that God's will is always love and acts for our
eternal best good. It shifts the focus from "God, give me what I want" to "God,
make me what You want."

---

### Q11. How was submission exemplified in the life of Christ?

**“He [Jesus] humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of
the cross.” Phil. 2:8. “He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened
not His mouth; He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before
her shearers is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.” Isa. 53:7. Read also Matt.
27:26-50.**

**Answer:** Christ is the supreme example of submission. Though He was equal
with God, He voluntarily took the form of a servant.

- **Active Obedience:** He kept the Law perfectly, demonstrating that humanity,
  connected with Divinity, can obey God.
- **Passive Obedience:** He submitted to injustice, torture, and death without
  retaliation. He trusted His Father to vindicate Him.
- **The Sanctuary Lamb:** As the Lamb of God, He submitted to the knife of
  justice so that we might be spared. His submission is the source of our
  salvation. We look to Him not only as our Substitute but as our Example.

**[ILL]** The path to greatness in God's kingdom is down, not up. Jesus
descended from the throne to the manger, and from the manger to the cross.
Because He humbled Himself lower than anyone else, God has exalted Him higher
than anyone else (Philippians 2:9).

---

### Q12. What is said about submission to worldly powers and authorities?

**“Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
magistrates.” Titus 3:1.**

**Answer:** The Christian is to be a model citizen. We are to respect the civil
order because anarchy is contrary to the character of God. Christianity does not
seek to overthrow earthly governments by force but seeks to change hearts
through the Gospel.

---

### Q13. Why are we required to do this?

**“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but
of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth
the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.” Rom. 11:1, 2. “Submit yourselves to
every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake, ...for so is the will of God.” 1
Peter 2:13-15.**

**Answer:** God is a God of order. Civil government is ordained by God to
maintain order, restrain evil, and protect rights in a fallen world (Romans
13:3–4). Even when rulers are not personally righteous, the _office_ and the
_structure_ of law are instruments of God's common grace to prevent the world
from descending into chaos. We obey them "for the Lord's sake."

---

### Q14. Does Peter mean that we should submit to the ordinances of men, even when these are contrary to the express command of God?

**Let Peter himself answer. “We ought to obey God rather than men.” Acts 5:29.
“Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God,
judge ye.” Acts 4:19.**

**Answer:** Here is the limit of human authority. God is the Supreme Sovereign;
Caesar (civil government) is a subordinate power.

- **The Hierarchy of Law:** Just as a city law cannot override a national law, a
  human law cannot override the Divine Law (the Ten Commandments).
- **Conscience:** When a human law compels us to sin (to do what God forbids or
  forbid what God commands), the Christian must respectfully but firmly decline
  to obey the human law, in order to obey the Divine. This is not rebellion; it
  is the highest form of allegiance to the King of Kings.

**[ILL]** If a general orders a soldier to commit a crime, and the King orders
the soldier to prevent crime, the soldier must obey the King, even if the
general punishes him.

---

### Q15. What noted example have we of obedience or submission to God rather than man?

**The three worthies in the fiery furnace. Dan. 3.**

**Answer:** Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego exemplify the balance. They were
loyal officials of Babylon in all civil matters. But when the King commanded
idolatry (breaking the Second Commandment), they refused. They did not fight the
king; they submitted to the punishment (the furnace) while entrusting their
souls to God. This is the spirit of the martyrs and the spirit of the Remnant
who will refuse the Mark of the Beast (Revelation 13:15; 14:12).

---

### Q16. Then what is really meant by being subject to worldly rulers and ordinances of men?

**“For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not
steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be
any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying; namely, Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” Rom. 13:9.**

**Answer:** Paul explains that civil laws usually align with the second table of
the Decalogue (duties to our fellow man). Governments exist to protect life,
property, and marriage. In these matters—honesty, non-violence, paying taxes,
respecting property—the Christian should be the most law-abiding citizen in the
nation. By loving our neighbor and doing no harm, we fulfill the righteous
requirement of the civil law.

---

### Q17. How do we stand related to one another with regard to submission?

**“Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you, be
subject one to another, and be clothed with humility.” 1 Peter 5:5.**

**Answer:** In the church and in society, there is to be a spirit of mutual
respect.

- **Respect for Experience:** The younger are to value the wisdom of the elder.
- **Mutual Submission:** Even leaders are to have a spirit of submission to the
  needs of the flock. "Subject one to another" means we are willing to serve and
  prefer others before ourselves (Romans 12:10). This destroys the spirit of
  rivalry and self-promotion.

---

### Q18. What seems to be the reason for this requirement?

**Submission cultivates humility, a Christian virtue of high value. It is the
humble to whom God “giveth grace,” and whom He will in due time exalt. 1 Peter
5:5, 6.**

**Answer:** Pride was the original sin of Lucifer (Isaiah 14:13–14). Humility is
the antidote to sin.

- **The Flow of Grace:** Grace is like water; it always flows to the lowest
  point. God cannot give grace to the proud because they feel no need of it. The
  humble heart is open to receive the righteousness of Christ.
- **Exaltation:** God waits to exalt us until we are humble enough to handle it
  without becoming proud.

**[ILL]** A tree with branches laden with heavy, good fruit always bows low. A
branch that sticks straight up is usually barren. Humility is the proof of
spiritual fruitfulness.

---

### Q19. What should be the attitude of a wife to her husband?

**“Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.” Col. 3:18.**

**Answer:** In the divine order of the home, God has established roles to ensure
harmony, just as there is order in the Godhead. This is not a submission of
value (for men and women are equal in Christ, Galatians 3:28), but a functional
submission to preserve unity in the family. It reflects the church's submission
to Christ.

---

### Q20. What is this submission?

**“To be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet,
chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands.” Titus 2:4, 5.**

**Answer:** This submission is characterized by love, loyalty, and care for the
domestic circle. It is a voluntary, loving cooperation that builds up the home.
It involves respecting the husband's role as the head of the household.

---

### Q21. Does this submission permit domination on the part of the husband?

**“Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.” Col. 3:19.
“Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church.” Eph. 5:25.**

**Answer:** Absolutely not. Biblical headship is not tyranny; it is
self-sacrificing love.

- **The Christ Standard:** A husband is commanded to love his wife "as Christ
  loved the church." How did Christ lead the church? By dying for her, serving
  her, and patiently guiding her. He never forced, bullied, or abused.
- **No Bitterness:** Harsh words and dictatorial control are forbidden. A
  husband who acts like a tyrant is not representing Christ and forfeits his
  moral right to respect.

**[ILL]** Christ washed the feet of His disciples. He, the Head, became the
Servant. A Christian husband leads by serving his family, protecting them, and
providing for them, not by barking orders.

---

### Q22. How far should a wife submit to her husband?

**“Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.”
Col. 3:18.**

**Answer:** The phrase "in the Lord" is the critical boundary. A wife's first
duty is to her Saviour. She cannot submit to a husband if he demands she violate
her conscience or the Law of God (e.g., breaking the Sabbath, engaging in
dishonesty, or harming her body). In such cases, she must gently but firmly obey
God rather than man, just as in the civil realm.

---

### Q23. In what should children be submissive to parents?

**“Children, obey your parents in all things; for this is well pleasing unto the
Lord.” Col. 3:20.**

**Answer:** Children are to learn the principle of authority in the home so they
can later submit to the authority of God. "In all things" implies a broad scope
of obedience, provided, again, that the parents do not command sin. This
obedience pleases the Lord because it reflects the Fifth Commandment, which is
the first commandment with a promise (Ephesians 6:2).

---

### Q24. What is said about the submission of servants to masters?

**“Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with
eye service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God.” Col.
3:22.**

**Answer:** This applies today to employees and employers.

- **Integrity:** Christians should work just as hard when the boss is not
  looking as when he is.
- **Motive:** We work not just for a paycheck, but "fearing God." We view our
  daily labor as service to Christ. An Adventist Christian should be the most
  reliable, honest, and diligent worker in any company, for they are working for
  a Heavenly Master.
