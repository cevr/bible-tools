# Bible Study: Selfishness—The Root of All Sin

## Introduction

Selfishness lies at the very heart of sin. It was the principle that led Lucifer to exalt himself in heaven, and it is the principle that lies beneath every transgression of God's law. To understand selfishness is to understand the nature of the great controversy itself—and to overcome it is to experience the very essence of salvation. This study examines what selfishness is, how it manifests, and most importantly, how Christ alone can deliver us from its deadly grip.

## Core Truths

### What Is Selfishness?

Webster defines selfishness as "that supreme self-love or self-preference which leads a person to direct his purposes to the advancement of his own interest, power, or happiness, without regarding those of others."

This definition captures the essence of sin itself. When we place self at the center—when our interests, our comfort, our advancement become the governing principle of our lives—we have dethroned God and enthroned self.

> _"Thou shalt not covet."_ (Exodus 20:17)

The tenth commandment strikes at the root of all other commandments. Covetousness is selfishness directed toward things, people, or positions. Every sin—murder, theft, adultery, lying—can be traced back to this root of selfish desire.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "covet" (_chamad_) means "to desire, delight in, or take pleasure in." It's the same word used when Eve "saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes" (Genesis 3:6). Selfishness was the lever Satan used to bring sin into our world.

### Selfishness Violates the Royal Law

> _"If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well."_ (James 2:8)

God's law is a law of love—love to God and love to man. Selfishness is the exact opposite principle. Where love gives, selfishness grasps. Where love serves, selfishness demands. Where love sacrifices, selfishness exploits.

**Love** asks: "What can I give?"
**Selfishness** asks: "What can I get?"

These two principles cannot coexist. One must conquer the other.

## Deeper Truths

### Seven Manifestations of Selfishness

Scripture reveals how selfishness shows itself in human conduct. Recognizing these manifestations helps us identify the enemy within:

**1. Lovers of Self**

> _"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous."_ (2 Timothy 3:2)

Self-love is the first and most fundamental expression of selfishness. It places "I" at the center of the universe where only God belongs.

**2. Pleasing Ourselves**

> _"We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves."_ (Romans 15:1)

The selfish heart constantly asks, "What do I want? What makes me comfortable? What satisfies my preferences?"

**3. Seeking Our Own**

> _"Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."_ (1 Corinthians 10:33)

This is selfishness in action—the relentless pursuit of personal advantage regardless of others.

**4. Greedy Gain**

> _"Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough... they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter."_ (Isaiah 56:11)

[ILL] Consider a child with a plate of cookies who, when asked to share, hides them behind his back. Though he cannot possibly eat them all, he cannot bear for another to have what he considers "his." So is the covetous heart—never satisfied, always grasping, incapable of generous joy.

**5. Seeking Undue Precedence**

> _"Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom."_ (Matthew 20:21)

Ambition for position and recognition—the desire to be first, to be honored, to be above others—is selfishness wearing religious clothing.

**6. Neglect of the Poor**

> _"But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"_ (1 John 3:17)

Selfishness blinds us to the needs of others. It builds walls around our abundance while brothers and sisters suffer want.

**7. Performing Duty for Reward**

> _"The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money."_ (Micah 3:11)

Even religious service can be poisoned by selfishness when we serve God for what we can get—reputation, income, influence, or heavenly reward—rather than from love.

[Q] **"But didn't Jesus promise rewards to His followers? Isn't it right to be motivated by heaven?"**

There is a difference between _receiving_ reward and _serving for_ reward. A child who obeys his father out of love may receive an inheritance, but he does not obey _in order to_ receive it. The selfish heart calculates: "What will I get?" The loving heart asks: "How can I please my Father?" Jesus promises rewards to those whose hearts are right, but the reward-seeking motive itself reveals a heart still governed by self.

### Selfishness Destroys Christian Fellowship

> _"There should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it."_ (1 Corinthians 12:25, 26)

The body of Christ functions as one organism. When selfishness enters, the body tears apart. Division, competition, jealousy, and strife—all fruit of the selfish root—make true Christian fellowship impossible.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "schism" (_schisma_) is where we get our English word. It literally means "a tear or rent," like cloth ripped apart. Selfishness tears the church as surely as thorns tear fabric.

### Selfishness Is Contrary to Love

> _"Charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil."_ (1 Corinthians 13:4, 5)

Notice how many descriptions of love are simply the _absence_ of selfish traits:

- **Envieth not** (does not covet what others have)
- **Vaunteth not itself** (does not boast of self)
- **Is not puffed up** (does not have an inflated self-view)
- **Seeketh not her own** (does not pursue self-interest)

Love and selfishness are mutually exclusive. Where one reigns, the other cannot exist.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Selfishness: The Principle of Satan's Kingdom

Selfishness is not merely a human weakness—it is the governing principle of Satan's rebellion. Lucifer said:

> _"I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the most High."_ (Isaiah 14:13, 14)

Five times "I will"—the anthem of self-exaltation. This principle lies at the heart of the great controversy. Satan's kingdom operates on selfishness; God's kingdom operates on self-sacrificing love.

Every human being must choose which principle will govern their life. There is no neutral ground.

### The Cross: Where Selfishness Was Condemned

> _"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."_ (2 Corinthians 8:9)

> _"For even Christ pleased not himself."_ (Romans 15:3)

At the cross, we see the complete antithesis of selfishness. The Son of God—who had everything—gave everything for those who had nothing and deserved nothing. This was not calculation or self-interest; it was pure, self-emptying love.

[ILL] Imagine a wealthy king who discovers that rebels in his kingdom are dying of a plague. Though they deserve death for their treason, he becomes poor himself—gives up his throne, his robes, his palace—and enters the plague-infested slums to bring the cure at the cost of his own life. This is what Christ did. And this is the principle that must govern His followers.

### Sanctuary Light: From Self to Christ

In the sanctuary service, we see the remedy for selfishness portrayed:

**Outer Court (The Cross)**: At the altar of burnt offering, the sinner laid his hand on the sacrifice, confessing his sins. This act of faith transferred guilt to the innocent substitute. Here selfishness receives its death blow—we acknowledge that self _cannot_ save, that our own works are worthless, that only the blood of Another can cleanse us.

**Holy Place (Daily Ministry)**: The priest ministered daily with bread, light, and incense—representing Christ's ongoing work of feeding, illuminating, and interceding for His people. As we daily receive Christ's righteousness, selfishness is progressively replaced by His character of love.

**Most Holy Place (Final Cleansing)**: In the Day of Atonement, the sanctuary was cleansed and the people afflicted their souls. This points to the final work of purification in the investigative judgment—when God's people are so completely delivered from selfishness that they reflect Christ's character fully and are sealed for eternity.

The entire sanctuary service declares: Self must die. Christ must reign.

### Righteousness by Faith: The Only Remedy

> _"For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."_ (2 Corinthians 5:14, 15)

Here is the divine remedy for selfishness: **the love of Christ constraineth us**.

We cannot overcome selfishness by trying harder to be unselfish. Such efforts are themselves self-focused—"Look how unselfish I'm being!" The only power that can deliver us is a power outside ourselves: the love of Christ.

When we behold Christ's sacrifice—when we truly comprehend that He died for _us_, that His love is personal and infinite—something happens within. His love "constrains" us. The Greek word (_synecho_) means "to press together, to hold fast, to compel." Christ's love presses in upon the soul, leaving no room for self.

[Q] **"But I've tried to behold Christ's love, and I still struggle with selfishness. What am I doing wrong?"**

Victory over selfishness is not instantaneous, and struggles do not mean failure. The key is _continued beholding_. "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord" (2 Corinthians 3:18). Transformation comes "from glory to glory"—progressively, as we keep looking. Each day, each hour, we must turn our eyes upon Jesus. As we behold, we become. This is the work of a lifetime, but it is a work Christ Himself performs in us as we surrender.

## Practical Application

### The Divine Prescription

> _"Let no man seek his own."_ (1 Corinthians 10:24)

> _"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."_ (Philippians 2:4)

These are not merely good suggestions—they are the pattern of the kingdom of heaven. How do we apply them practically?

**1. Daily Surrender**
Each morning, before engaging with the world, bring your self-life to the cross. Pray, "Lord, I cannot conquer selfishness. Take my heart, for I cannot give it. Keep it pure, for I cannot keep it for Thee. Mold me, fashion me, raise me into a pure and holy atmosphere, where the rich current of Thy love can flow through my soul."

**2. Look for Opportunities to Serve**
Selfishness is overcome not merely by _not doing_ selfish things, but by actively doing loving things. Ask each day: "Whom can I serve? What need can I meet? How can I bear another's burden?"

**3. Rejoice in Others' Blessings**
One of selfishness's most subtle manifestations is envy—resenting others' success, gifts, or blessings. Practice rejoicing when others are honored, promoted, or blessed. This crucifies self.

**4. Give Generously**

> _"Give, and it shall be given unto you."_ (Luke 6:38)

Generosity breaks the grip of covetousness. Give of your time, your resources, your attention. Give when it costs you something. Give to those who cannot repay.

**5. Examine Your Motives**
Regularly ask yourself: "Why am I doing this? Is it for God's glory, for others' good, or for my own advancement?" Honest self-examination, in the light of God's word and Spirit, exposes hidden selfishness.

### The Cost of Discipleship

> _"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."_ (Matthew 16:24)

Jesus makes clear that following Him requires self-denial. There is no Christianity without the cross, and there is no cross without death to self. This is not popular teaching, but it is biblical truth.

The good news is that what Christ requires, Christ supplies. He does not ask us to overcome selfishness in our own strength. He asks us to surrender, to trust, to follow—and He works the miracle of transformation within.

### Bible Examples: Warning and Instruction

Scripture provides sobering examples of selfishness unchecked:

- **Cain** (Genesis 4:9): "Am I my brother's keeper?"—the callous disregard for another's welfare
- **Nabal** (1 Samuel 25:3, 11): Churlish and evil in his dealings, hoarding what he could have shared
- **Haman** (Esther 3–7): Ambition and wounded pride leading to genocidal conspiracy
- **James and John** (Mark 10:35–37): Seeking position and honor even among the disciples
- **The multitude** (John 6:24–26): Following Jesus for loaves and fishes, not for truth

These examples stand as warnings. Selfishness, left unchecked, leads to destruction.

> _"Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core... wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever."_ (Jude 11–13)

## A Last-Day Warning

> _"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous..."_ (2 Timothy 3:1, 2)

Selfishness will be a defining characteristic of the last days. The world grows increasingly self-centered—obsessed with self-image, self-fulfillment, self-expression, self-esteem. Into this darkness, God calls His people to be lights—living demonstrations of self-sacrificing love.

[DYK🔎] The Greek phrase translated "lovers of their own selves" (_philautoi_) appears only here in the New Testament. It describes a self-love so intense that it becomes the defining characteristic of a person—and of an age. We live in that age.

The prevalence of selfishness confirms the lateness of the hour and calls us to examine our own hearts. Are we being swept along with the spirit of the age, or are we being transformed by the Spirit of Christ?

## Appeal

> _"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's."_ (Philippians 2:21)

This is a sweeping indictment—"all seek their own." But it need not be true of you today.

The love of Christ can break every chain. The One who emptied Himself for you can fill you with His self-emptying love. The cross that condemned selfishness can become the place where your selfishness dies.

Will you come to that cross today? Will you surrender the self-life that can never satisfy, and receive in its place the Christ-life that overflows with joy?

> _"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."_ (Galatians 2:20)

This is the exchange heaven offers: my selfishness for His love, my grasping for His giving, my self-seeking for His self-sacrifice. And it begins with a simple surrender:

"Lord, I give You my selfish heart. I cannot change it, but You can. Let the love of Christ constrain me. Let me live no longer to myself, but to Him who died for me and rose again. Amen."
