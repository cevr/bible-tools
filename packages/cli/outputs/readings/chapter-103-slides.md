## Slide 1 – Q1: Created Condition of Man

- **Question:** In what condition was man created?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:6, 7 – “What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or
  the son of man, that Thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little lower than
  the angels.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points & Faith Connection

- **Created Lower:** Man was created with dignity and crowned with honor, but
  distinct from angels.
- **Dependent Nature:** unlike God, man is not self-existent; unlike angels, he
  is of the earth.
- **Innocent but Mutable:** Adam was perfect yet subject to change; he was not
  created with a nature that _could_ not sin or a life that _could_ not end.
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - Unfallen Adam needed God’s "visitation" to sustain him.
  - We possess no inherent power to sustain our own righteousness or life.
  - If innocent Adam was dependent, how much more does fallen man need the
    indwelling Christ!

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **Illustration: The Vine and the Branch**
- Jesus illustrated our condition in John 15.
- A branch is created to bear fruit, but it is "lower" than the vine stock
  because it has no root of its own.
- It must remain connected to the vine to live.
- **Lesson:** If Adam needed this connection before sin, we essentially need it
  now to produce any fruit of righteousness.

## Slide 4 – Q2: The Nature of Angels

- **Question:** What is the nature of angels?
- **Key Text:** Luke 20:35, 36 – “But they which shall be accounted worthy to
  obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are
  given in marriage; neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the
  angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.”

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points & Sanctuary Insight

- **Not Yet Equal:** Jesus highlights that humans are _not_ yet equal to angels.
  - Angels cannot die (by natural decay) and are spirits who do not procreate.
  - Humans currently marry and are subject to death.
- **Future Equality:** We only become "equal unto the angels" (deathless)
  **after** the resurrection.
- **Sanctuary Insight:**
  - The judgment determines who is "accounted worthy."
  - This worthiness is not based on our merits, but on Christ’s merits credited
    to us (Justification) and the Spirit’s work in us (Sanctification).

## Slide 6 – Q3: Definition of Angels

- **Question:** What are angels called?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 1:7 – “And of the angels he saith, Who maketh His angels
  spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.”

## Slide 7 – Q3: Key Points

- **Nature (Spirits):** Angels are non-corporeal spirit beings, described as a
  "flame of fire" (pure, powerful, swift).
- **Function (Ministers):** They are servants sent to minister _for_ the heirs
  of salvation.
  - Hebrews 1:14 – “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
    for them who shall be heirs of salvation?”
- **Contrast:** Angels are "spirits"; Man was formed of dust (Genesis 2:7) and
  _is_ a soul.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Illustration

- **Illustration: The Messenger and the Message**
- A King has swift messengers (angels) who carry decrees to distant provinces.
- The citizens (humans) live on the land and till the soil.
- **Lesson:** We must not confuse the nature of the messenger (spirit) with the
  nature of the citizen (flesh and blood).

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Two Adams

- **Question:** What is the difference between the two Adams?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:45 – “And so it is written, The first man Adam
  was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Key Points & Gospel Connection

- **The First Adam (Living Soul):**
  - Natural, earthly, father of the race.
  - Disobedience brought death.
  - Could not _give_ life to others once disconnected from God.
- **The Last Adam (Christ):**
  - A "quickening spirit" (meaning "to make alive").
  - John 5:21 – “For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them;
    even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.”
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:**
  - We are born into the family of Adam 1 (heirs of death).
  - To be saved, we must be "born again" into the family of Adam 2 (Christ).
  - Christ does not just _have_ life; He _is_ the source that revives the dead
    sinner (Ephesians 2:1, 5).

## Slide 11 – Q5: Was Adam Spiritual?

- **Question:** Adam was made a living soul; but was he not a spiritual man?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:46 – “Howbeit that was not first which is
  spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.”

## Slide 12 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Sequence:** Natural first, then Spiritual.
- **Natural:** Adam had a natural body, dependent on food/breath, and was on
  probation.
- **Spiritual:** The higher order of imperishable life brought by Christ.
- **Transformation:** We start as natural men and must be transformed.
  - Romans 8:9 – “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that
    the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
    Christ, he is none of his.”

## Slide 13 – Q6: When Man Becomes Spiritual

- **Question:** When does man become a spiritual being?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:44 – “It is sown a natural body, it is raised a
  spiritual body, There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.”

## Slide 14 – Q6: Key Points

- **Timing:** Man becomes a "spiritual being" in the fullest sense **at the
  resurrection**.
- **Sown Natural:** We die with a body subject to decay.
- **Raised Spiritual:** We are raised with a body fitted for eternal life.
- **Clarification:** We must be spiritually _minded_ now (Romans 8:6), but we
  await the redemption of our physical bodies.
  - Romans 8:23 – “And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the
    firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
    for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.”

## Slide 15 – Q7: The Meaning of Sowing

- **Question:** To what does the sowing refer?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:36 – “That which thou sowest is not quickened,
  except it die.”

## Slide 16 – Q7: Key Points

- **Death as Sowing:** The "sowing" refers to death and burial.
- **Necessity:** Just as a seed must die in the ground to produce a stalk, our
  mortal bodies must be laid down to receive the immortal body.
- **Hope:** The grave is not a place of hopelessness, but a furrow where the
  seed is planted for the Resurrection morning.

## Slide 17 – Q7: Illustration

- **Illustration: The Grain of Wheat**
- A dry grain of wheat on a shelf remains a dry seed.
- When buried, it seems lost, but from that "death" comes a vibrant green stalk.
- **Lesson:** We die in weakness; we are raised in power.

## Slide 18 – Q8: Man’s Defined Nature

- **Question:** How is man's nature defined?
- **Key Text:** Job 4:17 – “Shall mortal man be more just than God?”

## Slide 19 – Q8: Key Points & Application

- **Mortal:** Means "subject to death" or "perishable."
- **No Immortal Soul:** The Bible never uses the phrase "immortal soul." Man is
  a candidate for immortality, not a possessor of it.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Acknowledging mortality creates humility.
  - Psalm 39:4 – “Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
    what it is; that I may know how frail I am.”
  - We trust His strength, not our own permanence.

## Slide 20 – Q9: God’s Nature

- **Question:** What is God's nature?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 1:17 – “Now unto the King, eternal, immortal,
  invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.”

## Slide 21 – Q9: Key Points

- **Immortal:** Means "deathless" and "having life in oneself."
- **Attribute of Deity:** Immortality belongs to God just as omnipotence does.
- **The Source:** God alone is the Fountain of Life.
  - Psalm 36:9 – “For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we
    see light.”

## Slide 22 – Q10: Man’s Formation

- **Question:** Of what was man formed in the beginning?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:7 – “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the
  ground.”

## Slide 23 – Q10: Key Points

- **Material Origin:** We are composed of the elements of the earth.
- **Humility:** There is no "divine spark" or uncreated entity naturally inside
  man.
- **Potter and Clay:**
  - Isaiah 64:8 – “But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and
    thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.”
  - Genesis 3:19 – “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
    return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art,
    and unto dust shalt thou return.”

## Slide 24 – Q11: Becoming a Living Soul

- **Question:** What act made him a living soul?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 2:7 – “And [God] breathed into his nostrils the breath
  of life; and man became a living soul.”

## Slide 25 – Q11: Key Points

- **The Process:**
  1. Form (Dust/Body)
  2. Breath (Spirit/Life Force)
- **The Result:** Man _BECAME_ a living soul.
- **Crucial Distinction:** Man was not "given" a soul as a separate entity; he
  _is_ a soul (a living person) as long as body and breath are united.

## Slide 26 – Q11: Illustration

- **Illustration: The Wooden Box**
- Boards + Nails = A Box.
- If you pull the nails out, where does the "box" go? It simply ceases to be.
- **Lesson:** Soul = Body + Breath.
- Death (Dust minus Breath) = Dead Soul (or corpse).

## Slide 27 – Q12: Other Living Souls

- **Question:** Are others besides man called "living souls" in the Bible?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 16:3 – “And the second angel poured out his vial upon
  the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died
  in the sea.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Key Points

- **Biblical Usage:** The term "living soul" (_nephesh chayyah_) applies to
  animals.
  - See Genesis 1:30 (margin).
- **Implication:** Possessing a "soul" does not prove immortality, for animals
  are souls and they die.
- **The Real Difference:** Man is made in the **image of God** and offered
  eternal life through Christ; animals are not.

## Slide 29 – Q13: Breath of Life in Creatures

- **Question:** Do other creatures besides man have the "breath of life?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 7:21, 22 – “And all flesh died that moved upon the
  earth... and every man; all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all
  that was in the dry land, died.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: Key Points

- **Universal Life Force:** The "breath of life" (_Ruach_ or _Neshamah_) is
  found in all air-breathing creatures.
- **God as Author:** It is the biological spark powering lungs and heart for
  both man and beast.

## Slide 31 – Q14: Comparison of Breath

- **Question:** Is theirs the same breath as man’s?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 3:19 – “As the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea,
  they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast;
  for all is vanity.”

## Slide 32 – Q14: Key Points

- **One Breath:** Physiologically, the life force is the same.
- **No Pre-eminence:** Both breathe air, both die when breath ceases, both
  return to dust.
- **Man's Superiority:** Lies in purpose and destiny (redemption), not in
  possessing a different kind of "spirit" that survives death naturally.

## Slide 33 – Q15: Breath in the Nostrils

- **Question:** The breath of life from God was breathed into man's nostrils in
  the beginning. What does Job call that which is in the nostrils?
- **Key Text:** Job 27:3 – “All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of
  God is in my nostrils.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Key Points

- **Interchangeable Terms:** Job uses "breath" and "spirit" interchangeably.
- **Definition:** "Spirit" (_Ruach_) here refers to the "breath of life" given
  by God.
- It is the invisible energy of life, not a disembodied ghost.

## Slide 35 – Q16: The Spirit at Death

- **Question:** When man gives up the spirit, what becomes of it?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 12:7 – “Then shall the dust return to the earth as
  it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.”

## Slide 36 – Q16: Key Points & Judgment

- **Reversal of Creation:**
  - Dust returns to earth (decomposition).
  - Spirit (Breath of Life) returns to God.
- **Universal:** This applies to all men and animals; it is the power of life
  returning to the Source.
- **Judgment Context:** The person "sleeps" in the dust, but their character
  record is preserved in Heaven for the Judgment.

## Slide 37 – Q16: Illustration

- **Illustration: The Electric Light**
- When the switch is turned off, the light goes out.
- The electricity returns to the power source. The bulb remains dark.
- The "light" doesn't go anywhere—it ceases to exist until the switch is flipped
  again.
- **Lesson:** At death, the power of life returns to God; the person waits for
  the Resurrection.

## Slide 38 – Q17: Life Only in Christ

- **Question:** Can one have the spirit of life with him eternally, unless he
  has Christ?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 5:12 – “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath
  not the Son of God hath not life.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Key Points & RBF

- **The Test:** Life is not intrinsic to man; it is in the Son.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - If man were naturally immortal, he wouldn't need Christ for existence, only
    for happiness.
  - Christ's death buys back our existence.
  - Justification is the title to this life; Sanctification is the fitness for
    it.

## Slide 40 – Q18: Barred from the Tree

- **Question:** Why were the first guilty pair driven from the tree of life?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 3:22 – “And now, lest he put forth his hand, and take
  also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.”

## Slide 41 – Q18: Key Points

- **Preventing Immortal Sin:**
  - God drove them out to prevent the existence of "immortal sinners."
  - Eternal life in a state of rebellion would be an eternal hell.
- **Mercy in Judgment:** God blocked the way so that death could eventually
  limit the misery of sin.

## Slide 42 – Q19: The Guarded Way

- **Question:** What was done to keep man away from the tree of life?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 3:24 – “So He drove out the man; and He placed at the
  east of the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every
  way, to keep the way of the tree of life.”

## Slide 43 – Q19: Key Points

- **The Barrier:** Cherubim and a flaming sword (Divine Justice) barred the way.
- **The Solution:** Natural man has no access.
- **The Cross:** Access is restored only through the breaking of the body and
  shedding of the blood which the sword of justice fell upon—Jesus Christ.

## Slide 44 – Q20: Man’s Natural State

- **Question:** How are all men in the natural state regarded?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:3 – “We all... were by nature the children of wrath,
  even as others.”

## Slide 45 – Q20: Key Points

- **Children of Wrath:** Born of Adam, we are legally subject to the broken
  law's penalty.
- **Natural Tendency:**
  - Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
    subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.”
- **Need for Rescue:** We do not possess a saving spark; we need a Savior.

## Slide 46 – Q21: Effect of God's Wrath

- **Question:** If the wrath of God abides on a person, of what does it deprive
  him?
- **Key Text:** John 3:36 – “He that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
  but the wrath of God abideth on him.”

## Slide 47 – Q21: Key Points & Sanctuary

- **Deprivation of Life:** The sinner "shall not see life."
- **Conditional Immortality:** The punishment is not eternal life in torment,
  but the loss of life (eternal death).
- **Sanctuary Truth:** Sin cannot exist in the presence of a holy God. His
  "wrath" is His consuming purity reacting against sin.

## Slide 48 – Q22: Saved from Wrath

- **Question:** Through whom is the sinner saved from wrath?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:9 – “Much more then, being now justified by His blood,
  we shall be saved from wrath through Him.”

## Slide 49 – Q22: Key Points & RBF

- **Saved Through Jesus:**
  - **Justification:** We are declared righteous because Christ took the death
    penalty that belonged to us.
  - **Substitution:** He died our death that we might live His life.
- **Faith Emphasis:** We are not saved by making ourselves good, but by being
  "justified by His blood."

## Slide 50 – Q23: The Believer's Prospect

- **Question:** When the sinner has been converted, what then is his prospect
  for life?
- **Key Text:** Colossians 3:3, 4 – “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with
  Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
  appear with Him in glory.”

## Slide 51 – Q23: Key Points

- **Hid with Christ:**
  - Legally "dead" to the old self.
  - Title to eternal life is secured in the Sanctuary above.
- **Future Hope:** We do not yet possess immortality in our bodies, but will
  receive it when Christ appears.

## Slide 52 – Q23: Illustration

- **Illustration: The Deposit**
- A father deposits money for a child in a bank.
- The child is rich, but the wealth is "hid" (safe) until maturity.
- **Lesson:** Our immortality is deposited in Christ, safe from the enemy,
  waiting for the Day of the Lord.

## Slide 53 – Q24: Immortality Restricted

- **Question:** The word immortal occurs but once in the English Bible (1 Tim.
  1:17), and is there applied to God; is any other said to have immortality?
- **Key Text:** 1 Timothy 6:15, 16 – “Who is the blessed and only potentate, the
  King of kings and Lord of lords: who only hath immortality.”

## Slide 54 – Q24: Key Points

- **God Only:** Scripture is emphatic that God "ONLY hath immortality."
- **Refutation:** This refutes the idea of the "natural immortality of the
  soul."
- **Conclusion:** Since God only has it, man can only obtain it by union with
  God.

## Slide 55 – Q25: Brought to Light

- **Question:** How is this desirable boon brought to light?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 1:10 – “But is now made manifest by the appearing of
  our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and
  immortality to light through the gospel.”

## Slide 56 – Q25: Key Points

- **Through the Gospel:** Immortality is not a natural fact but a revelation of
  the Good News.
- **Abolished Death:** Jesus broke death's permanent hold to offer eternal life
  as a gift of grace.

## Slide 57 – Q26: Obtaining Immortality

- **Question:** How does man obtain immortality?
- **Key Text:** Romans 2:7 – “To them who by patient continuance in well doing
  seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life.”

## Slide 58 – Q26: Key Points & Faith

- **Seeking:** We do not seek for what we already have. We must seek immortality
  because we are born mortal.
- **Method:** "Patient continuance in well doing."
- **Faith Connection:** This is faith that works by love.
  - Galatians 5:6 – “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any
    thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”

## Slide 59 – Q27: Receiving Immortality

- **Question:** When will the faithful receive immortality?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:51, 52 – “Behold, I show you a mystery: We
  shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the
  twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the trumpet shall sound, and the
  dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”

## Slide 60 – Q27: Key Points

- **At the Last Trump:** Immortality is given at the Second Coming.
- **The Dead:** Raised incorruptible.
- **The Living:** Changed from mortal to immortal.
- **Current State:** Until that moment, the dead sleep and the living are
  mortal.

## Slide 61 – Q28: Victory Over Death

- **Question:** What is then to be swallowed up?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:54 – “So when this corruptible shall have put
  on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be
  brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.”

## Slide 62 – Q28: Key Points

- **Victory:** Death is finally defeated.
- **The Exchange:** We trade the "rags" of corruptibility for the "robes" of
  immortality.

## Slide 63 – Q29: The Source of Victory

- **Question:** How is this victory gained?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:57 – “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the
  victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 64 – Q29: Conclusion & Appeal

- **A Gift:** We do not conquer death; Christ conquered it for us.
- **Summary:**
  - This doctrine magnifies Christ and strips man of pride.
  - Christ pleads His blood to give life to those who forfeited it.
  - To have Him is to have everything.
- **Appeal:** Deuteronomy 30:19 – “I call heaven and earth to record this day
  against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:
  therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.”
