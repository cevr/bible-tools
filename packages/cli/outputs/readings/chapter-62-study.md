# Bible Study: The Manner of Christ's Coming

## Introduction

The second coming of Jesus Christ stands as the "blessed hope" of every believer—the climactic event toward which all sacred history moves. Yet how will Christ return? Will it be secret or visible? Spiritual or literal? The Bible answers these questions with unmistakable clarity, revealing a coming so glorious, so overwhelming, that no human eye will miss it. Understanding the _manner_ of Christ's return guards us against deception and kindles our hearts with eager anticipation.

## Core Truths

### A Promise for Those Who Watch

The Christian faith is inseparably linked to expectation. We are not merely forgiven sinners; we are _waiting_ people:

> _"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation."_ (Hebrews 9:28)

Notice the connection: Christ's _first_ coming dealt with sin's penalty at the cross; His _second_ coming will bring final deliverance—"without sin unto salvation." This is not merely rescue _from_ sin's consequences, but the completion of God's work _in_ us. Those who "look for Him" are those whose hearts are prepared, whose lives are oriented toward heaven.

**Every person will be rewarded according to their works:**

> _"For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every man according to his works."_ (Matthew 16:27)

[DYK🔎] The Greek word translated "reward" (_apodidōmi_) means "to give back, to render what is due." Christ comes not merely to rescue but to _settle accounts_—to vindicate the righteous and execute judgment upon the wicked. This is not salvation by works, but the demonstration that genuine faith produces a transformed life (James 2:17-18).

### Death Is Not the Second Coming

A common misunderstanding, even among the early disciples, confused death with Christ's return:

> _"Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?"_ (John 21:23)

The disciples themselves recognized that Christ's "coming" was something _distinct_ from death. If death were the second coming, then John's possible survival until Christ returned would be meaningless—for John would simply die and "meet Christ" that way regardless.

[Q] **"Don't believers go to be with Christ at death? Isn't that essentially His coming for them?"**

Scripture does teach that death for the believer is a "sleep" in Christ (1 Thessalonians 4:13-14), a restful unconsciousness until the resurrection. But the _second coming_ is a cosmic, visible, bodily event—not an individual, invisible, spiritual experience. Paul longed not merely for death, but for the resurrection at Christ's appearing (Philippians 3:20-21; 2 Timothy 4:8). The distinction matters: the dead saints await the _same event_ the living saints await—the glorious return.

### A Literal, Visible, Personal Return

The manner of Christ's departure determines the manner of His return:

> _"This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven."_ (Acts 1:11)

Consider what the disciples witnessed:

- A **literal, bodily** Jesus ascending
- **Visibly**, "while they beheld"
- **Upward**, into the clouds of heaven
- **Personally**—"this same Jesus"

His return will mirror His departure: literal, bodily, visible, personal, and accompanied by clouds.

> _"Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him."_ (Revelation 1:7)

[DYK🔎] The phrase "every eye shall see Him" uses the Greek _pas ophthalmos_—literally, "all eyes." This universal visibility refutes any notion of a secret rapture or invisible spiritual coming. Even those who crucified Him—representing the wicked of all ages—will witness His return.

[ILL] Imagine the rising sun. No one needs to announce it or point it out. From the highest mountain to the lowest valley, its light fills the sky. So shall be the coming of the Son of man: _"For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be"_ (Matthew 24:27). There will be no hidden corners, no secret arrivals. Every human being—living or resurrected—will behold His glory.

## Deeper Truths

### The Sounds of Heaven

Christ's coming will not be silent:

> _"The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

Three sounds accompany His descent:

1. **A shout**—the commanding voice of the King of kings
2. **The voice of the archangel**—Michael, who is Christ Himself (see Jude 9; Daniel 12:1; John 5:28-29)
3. **The trump of God**—the resurrection trumpet that shatters death's dominion

> _"The trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."_ (1 Corinthians 15:52)

[Q] **"Who is Michael the archangel? Is Jesus really an angel?"**

The name "Michael" means "Who is like God?"—a fitting title for Christ, who is the express image of the Father (Hebrews 1:3). In Jude 9, Michael disputes with Satan over Moses' body—and Moses was resurrected (Matthew 17:3). In Daniel 12:1, Michael "stands up" to deliver God's people at the end of time. In John 5:28-29, Jesus declares that the dead will hear _His voice_ and come forth. The "archangel" is not a created being but the Commander of heaven's hosts—Christ Himself.

### The Resurrection: Hope of the Ages

The saints of old did not expect to receive their reward at death:

> _"And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."_ (Hebrews 11:39-40)

Abraham, Moses, David, Daniel—none of them have yet received the promised inheritance. They sleep in their graves, awaiting the resurrection morning when _together_ with the living saints they will be "made perfect." This corporate redemption reveals God's beautiful purpose: no one enters heaven alone. The family of God will be gathered _together_ at Christ's return.

**Job's triumphant hope:**

> _"For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God."_ (Job 19:25-26)

Even in the depths of suffering, Job clung not to the hope of death but to the hope of _resurrection_—of seeing God "in my flesh," with his own eyes, "at the latter day."

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "Redeemer" in Job 19:25 is _goel_—the kinsman-redeemer who had the right and responsibility to buy back a relative's lost inheritance and avenge their blood. Christ is our _Goel_: He has the right (as our Brother, Hebrews 2:11-14) to redeem us from the grave and avenge us against the great enemy, death.

### The Glory of His Appearing

Scripture labors to describe the indescribable brightness of Christ's return:

**Christ's transfigured glory:**

> _"His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was white as the light."_ (Matthew 17:2)

**The glory of angels:**

> _"His face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass."_ (Daniel 10:6)

**The glory of the Father:**

> _"As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord."_ (Ezekiel 1:28)

When Christ returns, He comes in _threefold glory_:

> _"When He shall come in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels."_ (Luke 9:26)

[ILL] When ancient Israel camped at Sinai, the glory of God upon the mountain was so overwhelming that even the animals were forbidden to touch it, and Moses himself trembled with fear (Hebrews 12:21). Yet that was but a veiled manifestation. At Christ's return, the full, unveiled glory of heaven will stream across the sky—ten thousand times ten thousand angels, each blazing with celestial fire, surrounding the Son of man whose countenance outshines the sun. No wonder the wicked cry for the rocks and mountains to hide them (Revelation 6:15-17).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

Christ's second coming is the _culmination_ of His high priestly ministry in the heavenly sanctuary:

- In the **outer court** (the cross), Christ offered Himself as the sacrifice for sin—"once offered to bear the sins of many" (Hebrews 9:28).
- In the **holy place**, Christ has ministered His blood on behalf of repentant sinners, interceding for their forgiveness and transformation.
- In the **Most Holy Place**, Christ now conducts the investigative judgment (Daniel 7:9-14), the antitypical Day of Atonement, determining who has truly accepted His righteousness.

When this work is complete—when every case has been decided—Christ lays aside His priestly garments and puts on His kingly robes. He "comes out" of the sanctuary (as the high priest emerged on the Day of Atonement) to bless His waiting people with final salvation.

> _"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation."_ (Hebrews 9:28)

The phrase "without sin" (_chōris hamartias_) means Christ comes no longer to deal with sin as a priest but to deliver His people as a King. The sin question has been settled. The atonement is complete. He comes to claim His own.

### The Great Controversy's Climax

From Eden to Patmos, the conflict between Christ and Satan has raged over one central question: _Who is worthy of worship and trust?_ Satan has accused God of injustice; he has deceived humanity into rebellion; he has persecuted the faithful through the ages.

At Christ's return, every question is answered. The universe beholds:

- The **faithfulness** of those who loved not their lives unto death
- The **justice** of God in rewarding the righteous and judging the wicked
- The **love** of Christ, who gave Himself for sinners and now welcomes them home

Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of this day:

> _"Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all."_ (Jude 14-15)

Daniel saw it in vision:

> _"At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people... and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book."_ (Daniel 12:1)

The "standing up" of Michael signals the close of probation—the end of intercession. What follows is deliverance for those whose names remain in the Lamb's book of life, and destruction for those who have rejected mercy.

### Righteousness by Faith and Readiness

How shall we be ready for such a coming? Not by fearful striving, but by faithful resting in Christ's finished work _and_ His ongoing sanctifying power.

Paul, facing execution in Rome, did not despair:

> _"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing."_ (2 Timothy 4:8)

Notice: the crown is given to those who "love His appearing." To love Christ's coming is to love Christ Himself—to long for His presence, to yearn for sin's end, to desire complete restoration to God's image.

John reveals the transforming power of this hope:

> _"We know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is."_ (1 John 3:2)

And then adds:

> _"Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure."_ (1 John 3:3)

The hope of Christ's return is not passive waiting but active preparation. Yet even our purification is Christ's work in us: _"Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it"_ (1 Thessalonians 5:24).

[Q] **"How can I be ready when I still struggle with sin?"**

The key is not sinless perfection achieved by human effort, but honest surrender to Christ's sanctifying grace. The investigative judgment examines not whether we are perfect, but whether we are _in Christ_—whether we have accepted His righteousness as our own and allowed His Spirit to transform our characters. Those who are trusting in Christ moment by moment, confessing and forsaking known sins, growing in grace—these are "looking for Him" and will "appear the second time without sin unto salvation."

## Practical Application

### Living in Light of His Coming

1. **Guard against deception.** Jesus warned that false christs and false prophets would arise, claiming secret comings or hidden appearances (Matthew 24:23-26). Knowing that Christ's return is _visible, audible, and unmistakable_ protects us from every counterfeit.

2. **Cultivate watchfulness.** "Watch and pray" was Christ's repeated counsel (Mark 13:33-37). This means staying spiritually alert through daily communion with God—Bible study, prayer, and obedience—so that day does not overtake us as a thief.

3. **Cherish the hope.** Paul calls Christ's return "the blessed hope" (Titus 2:13). Let it be blessed to you! When trials press, remember: "Yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry" (Hebrews 10:37).

4. **Share the message.** If Christ's return is certain, glorious, and soon, then the world must know. The three angels' messages (Revelation 14:6-12) are God's final warning and invitation. We are called not only to wait for Him but to _hasten_ His coming by proclaiming the gospel (Matthew 24:14; 2 Peter 3:11-12).

5. **Let hope purify.** Every day, ask the Spirit to search your heart. Confess known sins. Claim victory through Christ's indwelling power. "He that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure" (1 John 3:3).

## Appeal

_"Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."_ (Matthew 25:34)

From before the foundation of the world, God prepared a kingdom for you. Before you were born, before you had done good or evil, before you even knew there was a Saviour, Christ loved you and longed to welcome you home.

The question is not whether He will come—_He will_. The question is whether you will be ready. Will you hear those words, "Come, ye blessed"? Or will you be among those who cry for the rocks and mountains to hide them from His face?

Today, if you hear His voice, harden not your heart. Surrender every idol. Confess every sin. Trust wholly in His righteousness. And lift up your head, for your redemption draws near.

Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
