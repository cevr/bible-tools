### Q1. How much is included in the seventh commandment?

**"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit
adultery; but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after
her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." Matt. 5:27, 28.**

**Answer:**

Here Christ, the great Lawgiver, magnifies the law and makes it honorable
(Isaiah 42:21). In the Sermon on the Mount, He dispels the Pharisaic notion that
God’s law regulates only the outward actions.

1.  **The Spirituality of the Law:** The seventh commandment, "Thou shalt not
    commit adultery," extends beyond the physical act of illicit union. It
    reaches into the secret chambers of the soul—the motives, the desires, and
    the imagination.
2.  **The Seat of Sin:** Jesus identifies the "heart" as the true battleground.
    If the desire to sin is cherished and rolled under the tongue as a sweet
    morsel, the man is guilty before God, even if lack of opportunity prevents
    the physical act.
3.  **The Need for a New Heart:** This high standard drives us to the
    realization that we cannot keep the law in our own strength. A heart that
    naturally produces lust cannot simply "try harder." We need the **New
    Covenant** promise: "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in
    their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).
    - _Justification:_ Forgives the past acts and sinful thoughts.
    - _Sanctification:_ Changes the heart so that it no longer loves impurity.

**[ILL]** A man may have a garden full of weeds. He can cut the tops of the
weeds off with a mower (outward behavior modification), and the garden looks
clean for a day. But the roots remain, and soon the weeds return. The seventh
commandment, as explained by Jesus, demands the digging out of the root. Only
the Holy Spirit can pull the root of lust from the soil of the heart.

### Q2. What are the people of God exhorted to omit?

**"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once
named among you, as becometh saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking,
nor jesting, which are not convenient; but rather giving of thanks." Eph.
5:3, 4.**

**Answer:**

The Apostle Paul provides a specific list of behaviors that are incompatible
with the life of a "saint" (a set-apart one).

1.  **Fornication (Greek: _Porneia_):** This covers all forms of illicit sexual
    activity outside the marriage covenant between a man and a woman.
2.  **All Uncleanness:** Moral impurity in thought, word, or action. It refers
    to anything that defiles the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19).
3.  **Covetousness:** Paul links sexual impurity with covetousness (idolatry).
    Both are a greedy desire to possess something God has not given, to satisfy
    self at the expense of God's law.
4.  **Foolish Talking and Jesting:** This refers to coarse humor, double
    entendres, and levity that lowers the standard of dignity and reverence. A
    Christian’s speech should minister grace, not cheapen the soul.
5.  **"Not Once Named":** The standard is absolute. These things should not even
    be a topic of casual conversation or entertainment among God's remnant
    people.

**Definition:**

- **Sanctification:** The process of being made holy. It involves a separation
  from the world’s low standards and a dedication to God's high standard of
  purity.

### Q3. What does the apostle class this inclination?

**"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery,
fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness." Gal. 5:19.**

**Answer:**

Paul classifies these sins as "works of the flesh."

1.  **The Two Natures:** The Bible presents a conflict between the "flesh" (our
    fallen, sinful nature inherited from Adam) and the "Spirit" (the new nature
    imparted by Christ).
    - The flesh naturally gravitates toward self-indulgence and sensory
      pleasure.
    - The Spirit gravitates toward holiness and the law of God (Romans 8:7).
2.  **Manifest Works:** These sins are the visible fruit of an unconverted or
    carnal nature. They are "manifest"—obvious evidence that the self-life is
    still on the throne.
3.  **Righteousness by Faith:** We cannot overcome the "flesh" by using the
    energy of the flesh (willpower alone). Victory comes only when we are
    "crucified with Christ" (Galatians 2:20) and allow His Spirit to live out
    His pure life through us.

**[ILL]** Imagine a heavy stone. By nature, it falls downward due to gravity.
You can hold it up with your hand, but eventually, your arm will tire, and it
will fall. This is human effort trying to suppress lust. But if you place the
stone on a strong table, it stays up without effort. The "table" is Christ.
Resting on Him by faith breaks the law of gravity (sin and death) with a higher
law (the Spirit of life).

### Q4. Of what will those who are guilty in this direction be deprived?

**"I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not
inherit the kingdom of God." Gal. 5:21.**

**Answer:**

The warning is solemn and explicit: those who _practice_ (continue in, without
repentance) these sins will be excluded from heaven.

1.  **The Character of the Kingdom:** The New Jerusalem is a place of perfect
    purity. "And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth"
    (Revelation 21:27). God does not arbitrarily bar people; rather, a person
    who loves "filthiness" would be miserable in the pure atmosphere of heaven.
2.  **A Call to Examine Ourselves:** This verse destroys the false doctrine of
    "once saved, always saved." A profession of faith that does not lead to a
    departure from iniquity is a false profession.
3.  **The Necessity of Cleansing:** Because no impurity can inherit the kingdom,
    we must accept the work of our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary _now_
    to blot out not only the record of our sins but the love of sin from our
    hearts.

---

### Q5. If one professing godliness is known to be impure, what is our duty regarding Him?

**"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is
called a brother be a fornicator." 1 Cor. 5:11.**

**Answer:**

This text outlines the necessity of church discipline and social separation for
the health of the body.

1.  **"Called a Brother":** This instruction applies specifically to those
    within the church who profess to follow Christ yet live in open rebellion
    against His law.
2.  **Not to Keep Company:** We are not to treat such a person with the intimate
    fellowship of brotherhood. To do so would:
    - Condone their sin.
    - Deceive them into thinking they are saved while living in sin.
    - Leaven the whole lump (church) with their influence (1 Corinthians 5:6).
3.  **Purpose of Discipline:** The goal is not cruelty, but restoration. By
    withdrawing fellowship, the church hopes the sinner will realize the gravity
    of their condition, repent, and return to the Lord (1 Corinthians 5:5).

---

### Q6. If one received evil communications, how will they affect him?

**"Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners." 1 Cor. 15:33.**

**Answer:**

The word "communications" here implies companionship, associations, and
conversation.

1.  **The Law of Assimilation:** By beholding, we become changed (2 Corinthians
    3:18). It is a spiritual impossibility to surround oneself with impure
    friends, literature, or entertainment and remain pure in heart.
2.  **"Be Not Deceived":** Many young people (and adults) think, "I am strong
    enough to handle it; I won't be influenced." The Bible calls this
    self-deception. Even the strongest morals will eventually erode under the
    constant dripping of impure suggestions.
3.  **Practical Application:** In our day, "communications" includes the books
    we read, the music we listen to, and the media we watch. If these sources
    glorify lust ("sowing wild oats"), they corrupt the "good manners" of the
    Christian.

**[ILL]** If you take a basket of fresh, healthy apples and place one rotten
apple in the center, the healthy apples will never heal the rotten one. Instead,
the rot will spread to the healthy ones. So it is with the contagion of social
impurity.

### Q7. When a person allows corrupt thoughts to be sown in his heart, what may he expect to reap?

**"Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall
he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life
everlasting." Gal. 6:7, 8.**

**Answer:**

Here is the immutable law of the harvest in the spiritual world.

1.  **Thoughts are Seeds:** Every impure thought harbored, every lustful look,
    and every vulgar book read is a seed sown into the soil of the mind.
2.  **The Harvest is Inevitable:** You cannot sow thistle seeds and expect to
    harvest wheat. You cannot sow lust and expect to harvest a character of
    holiness.
3.  **Reaping Corruption:** To sow to the flesh results in moral decay
    ("corruption"). The mind becomes unable to relish spiritual things; the will
    becomes enslaved to appetite; and ultimately, the body and soul are
    destroyed.
4.  **Sowing to the Spirit:** This involves choosing to feed the mind with the
    Word of God, prayer, and holy service. This sowing results in the fruit of
    the Spirit and eternal life.

**Definition:**

- **The Great Controversy:** The battle between Christ and Satan is fought
  largely over the control of the human will. Sowing to the flesh hands the will
  to the enemy; sowing to the Spirit hands the will to Christ.

---

### Q8. What is even the thought of foolishness said to be?

**"The thought of foolishness is sin." Prov. 24:9.**

**Answer:**

This verse cuts to the very core of human pride.

1.  **The Standard of Judgment:** God judges not only the act but the intent. A
    "foolish" (morally deficient/wicked) thought is registered as sin in the
    books of heaven.
2.  **The Need for Atonement:** If even our thoughts are sinful, we see how
    utterly lost we are without a Savior. We need the blood of Christ to cover
    the sins of our mind, not just the sins of our hands.
3.  **A Call to Vigilance:** Since thoughts are sin, we must maintain a constant
    watch. We cannot afford to let the mind drift idly, for an idle mind is the
    devil's workshop.

---

### Q9. On what condition does God accept the sinner?

**"Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let
him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for
He will abundantly pardon." Isa. 55:7.**

**Answer:**

Here is the glorious promise of the Gospel (Righteousness by Faith).

1.  **The Condition:** There must be a "forsaking"—not just of the "way"
    (outward actions) but of the "thoughts" (internal desires). This is true
    repentance.
2.  **The Promise:** "He will abundantly pardon." God does not bear a grudge.
    When the sinner turns to Christ, desiring to be free from the slavery of
    lust, the Father runs to meet him (Luke 15).
3.  **Justification:** This is the legal act where God declares the penitent
    sinner righteous. The accumulated guilt of a lifetime of impure thoughts is
    washed away in a moment by the blood of Jesus.
4.  **Abundant Mercy:** God’s grace is greater than our sin (Romans 5:20). There
    is no stain so deep that Christ cannot wash it white as snow (Isaiah 1:18),
    provided the soul is willing to be cleansed.

---

### Q10. Where should one's thoughts be held?

**"And bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ." 2 Cor.
10:5.**

**Answer:**

The Christian warfare is mental warfare.

1.  **Captivity:** This implies force and authority. We must actively seize our
    wandering thoughts and bring them before the judgment seat of Christ.
2.  **Obedience of Christ:** We compare the thought with the life and law of
    Jesus. If the thought is not Christ-like, it is an intruder and an enemy.
3.  **How is this done?**
    - By the **Sword of the Spirit** (the Word of God). When Jesus was tempted,
      He quoted Scripture.
    - By **Prayer**. Crying out, "Lord, save me!" at the moment of temptation.
    - By **displacement**. We drive out bad thoughts by bringing in good ones
      (dwelling on Christ's love and sacrifice).

**[ILL]** A city under siege guards its gates. The watchman asks every traveler,
"Are you friend or foe?" If a foe, the gate is barred. Our mind is the city; the
senses are the gates. We must challenge every thought: "Are you from Christ or
from the flesh?"

---

### Q11. Does God know the thoughts?

**"Thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought
afar off." Ps. 139:2.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Omniscience:** Nothing is hidden from the eyes of Him with whom we have to
    do (Hebrews 4:13). God sees the secret fantasy as clearly as the public
    deed.
2.  **The Investigative Judgment:** In the sanctuary service, the High Priest
    examines the heart. Understanding that God is "looking on" should not just
    terrify us, but motivate us to keep our mental "house" clean. We should
    never invite into our minds a guest we would be ashamed for Jesus to see.
3.  **Comfort:** This is also a comfort to the struggling soul. God knows when
    we _reject_ a bad thought. He knows the struggle and the desire to be pure,
    even when we are tempted. He sympathizes with our infirmities.

---

### Q12. Then how should one treat him who indulges in low, impure conversation?

**"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather
reprove them. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of
them in secret." Eph. 5:11, 12.**

**Answer:**

1.  **No Fellowship:** We cannot laugh at the dirty joke or nod along with the
    gossip and remain guiltless. Silence is often interpreted as consent.
2.  **Reprove Them:** This requires moral courage. It may be a verbal rebuke, or
    it may be the silent rebuke of walking away or changing the subject to
    something noble.
3.  **"It is a Shame":** Some sins are so degrading they should not be described
    in detail. We must avoid a morbid curiosity about the "secrets" of the
    wicked world.

---

### Q13. In conversation, against what should one be strenuously guarded?

**"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is
good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers." Eph.
4:29.**

**Answer:**

1.  **Corrupt Communication:** The Greek word used here refers to rotten fruit.
    Impure speech is evidence of a rotting soul.
2.  **Edifying:** The goal of Christian speech is to "build up" (edify) others.
3.  **Ministering Grace:** Our words should be a vehicle for God’s grace. When
    we speak purity, truth, and kindness, we actually impart spiritual strength
    to those listening.
4.  **The Test:** Before speaking, ask: "Will this joke, story, or comment make
    it easier for my brother to love Jesus and keep His commandments?" If not,
    it is likely corrupt.

---

### Q14. What are the proper things to engage one's mind?

**"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest,
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are
lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if
there be any praise, think on these things." Phil. 4:8.**

**Answer:**

This is the divine "Replacement Principle."

1.  **Nature Abhors a Vacuum:** You cannot simply empty the mind of evil; you
    must fill it with good (Matthew 12:43-45).
2.  **The Menu for the Mind:** Paul gives us the diet for a healthy soul:
    - **True/Honest:** Reality as God sees it, not the fantasies of fiction.
    - **Just/Pure:** That which aligns with God’s law.
    - **Lovely/Good Report:** That which inspires hope and gratitude.
3.  **The Result:** If we habitually think on these things, the "God of peace
    shall be with you" (Phil 4:9).
4.  **Sanctuary Connection:** In the Holy Place, the priest ate the Shewbread
    (representing Christ/The Word). By feeding our minds on Scripture and the
    character of Christ, we are sanctified.

---

### Q15. What is promised to the pure in heart?

**"Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God." Matt. 5:8.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Beatific Vision:** The ultimate reward of the saved is to see the face
    of God (Revelation 22:4).
2.  **Fitness for Heaven:** Only the pure _can_ see God. To the impure, the
    presence of a holy God would be a consuming fire. Purity of heart is the
    essential qualification for dwelling in the atmosphere of heaven.
3.  **Present Experience:** Even now, the pure in heart see God—they see His
    hand in nature, His love in providence, and His character in the Word. The
    impurity of sin blinds the spiritual eyesight; purity restores it.

**[ILL]** If you wear red-tinted glasses, everything looks red. If you wear
dirty, smeared glasses, everything looks obscure. A heart smeared with lust
cannot see the beauty of God’s holiness. When the Spirit cleans the lens (the
heart), we see God clearly.

---

### Q16. From what source come our words?

**"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of
the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Matt. 12:34.**

**Answer:**

1.  **The Heart is the Reservoir:** The mouth is merely the overflow valve. If
    the bucket is filled with bitter water, sweet water cannot spill out.
2.  **The Futility of Externalism:** It is useless to try to "clean up one's
    language" without cleaning up the heart. A man may suppress bad language for
    a time (social politeness), but under pressure, the true contents of the
    heart will spill out.
3.  **The Cure:** We must ask God for a new heart (Ezekiel 36:26). When Christ
    dwells within, the abundance of the heart becomes love, joy, and purity, and
    the tongue naturally speaks the language of Canaan.

---

### Q17. Of what will all give account in the day of judgment?

**"But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall
give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be
justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned." Matt. 12:36, 37.**

**Answer:**

This text brings us face to face with the Great Judgment.

1.  **Idle Words:** Not just open blasphemy, but "idle" (useless, barren,
    careless) words are recorded. This includes the "foolish talking" and impure
    jesting mentioned in Ephesians.
2.  **The Standard of Judgment:** Our words are an accurate index of our
    character. They testify whether we are servants of Christ or servants of
    self.
3.  **Justification/Condemnation:** This does not mean we are saved by the merit
    of our words. It means our words provide the _evidence_ of whether we have
    truly accepted the righteousness of Christ. A justified man, indwelt by the
    Spirit, will have a transformed tongue.
4.  **The Hope:** Is there hope for those who have spoken idle words? Yes! If we
    confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us (1 John 1:9). But we
    must not presume on grace. We must flee to the Cross, be washed, and then,
    by His grace, set a watch before our mouths (Psalm 141:3) for the remaining
    time.

**[ILL]** Imagine a courtroom where a tape recording of your every secret
conversation is played. We would all be condemned. But Jesus offers to erase the
tape with His blood and record a new song of praise in its place. This is the
power of the Gospel.
