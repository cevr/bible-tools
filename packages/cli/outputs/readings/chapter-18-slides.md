## Slide 1 – Q1: Necessity of Conversion

- Question: What is necessary to salvation?
- Key Text: Matthew 18:3 – “And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be
  converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
  of heaven.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: Key Points

- **An Absolute Condition:**
  - Jesus does not suggest conversion is merely helpful.
  - He declares it an indispensable condition for entrance into the kingdom.
- **A Radical Change:**
  - The human heart is naturally opposed to God (Jeremiah 17:9 – “The heart is
    deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?”).
  - The "natural man" is at enmity against God (Romans 8:7 – “Because the carnal
    mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
    indeed can be.”).
- **Humility Required:**
  - We must become “as little children,” realizing our helplessness and
    dependence.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Broken Clock:**
  - Imagine a clock with stripped gears and a snapped mainspring.
  - You can polish the glass and paint the hands, but it will not keep time.
  - **Lesson:** Outward polish (education, manners) cannot fix the broken
    “mainspring” of the heart. We must be remade from the inside out.

## Slide 4 – Q2: Defining Conversion

- Question: What is the general sense of the word "conversion?"
- Definition: “A turning or change from one state to another.” (Webster).
- Note: Water is converted to ice; rough fields are converted to gardens; man
  must be converted from sin to holiness.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Key Points

- **A Change of Masters:**
  - We are servants to whomever we obey (Romans 6:16 – “Know ye not, that to
    whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye
    obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”).
  - Conversion shifts allegiance from Self/Satan to Jesus Christ.
- **A Change of Nature:**
  - Like a rough field turned into a garden, weeds (sins) are uprooted and seeds
    of righteousness are planted.
- **Restoration:**
  - It restores the moral image of the Creator (Colossians 3:10 – “And have put
    on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that
    created him:”).

## Slide 6 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Caterpillar:**
  - A caterpillar crawls in the dust and eats leaves.
  - Through metamorphosis, it becomes a butterfly that flies in the air.
  - **Lesson:** It does not just crawl faster; it has a new nature. Conversion
    is the metamorphosis of the soul from the dust of sin to the atmosphere of
    grace.

## Slide 7 – Q3: Two Necessary Steps

- Question: What two steps are necessary to make this change?
- Key Text: Acts 20:20-21 – “And have taught you publicly, and from house to
  house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks repentance toward
  God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Key Points

- **Step 1: Repentance toward God:**
  - Why toward God? Because He is the Lawgiver whose law we broke (Psalm 51:4 –
    “Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy
    sight...”).
- **Step 2: Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ:**
  - Why toward Christ? He is the Mediator and Sacrifice who provides the remedy.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Repentance sees the debt; Faith grasps the payment.
  - We must turn _from_ sin (Repentance) and _to_ the Saviour (Faith).

## Slide 9 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Man in the Pit:**
  - A man falls into a deep pit. To be saved, two things must happen:
  - 1. He must stop digging deeper and look up (Repentance).
  - 2. He must grasp the rope thrown by the rescuer (Faith).
  - **Lesson:** He cannot grasp the rope if his hands are still busy digging in
    the mud.

## Slide 10 – Q4: Repentance and Blotting Out

- Question: Of what is it necessary to repent?
- Key Text: Acts 3:19 – “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins
  may be blotted out.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Key Points (Sanctuary Connection)

- **Directed at Sin:**
  - Repentance is not a vague feeling; it is turning from specific sins.
- **Sanctuary Theme – "Blotting Out":**
  - This language points to the cleansing of the Sanctuary.
  - In the Judgment, the record of sin is removed (Daniel 7:9-10 – “...the
    judgment was set, and the books were opened.”).
- **The Goal:**
  - Only sins that are repented of and forsaken can be blotted out by Christ's
    blood, preparing us to stand faultless (Revelation 14:5 – “And in their
    mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of
    God.”).

## Slide 12 – Q5: The Definition of Sin

- Question: What is sin?
- Key Text: 1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin, transgresseth also the law;
  for sin is the transgression of the law.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points

- **The Legal Definition:**
  - Sin is not just a mistake or weakness; it is _anomia_ (lawlessness).
- **The Standard:**
  - The law is the standard of righteousness (Psalm 119:172 – “My tongue shall
    speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.”).
- **Rebellion:**
  - To sin is to step across the boundary God set for human happiness.
  - We are not left to guess what pleases God; He has written it in His law.

## Slide 14 – Q6: Identify the Law

- Question: What law does one transgress when he sins?
- Key Text: James 2:9-11 – “But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin,
  and are convinced of the law as transgressors. For He that said, Do not commit
  adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou
  kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Moral Law (Ten Commandments):**
  - James quotes "Do not commit adultery" and "Do not kill," identifying the Ten
    Commandments (Exodus 20) as the standard.
- **The Unity of the Law:**
  - You cannot pick and choose. To break one link is to break the chain.
  - The authority of the Lawgiver is behind every single precept.

## Slide 16 – Q6: Illustration

- **The Moored Boat:**
  - A boat is held to the dock by a chain of ten links.
  - If nine links are solid steel but one breaks, the boat drifts away.
  - **Lesson:** It does not matter which link breaks; the separation from God is
    the same. Breaking any commandment separates the soul from the Creator.

## Slide 17 – Q7: The Law’s Function

- Question: What part does the law act in repentance?
- Key Text: Romans 3:20 – “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no
  flesh be justified in His sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Key Points (Law & Gospel)

- **The Knowledge of Sin:**
  - The law acts as a diagnostic tool. It reveals our condition but provides no
    cure.
- **Not a Method of Salvation:**
  - We cannot be saved by works of the law because we have already broken it.
  - Justification is a gift of grace (Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by
    his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:”).
- **The Schoolmaster:**
  - The law shuts our mouths and leads us to Christ (Galatians 3:24 – “Wherefore
    the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be
    justified by faith.”).

## Slide 19 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Mirror:**
  - A mirror shows a man his face is dirty, but he cannot wash his face with the
    mirror.
  - **Lesson:** The Law is the mirror that reveals the dirt of sin; Christ’s
    blood is the fountain that washes it away (Zechariah 13:1 – “In that day
    there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David... for sin and for
    uncleanness.”).

## Slide 20 – Q8: Conviction by the Law

- Question: When Paul was converted, what first brought conviction to him?
- Key Text: Romans 7:7 – “I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not
  known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”

## Slide 21 – Q8: Key Points

- **Spirituality of the Law:**
  - Paul kept the outward letter, but the commandment "Thou shalt not covet"
    pierced his heart.
  - The law judges motives and desires, not just actions.
- **Need for Christ:**
  - This conviction slew his self-righteousness.
  - True obedience is a matter of the heart, possible only when Christ dwells
    within (Romans 8:3-4 – “...That the righteousness of the law might be
    fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”).

## Slide 22 – Q9: True Repentance

- Question: What more than conviction is necessary to true repentance?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 7:10 – “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to
  salvation not to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Key Points

- **Godly Sorrow:**
  - Sorrow for the sin itself and for wounding God.
  - Leads to a change of life ("repentance to salvation").
- **Sorrow of the World:**
  - Sorrow for the _consequences_ (getting caught, punishment).
  - Does not lead to a change of heart (e.g., Judas, Esau).

## Slide 24 – Q9: Illustration

- **The Thief:**
  - A thief in prison may be sorry he is behind bars (worldly sorrow), but would
    steal again if released.
  - A converted man is sorry he stole because it is wrong (godly sorrow). Even
    without prison, he would not steal again.

## Slide 25 – Q10: What Repentance Involves

- Question: What does repentance involve?
- Key Text: Ezekiel 18:30-31 – “Repent, and turn yourselves from all your
  transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all
  your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart
  and a new spirit.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Key Points

- **Active Turning:**
  - Repentance involves a deliberate break from the past ("turn" and "cast
    away").
  - We cannot hold a "pet sin" with one hand and Jesus with the other.
- **The Cooperation of Faith:**
  - God commands "Make you a new heart," but also promises to _give_ a new heart
    (Ezekiel 36:26 – “A new heart also will I give you...”).
  - **Lesson:** We supply the consent and will; God supplies the creating power.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Further Requirements

- Question: What does repentance further require?
- Key Text: Isaiah 55:6-7 – “Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, call ye
  upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous
  man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy
  upon him.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Key Points

- **Forsaking Thoughts:**
  - Not just the "way" (actions) but the "thoughts" (imagination/affections)
    must be purified.
- **Urgency:**
  - "While He may be found." The door of mercy does not stay open forever
    (Genesis 6:3 – “My spirit shall not always strive with man...”).
- **Promise:**
  - God will "abundantly pardon." Focus is on His grace.

## Slide 29 – Q12: Evidence of Repentance

- Question: How will genuine repentance be shown?
- Key Text: Matthew 3:8 – “Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points

- **Fruits of Righteousness:**
  - A converted heart naturally produces good works.
- **Restitution:**
  - Genuine repentance includes making things right (Ezekiel 33:15 – “If the
    wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed... he shall surely
    live...”).
- **Faith and Works:**
  - These works do not save us; they prove we are saved (James 2:26 – “For as
    the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”).

## Slide 31 – Q12: Illustration

- **The Master Gardener:**
  - If a man claims to be a master gardener but his garden is full of weeds, you
    doubt his claim.
  - **Lesson:** If a man claims to be a Christian but his life is full of
    bitterness and dishonesty, his profession is vain. The fruit proves the
    root.

## Slide 32 – Q13: Faith Required

- Question: What besides repentance is required in conversion?
- Key Text: Acts 20:21 – “Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus
  Christ.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Key Points

- **The Counterpart to Repentance:**
  - Repentance empties the heart of self and sin.
  - Faith fills the heart with Christ.
  - Without faith, repentance is merely despair. Faith looks to the Redeemer for
    mercy.

## Slide 34 – Q14: The Object of Faith

- Question: Who is Christ, that one should believe in Him?
- Key Text: John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
  begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
  everlasting life.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: Key Points

- **The Divine Gift:**
  - Salvation originates in the Father's love.
  - Only the "only begotten Son" (Divine) could pay the infinite debt of sin.
- **The Great Exchange:**
  - He took our death ("perish") that we might have His life ("everlasting
    life").

## Slide 36 – Q15: Christ’s Work

- Question: What has Christ done for us that we should be saved through Him?
- Key Text: 1 Corinthians 15:3 – “Christ died for our sins according to the
  Scriptures.”

## Slide 37 – Q15: Key Points (Sanctuary & Atonement)

- **Substitution:**
  - He died _for_ our sins. He paid the wages of sin (Romans 6:23 – “For the
    wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus
    Christ our Lord.”).
- **"According to the Scriptures":**
  - His death fulfilled the Old Testament sanctuary types.
  - He is the Lamb of God who makes Atonement (At-one-ment) possible.

## Slide 38 – Q16: Cleansing from Sin

- Question: In order for one to be cleansed from sin, what is required of Him?
- Key Text: 1 John 1:7-9 – “But if we walk in the light... the blood of Jesus
  Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin... If we confess our sins, He is
  faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
  unrighteousness.”

## Slide 39 – Q16: Key Points

- **Walking in the Light:**
  - We must live according to revealed truth.
- **Confession:**
  - Specific, heartfelt confession is required.
- **Forgiveness AND Cleansing:**
  - He forgives the guilt (Justification).
  - He cleanses the "unrighteousness" (Sanctification).
  - Note: The blood _cleanses_ (present tense)—a present power for victory.

## Slide 40 – Q17: Relation to Sin

- Question: What should be one's relation to sin after repentance?
- Key Text: Romans 6:1-2 – “What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin,
  that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live
  any longer therein?”

## Slide 41 – Q17: Key Points

- **No License to Sin:**
  - Grace is not permission to continue sinning ("God forbid").
- **Dead to Sin:**
  - A dead man does not respond to temptation.
  - The gospel saves us _from_ our sins, not _in_ them (Matthew 1:21 – “...and
    thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their
    sins.”).

## Slide 42 – Q18: Dying to Sin

- Question: How does one become dead to sin?
- Key Text: Romans 6:6 – “Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him,
  that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve
  sin.”

## Slide 43 – Q18: Key Points

- **Crucified with Christ:**
  - By faith, we identify with Christ's death.
  - The "Old Man" (the selfish carnal nature) must be rendered powerless.
- **Freedom from Slavery:**
  - The result is that we "henceforth should not serve sin."
  - Conversion breaks the chains of the old master.

## Slide 44 – Q18: Illustration

- **The Dead Slave:**
  - A slave who dies is no longer under his master’s authority. The master may
    shout, but the dead slave does not obey.
  - **Lesson:** When we are "crucified with Christ," Sin may shout temptations,
    but we are dead to that voice and alive only to Christ.

## Slide 45 – Q19: Burial and Resurrection

- Question: What is done with the "old man" after he dies?
- Key Text: Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into
  death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the
  Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”

## Slide 46 – Q19: Key Points

- **Burial:**
  - Baptism is the funeral service for the old life of sin.
- **Resurrection:**
  - We rise to walk in "newness of life."
  - This is the impartation of the life of Christ to the believer.

## Slide 47 – Q20: The Gift of the Spirit

- Question: When truly converted, what does everyone receive?
- Key Text: Acts 2:38 – “Repent, and be baptized everyone of you in the name of
  Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the
  Holy Ghost.”

## Slide 48 – Q20: Key Points

- **The Divine Gift:**
  - Every real conversion is a miracle of grace involving the Holy Spirit.
- **Power for Living:**
  - The Spirit brings the presence of Jesus into the heart.
  - Without the Spirit, we cannot overcome.
- **Sanctuary Type:**
  - Like the oil in the lamps of the Holy Place, the Spirit illuminates the
    believer.

## Slide 49 – Q21: The Spirit is Essential

- Question: Can anyone be a Christian without having the Spirit of Christ?
- Key Text: Romans 8:9 – “Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is
  none of His.”

## Slide 50 – Q21: Key Points

- **The True Test:**
  - A Christian is not defined by lineage or membership, but by the indwelling
    Spirit.
- **Character:**
  - The Spirit of Christ is a spirit of love, humility, and obedience.
  - If these are absent, the claim to Christianity is false.

## Slide 51 – Q22: Sons of God

- Question: What precious relation is sustained when one has the Holy Spirit?
- Key Text: Romans 8:14 – “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are
  the sons of God.”

## Slide 52 – Q22: Key Points

- **Adoption:**
  - We become members of the Royal Family; God becomes our Father.
  - We have access through Christ (Ephesians 2:18 – “For through him we both
    have access by one Spirit unto the Father.”).
- **Guidance:**
  - The mark of a son is being "led" by the Spirit, not by the world.

## Slide 53 – Q23: Assurance

- Question: Can it be known when this relation exists?
- Key Text: Romans 8:16 – “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit,
  that we are the children of God.”

## Slide 54 – Q23: Key Points

- **Internal Witness:**
  - God gives assurance and peace to the accepted believer.
- **Harmony with Word:**
  - The Spirit witnesses _with_ our spirit.
  - This implies a clean conscience and harmony with God’s written Word (which
    the Spirit inspired).

## Slide 55 – Q24: A New Creature

- Question: When one thus stands complete in Christ, what is he?
- Key Text: 2 Corinthians 5:17 – “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
  creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”

## Slide 56 – Q24: Key Points

- **Re-Creation:**
  - It is a miracle equal to the creation of the world.
- **Total Transformation:**
  - New motives, tastes, and habits.
  - We love what we once hated (holiness) and hate what we once loved (sin).
- **Righteousness Imparted:**
  - Christ's life is actually lived out in the believer.

## Slide 57 – Q25: Putting Off the Old

- Question: Of what character are the "old things" which are to be put off?
- Key Text: Colossians 3:8-9 – “But now ye also put off all these: anger, wrath,
  malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to
  another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds.”

## Slide 58 – Q25: Key Points

- **Specific Sins:**
  - Sins of Temper: Anger, wrath, malice.
  - Sins of Tongue: Blasphemy, filthy language, lying.
- **The Requirement:**
  - These must be "put off" like dirty clothes.
  - A converted person cannot maintain these habits.

## Slide 59 – Q26: Putting On the New

- Question: What will the new man acquire?
- Key Text: Colossians 3:12-14 – “Put on therefore... bowels of mercies,
  kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering... And above all these
  things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.”

## Slide 60 – Q26: Key Points

- **The Wardrobe of Heaven:**
  - We put on the character of Christ: Mercy, kindness, humility, patience.
- **Charity (Love):**
  - The "bond of perfectness."
  - Love is the fulfilling of the law (Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to
    his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.”).

## Slide 61 – Q26: Illustration

- **The Uniform:**
  - When a soldier joins the army, he removes civilian clothes and puts on the
    uniform.
  - **Lesson:** The virtues of kindness and humility are the uniform of the
    Christian soldier, identifying whom he serves.

## Slide 62 – Q27: Heavenly Affections

- Question: Where will the affections then be found?
- Key Text: Colossians 3:1-2 – “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those
  things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set
  your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.”

## Slide 63 – Q27: Key Points (Sanctuary Focus)

- **Sanctuary Focus:**
  - Our High Priest is at the "right hand of God."
  - Our attention is directed to His work in the heavenly sanctuary.
- **Citizenship:**
  - We are citizens of heaven (Philippians 3:20 – “For our conversation is in
    heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour...”).
  - We hold earthly things loosely.

## Slide 64 – Q28: The Final Result

- Question: Having done all this, what will be the final result?
- Key Text: Colossians 3:3-4 – “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with
  Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
  appear with Him in glory.”

## Slide 65 – Q28: Key Points

- **Security:**
  - Our life is "hid with Christ." Satan cannot touch what is entrusted to
    Jesus.
- **The Blessed Hope:**
  - We look for the Second Coming ("When Christ... shall appear").
- **Glorification:**
  - Sanctification ends in Glorification.
  - We shall be changed (1 Corinthians 15:53 – “For this corruptible must put on
    incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”).
