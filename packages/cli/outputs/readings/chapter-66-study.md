# Reading 66: The Length of the Day of the Lord

## Introduction

When Scripture speaks of "the day of the Lord," many assume it refers to a single twenty-four-hour period. Yet careful study reveals something far grander—a divine "day" spanning more than a thousand years, from the first warning signs of Christ's return to the final purification of the earth by fire. Understanding this extended timeline unlocks the prophetic sequence and reveals God's patient, thorough work of judgment and restoration.

## Core Truths

### The Character of the Day of the Lord

The prophet Zephaniah describes this day in solemn terms:

> _"The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress."_ (Zephaniah 1:14, 15)

This is no ordinary day. It is:

- **A day of wrath**—God's settled opposition to sin finally manifested
- **A day of trouble and distress**—for those unprepared to meet their Maker
- **A day that "hasteth greatly"**—approaching with increasing speed as prophecy fulfills

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew phrase translated "hasteth greatly" (_maher meod_) suggests rapid acceleration—like a boulder gaining momentum as it rolls downhill. The day of the Lord does not arrive suddenly without warning; rather, its approach quickens as we near its climax.

### The Beginning: Signs Under the Sixth Seal

When does this great day begin? Revelation places its commencement under the sixth seal:

> _"And I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal... For the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?"_ (Revelation 6:12, 17)

The signs accompanying this seal were to serve as heaven's announcement that the day of the Lord had begun:

> _"The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."_ (Revelation 6:12, 13)

Jesus confirmed this prophetic sequence:

> _"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven... and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven."_ (Matthew 24:29, 30)

**Historical fulfillment**: The Dark Day of May 19, 1780, when the sun was mysteriously darkened and the moon appeared as blood, followed by the great meteoric shower of November 13, 1833, marked the opening of this prophetic period. These signs announced: the day of the Lord has begun.

[Q] **"If the day of the Lord began in 1780, why hasn't Christ returned yet?"**

Because the "day of the Lord" is not a literal twenty-four-hour period but an extended prophetic time encompassing all the events of final judgment. Just as the "day of salvation" has extended for two thousand years (2 Corinthians 6:2), so the "day of the Lord" spans the entire closing work of human history. We are now living within this solemn period.

## Deeper Truths

### The Prophetic Timeline: From Sixth Seal to Final Fire

Understanding the full extent of the day of the Lord requires tracing its events in sequence:

**1. The Seven Last Plagues (Before Christ's Return)**

> _"And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God."_ (Revelation 15:1)

The plagues are poured out while probation remains closed but before Christ visibly appears. By the sixth plague, Christ announces:

> _"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame."_ (Revelation 16:15)

**2. The Second Coming (Seventh Seal)**

> _"And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour."_ (Revelation 8:1)

This silence occurs because all heaven's inhabitants accompany Christ to earth:

> _"For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first."_ (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

[DYK🔎] Using the prophetic day-year principle in reverse (a prophetic "half hour" being 1/48th of a prophetic day, or about seven literal days), some students see this "silence" representing the time of Christ's journey to and from earth with the redeemed—a solemn, awe-filled transit through the heavens.

**3. The Thousand Years (Millennium)**

> _"And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished."_ (Revelation 20:4, 5)

During this millennium:

- The righteous are in heaven, participating in the judgment review (1 Corinthians 6:2, 3)
- The earth lies desolate, Satan bound by circumstances
- The wicked remain dead until the thousand years end

**4. The Final Battle and Second Death**

> _"And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations... to gather them together to battle."_ (Revelation 20:7, 8)

The wicked are resurrected, and Satan rallies them for one final assault:

> _"And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."_ (Revelation 20:9)

This is "the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death" (Revelation 21:8).

**5. The Earth's Purification**

The day of the Lord extends even to the complete burning of the earth:

> _"But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."_ (2 Peter 3:7)

> _"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."_ (2 Peter 3:10)

[ILL] Consider a master craftsman restoring an ancient, corrupted masterpiece. He does not merely touch up the surface; he strips away every layer of damage, removes every contaminant, and rebuilds from the foundation. So God's day of judgment is not a hasty verdict but a thorough work—first the warning signs, then the plagues, then the separation of righteous and wicked, then a thousand years of transparent judicial review, then the final eradication of sin, and finally the complete purification of creation itself. Only then can the new heavens and new earth emerge, untainted by any trace of rebellion.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Thoroughness of Divine Justice

The extended nature of the day of the Lord reveals God's character:

- **He warns before He judges**—the signs precede the plagues
- **He separates before He destroys**—the righteous are taken before the final fires
- **He explains before He executes**—the millennium allows the redeemed to review heaven's records and understand God's justice
- **He purifies completely**—sin is not merely suppressed but utterly eradicated

This is the final answer to Satan's charges against God's government. Every question will be answered. Every doubt will be resolved. The universe will declare with one voice: _"Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints"_ (Revelation 15:3).

### Sanctuary Connections

The day of the Lord corresponds to the final phases of Christ's sanctuary ministry:

- **The Most Holy Place ministry** (investigative judgment) determines who will be protected through the plagues
- **The closing of probation** marks the end of Christ's intercession
- **The plagues** correspond to the cleansing of the sanctuary from all defilement
- **The millennium** is the "scapegoat" phase—Satan bearing responsibility for sins he incited
- **The lake of fire** is the final sin offering—the complete destruction of sin and sinners

[DYK🔎] On the ancient Day of Atonement, after the sanctuary was cleansed, the sins were symbolically placed on the scapegoat and sent into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:21, 22). During the millennium, Satan—the antitypical scapegoat—is confined to the desolate earth, bound by circumstances, awaiting final judgment. The thousand years fulfill this ancient type.

## Practical Application

Understanding the length of the day of the Lord should shape how we live:

**1. We are living in the day of the Lord now.** The signs have been given. The door of mercy still stands open, but it will not remain so indefinitely. Every day is precious.

**2. God's patience has purpose.** The extended timeline is not divine delay but divine mercy—time for repentance, character development, and the gospel to reach every nation (2 Peter 3:9, 15).

**3. The millennium reveals God's transparency.** Heaven has nothing to hide. Every case will be reviewed. God invites the redeemed to examine His justice. This should give us confidence in His character now.

**4. Sin's end is total.** There will be no eternal torture, but there will be complete destruction of sin. God's solution is thorough and final—and it makes way for eternal peace.

**5. Our preparation is character-deep.** Since the sealing must be complete before the plagues, and character is fixed at the close of probation, now is the time to allow Christ to write His law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).

## Appeal

> _"But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night... Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God?"_ (2 Peter 3:10-12)

We are living in the day of the Lord. The signs have been given. The plagues are yet future, but probation's close draws near. The question heaven asks each of us is the same one asked at the opening of this prophetic period: _"Who shall be able to stand?"_ (Revelation 6:17).

The answer comes in Revelation 14:12: _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."_

Will you, by God's grace, be among those who stand? Will you surrender fully to Christ today, allowing Him to prepare you for the solemn events ahead? The day of the Lord is not merely coming—it has begun. Now is the time to be ready.
