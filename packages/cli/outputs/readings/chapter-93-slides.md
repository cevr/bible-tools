## Slide 1 – Q1: Foundation of the Church

- Question: On what foundation is the Christian church built?
- Key Text: Ephesians 2:20 – “And are built upon the foundation of the apostles
  and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Cornerstone and Scripture

- **The Cornerstone:**
  - In ancient architecture, the cornerstone determined the angle and stability
    of the whole building.
  - The church collapses if removed from Christ; all doctrine must align with
    His life.
- **Unity of Scripture:**
  - The church rests on the **prophets** (Old Testament) and **apostles** (New
    Testament).
  - The Old Testament is not obsolete; it is the foundation the New Testament
    stands on.
  - Christ appealed to the prophets to validate His mission (Luke 24:27 – “And
    beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the
    scriptures the things concerning himself.”).

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Living Temple

- **Earthly Sanctuary:** The law of God was housed in the Most Holy Place.
- **Spiritual Temple:** The church is the spiritual temple where Christ writes
  that same law on the heart.
- Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
  Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
  and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be
  to me a people.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Builder’s Mistake:**
  - Imagine a builder trying to construct a second story (the New Testament)
    while destroying the first story (the Old Testament).
  - The entire house would fall.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The apostles built _upon_ the prophets; they did not destroy them.
  - To understand the New Testament, we must look at the foundation laid in the
    beginning.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Agent of Creation

- Question: By whom were all things created?
- Key Text: Ephesians 3:9 – “Which from the beginning of the world hath been hid
  in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Christ the Creator and Redeemer

- **Christ the Creator:**
  - The One who died on Calvary is the same One who spoke the worlds into
    existence.
  - He is the Architect of creation (John 1:3 – “All things were made by him;
    and without him was not any thing made that was made.”).
- **Creation and Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The power to create a world from nothing is the same power required to
    create a clean heart in a sinner.
  - Psalm 51:10 – “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
    within me.”
- **Worship:** Since Christ is the active Creator, the memorial of creation (the
  Sabbath) is a memorial of His work.

## Slide 7 – Q3: The Finished Work

- Question: When was the creation finished?
- Key Text: Genesis 1:31; 2:1 – “And God saw everything that He had made, and,
  behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
  Thus, the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.”

## Slide 8 – Q3: Creation and Justification

- **"Very Good":**
  - When Christ finished His work, it was perfect. There was no sin, death, or
    flaw.
- **The Finished Work:**
  - Creation was a "finished" work; man could add nothing to it.
  - **Justification** is the finished work of Christ. We cannot add our merits
    to His atonement.
- **Definition of Justification:**
  - The legal declaration that a repentant sinner is righteous, based solely on
    the merits of Jesus credited to their account (Romans 3:24 – “Being
    justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ
    Jesus.”).

## Slide 9 – Q4: The Creator’s Rest

- Question: What did the Creator do on the seventh day?
- Key Text: Genesis 2:2 – “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He
  had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had
  made.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Meaning of Rest

- **Divine Rest:**
  - God did not rest due to fatigue, for the Creator “fainteth not, neither is
    weary” (Isaiah 40:28).
  - He rested to set an example and establish a cycle for humanity.
- **Spiritual Significance:**
  - To "rest" (_shabath_) means to cease.
  - This points to the Gospel rest: we cease from our own attempts to earn
    salvation and rest in Jesus.
  - Hebrews 4:10 – “For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased
    from his own works, as God did from his.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Masterpiece:**
  - A painter finishes a masterpiece, steps back, puts down his brush, and
    enjoys the beauty of what he has made.
  - He stops not because he is exhausted, but because the work is complete and
    perfect.
- **The Lesson:**
  - The Sabbath is an invitation to step back and admire God’s perfect work in
    creation and redemption.

## Slide 12 – Q5: Three Divine Acts

- Question: After resting from His creative work on that seventh day, what did
  the Creator do?
- Key Text: Genesis 2:3 – “And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it;
  because that in it He had rested from all His work which God created and
  made.”

## Slide 13 – Q5: Key Points and Sanctification

- **Three Acts:**
  - **Rested:** Ceased from labor.
  - **Blessed:** Placed special spiritual favor on this specific 24-hour period.
  - **Sanctified:** Set it apart for holy use.
- **Not Jewish:** This occurred in Eden before sin or the existence of the
  Jewish nation.
- **Definition of Sanctification:**
  - The process of being made holy or set apart.
  - It is the Holy Spirit imparting the life of Christ to the believer for
    obedience (1 Thessalonians 4:3 – “For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification...”).

## Slide 14 – Q6: Made for Man

- Question: For whom did Christ say the Sabbath was made?
- Key Text: Mark 2:28 [referencing v.27] – “And He said unto them, the Sabbath
  was made for man.”

## Slide 15 – Q6: A Universal Gift

- **A Gift, Not a Burden:**
  - Pharisees made the Sabbath a burden; Jesus restored it as a blessing.
  - It was designed for physical rest and spiritual refreshment.
- **Universal Scope:**
  - Made for "man" (mankind), not just one nation.
  - As long as mankind needs rest and a connection with the Creator, the Sabbath
    remains.
- **Health:**
  - The Creator designed our frame to need one day in seven for recuperation.

## Slide 16 – Q7: The Lord of the Day

- Question: What is Christ's relation to the Sabbath?
- Key Text: Mark 2:28 – “Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”

## Slide 17 – Q7: Lordship and Ownership

- **Ownership:**
  - If Christ is "Lord of the Sabbath," the day belongs to Him.
  - Jesus never claimed lordship over Sunday; He specifically claims the seventh
    day.
- **Discipleship:**
  - If we call Him "Lord," we must respect His property and command.
  - Luke 6:46 – “And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
    say?”

## Slide 18 – Q7: Illustration

- **The Landlord:**
  - If a landlord owns a property, he sets the rules for it.
  - A tenant cannot decide to pay rent on a different day or claim ownership of
    a different house.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Christ, the Lord of Time, has marked the seventh day as His property. To
    appropriate another day is to trespass on His authority.

## Slide 19 – Q8: Honoring the Son

- Question: How much honor is due to Christ?
- Key Text: John 5:23 – “All men should honor the Son, even as they honor the
  Father.”

## Slide 20 – Q8: Equality and Honor

- **Equality:**
  - True Christianity elevates Christ to His rightful place as equal with the
    Father.
  - We cannot honor the Father while dishonoring the Son’s commandments.
- **Practical Honor:**
  - We honor Christ by walking as He walked.
  - Keeping the day He made, blessed, and kept is a high form of honor.

## Slide 21 – Q9: Christ’s Custom

- Question: Did Christ keep the Sabbath?
- Key Texts:
  - Luke 4:16 – “And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as
    His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up
    for to read.”
  - John 15:10 – “I have kept My Father's commandments.”

## Slide 22 – Q9: Christ Our Example & Righteousness

- **Christ Our Example:**
  - 1 John 2:6 – “He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
    even as he walked.”
  - Jesus lived a life of perfect obedience to God's Law.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - **Imputed:** His record of Sabbath-keeping is credited to us for
    Justification.
  - **Imparted:** Through the Holy Spirit, He lives that same obedient life _in
    us_ for Sanctification.
  - Christ in the heart will not break the Sabbath today.

## Slide 23 – Q10: Prophecy and Practice

- Question: When the Saviour predicted the destruction of Jerusalem... how did
  He urge them to regard the Sabbath in that flight?
- Key Text: Matthew 24:20 – “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,
  neither on the Sabbath day.”

## Slide 24 – Q10: Permanence of the Sabbath

- **Looking Ahead:**
  - Jesus spoke of the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), nearly 40 years after
    the Cross.
  - He expected His followers to still be observing the Sabbath then.
- **Proof of Permanence:**
  - If the Sabbath ended at the Cross (A.D. 31), this instruction would be
    meaningless.
- **Care for His People:**
  - Christ desired His people to be free to rest and worship, even in
    tribulation.

## Slide 25 – Q11: The Disciples’ Obedience

- Question: Did the followers of Christ keep the Sabbath after His death?
- Key Text: Luke 23:56 – “And they returned and prepared spices and ointments;
  and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.”

## Slide 26 – Q11: Sanctuary Connection

- **"According to the Commandment":**
  - Luke, writing decades later, affirms the commandment is still the standard
    for believers.
- **Sanctuary Timeline:**
  - **Friday:** Christ died (The Sacrifice).
  - **Sabbath:** Christ rested in the tomb.
  - **Sunday:** Christ arose (High Priest ministry begins).
  - Even in death, Christ honored the Sabbath rest.

## Slide 27 – Q12: The First Day of the Week

- Question: What did they do on the next day? and what day of the week was it?
- Key Text: Luke 24:1 – “Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the
  morning, they came unto the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had
  prepared, and certain others with them.”

## Slide 28 – Q12: Distinction of Days

- **The Distinction:**
  - The disciples rested on the Sabbath (7th day) and worked on the first day
    (Sunday).
  - 1. Preparation Day (Friday) -> 2. The Sabbath (Saturday) -> 3. First Day
       (Sunday).
- **No Transfer of Holiness:**
  - Scripture never transfers Sabbath holiness to the day of the resurrection.
  - The memorial of the resurrection is **Baptism**, not Sunday observance.
  - Romans 6:4 – “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that
    like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even
    so we also should walk in newness of life.”

## Slide 29 – Q13: God’s Definition

- Question: What day does the commandment say is the Sabbath?
- Key Text: Exodus 20:10 – “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
  God.”

## Slide 30 – Q13: The Seal of the Law

- **Specific Definition:**
  - God specifies _which_ day. It is not "a" sabbath, but "the" Sabbath.
- **"Of the Lord":**
  - It belongs to God, not to the Jews.
- **The Seal:** The Fourth Commandment contains the elements of a royal seal:
  1.  **Name:** "The Lord thy God."
  2.  **Title:** Creator ("made heaven and earth").
  3.  **Territory:** Heaven and earth.

## Slide 31 – Q14: Enduring Commandments

- Question: How enduring are the commandments?
- Key Text: Psalm 111:7, 8 – “The works of His hands are verity and judgment;
  all His commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever, and are done
  in truth and uprightness.”

## Slide 32 – Q14: Law and Covenant

- **God’s Character:**
  - The Law reflects God’s character. Since God does not change (Malachi 3:6),
    His moral law stands fast.
- **The New Covenant:**
  - God does not abolish the law; He writes it **in the heart**.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their
    hearts.”
  - He empowers the believer to keep it through grace.

## Slide 33 – Q15: The Tittle of the Law

- Question: What did Christ say of the commandments?
- Key Text: Luke 16:17 – “It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one
  tittle of the law to fail.”

## Slide 34 – Q15: Faith Establishes Law

- **Immutability:**
  - As long as heaven and earth exist, the Law remains in effect.
  - Not even a "tittle" (a tiny stroke of a letter) was to be removed.
- **Grace and Law:**
  - Grace forgives transgression but does not remove the standard.
  - Romans 3:31 – “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
    we establish the law.”

## Slide 35 – Q16: Magnifying the Law

- Question: What was Christ to do to the law when He came?
- Key Text: Isaiah 42:21 – “The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness'
  sake: He will magnify the law and make it honorable.”

## Slide 36 – Q16: Meaning of Magnify

- **To Magnify:**
  - Means to show something in its fullest detail and greatness, not to destroy
    it.
- **Sermon on the Mount:**
  - Jesus showed the law reaches the thoughts and intents of the heart (Matthew
    5:21–28).
- **Law of Love:**
  - He swept away man-made traditions and revealed the law as a law of love.
  - Romans 13:10 – “Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
    fulfilling of the law.”

## Slide 37 – Q16: Illustration

- **The Magnifying Glass:**
  - If you look at a leaf under a magnifying glass, you do not destroy the leaf.
  - You simply reveal the intricate details that were always there.
- **The Lesson:**
  - Jesus put the magnifying glass of His life over the Ten Commandments,
    revealing their deep spiritual beauty.

## Slide 38 – Q17: Doing Good

- Question: What did the Saviour say about the Sabbath?
- Key Text: Matthew 12:12 – “Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath
  days.”

## Slide 39 – Q17: Mercy and Restoration

- **Lawful to do Good:**
  - Acts of mercy and necessity are in harmony with the Sabbath.
- **Restoration:**
  - The Sabbath is a memorial of creation; healing restores the body (creation).
- **Not License for Sin:**
  - This is not permission for personal business or pleasure.
  - Isaiah 58:13 – “If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
    pleasure on my holy day...”

## Slide 40 – Q18: Paul’s Example

- Question: How did the apostle Paul use the Sabbath days?
- Key Text: Acts 17:2 – “And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and
  three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.”

## Slide 41 – Q18: Apostolic Practice

- **Paul’s "Manner":**
  - Like Jesus, Paul habitually kept the Sabbath (Acts 13:14, 42, 44; 16:13).
- **Gentile Observance:**
  - Paul preached to Gentiles on the Sabbath, not just Jews.
  - Acts 13:42 – “...the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to
    them the next sabbath.”
- **Moral vs. Ceremonial:**
  - Paul taught that ceremonial laws (sacrifices) were met in Christ, but the
    moral law remained.

## Slide 42 – Q19: The Lord’s Day

- Question: On what day was John in the Spirit?
- Key Text: Revelation 1:10 – “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day.”

## Slide 43 – Q19: Identifying the Day

- **Biblical Evidence:**
  - God calls the Sabbath "My holy day" (Isaiah 58:13).
  - Jesus is "Lord of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28).
  - Scripture never calls Sunday the "Lord's Day."
- **Golden Thread:**
  - The Bible begins with the Sabbath (Genesis) and ends with the Sabbath
    (Revelation).
  - It binds God's creative and redemptive work together.

## Slide 44 – Q19: Conclusion – The Sign of Sanctification

- **The Final Test:**
  - Worship is the central issue of the last days (Revelation 14:7).
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - The Sabbath is a sign that we rest in Christ’s finished work.
  - It is the outward sign of an inward covenant.
- **Exodus 31:13** – “Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between
  me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord
  that doth sanctify you.”
