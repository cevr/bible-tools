## Slide 1 – Q1: The Cost of Redemption

- **Question:** What has man's redemption from sin cost?
- **Key Text:** John 3:16 – “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only
  begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have
  everlasting life.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Infinite Sacrifice

- The cost of redemption was the infinite life of the Lawgiver Himself.
- Sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4 – “Whosoever committeth sin
  transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.”).
- The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23 – “For the wages of sin is death; but
  the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”).
- God could not simply set aside His law to save man, for that would compromise
  His justice and government.
- The Father gave His Son to pay the penalty the broken law demanded.

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Sanctuary & High Priest

- **The Infinite Sacrifice:** Christ poured out His life, feeling the crushing
  weight of the world’s sin in Gethsemane and on the cross.
- **The Author of Salvation:** Through suffering, Christ became the author of
  salvation.
  - Hebrews 5:8–9 – “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the
    things which he suffered; And being made perfect, he became the author of
    eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.”
- **Our High Priest:** Jesus is now our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.
  He saves to the uttermost because He paid the uttermost price.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Definition & Illustration

- **Definition: Redemption**
  - The act of buying back a sinner from the slavery of sin and death through
    the payment of a ransom—the blood of Jesus.
  - 1 Peter 1:18–19 – “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
    corruptible things, as silver and gold... But with the precious blood of
    Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.”
- **Illustration:**
  - Imagine a judge whose son is guilty of a capital crime.
  - The judge cannot ignore the law without becoming corrupt.
  - Instead, he pronounces the guilty verdict, steps down, removes his robes,
    and takes the punishment for his son.
  - This satisfies the law while saving the son.

## Slide 5 – Q2: The Greatness of Love

- **Question:** How great was this love?
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:7–8 – “For scarcely for a righteous man will one die;
  yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. But God
  commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died
  for us.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points on God’s Love

- **Proactive Love:** Human love is reactive, but God’s love is unconditional.
- **While We Were Enemies:** Christ died for us while we were in open rebellion,
  not waiting for us to improve (Romans 5:10 – “For if, when we were enemies, we
  were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled,
  we shall be saved by his life.”).
- **Everlasting Love:** This love existed before the foundation of the world.
  - Jeremiah 31:3 – “The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have
    loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I
    drawn thee.”

## Slide 7 – Q2: Justification by Faith

- **The Ground of Acceptance:** Our acceptance is based on God’s character, not
  our performance.
- **Definition: Justification**
  - The legal act where God declares a penitent sinner righteous.
  - It is a change of standing before the law, credited solely because of what
    Jesus has done.
- **Foundation of Faith:** God declares the ungodly righteous based on Christ’s
  merits (Romans 4:5 – “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
  justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”).

## Slide 8 – Q2: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - Imagine a man seeing a drowning enemy—someone who has cursed him and stolen
    from him.
  - The man jumps into the raging water to save his enemy at the cost of his own
    life.
  - This is the love of God: He saves us not because we are good, but because He
    is love.

## Slide 9 – Q3: What God Requires

- **Question:** In return, what does God require of us?
- **Key Text:** Luke 10:27 – “And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord
  thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,
  and with all thy mind.”

## Slide 10 – Q3: Total Surrender

- **All is Required:** Because God gave all, He requires all. He does not accept
  divided service (Matthew 6:24 – “No man can serve two masters...”).
- **Total Consecration:** The commandment requires:
  - The **Intellect** (mind).
  - The **Affections** (heart).
  - The **Physical Powers** (strength).
  - The **Spiritual Life** (soul).

## Slide 11 – Q3: The Response of Faith & The New Covenant

- **Response, Not Earning:** We do not love to earn heaven, but because our
  hearts are touched by His sacrifice.
  - 1 John 4:19 – “We love him, because he first loved us.”
- **Impossible for Natural Man:** The carnal mind cannot obey God (Romans 8:7 –
  “Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the
  law of God, neither indeed can be.”).
- **The Remedy:** We need the New Covenant promise where Christ lives _in_ us.
  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant... I will put my laws into their
    mind, and write them in their hearts...”

## Slide 12 – Q3: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - In a marriage, a husband does not want his wife to be faithful only 90% of
    the time.
  - He does not want her to love him only when it is convenient.
  - True love demands the whole heart.
  - God is the husband of His people (Isaiah 54:5 – “For thy Maker is thine
    husband; the Lord of hosts is his name...”) and asks for exclusive devotion.

## Slide 13 – Q4: The Definition of Love

- **Question:** What is the love of God?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 5:3 – “For this is the love of God, that we keep His
  commandments.”

## Slide 14 – Q4: Love is Obedience

- **A Principle of Action:** Love is not merely a feeling; it is doing.
- **The Test of Love:** Jesus equated love with keeping His word.
  - John 14:15 – “If ye love me, keep my commandments.”
- **Disobedience:** One cannot claim to love God while willfully breaking His
  law; disobedience is the highest form of disrespect.

## Slide 15 – Q4: Sanctification & The Fruit of Faith

- **Not a Burden:** The commandments are not grievous when written on the heart.
- **Definition: Sanctification**
  - The work of the Holy Spirit imparting the life of Christ so the character is
    changed and the law is lived out.
- **The Attitude of Christ:**
  - Psalm 40:8 – “I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
    heart.”
- **Fruit vs. Root:** Obedience is the _fruit_ of salvation, not the _root_. We
  obey because we are saved by grace.

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - A good tree naturally produces good fruit.
  - You do not have to force an apple tree to manufacture apples.
  - If a person is “rooted” in Christ, they will naturally produce the “fruit”
    of obedience.

## Slide 17 – Q5: Compelled Obedience?

- **Question:** Does the Lord compel obedience?
- **Key Text:** Revelation 22:17 – “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And
  let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
  whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.”

## Slide 18 – Q5: God’s Method vs. Satan’s Method

- **Free Will:** God’s government is based on love, which cannot be forced.
- **The Choice:** “Choose you this day whom ye will serve” (Joshua 24:15).
- **Contrasting Methods:**
  - **Satan:** Uses force, coercion, and deception.
  - **God:** Uses attraction, truth, and invitation.
- **The Open Door:** God knocks (Revelation 3:20 – “Behold, I stand at the door,
  and knock...”) but never breaks the door down.

## Slide 19 – Q5: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - A government can draft soldiers and force them to march.
  - However, it cannot force them to be patriots at heart.
  - Forced loyalty is no loyalty at all.
  - God desires children who serve Him out of love, not programmed robots.

## Slide 20 – Q6: Why Ask Obedience?

- **Question:** Why does He ask obedience?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 48:18 – “O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments!
  then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the
  sea.”

## Slide 21 – Q6: Protection and Peace

- **The Law is Protection:** God’s commandments are a “hedge” of safety. Every
  prohibition prevents us from getting hurt.
- **Peace:** Obedience brings peace like a river—deep and flowing.
- **Unrest of the Wicked:**
  - Isaiah 48:22 – “There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.”
- **Abiding in Love:** Obedience keeps us in the atmosphere of God’s blessing.
  - John 15:10 – “If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love...”

## Slide 22 – Q6: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - A parent tells a child, “Do not play in the street.”
  - Is the parent trying to restrict the child's fun? No.
  - The parent is preserving the child's life.
  - The law of God is the wall that keeps us safe from the traffic of sin.

## Slide 23 – Q7: Handling Holy Things

- **Question:** What did God forbid those to do who assisted in removing the
  sanctuary from place to place?
- **Key Text:** Numbers 4:15 – “And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of
  covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is
  to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they
  shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die.”

## Slide 24 – Q7: Holy vs. Common

- **Distinction:** God taught Israel the difference between the holy and the
  common.
- **Reverence:** The sanctuary vessels represented Christ and His ministry; they
  were not common luggage.
- **Strict Obedience:** The Kohathites could carry the furniture but were
  forbidden to touch it directly.
- **Lesson for Us:** We must treat God’s Word, His law, and His house with deep
  reverence.
  - Psalm 89:7 – “God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and
    to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.”

## Slide 25 – Q7: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - High-voltage electricity lines are powerful and useful.
  - However, they must be handled according to strict protocols.
  - Touching a live wire with a bare hand brings death, regardless of
    intentions.
  - God’s holiness is a consuming fire; we approach only through Christ.

## Slide 26 – Q8: David’s Proposal

- **Question:** When David designed to remove the ark of the covenant from
  Gibeah to Jerusalem, how did he propose to do it?
- **Key Text:** 2 Samuel 6:3 – “And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and
  brought it our of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah; and Uzzah and
  Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.”

## Slide 27 – Q8: Good Intentions, Wrong Method

- **Copying the World:** David adopted a pagan method (the Philistines used a
  cart in 1 Samuel 6:7) instead of God’s instruction.
- **God’s Way:** The law required the Ark to be carried on the shoulders of
  Levites (Numbers 7:9).
- **Zeal with Knowledge:** Good intentions are not enough.
  - Romans 10:2 – “For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
    according to knowledge.”
- **Partial Obedience:** They obeyed the _desire_ of God (to honor the Ark) but
  disobeyed the _method_ of God.

## Slide 28 – Q8: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - If a doctor prescribes a specific medicine, but the patient drinks poison
    because it “looks better” or is “easier to get,” the patient will die.
  - Sincerity does not change the chemical result.
  - We must follow God’s prescription exactly.

## Slide 29 – Q9: Uzzah’s Act

- **Question:** What was one of these men next emboldened to do?
- **Key Text:** 2 Samuel 6:6 – “And when they came to Nachon's threshing floor,
  Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it; for the oxen
  shook it.”

## Slide 30 – Q9: The Consequence of Error

- **Domino Effect:** Using the cart (disobedience) caused the oxen to stumble,
  leading to the next error.
- **Presumption:** Uzzah presumed his hand was less sinful than the dirt of the
  threshing floor. He thought he was helping God.
- **Definition: Presumption**
  - Claiming the promises or protection of God while willfully neglecting His
    commandments; a counterfeit faith.
- **Loss of Awe:** Having the Ark in his home likely caused Uzzah to lose his
  sense of reverence for the presence of God.

## Slide 31 – Q10: God’s Judgment

- **Question:** How did the Lord regard this act?
- **Key Text:** 2 Samuel 6:7 – “And the anger of the Lord was kindled against
  Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of
  God.”

## Slide 32 – Q10: Holiness and Atonement

- **God Means What He Says:** God had warned, “They shall not touch any holy
  thing, lest they die” (Numbers 4:15).
- **Checking Sin:** God judged one man physically to save the nation from
  spiritual irreverence.
- **The Sanctuary Lesson:**
  - The Ark represented God’s Throne and Law.
  - A sinner cannot approach God’s law without a Mediator/Covering.
  - Uzzah approached without the covering; the law demands the death of the
    sinner.

## Slide 33 – Q10: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - Gravity is a law.
  - A man who jumps off a cliff may be kind and well-intentioned, but gravity
    will still pull him down.
  - Spiritual laws are just as real; we cannot violate God’s command and expect
    to escape the result.

## Slide 34 – Q11: Saul’s Disobedience

- **Question:** What did Samuel say Saul had done in disobeying a plain command
  given him?
- **Key Text:** 1 Samuel 15:26 – “And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return
  with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath
  rejected thee from being king over Israel.”

## Slide 35 – Q11: Partial Obedience

- **The Context:** Saul claimed to have obeyed God, but he kept the best sheep
  for sacrifice, contrary to the command to destroy everything.
- **Negotiating with God:** Saul thought he could adjust God’s requirements.
- **Rejection of the Word:** Samuel equated disobedience with rejecting God
  Himself.
- **True Worship:**
  - 1 Samuel 15:22 – “Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken
    than the fat of rams.”

## Slide 36 – Q11: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - If an employee follows 9 out of 10 instructions from the boss, but willfully
    ignores the most critical one because he thinks he “knows better,” he is
    insubordinate.
  - God seeks humble hearts that tremble at His word.
  - Isaiah 66:2 – “...but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and
    of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.”

## Slide 37 – Q12: The Warning to Lot

- **Question:** When the angels had put Lot and his family out of the doomed
  city of Sodom, what admonition did they give them?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 19:17 – “Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,
  neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be
  consumed.”

## Slide 38 – Q12: Urgency and Separation

- **A Type of the Gospel:** We are called to leave the world (Sodom) and find
  refuge in Christ (the Mountain).
- **Urgency:** “Escape for thy life.” Salvation is a life-or-death matter; there
  is no time for delay.
- **Total Separation:** “Look not behind thee.” We cannot be saved while longing
  for the sins we are leaving.
- **No Lingering:** We must not stay in the “plain” of compromise but go all the
  way to the high ground of holiness.

## Slide 39 – Q12: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - When a building is on fire, you run.
  - You do not stop to pack bags or admire the pictures on the wall.
  - You run to safety. Sin is that fire.

## Slide 40 – Q13: Lot’s Wife

- **Question:** When Lot's wife looked back, what became of her?
- **Key Text:** Genesis 19:26 – “But his wife looked back from behind him, and
  she became a pillar of salt.”

## Slide 41 – Q13: A Divided Heart

- **Heart Attachment:** Lot’s wife was physically out of Sodom, but her heart
  was still there.
- **Instability:** She became a monument to the danger of half-heartedness.
  - James 1:8 – “A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”
- **Proximity is Not Salvation:** She was the wife of a righteous man and held
  the hand of angels, yet she was lost. Being close to truth does not save.

## Slide 42 – Q13: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - A ship can be very close to the harbor and still sink.
  - Being “almost saved” is to be wholly lost.

## Slide 43 – Q14: The Savior’s Warning

- **Question:** In referring to this, what warning does our Saviour give to all?
- **Key Text:** Luke 17:32 – “Remember Lot's wife.”

## Slide 44 – Q14: Context of the Second Coming

- **Danger of Attachment:** In the final days, God’s people must be detached
  from the world.
  - Matthew 6:21 – “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”
- **No Looking Back:**
  - Luke 9:62 – “No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is
    fit for the kingdom of God.”
- **Victory through Faith:** We must have the faith of Abraham, seeking the city
  built by God (Hebrews 11:10).

## Slide 45 – Q15: The Danger of Neglect

- **Question:** When evidently citing these cases, what solemn question does the
  apostle ask?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 2:2–3 – “For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast,
  and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward,
  how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?”

## Slide 46 – Q15: Greater Light, Greater Responsibility

- **The Argument:** If God punished violations of the Old Testament types (“word
  spoken by angels”), how much more serious is it to reject the Son of God?
- **Neglect vs. Rejection:**
  - One does not have to actively fight God to be lost; one simply has to
    _neglect_ the Gospel.
  - We must not drift away (Hebrews 2:1).
- **No Other Way:**
  - Acts 4:12 – “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
    other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”

## Slide 47 – Q15: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - A man who has swallowed poison does not need to drink more poison to die.
  - He simply needs to _neglect_ the antidote.

## Slide 48 – Q16: Willful Sin

- **Question:** What does He say in another place of those who persist in
  willful sins?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 10:26 – “For if we sin willfully after that we have
  received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for
  sins.”

## Slide 49 – Q16: The End of Grace

- **Definition: Willful Sin**
  - A settled determination to continue in disobedience despite knowing the
    truth. It is not a momentary stumble, but a rejection of the Spirit’s
    conviction.
- **No More Sacrifice:**
  - All sacrifices point to Christ. If a man rejects Christ’s power to cleanse
    him, God has no "Plan B."
- **Investigative Judgment:** Just as the door of the Ark closed, there comes a
  point where character is fixed. If we hold onto sin, we cannot hold onto the
  Savior.

## Slide 50 – Q16: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - If a patient tears off his bandages and refuses the surgeon's help, the
    surgeon can do nothing more.
  - It is not that the doctor lacks skill, but that the patient has rejected the
    only cure.

## Slide 51 – Q17: Vain Worship

- **Question:** How does the Saviour regard the worship of those who allow a
  tradition to take the place of one of God's commandments?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 15:9 – “But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for
  doctrines the commandments of men.”

## Slide 52 – Q17: Tradition vs. Truth

- **Vain Worship:** Worship means ascribing "worth" to God. Placing human
  authority above God makes worship empty ("vain").
- **The Controversy:** The issue is authority.
  - **God says:** “Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8).
  - **Tradition says:** Keep the first day.
- **True Discipleship:** We must follow the Lamb (Revelation 14:4) and submit
  every tradition to the test of Scripture.
  - Isaiah 8:20 – “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
    to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”

## Slide 53 – Q17: Illustration

- **Illustration:**
  - A counterfeit watch may look real, tick like the real thing, and have the
    logo.
  - But a master watchmaker will reject it because it did not come from his
    workshop.
  - Man-made doctrines are counterfeit religion; they will not stand in the
    judgment.
