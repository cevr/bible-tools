## Slide 1 – The Home and the Two Spiritual Families

- A Bible Study on the Christian Home and Spiritual Identity
- Based on Scripture and the Great Controversy Theme

---

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Mother’s Influence

- **Question:** By what means may the mother largely bind home hearts together?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 31:26 – “She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her
  tongue is the law of kindness.”

---

## Slide 3 – Q1: Key Points

- **The Queen of the Household:**
  - The mother’s spirit and words largely determine the home’s atmosphere.
  - Her scepter is the “law of kindness.”
- **A Spiritual Principle:**
  - The “law of kindness” is not just a pleasant personality; it is the love of
    Christ (agape) in speech.
  - When God’s law is written in the heart (Hebrews 8:10), kindness flows from
    the tongue.
- **Binding Hearts (Sanctuary Connection):**
  - Just as the High Priest bore the names of Israel on his breastplate near his
    heart (Exodus 28:29), the mother binds the family together.
  - Harsh words scatter; kind words gather.
- **Wisdom from Above:**
  - True wisdom is pure, peaceable, and gentle (James 3:17).
  - Abiding in Christ enables a mother to guide without fretfulness.

---

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Home as a Garden:**
  - Harsh words are like hail that beats down tender plants and stunts their
    growth.
  - Kind words are like dew and gentle rain that nourish the roots.
- **Lesson:**
  - A mother’s kindness creates the climate where children’s souls can grow
    toward the Sun of Righteousness.

---

## Slide 5 – Q2: Encouraging the Mother

- **Question:** Is it proper to speak words of encouragement to the pains taking
  keeper of home?
- **Key Text:** Proverbs 31:28, 31 – “Her children arise up and call her
  blessed: her husband also, and he praiseth her. Give her of the fruit of her
  hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.”

---

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points

- **A Christian Duty:**
  - It is proper and necessary to express gratitude.
  - Domestic work is often unseen and repetitive, requiring patience and
    self-sacrifice.
- **Sanctuary Parallel:**
  - The mother’s daily service resembles the continual ministry in the Holy
    Place—faithfully maintaining the light and bread of the home.
- **Encouragement as Fuel:**
  - Praise brightens the weary heart like oil in a lamp.
  - Neglecting to thank the mother is a form of selfishness.
- **The Fruit of Her Hands:**
  - While salvation is by grace, our works follow us (Revelation 14:13).
  - Faithful discharge of duty is a "fruit" that testifies to genuine faith.

---

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Hidden Stream:**
  - A traveler may drink from a cool spring without thinking of the underground
    stream feeding it.
  - A mother’s love is often that hidden stream.
- **Lesson:**
  - The family must trace the blessing back to its source and say, "Thank you."

---

## Slide 8 – Q3: Mutual Obligations

- **Question:** Is mutual obligation enjoined in a well appointed home?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 6:1-4 – “Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for
  this is right. Honor thy father and mother; which is the first commandment
  with promise; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the
  earth. And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up
  in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.”

---

## Slide 9 – Q3: Key Points (Children)

- **The Home as a School:**
  - The home prepares us for membership in the family of God.
- **Obedience in the Lord:**
  - Parents stand in the place of God to young children.
  - Obedience teaches respect for divine authority.
- **First Commandment with Promise:**
  - Refers to the Fifth Commandment (Exodus 20:12).
  - Connects spiritual honor with temporal blessing and longevity.

---

## Slide 10 – Q3: Key Points (Parents)

- **Parental Restraint:**
  - Fathers must not "provoke" children with arbitrary or harsh authority.
  - God’s law is a law of love; parental authority must reflect this.
- **Nurture and Admonition:**
  - _Nurture:_ Providing for physical and emotional needs (tenderness).
  - _Admonition:_ Instruction and discipline (firmness).
- **Goal of Training:**
  - Admonition implies teaching the child to reason from cause to effect, not
    just blind submission.

---

## Slide 11 – Q3: Illustration

- **The Young Tree:**
  - A young tree must be staked to grow straight.
  - Bound too tightly: The rope cuts the bark and kills the tree (provoking
    wrath).
  - Bound too loosely: The wind blows the tree over (lack of discipline).
- **Lesson:**
  - The godly parent finds the balance of love and law to guide the child
    upward.

---

## Slide 12 – Q4: The Two Families

- **Question:** In what scriptures are two families brought to view?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 13:38 – “The field is the world; the good seed are the
  children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.”
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:10 – “In this the children of God are manifest, and the
  children of the Devil.”

---

## Slide 13 – Q4: Key Points

- **Only Two Spiritual Families:**
  - Despite earthly divisions, spiritually there are only:
    - **Children of the Kingdom (Wheat):** Those who receive Christ and His
      righteousness.
    - **Children of the Wicked One (Tares):** Those who remain in rebellion.
- **The Great Controversy:**
  - There is no neutral ground; we are either gathering with Christ or
    scattering.
- **The Harvest:**
  - Tares may resemble wheat (having a form of religion), but the judgment
    reveals the true nature.

---

## Slide 14 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Magnet Factory:**
  - A piece of metal may look like a magnet and sit in the same box.
  - However, only the one with the magnetic charge attracts the steel.
- **Lesson:**
  - Only the life of Christ (the magnetic charge) distinguishes the true child
    of God from the formal professor.

---

## Slide 15 – Q5: Marks of God’s Children

- **Question:** How are the children of God manifest?

  will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.”

---

## Slide 16 – Q5: Key Points (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The New Birth:**
  - To be "born of God" is to receive a new nature that loves righteousness (2
    Peter 1:4).
  - "Doth not commit sin" means one does not practice or cherish sin as a habit.
- **Obedience by Love:**
  - We do not obey to _become_ children; we obey because we _are_ children.
  - Love and commandment-keeping are inseparable.
- **Victory is Possible:**
  - God’s biddings are enablings.
  - **Sanctification:** The daily process of dying to self and living to Christ,
    reflecting God's law more fully (Romans 8:3-4).

---

## Slide 17 – Q6: Marks of the Wicked

- **Question:** How may the children of the wicked one be known?
- **Key Text:** 1 John 3:8 – “He that committeth sin is of the Devil.”
- **Key Text:** John 8:44 – “Ye are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of
  your father ye will do.”

---

## Slide 18 – Q6: Key Points

- **Spiritual Parentage:**
  - "Of the Devil" indicates the source of one's character.
  - Cherishing hatred or falsehood aligns one with Satan's nature.
- **Committing Sin:**
  - Living in continuous violation of God’s law (1 John 3:4).
- **Lusts of the Father:**
  - Selfishness, pride, and covetousness.
  - Even a refined person living entirely for self is a child of the enemy in
    Heaven's eyes.

---

## Slide 19 – Q6: Illustration

    for the world reveals the true nature.

---

## Slide 20 – Q7: Counterfeit Believers

- **Question:** Are there counterfeit children of God?
- **Key Text:** 2 Timothy 3:5 – “Having a form of godliness, but denying the
  power thereof.”
- **Key Text:** Titus 1:16 – “They profess that they know God, but in works,
  they deny Him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work
  reprobate.”

---

## Slide 21 – Q7: Key Points

- **The Form vs. The Power:**
  - **Form:** Rituals, doctrines, outward habits.
  - **Power:** The Holy Spirit cleansing the heart from the love of sin.
- **Laodicean Condition:**
  - Feeling rich and increased with goods, yet spiritually naked (Revelation
    3:17).
- **Faith and Works:**
  - A profession without a transformed life is a lie.
  - True faith always produces works of love and obedience (James 2:20).

---

- **Key Text:** Matthew 7:20 – “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.”

---

## Slide 23 – Q8: Key Points

- **God’s Test:**
  - Since we cannot read hearts, we must look at the "fruit."
  - **The Fruit:** Galatians 5:22-23 (Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, etc.).
- **Consistency:**
  - A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.
  - Truth must be matched by a life of integrity.
- **The Life Test:**
  - The question is not about emotional ecstasy or doctrinal knowledge.
  - The question is: "Is the character of Christ seen in the daily life?"

---

## Slide 24 – Q8: Illustration

- **Dead Branch vs. Living Branch:**
  - You can tie apples onto a dead branch, but they will rot and fall.
  - A living branch produces apples naturally from within.
- **Lesson:**
  - A counterfeit Christian adds deeds as ornaments.
  - A true Christian grows fruit because they are connected to the Vine (Jesus).

---

- **Question:** To what family do they belong who are not the children of God?
- **Key Text:** Ephesians 2:1-3 – “And you hath He quickened who were dead in
  trespasses and sins, ...and were by nature the children of wrath, even as
  others.”

---

## Slide 26 – Q9: Key Points

- **The Family of Adam:**
  - By default, all are born into a fallen, broken race.
- **Children of Wrath:**
  - Our nature is opposed to God's law.
  - Unchanged, this nature cannot survive the glory of God's holiness.
- **Dead in Trespasses:**
  - We possess biological life but lack spiritual life.
- **The Need for Regeneration:**

  - We need **Justification** (forgiveness) and a **New Heart**.

---

## Slide 27 – Q10: The Way of Escape

- **Question:** If one desires to escape from the snare of the enemy, what must
  he do?
- **Key Text:** James 4:7, 8 – “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the
  Devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to
  you.”

---

## Slide 28 – Q10: Key Points (Victory over Sin)

- **Cooperative Work:**
  - **Submit:** Yield the will to God (death to self).
  - **Resist:** Actively say "No" to temptation relying on the Spirit’s power.
- **Sanctuary Application:**
  - **Draw Nigh:** Through prayer and looking to Jesus in the heavenly
    sanctuary.
- **The Promise:**

---

## Slide 29 – Q10: Illustration

- **The Bully and the Father:**
  - A small child cannot fight a large tyrant alone.
  - If the child runs and stands behind his mighty Father, the tyrant flees.
- **Lesson:**
  - The tyrant flees because of the Father's presence, not the child's strength.
    Submission is running to the Father.

---

  bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.”

---

## Slide 33 – Q12: Key Points
