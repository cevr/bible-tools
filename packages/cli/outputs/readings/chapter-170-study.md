# Bible Study: The Marriage Institution—God's Unchanging Plan

## Introduction

Marriage stands as one of Eden's twin gifts to humanity—instituted alongside the Sabbath before sin entered the world. This study traces God's original design for marriage through Scripture, examining how the enemy has sought to counterfeit and corrupt it, and how God has consistently upheld His plan across all generations. Understanding marriage as God designed it reveals profound truths about His character, His relationship with His people, and His purpose for human happiness.

## Core Truths

### The Divine Origin of Marriage

Marriage did not evolve from human custom or cultural necessity—it came directly from the hand of God in Eden's perfection.

> _"And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man."_ (Genesis 2:22)

Like the Sabbath, marriage was established before the fall, marking it as part of God's ideal for humanity—not a remedy for sin, but an expression of divine wisdom and love.

[DYK🔎] Marriage and the Sabbath are the only two institutions that have come down to us from Eden. Both were given when mankind was sinless, both were blessed by God, and both have been attacked and counterfeited by Satan throughout history.

### God's Twofold Purpose

The Creator established marriage for two beautiful reasons:

**First: To populate the earth with godly offspring**

> _"Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it."_ (Genesis 1:28)

> _"He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited."_ (Isaiah 45:18)

**Second: To provide companionship and mutual help**

> _"It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him."_ (Genesis 2:18)

God looked upon Adam in Eden's perfection—surrounded by beauty, in communion with his Maker, possessing every good thing—and declared something "not good." Man needed the refinement and companionship that comes from union with woman. This was not Adam's weakness but God's design.

### The Original Plan: One Man, One Woman

To accomplish His purpose, God ordained a specific arrangement:

> _"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."_ (Genesis 2:24)

> _"They two shall be one flesh."_ (Ephesians 5:31)

Notice the singular language throughout Scripture: "his wife" (not wives), "they two" (not three or more), "one flesh" (not divided loyalties). God created one woman for Adam—not two, not several, but one. This establishes the divine pattern for all time.

[ILL] When God fashioned Eve, He did not form her from Adam's head to rule over him, nor from his feet to be trampled by him, but from his side—to walk beside him, near his heart—to be loved, protected, and cherished as his equal partner in life's journey.

## Deeper Truths

### The Origin of the Counterfeit

Every truth of God has its satanic counterfeit, and marriage is no exception. Scripture traces polygamy to a specific lineage:

> _"And Lamech took unto him two wives."_ (Genesis 4:19)

Who was Lamech? Tracing his ancestry reveals he was the sixth generation from Cain—the murderer. Lamech himself boasted of killing a man (Genesis 4:23). The pattern is unmistakable: polygamy originated not among the faithful but among those whose father Jesus identified:

> _"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth."_ (John 8:44)

**Let this be forever remembered: In the beginning, the Creator gave one wife; the devil gave two.**

[Q] **"But didn't God permit polygamy among His people in the Old Testament?"**

This question deserves careful consideration. We must distinguish between what God _permits_ and what He _approves_. God permitted divorce, but Jesus said it was "because of the hardness of your hearts" and was never part of the original plan (Matthew 19:8). Similarly, God's dealings with polygamists in Scripture show His mercy toward sinners, not His endorsement of their sin.

Consider the evidence:

- God never commanded any man to take multiple wives
- Every clear statement of God's design specifies one wife
- The few prominent men who practiced polygamy suffered severe consequences
- When God needed to restart humanity (Noah) or establish a covenant line (Abraham's call), He worked through monogamous unions

### The Corruption Before the Flood

The counterfeit spread like a plague:

> _"The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose."_ (Genesis 6:2)

The phrase "of all which they chose" suggests unrestrained, lustful selection—multiple wives chosen for physical beauty rather than godly character. What was the result?

> _"God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted His way upon the earth."_ (Genesis 6:12)

Note carefully: they corrupted "His way." God's way was one wife. Corrupting His way brought plurality and licentiousness, until:

> _"The earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth."_ (Genesis 6:13)

This is the first great era of contest between God's original design and Satan's counterfeit—ending in the flood.

### God's Plan Reaffirmed Through Noah

When God preserved humanity through the flood, what pattern did He establish?

> _"In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark."_ (Genesis 7:13)

Four men. Four wives. The monogamous pattern preserved through judgment. And Noah's character?

> _"Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God."_ (Genesis 6:9)

[DYK🔎] Some have speculated that Noah or his sons might have had other wives who weren't permitted on the ark. But Scripture closes this door: "Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me" (Genesis 7:1). Everyone belonging to Noah's household entered—there were no excluded polygamous wives.

### The Case of Abraham

When God called Abraham to father the covenant people, He chose a man with one wife:

> _"Abram took Sarai his wife... and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan."_ (Genesis 12:5)

Why one wife? The prophet Malachi answers:

> _"Wherefore one? That He might seek a godly seed."_ (Malachi 2:15)

[Q] **"But didn't Abraham have Hagar as a second wife?"**

This is one of the most misunderstood passages in Scripture. Let us examine it carefully:

When Sarah, lacking faith in God's promise, gave Hagar to Abraham, did this make Hagar his wife? Consider how every person involved—including God—referred to Hagar afterward:

- **Sarah** called her "my maid" and "this bondwoman"—never "your wife" or "my co-wife"
- **Abraham** called her "thy maid" when speaking to Sarah—not "my wife"
- **Hagar** referred to Sarah as "my mistress"—the language of servant, not co-wife
- **The angel** called her "Sarai's maid" and said "Return unto thy mistress"—not "unto thy husband"
- **God Himself** by inspiration called her "Hagar the Egyptian" and "bondwoman"—never "wife"

Abraham's second wife was Keturah, married after Sarah's death (Genesis 23:1-2; 25:1). Rather than being a polygamist, Abraham committed adultery at his wife's instigation—a grievous sin, but not the same as polygamy.

What happened immediately after this failure?

> _"When Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before Me, and be thou perfect."_ (Genesis 17:1)

This divine call to perfection came right after his sin. And Abraham's response?

> _"Abram fell on his face."_ (Genesis 17:3)

Unlike Cain and his descendants who justified their sins, Abraham humbled himself. He was blessed not because of his failures but because of his repentance and faith.

### The Painful Lessons of Jacob, David, and Solomon

**Jacob's Experience**

Jacob was commanded to take one wife (Genesis 28:1-2). But through Laban's deception and his own unwillingness to accept God's providence, he ended up with two wives and their handmaids. The results?

- Envy between sisters (Genesis 30:1)
- Jealousy and rivalry (Genesis 30:8)
- Strife in the household (Genesis 30:15)
- Children raised in conflict
- A life summarized in his own words:

> _"Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been."_ (Genesis 47:9)

Jacob was blessed not because of his polygamy but because of that night by the brook Jabbok, when he wrestled with God in repentance and confession, and "He blessed him there" (Genesis 32:29).

**David's Tragedy**

Was David blessed for his plurality of wives?

> _"Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in His sight?... Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house."_ (2 Samuel 12:9-10)

God called David's actions "evil" and contrary to His "commandment." The consequences followed David for the rest of his life—rape, murder, and rebellion within his own family.

[Q] **"But Scripture says David did what was right in God's eyes."**

Yes, and the same passage adds "save only in the matter of Uriah" (1 Kings 15:5). These statements describe David's general character and direction, not his every action. David also sinned by numbering Israel, bringing plague upon 70,000 people. The Bible's endorsements of David's character don't approve every deed but acknowledge his overall heart toward God—especially his profound repentance:

> _"I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin."_ (Psalm 32:5)

**Solomon's Downfall**

Solomon's case is perhaps the clearest warning:

> _"His wives turned away his heart after other gods... And the Lord was angry with Solomon... Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept My covenant and My statutes... I will surely rend the kingdom from thee."_ (1 Kings 11:4, 9, 11)

The wisest man became the greatest fool through polygamy. His seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines led directly to idolatry and the kingdom's division.

[ILL] These three men—Jacob, David, Solomon—stand as monuments to both human weakness and divine grace. Their dark failures are recorded not for imitation but for warning. Their conflicts with evil, their prayers for help, their humility and repentance secured Heaven's favor. We should study their repentance as carefully as their sins.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Unchanging Character of God

Throughout history, Satan has sought to corrupt every good gift of God. The great controversy is fought not only over worship and salvation but over the fundamental institutions God established for human blessing.

When we see God's plan corrupted—whether the Sabbath, marriage, or any other divine institution—we witness Satan's work, not divine change. God declares:

> _"I am the Lord, I change not."_ (Malachi 3:6)

His original design for marriage remains His design today. What was established in Eden's perfection reflects eternal principles of love, loyalty, and unity that mirror the relationship between Christ and His church (Ephesians 5:25-32).

### No Divine License for Polygamy

Some have attempted to find divine permission for polygamy in Scripture. Let us examine the passages used:

**Exodus 21:9-10** — The word "wife" in verse 10 is not in the original Hebrew. The passage addresses betrothal customs, not permission for multiple wives. And even if the word belonged there, "if" statements in law describe how to handle situations that occur—not what God commands or approves. "If a man steal an ox" (Exodus 22:1) doesn't mean stealing is approved.

**Deuteronomy 25:5** — The levirate marriage law required an _unmarried_ kinsman to marry a brother's childless widow. Boaz, who married Ruth under this law, was unmarried. Not a single instance exists where God counseled a married man to take a second wife.

**Isaiah 4:1** — This prophecy of "seven women taking hold of one man" describes a future condition of scarcity and desperation—not God's ideal. Prophecies of evil don't constitute divine approval. Absalom's rebellion and Judas's betrayal were also prophesied.

### God's Original Plan Sustained

From Genesis through the New Testament, the consistent testimony upholds God's original design:

**Moses:** _"Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her... in her lifetime."_ (Leviticus 18:18, with margin reading "one wife to another")

**Malachi:** _"Let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. For the Lord, the God of Israel, saith that He hateth putting away."_ (Malachi 2:15-16)

**Christ:** _"From the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh."_ (Mark 10:6-8)

**Paul:** _"Let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself."_ (Ephesians 5:33)

The apostle's instruction that bishops and deacons be "the husband of one wife" (1 Timothy 3:2, 12) doesn't suggest others in the church could have multiple wives. Rather, it means that if polygamists converted and joined the church, they should not serve in leadership positions requiring "blameless" men. God has never chosen a polygamist for special, important work.

[DYK🔎] From Adam to the present time, thousands of cases are recorded of conformity to God's marriage plan, against only a handful of instances of polygamy among God's people. The exceptions prove the rule—and each exception brought sorrow, not blessing.

## Practical Application

### For Those Considering Marriage

1. **Seek God's choice, not merely your own**. Abraham sent his servant to find a wife for Isaac with prayer and divine guidance (Genesis 24). Marriage is too important for impulse or infatuation alone.

2. **Choose a partner who shares your faith**. Isaac charged Jacob: "Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan" (Genesis 28:1). Paul echoed: "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers" (2 Corinthians 6:14).

3. **Enter marriage with commitment to permanence**. Jesus said, "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder" (Matthew 19:6). Marriage is not a trial arrangement but a covenant for life.

### For Those Who Are Married

1. **Treasure your spouse as God's gift**. Eve was God's gift to Adam—formed by divine hands, brought to him by the Creator Himself. Your spouse, whatever their imperfections, is entrusted to you by God.

2. **Guard your marriage against all counterfeits**. Satan still attacks marriage through unfaithfulness, pornography, emotional affairs, and countless subtle corruptions. "Take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously" (Malachi 2:15).

3. **Let Christ's love for the church model your love**. "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it" (Ephesians 5:25). This is self-sacrificing, purifying, sanctifying love.

### For All Believers

1. **Uphold God's standard without condemning the fallen**. The same Jesus who affirmed lifelong monogamy offered living water to the Samaritan woman with five husbands. Truth and grace must walk together.

2. **Recognize marriage as preparation for heaven**. The love, trust, self-denial, and unity cultivated in godly marriage prepare us for the eternal union between Christ and His redeemed.

3. **Trust God's design even when culture contradicts it**. In Noah's day, in Lot's day, and in our day, the world mocks God's standards. "Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions" (Ecclesiastes 7:29).

## Appeal

> _"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."_ (Mark 10:9)

The marriage institution, like the Sabbath, bears the fingerprints of Eden. Both came from the Creator's hand when humanity was sinless, both have been attacked and corrupted by Satan, and both will be restored in the earth made new.

God's plan has never changed. From Adam and Eve, through Noah's family, through Abraham and Sarah, through the teachings of Christ and the apostles, the testimony is consistent: one man, one woman, united for life.

The counterfeits have always brought sorrow. The original has always brought blessing—not because marriage is easy, but because walking in God's way brings His presence, His power, and His peace.

Perhaps you have failed to honor marriage as God designed. Perhaps your past includes broken vows, unfaithfulness, or relationships outside God's plan. Remember Abraham falling on his face. Remember David's broken and contrite heart. Remember that these men were blessed not because of their failures but because of their repentance.

Whatever your past, God's grace is sufficient. Whatever your present, His design is still best. Whatever your future, His plan will bring blessing.

Will you commit today—whether single, engaged, or married—to honor God's original design? Will you trust that the One who created marriage knows best how it should be lived? Will you bring your relationships, your struggles, your hopes to Him who said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10)?

The God who instituted marriage in Eden's perfection desires to bless your home with Eden's peace. Surrender your heart to Him, and let His love transform your relationships into reflections of heavenly union.
