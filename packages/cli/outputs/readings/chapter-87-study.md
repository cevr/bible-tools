# Reading 87: The Manner of Observing the Sabbath

## Introduction

God has not only commanded us to keep the Sabbath holy, but He has graciously shown us _how_ to keep it. The Sabbath is not a burden to be endured but a blessing to be embraced—a sacred appointment with our Creator. Understanding the manner of its observance transforms the Sabbath from mere duty into delight, revealing the heart of a God who desires intimate fellowship with His children.

## Core Truths

### When the Sabbath Begins and Ends

Scripture is remarkably clear about how God reckons a day. From the very first page of Genesis, we learn the divine pattern:

> _"And the evening and the morning were the first day."_ (Genesis 1:5)

The biblical day begins at evening, not at midnight as in modern reckoning. But when precisely does evening begin? Moses leaves no doubt:

> _"There thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at even, at the going down of the sun."_ (Deuteronomy 16:6)

The New Testament confirms this understanding. Mark records that the people waited until the Sabbath had ended before bringing their sick to Jesus:

> _"And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto Him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils."_ (Mark 1:32)

The Day of Atonement provides perhaps the clearest instruction of all:

> _"In the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath."_ (Leviticus 23:32)

**The principle is unmistakable**: If the tenth day began at the evening of the ninth day at sunset, then the seventh-day Sabbath always begins at sunset on the sixth day (Friday evening) and ends at sunset on the seventh day (Saturday evening).

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "evening" (_ereb_) comes from a root meaning "to grow dark" or "to become mixed"—describing that sacred moment when daylight mingles with darkness at sunset. This twilight transition marked the holy threshold between ordinary time and Sabbath rest.

### The Preparation Day

God, in His wisdom, established not only the Sabbath but also a day of preparation:

> _"And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on."_ (Luke 23:54)

The sixth day is called "the preparation" because it is designated for making ready for the Sabbath. This principle was taught powerfully through the manna in the wilderness:

> _"And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man."_ (Exodus 16:22)

God provided a double portion on Friday so that no gathering would be necessary on His holy day. The instruction was explicit:

> _"Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord; bake that which ye will bake today, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning."_ (Exodus 16:23)

And on the seventh day:

> _"Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there shall be none."_ (Exodus 16:26)

[ILL] Consider a family preparing to receive honored guests. They do not wait until the guests arrive to begin cooking, cleaning, and making arrangements. Rather, they prepare everything beforehand so that when the guests arrive, the hosts are free to give undivided attention to fellowship. So it is with the Sabbath—we prepare beforehand that we might give our undivided attention to the heavenly Guest who comes to meet with us.

### Work Permitted and Forbidden

The fourth commandment distinguishes between ordinary work and Sabbath activity:

> _"Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work."_ (Exodus 20:9)

Whatever secular yet lawful work presents itself during the week may be freely pursued on any of the six working days. This is called "thy work"—our own business, our personal pursuits, our temporal affairs.

[Q] **"Is any kind of labor lawful on the Sabbath?"**

Jesus Himself answered this question:

> _"Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days."_ (Matthew 12:12)

To demonstrate His meaning, Christ healed a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath (Matthew 12:13). Disinterested works of mercy—toward both man and beast—are always in place on God's holy day. The Saviour also noted that the priests performed arduous labor in the temple on the Sabbath without guilt (Matthew 12:5), because it was the Lord's work, not their own.

**The distinction is this**: Personal, secular work for temporal gain is forbidden. Work done in service to God or in merciful ministry to others honors the Sabbath's purpose.

## Deeper Truths

### The Sabbath as Holy Convocation

Beyond mere cessation from labor, God intended the Sabbath for sacred assembly:

> _"Six days shall work be done; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation."_ (Leviticus 23:3)

The Hebrew word for "convocation" (_miqra_) means "a calling together"—a sacred assembly where God's people gather in His presence. The Sabbath was never meant to be observed in isolation but in community with fellow believers.

Jesus exemplified this principle perfectly:

> _"And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read."_ (Luke 4:16)

Notice the phrase "as His custom was." Sabbath worship was not occasional for Christ—it was habitual. He regularly gathered with God's people to study Scripture and commune with His Father.

[DYK🔎] The word "synagogue" comes from the Greek _synagōgē_, meaning "a bringing together." The synagogue existed primarily for Sabbath instruction in the Scriptures. Jesus' faithful attendance established the pattern for all who would follow Him.

### The Spirit of Sabbath Observance

Isaiah provides the most comprehensive instruction regarding the spirit in which the Sabbath should be kept:

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words."_ (Isaiah 58:13)

This remarkable passage reveals several principles:

**"Turn away thy foot from the Sabbath"** — Do not trample upon its sacred hours with secular pursuits. The foot represents our direction, our path, our choices. We are to consciously redirect our steps from worldly paths to holy ones.

**"From doing thy pleasure on My holy day"** — The Sabbath is not primarily about _our_ pleasure but about _His_ pleasure. It is "My holy day," says the Lord. Our personal amusements and entertainments give way to pursuits that honor God.

**"Call the Sabbath a delight"** — Yet paradoxically, when we cease seeking our own pleasure and seek God's instead, we discover true delight! The Sabbath becomes not a burden but a blessing, not a restriction but a liberation.

**"Not doing thine own ways"** — Our routine patterns of living are set aside. The Sabbath is different—set apart—in its very rhythm.

**"Nor finding thine own pleasure"** — Our personal amusements and diversions are put away for this sacred time.

**"Nor speaking thine own words"** — Even our conversation is elevated. Idle talk, business discussions, worldly gossip—all these are replaced by words of faith, praise, and spiritual edification.

[Q] **"Does this mean the Sabbath is restrictive and joyless?"**

Not at all! Notice that God calls it "a delight" and "honorable." The restrictions are not negative but protective—like guardrails on a mountain road that free the traveler to enjoy the journey without fear. When we cease pursuing our own pleasure, we discover God's pleasure, which far surpasses anything the world offers. The Sabbath is liberating rest, not legalistic burden.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Sabbath and the Sanctuary

The manner of Sabbath observance reflects the sanctuary's deeper meaning. In the earthly sanctuary, the priests performed their sacred duties even on the Sabbath—for the Sabbath service was God's service, not their own. The showbread was changed every Sabbath (Leviticus 24:8), and the daily sacrifices continued (Numbers 28:9-10).

In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ our High Priest ministers continually for us. The Sabbath calls us to pause from our labors and by faith enter into His rest (Hebrews 4:9-10). We cease from our own works of righteousness even as God ceased from His works of creation. The Sabbath thus becomes a weekly rehearsal of righteousness by faith—resting entirely in what God has done, not in what we can do.

[ILL] A man exhausted from attempting to swim across a great river finally gives up his struggle and discovers a boat waiting at the shore. The boat carries him effortlessly to the other side while he rests. The Sabbath is God's weekly invitation to stop our own struggling and rest in the vessel of His grace. We cannot work our way to heaven; we can only rest in the One who carries us there.

### Sabbath and the Great Controversy

In the great conflict between Christ and Satan, the Sabbath stands as a perpetual sign of loyalty to the Creator. Satan has attacked the Sabbath because it points to God's authority as Maker of heaven and earth. The manner of our Sabbath observance reveals whom we worship—whether we honor God's way or our own.

Those who keep the Sabbath "from even unto even," who prepare beforehand, who gather for holy convocation, who turn from their own ways and words and pleasures—these demonstrate that God's law can be kept, that His commandments are not grievous, and that His people can be loyal to Him even in a world of rebellion.

## Practical Application

### Preparing for the Sabbath

- **Begin preparation early on Friday**: Cooking, cleaning, and temporal business should be completed before sunset.
- **Bathe and dress in clean clothing**: The Sabbath deserves our best, not our leftovers.
- **Gather the family at sunset**: Mark the Sabbath's beginning with prayer, Scripture reading, and song.
- **Review the week with gratitude**: Thank God for His mercies and commit the new Sabbath hours to His service.

### During the Sabbath Hours

- **Attend holy convocation**: Gather with fellow believers for worship, study, and fellowship.
- **Engage in acts of mercy**: Visit the sick, encourage the discouraged, minister to those in need.
- **Study God's Word**: The Sabbath provides unhurried time for deeper Scripture study.
- **Commune with nature**: God's second book reveals His character and refreshes the soul.
- **Rest from secular concerns**: Set aside business discussions, worldly news, and temporal anxieties.
- **Elevate conversation**: Let words be seasoned with grace—talk of eternal things.

### Closing the Sabbath

- **Mark the Sabbath's close at sunset**: As the holy hours end, thank God for the blessing received.
- **Carry the Sabbath spirit forward**: Let the rest and renewal of the Sabbath strengthen you for the week ahead.

## Appeal

> _"If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord."_ (Isaiah 58:13-14)

The promise is sure: those who honor God's Sabbath will "delight themselves in the Lord." The Sabbath is not a test to pass but a gift to receive—a weekly appointment with our Creator, a foretaste of eternal rest.

Will you determine today to keep the Sabbath as God intended? Not as a burden, but as a blessing? Not in legalistic anxiety, but in joyful surrender? The same God who rested on the seventh day and hallowed it now invites you into His rest. Come, weary soul—the Sabbath awaits, and with it, the Sabbath's Lord.
