### Q1. How are all commanded to keep the Sabbath?

**“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy." Ex. 20:8.**

**Answer:**

The command begins with the word "Remember," implying that this institution was
already known but in danger of being forgotten. To keep the Sabbath "holy" means
to preserve the distinction God placed upon it at Creation.

1.  **The Source of Holiness:** God alone is holy (Isaiah 6:3). Man cannot
    _make_ a day holy; he can only _keep_ holy what God has already sanctified.
    - **Sanctification:** The act of setting something apart for a holy or
      sacred use. God sanctified the seventh day at Creation (Genesis 2:3).
2.  **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** Just as we cannot create a holy day,
    we cannot create a holy character. We "keep" the Sabbath by faith, entering
    into God’s finished work of Creation, just as we enter into His finished
    work of Redemption (Hebrews 4:3–4, 9–10).
3.  **The Sanctuary in Time:** The Sabbath is a "sanctuary in time." Just as the
    tabernacle was a holy space set apart for God’s presence (Exodus 25:8), the
    Sabbath is a holy time set apart for communion with the Creator.

**[ILL]** Imagine a king sets out a golden cup and says, "This cup is dedicated
only for my use." If a servant uses it to drink common water or scrubs it with
dirty rags, he has not "kept it holy." To keep it holy, he must treat it
differently than the common cups, using it only for the purpose the king
intended. So it is with the Sabbath; we keep it holy by using it for God's
purposes—worship, rest, and ministry—rather than our common business.

### Q2. What constitutes a day?

**“The evening and the morning were the first day." Gen. 1:5, 8, 13.**

**Answer:**

In God's reckoning, the day begins with the dark part (evening) and ends with
the light part (morning). This order was established at Creation and remains the
biblical standard for marking time.

1.  **Biblical Definition:** A biblical day consists of a twenty-four-hour
    period beginning at sunset.
2.  **Countering Tradition:** Modern reckoning begins the day at midnight, a
    Roman custom. However, the Bible student follows God’s clock, not man’s.
3.  **Spiritual Lesson:** There is a beautiful spiritual lesson in the sequence
    of "evening and morning." We often begin in the darkness of sin or trial,
    but God brings us into the light of His presence. "Weeping may endure for a
    night, but joy cometh in the morning" (Psalm 30:5).

---

### Q3. When does the evening begin?

**“But the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place His name in, there
thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at even, at the going down of the sun." Deut.
16:6.**

**Answer:**

Scripture defines "even" (evening) as the precise moment of the "going down of
the sun."

1.  **Objective Standard:** God gave the sun to rule the day (Genesis 1:16). The
    boundary of the Sabbath is marked by the movement of the heavenly bodies,
    not by a mechanical clock.
2.  **Universality:** This mark works everywhere on earth. When the sun sets,
    holy time begins.
3.  **Reverence:** As the sun nears the horizon on the sixth day, the believer
    lays aside secular cares. It is a call to shift focus from the work of the
    hands to the work of the heart.

**[ILL]** If a loyal subject has an appointment with the King at a specific
signal, he watches for that signal intently. He does not delay until he feels
like it. When the sun sets, God’s appointment begins. To continue common labor
past this point is to steal time that belongs to the King of kings.

---

### Q4. How does the New Testament state this point?

**“And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto Him all that were
diseased, and them that were possessed with devils." Mark 1:32.**

**Answer:**

The New Testament confirms the Old Testament timing. The people waited until
"the sun did set" to bring their sick burdens to Jesus because they understood
the Sabbath hours ended at sunset.

1.  **Consistency of Scripture:** There is no change in the reckoning of time
    from the Old Testament to the New.
2.  **Respect for Law:** Even in their eagerness to be healed, the people
    respected the edges of the Sabbath. While Jesus taught that doing _good_
    (healing) is lawful on the Sabbath, the people’s action here demonstrates
    the common understanding of when the day ended.

### Q5. When did the tenth day of the seventh month begin?

**“Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of
atonement... It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your
souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye
celebrate your sabbath." Lev. 23:27-32.**

**Answer:**

This text establishes the "even-to-even" principle for the observance of
Sabbaths. The Day of Atonement—the most solemn day of the year—was kept from the
evening of the ninth day until the evening of the tenth.

1.  **The Sanctuary Connection:** This text links the Sabbath to the **Day of
    Atonement**.
    - **Atonement:** The work of reconciliation between God and man. In the type
      (earthly sanctuary), this was the cleansing of the sanctuary. In the
      antitype (heaven), it is Christ’s final work of judgment and blotting out
      of sin (Daniel 8:14).
2.  **Afflicting the Soul:** This refers to deep searching of heart, repentance,
    and turning away from sin.
3.  **RBF Application:** Just as the ancient Israelites rested and "afflicted
    their souls" while the High Priest worked in the Most Holy Place, we today
    are living in the great antitypical Day of Atonement. We rest in Christ’s
    merits (Sabbath principle) while cooperating with Him in the removal of sin
    from our lives (Sanctification).

### Q6. What kind of labor is permitted through the week?

**“Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work." Ex. 20:9.**

**Answer:**

God grants us six days for "thy work"—secular, honest labor to sustain life and
society.

1.  **The Dignity of Labor:** The commandment to work is as binding as the
    commandment to rest. Idleness is not holiness. God Himself is a worker (John
    5:17).
2.  **Stewardship:** We are to be diligent in business (Romans 12:11), providing
    for our own house (1 Timothy 5:8).
3.  **Distinction:** This labor is called "thy work." It is the work for our own
    profit and sustenance. The Sabbath is for "God's work."

---

### Q7. Is any kind of labor lawful on the Sabbath?

**“Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days." Matt.12:12.**

**Answer:**

Yes, deeds of mercy, necessity, and ministry are lawful. The Sabbath was made
for man, not man for the Sabbath (Mark 2:27).

1.  **"To Do Well":** This encompasses saving life, relieving suffering, and the
    work of the gospel.
2.  **Legalism vs. Love:** The Pharisees had burdened the Sabbath with man-made
    rules, making it a yoke of bondage. Jesus restored its true intent: a day of
    freedom and blessing.
    - **Legalism:** Attempting to earn favor with God by strict adherence to
      rules without the heart of love.
3.  **Sanctuary Ministry:** The priests in the temple worked harder on the
    Sabbath than any other day (Numbers 28:9–10), offering double sacrifices.
    This shows that spiritual activity and service to God are not "secular
    labor."

**[ILL]** If a sheep falls into a pit on the Sabbath, the owner pulls it out.
Why? Because the creature is suffering. The Sabbath is a day of restoration. If
we can help a suffering neighbor or comfort a sorrowing heart, we are doing the
work of Jesus, which is appropriate for the Lord's Day.

### Q8. What example did the Saviour give to show the meaning of His words?

**“Then saith He to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it
forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other." Matt. 12:13.**

**Answer:**

Jesus healed the man with the withered hand, demonstrating that the Sabbath is a
day for restoration and spiritual power.

1.  **Power to Obey:** The man could not stretch out his hand by his own power.
    But when Christ commanded, "Stretch forth," the man believed, willed to
    obey, and the power came.
    - **Righteousness by Faith:** This is a perfect picture of the gospel. God
      commands the impossible (perfect obedience to His law). In our own
      strength (the withered hand), we cannot do it. But when we claim His
      promise and choose to obey, He supplies the power.
2.  **Restoration:** The Sabbath is a memorial of Creation. Healing restores the
    body to its created intent; therefore, healing honors the Creator of the
    Sabbath.

---

### Q9. What is the day before the Sabbath called?

**“And that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath drew on." Luke 23:54.**

**Answer:**

The sixth day (Friday) is biblically designated as "the preparation."

1.  **Preparation for Holiness:** You cannot enter the Sabbath rest abruptly
    from the rush of business. The heart and the home must be prepared.
2.  **Sanctuary Type:** Before the priest entered the sanctuary, he had to wash
    at the laver (Exodus 30:19–21). Before we enter the holy time of the
    Sabbath, we "wash" away our secular cares and prepare our environment.
3.  **Practical Godliness:** This includes practical duties—cooking, cleaning,
    and bathing—so that the Sabbath hours are not consumed by common chores.

**[ILL]** If a bride expects her groom to arrive at sunset, she does not wait
until the sun goes down to start putting on her wedding dress or cleaning the
house. She prepares all day so that when he arrives, she is free to sit with him
and enjoy his company. Friday is the day we prepare to meet the Lord in His holy
time.

### Q10. On which day did the Israelites receive their Sabbath supply of manna?

**“And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread,
two omers for one man." Ex. 16:22.**

**Answer:**

On Friday, God performed a weekly miracle by providing a double portion of
manna.

1.  **Providence:** God takes responsibility for the needs of those who obey His
    commands. If we stop working to keep the Sabbath, He ensures our needs are
    met.
2.  **The Test of Faith:** It required faith to gather double. A skeptic might
    fear the food would rot (as it did on other days), but faith trusts God's
    word.

---

### Q11. What instruction did they receive regarding this double supply of food?

**“And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, Tomorrow is the
rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord; bake that which ye will bake today, and
seethe [boil] that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you
to be kept until the morning." Ex. 16:23.**

**Answer:**

The instruction was clear: all heavy cooking and baking was to be done on the
preparation day (Friday).

1.  **Relieving Burdens:** This command was an act of mercy, specifically to
    those who prepared the food (often the women in the household). God wanted
    _everyone_ to rest, not just the head of the house.
2.  **Simplicity of Diet:** On the Sabbath, we should have simple, palatable
    food that requires little effort to serve.
3.  **Sanctuary Order:** God is a God of order. The "Showbread" in the sanctuary
    was replaced every Sabbath (Leviticus 24:8), having been prepared
    beforehand.

---

### Q12. Was there any day in which the manna did not fall?

**“Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in
it there shall be none." Ex. 16:26.**

**Answer:**

For forty years, no manna fell on the seventh day.

1.  **The Miracle of the Sabbath:** God reinforced the Sabbath cycle with a
    threefold miracle every week for forty years:
    - Double manna on Friday.
    - The Friday manna did not spoil overnight (unlike other days).
    - No manna fell on Sabbath.
2.  **The Lesson:** We cannot expect God's blessing if we seek for "manna"
    (gain) on His holy day. We must trust that what He provides in six days is
    sufficient.

---

### Q13. What were God's ancient people to do on the Sabbath?

**“Six days shall work be done; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, a
holy convocation." Lev. 23:3.**

**Answer:**

The Sabbath is a "holy convocation."

1.  **Definition:** A _convocation_ is a calling together, an assembly.
2.  **Corporate Worship:** While private rest is essential, the Sabbath is
    designed for public worship. We are not to "forsake the assembling of
    ourselves together" (Hebrews 10:25).
3.  **Forestate of Heaven:** Gathering with God's people on earth to study His
    Word is a rehearsal for the great gathering in the heavenly Canaan.

---

### Q14. What example did the Saviour set in this matter?

**“And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and, as His custom
was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read."
Luke 4:16.**

**Answer:**

Jesus made it His "custom" (habit) to attend public worship on the Sabbath.

1.  **Christ Our Righteousness:** Jesus lived a perfect life of obedience not
    just as an example, but to weave a robe of righteousness for us. Part of
    that righteousness includes faithful Sabbath observance.
2.  **The Living Law:** Jesus was the Law made flesh. If the "Spirit of Christ"
    dwells in us (Romans 8:9), He will do in us what He did while on earth—He
    will lead us to the house of God on the Sabbath.

**[ILL]** If a musician wants to play a symphony, they follow the conductor.
Jesus is the Conductor of our faith. If He went to the synagogue on Sabbath, His
followers who are "in tune" with Him will do the same.

---

### Q15. How sacredly should the Sabbath be observed?

**“If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My
holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable: and
shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor
speaking thine own words." Isa. 58:13.**

**Answer:**

This beautiful prophecy outlines the spirit of true Sabbath keeping. It is not
merely stopping work; it is a change of focus and affection.

1.  **"Turn away thy foot":** This imagery suggests we are stepping onto holy
    ground. Like Moses at the burning bush, we remove the shoes of our worldly
    business and tread reverently.
2.  **"Not doing thine own pleasure":** We set aside our hobbies, business
    interests, and secular entertainment to seek _God's_ pleasure.
3.  **"A Delight":** This is the test of the new heart. To the carnal mind, the
    Sabbath is a burden (Amos 8:5). To the heart renewed by grace, communion
    with God is the highest joy.
    - **RBF Key:** We do not keep the Sabbath to _earn_ salvation; we keep it
      because we delight in the Savior. Obedience is the fruit of love (John
      14:15).
4.  **"Nor speaking thine own words":** Our conversation changes. We leave
    behind politics, finance, and sports, and speak of the blessed hope, the
    lessons of Scripture, and the works of God.

**[ILL]** Imagine a child who loves their father deeply but rarely sees him
because the father travels. When the father returns for a day, the child drops
their toys, ignores the television, and wants only to walk with, talk with, and
listen to their father. That is the "delight" of the Sabbath—dropping the toys
of the world to walk with our Heavenly Father.
