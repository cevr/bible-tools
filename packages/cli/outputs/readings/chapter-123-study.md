### Q1. What general promise is given to the overcomer?

"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he
shall be My son." Rev. 21:7.

**Answer:**

This promise is the culmination of the entire plan of salvation. It is not
merely a legal transaction, but the restoration of a broken family relationship.

- **Inheritance through Christ:** In the beginning, Adam was the "son of God"
  (Luke 3:38) and the ruler of the earth. When he fell, he lost his dominion and
  his intimate standing. Christ, the Second Adam, regained this inheritance.
  When we overcome through Him, we become "joint-heirs with Christ" (Romans
  8:17). To "inherit all things" means the earth made new, the universe of God’s
  creation, and the full resources of Heaven are opened to the redeemed.
- **Adoption and Intimacy:** The promise "I will be his God, and he shall be My
  son" indicates the deepest possible bond. Sin alienates us from God; victory
  through faith restores the face-to-face communion enjoyed in Eden.
- **The Condition:** The promise is specific to "he that overcometh." The Gospel
  does not promise the inheritance to those who cling to their sins, but to
  those who cling to the Savior and allow Him to conquer sin in their lives.

**[ILL]** Imagine a prince who was kidnapped as a child and raised in a slum,
forgetting his identity. When the King finds him, he does not just give him
money; he restores him to the palace, gives him the family name, and makes him
heir to the kingdom. God does this for the sinner who accepts Christ.

### Q2. What is it to overcome?

To vanquish, to conquer, to be victorious. - Webster.

**Answer:**

To overcome implies that the Christian life is a warfare. We are not called to a
life of ease, but to a battlefield where a real enemy must be defeated.

- **Active Warfare:** The Great Controversy is not just a cosmic battle between
  Christ and Satan; it is a battle fought on the ground of every human heart. To
  "vanquish" means to subdue the enemy completely.
- **Not Passive:** We cannot merely "float" into heaven. While we are saved by
  grace alone, that grace empowers us to fight the good fight of faith (1
  Timothy 6:12).
- **Defining the Victory:** In the spiritual sense, to overcome means to
  successfully resist temptation, to subdue selfish passions, and to remain
  loyal to God despite persecution or trial.

**[ILL]** A swimmer in a rushing river cannot stay in the same place by doing
nothing; the current will sweep them away. To reach the shore, they must stroke
against the current. The "current" is our fallen nature and the world;
"overcoming" is the Spirit-empowered motion toward God.

### Q3. What must be overcome to realize the promises to the overcomer?

"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil." Rom. 12:21. "For whatsoever is
born of God overcometh the world." 1 John 5:4.

**Answer:**

The Bible identifies two great antagonists: "evil" and "the world."

- **Overcoming Evil:** This includes both external malice from others and, more
  importantly, the internal "evil" of our own fallen inclinations. We are told
  not to react to evil with revenge (which is being overcome by it), but to
  respond with the love of Christ (overcoming it).
- **Overcoming the World:** The "world" refers to the system of rebellion
  against God—the "lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
  life" (1 John 2:16). To overcome the world means to refuse to be molded by its
  standards, fashions, and sinful pleasures.
- **Sanctification:** This is the work of _sanctification_—the daily process by
  which the believer, through the Holy Spirit, separates from the ways of the
  world and becomes like Jesus in character.

> **Definition—Sanctification:** The ongoing work of God’s grace by which the
> believer is made holy, setting aside sin and growing in the likeness of Christ
> (1 Thessalonians 4:3).

**[ILL]** If you bring a light into a dark room, you do not have to shovel the
darkness out. The presence of the light "overcomes" the darkness instantly. So
it is with the soul; we overcome evil by being filled with the "Light of the
World," Jesus Christ.

---

### Q4. What is meant by overcoming the world?

“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin." 1 John 3:9.

**Answer:**

This text presents the high standard of the Gospel. It describes the nature of
the true believer.

- **A New Nature:** To be "born of God" (regeneration) creates a new nature that
  hates sin. Just as it is contrary to the nature of a sheep to wallow in the
  mire, it is contrary to the nature of a born-again Christian to live in
  willful sin.
- **Not "Committing" Sin:** The Greek tense here implies a continuous habit or
  practice of sinning. The child of God may slip and fall (1 John 2:1), but they
  do not make sin their lifestyle or their master.
- **Victory is Possible:** This verse refutes the idea that we must continue
  sinning as long as we are in the flesh. Through the indwelling Christ, the
  power of sin is broken. The goal of the Gospel is not just forgiveness for the
  past, but power for the present.

> **Definition—Regeneration (New Birth):** The spiritual transformation where
> God imparts new life to the believer, changing their heart from loving sin to
> loving righteousness (John 3:3-5).

**[ILL]** A pig and a lamb may both fall into a mud puddle. The pig delights in
it and stays there; that is its nature. The lamb hates it and bleats until it is
cleansed. The overcomer may fall, but because they have the nature of the Lamb
(Christ), they cannot remain comfortable in the mud of the world.

### Q5. What, then, must we exercise in order to claim the promise of inheriting all things?

“But godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that
now is, and of that which is to come." 1 Tim. 4:8.

**Answer:**

We must exercise **godliness**.

- **Godliness Defined:** Godliness is "God-likeness"—a life that reflects the
  character of God. It is the result of the Holy Spirit dwelling within.
- **Two-Fold Promise:**
  1.  **The Life that Now Is:** Holiness brings blessings even on earth.
      Obedience to God's laws (moral and physical) often shields the believer
      from the diseases, anxieties, and troubles brought on by vice and
      intemperance.
  2.  **The Life to Come:** Godliness fits the character for heaven. We are not
      saved _by_ our godliness, but we are saved _to_ godliness.
- **Practical Application:** This includes health reform and temperance. As we
  care for the body temple (1 Corinthians 6:19), we exercise godliness in "the
  life that now is," clearing the mind to discern spiritual truths.

**[ILL]** An athlete exercises daily, denying himself junk food and laziness,
not to punish himself, but to win the prize. His discipline ("godliness") is
profitable for his health today and secures the trophy tomorrow.

---

### Q6. Who alone can overcome?

“Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the
Son of God?" 1 John 5:5.

**Answer:**

Victory is not achieved by human willpower, but by **faith in Christ**.

- **The Object of Faith:** We do not have faith in our own strength, but in
  "Jesus the Son of God." We believe that He overcame the world, and by faith,
  we claim His victory as our own.
- **Union with Christ:** Faith is the connector. It joins the weakness of
  humanity to the omnipotence of Divinity. When we believe, Christ dwells in our
  hearts, and _He_ does the overcoming in us.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** This is the core of the message. We cannot fight
  Satan alone. We overcome only when we hide ourselves in the One who has
  already defeated him.

> **Definition—Justification:** The act of God where He declares a repentant
> sinner righteous, not because of their own works, but by imputing (crediting)
> the perfect righteousness of Christ to their account (Romans 4:5).

**[ILL]** A small child cannot move a heavy boulder. But if the child holds the
hand of his strong father, and the father moves the boulder, the child has
"overcome" the obstacle through the father's strength.

---

### Q7. By what means are we enabled to overcome?

“This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." 1 John 5:4.
"And they overcame him [Satan, the originator and disseminator of sin, verse 9]
by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony." Rev. 12:11.

**Answer:**

Here is the three-fold arsenal of the saint:

1.  **The Blood of the Lamb:** This represents the atoning sacrifice of Christ.
    It deals with the guilt of sin. We can never overcome if we are crushed by
    guilt. Knowing we are forgiven and cleansed by His blood (justification)
    gives us the courage to stand.
2.  **The Word of Their Testimony:** This represents the active use of the Sword
    of the Spirit (the Word of God) and the confession of Christ before men. It
    implies an active, living faith that speaks truth against the lies of Satan.
3.  **Faith:** As noted in the previous question, faith is the hand that grasps
    the victory.

- **Sanctuary Connection:** The "Blood" points to the Altar of Burnt Offering in
  the courtyard (Christ's sacrifice). The "Word" and "Faith" point to the
  ministry in the Holy Place, where the believer lives by the light of the
  Spirit and the bread of Life.

**[ILL]** In a court of law, how does a defendant overcome an accuser? He
presents the evidence that the debt has been paid (the Blood) and he testifies
to the truth (the Word). Satan, the "accuser of the brethren," is silenced by
the Blood of Christ.

---

### Q8. Who gives us strength to overcome? and through whom is it bestowed?

“But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ." 1 Cor. 15:57. "In all these things we are more than conquerors through
Him that loved us." Rom. 8:37.

**Answer:**

- **The Source:** God the Father is the originator of the plan of victory.
- **The Mediator:** It is bestowed "through our Lord Jesus Christ." There is no
  other channel of grace.
- **"More than Conquerors":** This is a powerful phrase in Romans 8. A conqueror
  may win a battle but lose many men and suffer great loss. To be _more_ than a
  conqueror means to win a victory so decisive that even the trials are turned
  into blessings.
- **Through Him:** The victory is not independent of Christ. We are not given a
  "battery" of power to use on our own; we must remain plugged into the Source.
  "Without Me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5).

**[ILL]** David and Goliath illustrate this. The Israelites were terrified.
David (a type of Christ) defeated the giant. The army of Israel then chased the
Philistines and took the spoil. They were "more than conquerors"—they shared in
a victory they did not win by their own power, but through their champion.

### Q9. What is one important purpose of the promises given in the Bible?

“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises; that by these
ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that
is in the world through lust." 2 Peter 1:4.

**Answer:**

The promises of God are not just for comfort; they are for **transformation**.

- **Partakers of Divine Nature:** This is the mystery of godliness. God intends
  to restore in man the image of God lost in Eden. Through the Holy Spirit, we
  actually share in the moral character of God—His love, His purity, His hatred
  of sin.
- **Escaping Corruption:** The world is decaying because of "lust" (sinful
  desire). The only escape mechanism is the intake of God's promises.
- **How it Works:** When we believe a promise (e.g., "I will cleanse you," or
  "Sin shall not have dominion over you"), that Word carries the power to
  fulfill itself.

> **Definition—Imparted Righteousness:** The righteousness of Christ that is
> actually produced _inside_ the believer by the Holy Spirit, resulting in
> obedience and a holy life (Galatians 2:20).

**[ILL]** A promise from a wealthy man is only as good as his bank account.
God’s promises are backed by the bank of Heaven. When we "cash" them by faith,
we receive the "currency" of the Divine Nature.

---

### Q10. What is one of the greatest promises given to the overcomer?

"And this is the promise that He hath promised us, even eternal life." 1 John
2:25.

**Answer:**

- **The Gift of Life:** Death is the wages of sin. The restoration of
  life—eternal, sorrow-less, deathless life—is the supreme gift of the Gospel.
- **Quality of Life:** This is not just endless existence, but life as God lives
  it—life in its absolute fullness, free from the limitations of the fallen
  flesh.
- **Present Possession:** "He that hath the Son hath life" (1 John 5:12). The
  spiritual seed of this eternal life begins now in the heart of the believer.

**[ILL]** Imagine a prisoner on death row, counting the minutes to execution.
The governor arrives not just with a stay of execution, but with a pardon and a
medicine that reverses aging. That is the promise of eternal life to the dying
sinner.

---

### Q11. Name some of the precious things promised to the overcomer.

(1) He shall eat of the tree of life. Rev. 2:7. (2) He "shall not be hurt of the
second death." Rev. 2:11. (3) He shall eat of the hidden manna, and receive a
white stone, and "in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he
that receiveth it." Rev. 2:17. (4) He shall have power over the nations. Rev.
2:26. (5) He shall be clothed in white raiment; and his name shall not be
blotted out of the book of life, but shall be confessed before the Father and
the angels. Rev. 3:5. (6) He shall be a pillar in the temple of God forever, and
Christ will write upon him God's name, and the name of the New Jerusalem, and
his own new name. Rev. 3:12. (7) He shall sit with Christ on His throne. Rev.
3:21. (8) He "shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to
them that love Him." James 1:12.

**Answer:**

These symbols delineate the glorious rewards reserved for the faithful:

- **Tree of Life:** Access to immortality, lost in Eden, restored in the New
  Jerusalem.
- **Second Death:** The overcomer faces the first death (sleep), but has no fear
  of the final destruction of the wicked.
- **White Stone/New Name:** In ancient courts, a white stone signified
  acquittal. The "new name" signifies a character transformed by grace—a
  personal secret between the soul and God.
- **White Raiment:** The righteousness of saints (Revelation 19:8). It implies
  that the investigative judgment is passed, and their name remains in the Book
  of Life.
- **Throne and Pillar:** Symbols of stability and royal authority. We will reign
  with Christ.

**[ILL]** Just as a victorious general returns home to receive medals, titles,
and a seat of honor, Christ has prepared specific, tangible rewards for those
who have fought the battles of the Lord on earth.

### Q12. Have any of those who in the past have sought to receive the promises, as yet come into their possession?

“And these all [those enumerated in Heb. 11], having obtained a good report
through faith, received not the promise." Heb. 11:39.

**Answer:**

- **The State of the Dead:** This verse confirms that the heroes of faith
  (Abraham, Moses, David, etc.) have not yet received their final reward. They
  are not currently in heaven.
- **Waiting in the Grave:** They "obtained a good report" (were justified), but
  they wait for the final consummation.
- **The Better Thing:** Verse 40 says God has provided "some better thing for
  us, that they without us should not be made perfect." The plan of God is that
  all the redeemed—from Adam to the last soul saved—will be glorified _together_
  at the First Resurrection.

**[ILL]** At a grand banquet, the doors are not opened for guests one by one to
start eating while others are still arriving. The Host waits until all the
guests are gathered, and then the doors are opened for everyone to enter the
feast together.

---

### Q13. When will these precious promises be realized?

"Ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might
receive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall come, will come,
and will not tarry." Heb. 10:36, 37.

**Answer:**

- **The Second Coming:** The realization of the promises is tied to the return
  of Christ ("He that shall come").
- **The Need for Patience:** We live in the "waiting time." Like the saints in
  the sanctuary crying "How long?", we must endure until the end.
- **Doing the Will of God:** Note the sequence—first "do the will of God,"
  _then_ receive the promise. Obedience is the condition of the covenant; grace
  is the power to fulfill it.

**[ILL]** A farmer plants a seed in the spring. He cannot harvest the next day.
He needs patience, rain, and sun. The harvest comes only at the appointed
season. The Second Coming is the harvest of the earth.

---

### Q14. What manner of persons ought we to be, as we see the time approaching when the promises are to be realized?

“Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye
may be found of Him in peace, without spot, and blameless." 2 Peter 3:14.

**Answer:**

This text points to the work of preparation for the judgment.

- **Without Spot:** In the ancient sanctuary service, the lamb brought for
  sacrifice had to be without blemish. In the New Covenant, Christ cleanses us
  so that _we_ may be presented "without spot" (Ephesians 5:27). This implies a
  character cleansing—the blotting out of sins from the life.
- **Diligent:** This is not a time for spiritual laziness. We must be zealous in
  repentance and in seeking the Lord.
- **In Peace:** This is the peace that comes from knowing our sins are forgiven
  and our lives are surrendered to God.

> **The Investigative Judgment:** The time prior to Christ's return when He
> examines the lives of professed believers to see if they are clothed in His
> righteousness. Those found "without spot" (covered by His blood and Spirit)
> receive the kingdom (Daniel 7:9-10, 22).

**[ILL]** A bride preparing for her wedding day is diligent. She checks her
dress for the slightest stain or wrinkle. She wants to appear before her groom
"without spot." The church is the Bride of Christ, preparing for the Marriage
Supper of the Lamb.

---

### Q15. What will be the condition of those who realize the promises?

“After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of
all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and
before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; And cried
with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb. And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about
the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and
worshipped God, Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving,
and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen."
Revelation 7:9-12.

**Answer:**

This is the triumphant scene of the finished mystery.

- **Victory Achieved:** They have "palms in their hands"—an ancient symbol of
  victory. They have overcome the beast, the image, and the mark (Revelation
  15:2).
- **White Robes:** They are clothed in the perfect righteousness of Christ. They
  have "washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Rev
  7:14).
- **The Song of Praise:** Notice that the overcomers do not sing of their own
  achievements, their own willpower, or their own good works. They cry,
  "Salvation to _our God_... and unto the _Lamb_."
- **The End of the Controversy:** The universe unites in declaring that God is
  just, wise, and powerful. Sin is gone, the battle is over, and the children of
  God are safe at home.

**[ILL]** Imagine a ship that has battled through a hurricane, battered by waves
and wind. Finally, it enters the calm harbor. The passengers do not praise their
own swimming ability; they praise the Captain and the Ship that brought them
through the storm. So will the redeemed praise Christ throughout eternity.
