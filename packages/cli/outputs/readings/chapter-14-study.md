# Bible Study: Salvation

## Introduction

Salvation is the great theme of Scripture—God's work to rescue humanity from sin
and death and restore us to eternal life in Him. This study traces the pathway
from our lost condition to our glorious inheritance as children of God, showing
that salvation is wholly Christ's work, received by faith, and secured by
endurance to the end.

## Core Truths

### The Purpose of Christ's Coming

_"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
came into the world to save sinners"_ (1 Timothy 1:15).

The apostle Paul declares this truth "worthy of all acceptation"—deserving
universal welcome and belief. Jesus did not come merely to teach, to heal, or to
set an example. He came **to save sinners**.

- **Salvation**: Deliverance from sin's penalty (death) and power (bondage),
  resulting in restoration to eternal life with God (Romans 6:23; John 17:3).

_"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved"_ (Acts 4:12).

This is exclusive, not exclusive in arrogance, but in truth. A drowning man
cannot choose which lifeguard saves him—there is only one in the water. Christ
alone has the power and authority to rescue humanity.

[DYK🔎] The name "Jesus" (Greek: _Iēsous_; Hebrew: _Yeshua_) literally means
"Yahweh saves" or "Yahweh is salvation." His very name declares His mission.

### Salvation From Sin, Not In Sin

_"Thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins"_
(Matthew 1:21).

Note carefully: **from** their sins, not **in** their sins. Christ did not come
to excuse sin or to permit continued rebellion while granting heaven's
assurance. He came to deliver us from sin's dominion—its guilt, its power, and
ultimately its presence.

[Q] **"But aren't we saved the moment we believe?"**

Scripture presents salvation in three tenses:

1. **Past** (justification): We have been saved from sin's penalty (Ephesians
   2:8)
2. **Present** (sanctification): We are being saved from sin's power (1
   Corinthians 1:18; Philippians 2:12)
3. **Future** (glorification): We shall be saved from sin's presence (Romans
   5:9-10; 1 Peter 1:5)

The woman who washed Christ's feet was told, _"Thy faith hath saved thee; go in
peace"_ (Luke 7:50). She was healed of her sinful condition at that moment—her
past sins forgiven. Yet this did not guarantee her eternal salvation apart from
continued faithfulness.

### Endurance Required

_"But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved"_ (Matthew
24:13).

This is not salvation by works but salvation demonstrated through perseverance.
True faith produces endurance; counterfeit faith collapses under trial.

_"But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth
iniquity... in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die"_ (Ezekiel
18:24).

[ILL] Consider a patient receiving treatment for a deadly disease. The physician
prescribes a full course of medicine. If the patient takes the first dose and
declares himself cured, abandoning the treatment, the disease will return and
destroy him. He was genuinely receiving healing—but healing is a process that
must continue to completion. So it is with salvation: we are genuinely saved
when we receive Christ, but we must continue in Him to the end.

## Deeper Truths

### The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant

Christ told of a servant who owed his master ten thousand talents—an
incomprehensible debt, equivalent to millions in modern currency. When he could
not pay, his master _"was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him
the debt"_ (Matthew 18:27).

Yet this same servant, finding a fellow servant who owed him a mere hundred
pence, refused to show mercy and had him imprisoned.

The master's response was severe: _"I forgave thee all that debt, because thou
desiredst me. Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant,
even as I had pity on thee?"_ (Matthew 18:32-33). The forgiven debt was
reinstated; the servant was delivered to the tormentors.

Christ's application pierces the heart: _"So likewise shall My heavenly Father
do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
trespasses"_ (Matthew 18:35).

[DYK🔎] Ten thousand talents represented approximately 200,000 years of wages
for a common laborer—a debt no human could ever repay. This illustrates the
infinite debt our sin creates before a holy God, which only infinite mercy can
cancel.

This parable demolishes the notion of "once saved, always saved" as popularly
taught. The servant was genuinely forgiven—his debt truly cancelled—yet his
subsequent actions revealed an unchanged heart, and the forgiveness was
withdrawn.

[Q] **"Does this mean we can lose our salvation over small failures?"**

No. The issue is not occasional failure but a fundamental change of heart—a
return to the spirit of unforgiveness and hardness. The servant's unforgiving
spirit proved that grace had not transformed him. Those who have truly
experienced God's mercy will extend mercy to others (Matthew 5:7; James 2:13).

### Salvation Nearer Than When We Believed

_"Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed"_ (Romans 13:11).

Paul writes to believers who had already exercised faith, yet speaks of
salvation as future—something they were approaching but had not yet fully
received. This confirms that while justification is complete at conversion, the
fullness of salvation awaits the second coming.

_"Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be
revealed in the last time"_ (1 Peter 1:5).

We are **kept**—not by our own strength, but by God's power. Yet this keeping
operates **through faith**—our continued trust and surrender to Christ.

_"Unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto
salvation"_ (Hebrews 9:28).

Final salvation comes at Christ's return. Those who "look for Him" are those
whose faith has produced a life of anticipation and preparation.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Condition of Humanity

_"The Scripture hath concluded all under sin"_ (Galatians 3:22). _"For all have
sinned, and come short of the glory of God"_ (Romans 3:23).

This is humanity's universal condition—not merely committing sins, but being
_under sin_, enslaved to its power. The law reveals our guilt; it cannot remove
it.

_"The wages of sin is death"_ (Romans 6:23).

Death is not arbitrary punishment but natural consequence. Sin separates from
God, who is the source of life; separation from life is death.

### The Gift of Life in Christ

_"The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord"_ (Romans 6:23).
_"This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is
in His Son"_ (1 John 5:11).

Eternal life is not something we achieve but something we **receive**. It exists
in Christ, and we possess it only by possessing Him.

_"He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not
life"_ (1 John 5:12).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "hath" (ἔχω, _echō_) in this verse implies present,
continuous possession. Eternal life is not merely a future reward but a present
reality for those who abide in Christ.

### Christ in Us: The Hope of Glory

_"Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be
reprobates?"_ (2 Corinthians 13:5).

Paul presents Christ dwelling within as the distinguishing mark of genuine
Christianity. A profession without this indwelling reality is counterfeit.

_"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in
the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God"_ (Galatians 2:20).

This is the mystery of righteousness by faith: **Christ's life replacing
ours**. We do not merely try harder to obey; we yield our wills to Christ, and
His life manifests through us. Obedience flows from His presence, not our
effort.

_"Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ"_
(Ephesians 2:5).

Before conversion, we were spiritually dead—incapable of producing life or
righteousness. Christ's quickening power alone raises us to new life.

### The New Birth

_"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word
of God, which liveth and abideth forever"_ (1 Peter 1:23).

**New birth**: The spiritual transformation by which a sinner, dead in
trespasses, is made alive by the Holy Spirit and becomes a child of God (John
3:3-8).

The old life cannot be reformed; it must be replaced. As physical birth brings a
person into a new world, so spiritual birth brings us into the kingdom of God.

### The Seed of Promise

When Adam and Eve sinned, God immediately announced the plan of redemption:

_"I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel"_ (Genesis 3:15).

This first gospel promise pointed to Christ, who would crush Satan's power while
suffering in the conflict.

_"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also
Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him
that had the power of death, that is, the devil"_ (Hebrews 2:14).

Christ's death was not defeat but victory—the decisive blow against Satan's
dominion.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "bruise" in Genesis 3:15 (_shuph_) can also mean
"crush" or "strike." Satan would wound Christ's heel (the cross), but Christ
would crush Satan's head (permanent destruction of his kingdom).

### Abraham's Faith

_"The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land"_
(Genesis 12:7). _"In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed"_
(Acts 3:25).

_"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to
seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ"_ (Galatians
3:16).

The promise to Abraham pointed to Christ. Abraham believed in the coming
Redeemer, and _"it was counted unto him for righteousness"_ (Romans 4:3).

Abraham was justified by faith—the same faith that justifies us today. The
gospel was preached to Abraham (Galatians 3:8); we stand in the same covenant of
grace.

[Q] **"If Abraham was justified by faith, why was the law given?"**

_"If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain"_ (Galatians
2:21).

The law was never intended as a means of salvation. It reveals sin's nature and
our need for a Savior. The law is the diagnosis; Christ is the cure.

_"The Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus
Christ might be given to them that believe"_ (Galatians 3:22).

The law shuts every mouth and shows all the world guilty before God (Romans
3:19), so that we might receive righteousness through faith alone.

### Children and Heirs

_"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh
unto the Father, but by Me"_ (John 14:6).

Christ is the exclusive path to the Father—not one option among many, but the
only way.

_"For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus"_ (Galatians
3:26).

Through faith, we become God's children—not servants only, but sons and
daughters with full inheritance rights.

_"If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ"_ (Romans
8:17).

[ILL] When a wealthy father adopts a child from poverty, that child receives not
merely food and shelter but the full legal standing of a natural-born heir. All
the father's riches become the child's inheritance. So God has adopted us into
His family; all the riches of heaven become ours in Christ.

### Sanctuary Connection

The earthly sanctuary illustrated the plan of salvation:

- **Altar of sacrifice (outer court)**: Christ's death for our sins—justification
- **Daily ministry (holy place)**: Christ's ongoing intercession—sanctification
- **Day of Atonement (most holy place)**: Final cleansing and vindication—glorification

In the heavenly sanctuary, Christ now ministers as our High Priest, applying His
blood to our cases, interceding for our weaknesses, and preparing a people who
will stand in the judgment. Salvation is not merely a past event but an ongoing
relationship with our living Savior.

## Practical Application

This truth calls us to:

1. **Receive Christ fully**—not merely as Savior from penalty, but as Lord of
   our lives. He must dwell within by faith.

2. **Rest in His righteousness**—cease attempting to earn salvation through
   works; trust wholly in Christ's merits.

3. **Abide in Him daily**—salvation is maintained through continued faith and
   surrender. Neglect of this relationship brings spiritual death.

4. **Extend mercy to others**—those who have received the infinite forgiveness
   of God will freely forgive those who wrong them.

5. **Look for His appearing**—live in expectation of Christ's return, when
   salvation will be complete.

6. **Examine ourselves**—is Christ truly in us? Is His life manifesting through
   ours? Or do we have only a form of godliness?

_"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.
And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of
life freely"_ (Revelation 22:17).

## Appeal

_"He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not
life"_ (1 John 5:12).

There are only two conditions: having Christ or not having Him. There is no
middle ground. **Do you have the Son?** Not merely knowledge about Him, but
Christ Himself living within—His thoughts becoming your thoughts, His desires
your desires, His life your life?

If you have wandered, return today. The parable of the unmerciful servant warns
that past forgiveness does not guarantee future security apart from a
transformed heart. But the same Christ who forgave the great debt stands ready
to forgive again and to complete His work in you.

If you have never fully surrendered, the invitation stands: _"Whosoever will,
let him take the water of life freely."_

Salvation is Christ—receiving Him, abiding in Him, and being kept by His power
through faith unto that day when He appears "the second time without sin unto
salvation." May that glorious hope be yours.
