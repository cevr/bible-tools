# Bible Study: The Birth and Early Life of Christ

## Introduction

The coming of Jesus Christ into this world was not an afterthought or emergency rescue—it was the unfolding of a plan laid before the foundation of the world. From the first whisper of hope in Eden to the manger in Bethlehem, every prophecy, every promise, every type and shadow pointed to this moment: God Himself would become man to save His people from their sins. In studying the birth and early life of Christ, we discover not merely historical facts, but the very heart of God revealed in flesh.

## Core Truths

### The Promise Given in Eden

Before sin had scarcely entered our world, God spoke the first gospel promise directly to the serpent—that ancient enemy, Satan himself:

> _"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."_ (Genesis 3:15)

Here is the seed of every prophecy concerning Christ. Notice that God Himself would put the enmity—the natural heart has no hatred for sin, no longing for righteousness. But God, in His mercy, would implant within fallen humanity a warfare against evil and a hope of deliverance.

**The Promised Seed**: This "seed of the woman" would one day crush the serpent's head—a fatal blow to Satan's kingdom—while receiving only a wound to His heel. The cross appeared to be Satan's victory; it was, in truth, his utter defeat.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "seed of the woman" is unique in Scripture. Genealogies consistently trace through the man, yet this promise speaks of the woman's seed—a remarkable hint, thousands of years before Bethlehem, of the virgin birth.

### The Seed of Abraham

God's promise narrowed through the generations. To Abraham He declared:

> _"To thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever."_ (Genesis 13:15)

Paul, writing under inspiration, clarifies this was no mere reference to Abraham's many descendants:

> _"He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."_ (Galatians 3:16)

Every covenant blessing, every promise of restoration, ultimately pointed to one Person—the Christ, the Anointed One, through whom all nations would be blessed.

### Prophecy Fulfilled with Precision

**Birthplace**: Centuries before Bethlehem existed as anything more than a small village, the prophet Micah declared:

> _"But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting."_ (Micah 5:2)

When Herod demanded of the chief priests where Christ should be born, they answered without hesitation: "In Bethlehem of Judea" (Matthew 2:5-6). The religious leaders knew the prophecy—yet tragically, they did not seek Him.

**Virgin Birth**: Isaiah prophesied what natural minds could not comprehend:

> _"Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."_ (Isaiah 7:14)

Immanuel—"God with us." Not merely a prophet, not simply a good teacher, but God Himself clothed in human flesh, dwelling among men.

[Q] **"How can we be certain Isaiah meant a virgin and not simply a young woman?"**

The Hebrew word _almah_ does mean "young woman," but the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament), translated centuries before Christ by Jewish scholars, rendered it _parthenos_—which specifically means "virgin." Matthew, writing under inspiration, confirms this was the intended meaning (Matthew 1:23). Moreover, what "sign" would it be for a young woman to conceive? The miraculous element is essential to the prophecy's significance.

## Deeper Truths

### The Meaning of His Name

The angel instructed Joseph with profound simplicity:

> _"Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."_ (Matthew 1:21)

Not "save his people _in_ their sins," but _from_ their sins. Here is the heart of the gospel—Jesus came not merely to forgive sin's penalty, but to deliver from sin's power. The name "Jesus" (Greek _Iesous_) is the equivalent of the Hebrew "Joshua," meaning "Yahweh saves" or "Jehovah is salvation."

[ILL] A physician who merely removed the pain of disease while leaving the disease itself would be no true healer. Christ does not anesthetize the conscience while sin remains; He removes the very corruption that enslaves us. He saves His people _from_ their sins—breaking the chains, transforming the heart, and restoring the image of God.

### The Heavenly Announcement

To humble shepherds—not priests, not scholars, not kings—the angel brought the first announcement:

> _"Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord."_ (Luke 2:10-11)

Three titles in one breath:

- **Saviour**—deliverer from sin and death
- **Christ**—the Anointed One, the long-awaited Messiah
- **Lord**—Yahweh Himself, the covenant-keeping God

Then the heavens could no longer contain their joy:

> _"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."_ (Luke 2:14)

[DYK🔎] The shepherds watching their flocks near Bethlehem were likely caring for lambs destined for temple sacrifices. How fitting that they should be first to hear of the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world!

### Witnesses of the Incarnation

**Simeon**, righteous and devout, had received a promise that he would not die before seeing "the Lord's Christ." When Mary and Joseph brought the infant Jesus to the temple, the Holy Spirit revealed to Simeon that this was the One:

> _"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: for mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel."_ (Luke 2:29-32)

**Anna**, a prophetess of great age who "departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day," immediately recognized the Child and "spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem" (Luke 2:38).

**The Wise Men** from the East, following the star, found the young child and "fell down, and worshipped him" (Matthew 2:11). Their gifts were prophetic:

- **Gold**—for a King
- **Frankincense**—for a Priest (used in sanctuary worship)
- **Myrrh**—for One who would die and be buried

### The Dragon's Wrath

John the Revelator pulls back the veil on the spiritual warfare behind Herod's murderous rage:

> _"And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born."_ (Revelation 12:4)

Satan, working through Herod, sought to destroy the promised Seed. The slaughter of Bethlehem's innocents was not merely political paranoia—it was the great controversy in terrible, bloody reality. From Eden onward, Satan has sought to destroy the Deliverer and all who follow Him.

But God preserved His Son. Joseph fled to Egypt, fulfilling yet another prophecy: "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (Hosea 11:1; Matthew 2:15).

[Q] **"Why would God allow innocent children to die while Jesus escaped?"**

This is one of Scripture's most difficult passages. We must recognize: (1) the martyred innocents are not forgotten by God—they will rise in the resurrection; (2) Satan, not God, is the author of murder and destruction; (3) Jesus' escape was necessary for the salvation of the entire human race, including those very children who died. The depth of evil revealed in Herod shows what sin produces; the depth of love revealed in Christ shows what God provides to overcome it.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Central Battlefield

The birth of Christ reveals that this world is the theater of a cosmic conflict. Satan sought to destroy the Messiah before His mission could be accomplished. Every prophecy that guided the wise men, every angelic warning that preserved the holy family, demonstrates Heaven's active involvement in this warfare.

The sanctuary service foreshadowed this reality. The lamb slain from the foundation of the world (Revelation 13:8) now appeared in human flesh—the true Sacrifice to which every altar and offering had pointed.

### God's Mysterious Methods

Notice _how_ God accomplished His purposes:

- Through a peasant girl in an obscure village
- Announced first to poor shepherds, not religious leaders
- Preserved by flight to Egypt, the ancient land of bondage
- Raised in Nazareth, a town of no reputation

> _"He shall be called a Nazarene."_ (Matthew 2:23)

[DYK🔎] "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Nathanael would later ask (John 1:46). The town was despised, its people considered rough and uncultured. Yet God chose this place to raise the Saviour of the world.

God delights to accomplish great things through humble means, that no flesh should glory in His presence (1 Corinthians 1:29).

### The Perfect Development

Luke records the beautiful summary of Christ's early life:

> _"And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him."_ (Luke 2:40)

> _"And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."_ (Luke 2:52)

Jesus developed as humans develop—physically, mentally, spiritually, socially. He did not simply appear as a full-grown man but experienced every stage of human life, sanctifying each one. He was "in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15).

**At age twelve**, Jesus demonstrated His unique awareness of His mission. Found in the temple "sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions," He astonished all who heard Him (Luke 2:46-47). When His parents expressed concern, He replied:

> _"Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?"_ (Luke 2:49)

Yet even with this divine consciousness, "he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them" (Luke 2:51). The Creator of the universe, in human form, submitted to human parents—a perfect example of humble obedience.

## Practical Application

### For Our Faith

The fulfilled prophecies surrounding Christ's birth provide an unshakeable foundation for faith. Every detail—the place, the manner, the witnesses, the preservation—occurred precisely as foretold centuries before. If Scripture can be trusted in these particulars, it can be trusted in all things.

### For Our Salvation

Jesus came to "save his people _from_ their sins"—not merely to forgive, but to deliver. Do you believe He can do this for you? The same power that fulfilled every prophecy, that preserved the infant Christ from Herod's sword, that enabled Him to grow in perfect wisdom and grace—this same power is available to transform your life.

[ILL] When a child is learning to walk, the father does not simply forgive each fall; he reaches down, lifts the child up, steadies the trembling legs, and walks alongside until the child can walk alone. So Christ does for us. He forgives our falls, yes—but He also lifts us, strengthens us, and walks with us until we can stand firm in righteousness.

### For Our Development

"Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man." God cares about our whole being:

- **Wisdom**—mental development, study, understanding
- **Stature**—physical health and proper care of the body
- **Favour with God**—spiritual growth, prayer, devotion
- **Favour with man**—social relationships, kindness, service

We are called to develop harmoniously in every area, as Christ did, by His grace.

### For Our Obedience

Though Jesus knew His divine mission, He was "subject" to His earthly parents. Humble submission to proper authority—even when we might think we know better—is the pathway of Christ. Those who would follow Him must learn this lesson.

## Appeal

The story of Christ's birth is not merely history—it is invitation. The Saviour who came to Bethlehem, who grew up in Nazareth, who fulfilled every prophecy and overcame every temptation, now stands ready to accomplish His purpose in your life: to save you _from_ your sins.

> _"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given."_ (Isaiah 9:6)

Will you receive Him today? Will you open your heart to the One whose name is Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace?

Like Simeon, may you be able to say: "Mine eyes have seen thy salvation." Not merely known _about_—but seen, experienced, embraced. Christ offers Himself to you—not only as your Substitute on the cross, but as your living Saviour who can deliver you from every besetting sin and fill your life with His peace.

The dragon still rages. The great controversy still unfolds around us. But the Seed of the woman has crushed the serpent's head. Victory is assured to all who trust in Him.

_"Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins."_ (Matthew 1:21)
