    remains the standard for Christians.

    we establish the law.”
- **A Commandment of Relationship**
  - The Ten Commandments have two sections: love for God (1–4) and love for
    neighbor (6–10).
  - The command to honor parents acts as the "hinge," being the first
    commandment regarding human relationships.
- **God is a Rewarder**
  - God is a loving Father, not a tyrant; He attaches blessings to obedience for
    our happiness.
  - Deuteronomy 10:13 – “To keep the commandments of the Lord, and his statutes,
    which I command thee this day for thy good?”

    sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The Road Sign**

    thy life shall be many.”

    kingdom.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- **The Need for a New Heart**
  - We cannot manufacture a heart that truly honors others; our natural heart is
    selfish.

  - Hebrews 8:10 – “For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
    Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind,
    and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall
    be to me a people.”

    education through His Word and Spirit.

## Slide 11 – Q3: Application (Defining the Gospel)

- **The Good News**
  - The Gospel is the news that Jesus died for our sins and lives to restore us.
  - 1 Corinthians 15:3–4 – “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I

    commandments").

    Lord" a joy.
  - James 2:17 – “Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.”

## Slide 16 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Fire Analogy**

    much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be
    merciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house
    justified rather than the other...”
- **The Robe of Righteousness**

    righteousness.

## Slide 20 – Q5: Illustration

- **Two Cups**
  - **Cup 1:** A golden goblet, expensive but sealed shut.
  - **Cup 2:** A simple clay cup, but open and clean.

    dependence.
- **Grace Through Faith**
  - We are saved by grace, not by earning our way.
  - Ephesians 2:8 – “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
    yourselves: it is the gift of God.”

## Slide 23 – Q6: Illustration

    it.
  - They do not ask for a map or a contract; they trust you to lead.

- **The Condition: Believing**
  - Faith is taking God at His word and claiming promises as reality.
  - Hebrews 11:1 – “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
    of things not seen.”
- **The Scope: All Things**
  - We may confidently ask for pardon, the Holy Spirit, and victory over sin.
  - 1 John 5:14–15 – “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if
    we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us...”

  - This enables us to "do His commandments" naturally and joyfully.

## Slide 34 – Q9: Illustration
