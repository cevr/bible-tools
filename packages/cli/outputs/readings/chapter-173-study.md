# Bible Study: Good Health—Glorifying God in Body and Spirit

## Introduction

The Bible presents a striking truth often overlooked in modern Christianity: our physical bodies matter to God. Far from being mere containers for the soul, our bodies are declared to be temples of the Holy Spirit—sacred vessels purchased at infinite cost. This study explores the biblical foundation for health as a spiritual duty, revealing how caring for our bodies connects directly to our sanctification, our witness, and our preparation for Christ's return.

## Core Truths

### The Apostolic Priority of Health

The apostle John's greeting to Gaius reveals something remarkable about early Christian concern:

> _"Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth."_ (3 John 1:2)

Notice the phrase "above all things"—this was no mere social pleasantry. The Greek word translated "health" (_hygiainō_) means to be sound, whole, and uncorrupted. John desired for his friend's physical condition to match his spiritual prosperity.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word _hygiainō_ (health) is the root of our English word "hygiene." It appears frequently in the New Testament and is sometimes translated "sound" as in "sound doctrine" (1 Timothy 1:10; 2 Timothy 4:3)—suggesting that physical soundness and doctrinal soundness share a common principle of wholeness and purity.

### The Body as Living Sacrifice

Why does physical health matter spiritually? Paul answers directly:

> _"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."_ (Romans 12:1)

Under the old covenant, sacrificial animals had to be "without blemish" (Leviticus 1:3, 10). A diseased, lame, or defective offering was an insult to God (Malachi 1:8, 13). How much more, then, should Christians—who are both priest and sacrifice under the new covenant—present their bodies in the best possible condition?

**Sanctification**: The setting apart of a person or thing for holy use and God's service.

### Whole-Being Sanctification

Paul's prayer in 1 Thessalonians reveals the scope of true sanctification:

> _"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

Notice the three-part completeness: **spirit, soul, and body**. Biblical sanctification is not merely an invisible, spiritual matter—it touches every aspect of our being. God desires to set apart the _whole person_ for His service and glory.

[Q] **"Isn't salvation about the soul? Why does God care about my body?"**

Scripture never teaches that the body is unimportant or evil. God created our bodies "very good" (Genesis 1:31). Jesus took on a human body and rose from the grave in a glorified physical form. Our hope is not escape from the body, but resurrection—transformation of the whole person (1 Corinthians 15:51-54; Philippians 3:21). The body-soul division that devalues physical health comes from Greek philosophy, not biblical teaching.

## Deeper Truths

### The Body as God's Temple

Paul presents one of Scripture's most striking images:

> _"What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."_ (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)

Consider the profound implications:

1. **Ownership transferred**: We are "not our own"—we belong to God by creation and redemption
2. **Purchase price paid**: We were "bought with a price"—the precious blood of Christ (1 Peter 1:18-19)
3. **Sacred occupation**: The Holy Spirit dwells _within_ these physical bodies
4. **Dual obligation**: We must glorify God in both body _and_ spirit

[ILL] Imagine a wealthy benefactor pays off your crushing debts and then entrusts you with the care of his magnificent mansion while he is away. Would you neglect the property? Fill it with garbage? Let it fall into ruin? Of course not—gratitude and honor would compel you to maintain it beautifully. Yet God has done infinitely more: He has purchased us with His own blood and made our very bodies His dwelling place. How carefully, then, ought we to maintain these temples!

### The Warning Against Defiling the Temple

The consequences of temple defilement are severe:

> _"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."_ (1 Corinthians 3:17)

The word "defile" (_phtheirō_) means to corrupt, destroy, or bring to ruin. This applies to any practice that damages or degrades the body God has made His dwelling place. The warning is solemn: God will not hold guiltless those who knowingly destroy what He has made holy.

[DYK🔎] In the Old Testament, anyone who defiled the sanctuary faced severe consequences—even death (Leviticus 15:31; Numbers 19:13, 20). The principle carries forward: defiling God's temple, whether the ancient structure or the Christian's body, is no light matter.

### Paul's Personal Discipline

The apostle who taught these truths also lived them:

> _"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."_ (1 Corinthians 9:27)

The phrase "keep under" (_hypōpiazō_) literally means to "strike under the eye"—a boxing term for dealing a decisive blow. Paul treated his body not as master but as servant, disciplining its appetites lest they undermine his spiritual mission.

[Q] **"Isn't this legalism? Aren't we saved by grace, not by what we eat?"**

Absolutely, salvation is by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9). But genuine faith produces obedience from love, not from fear of punishment. We care for our bodies not to _earn_ salvation but because we _have_ been saved—because the Holy Spirit dwells within us, because we love the One who purchased us, and because we want to serve Him with every power of our being. As Paul wrote, "the love of Christ constraineth us" (2 Corinthians 5:14).

## Biblical Principles for Eating and Drinking

### The Overarching Principle

> _"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."_ (1 Corinthians 10:31)

This comprehensive principle covers every aspect of life, but particularly our diet. The question to ask before eating or drinking anything is not merely "Is this lawful?" but "Does this glorify God?"

### Lawful vs. Expedient

Paul teaches an important distinction:

> _"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."_ (1 Corinthians 10:23)

**Expedient**: Profitable, advantageous, contributing to one's good or the good of others.

**Edify**: To build up, strengthen, or improve (from Latin _aedificare_, to build).

The mature Christian asks not only "Is this permitted?" but "Is this wise? Does this build up my body, my spiritual life, my influence for good?"

### God's Original Diet

In Eden, before sin entered, God prescribed the ideal human diet:

> _"And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat."_ (Genesis 1:29)

The original diet consisted of fruits, grains, and nuts—plant foods in their natural state. This was the diet of Paradise, and it sustained humanity for the long-lived generations before the Flood.

[DYK🔎] The longest-lived people in Scripture—those who lived 800-900+ years—lived before the Flood on the original plant-based diet. After the Flood, when flesh foods were permitted, human lifespans dropped dramatically within just a few generations (compare Genesis 5 with Genesis 11).

### The Permission of Flesh Food and Clean/Unclean Distinctions

After the Flood, God permitted flesh food but with significant restrictions:

> _"Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is cloven footed, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat."_ (Leviticus 11:3)

The distinction between "clean" and "unclean" animals predates the Mosaic law:

> _"Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female."_ (Genesis 7:2)

Noah knew this distinction before Sinai—it was not merely a ceremonial Jewish law but a principle rooted in creation.

### The Swine Specifically Forbidden

Among unclean animals, the swine receives particular attention:

> _"And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass."_ (Deuteronomy 14:8)

The pig appears to meet one criterion (cloven hoof) but fails the other (chewing the cud). It is a scavenger by nature, consuming refuse, carrion, and waste. Its flesh harbors parasites and disease-causing organisms that cooking does not always destroy.

[DYK🔎] Modern science confirms what Scripture declared millennia ago: pork is associated with higher rates of parasitic infection (trichinosis, tapeworm), hepatitis E virus, and various food-borne illnesses compared to clean meats. The swine's digestive system does not filter toxins as effectively as ruminant animals that chew the cud.

### The Reason for Dietary Restrictions

Why did God restrict Israel's diet?

> _"For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto Himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth. Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing."_ (Deuteronomy 14:2-3)

**Holy**: Set apart, consecrated to sacred use.

**Peculiar**: From Latin _peculium_, meaning "private property"—God's treasured possession.

God's people were to be distinct from surrounding nations in every way, including their diet. These distinctions were not arbitrary ceremonial rules but wise provisions for the health and holiness of His people.

### Daniel's Example

The prophet Daniel demonstrated the connection between diet and spiritual faithfulness:

> _"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank."_ (Daniel 1:8)

Daniel recognized that eating the king's rich food and wine would "defile" him. His choice of simple plant food ("pulse"—vegetables and grains) resulted in superior physical health and mental clarity (Daniel 1:15, 17, 20).

[ILL] A radio receiver can only pick up signals clearly when properly tuned and free from interference. Static, damage, or poor maintenance degrades reception. Similarly, the human mind—the channel through which God communicates His truth—functions best when the body is healthy and unimpaired by harmful substances. Daniel's clear mind received visions and understanding that surpassed all the wise men of Babylon because his body was kept in optimal condition.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Health and the Sanctuary

The sanctuary teaches us about God's plan for complete restoration. Consider:

- **Outer Court (Altar of Sacrifice)**: Christ's death provides forgiveness—but He died also to free us from the _power_ of sin (Romans 6:6-7), including sins against the body
- **Holy Place (Table of Showbread)**: The bread represented Christ, the Bread of Life, who sustains us—both spiritually and in wisdom for physical living
- **Most Holy Place (Preparation for Translation)**: The final generation will be so closely connected with God that their bodies will be transformed without seeing death (1 Corinthians 15:51-52)

Those preparing for Christ's return must have bodies and minds fitted for heaven. Gross habits and defiled temples cannot receive the seal of God or stand in His presence.

### Righteousness by Faith and Health

True health reform is never legalism or self-righteousness. It flows from:

1. **Gratitude**: We love Him who first loved us (1 John 4:19)
2. **Cooperation**: We work with God's power, not our own willpower (Philippians 2:12-13)
3. **Faith**: We trust that God's ways are best, even when appetite protests (Proverbs 3:5-6)
4. **Sanctification**: The Holy Spirit transforms our desires as we surrender (Romans 12:2)

The same Christ who forgives our sins also empowers victory over harmful habits. We cannot overcome by human effort, but "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13).

### The Prophetic Warning

Isaiah's prophecy connects diet directly to Christ's return:

> _"For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with His chariots like a whirlwind, to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire... They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord."_ (Isaiah 66:15-17)

This passage describes people who attempt self-sanctification ("sanctify themselves") while continuing in practices God has forbidden. At Christ's coming, the distinction between those who truly honor God and those who merely profess to do so will be revealed.

[Q] **"Wasn't the distinction between clean and unclean foods abolished in the New Testament?"**

Some point to Peter's vision in Acts 10 or Paul's statements in Romans 14 and Colossians 2. But careful study shows:

- Peter's vision was about _people_, not food—God was teaching him not to call Gentiles "unclean" (Acts 10:28, 34-35)
- Romans 14 addresses _scruples_ over meat offered to idols, not the clean/unclean distinction
- Colossians 2:16 concerns _feast days_ ("meat and drink" in the context of holy days), not daily diet

Nowhere does the New Testament declare swine or other unclean animals fit for food. The principles of health established at creation and clarified in Scripture remain valid for those who desire to glorify God in their bodies.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for Daily Living

1. **Recognize your body as sacred**: You are not your own; you belong to God by creation and redemption

2. **Choose foods that glorify God**: Ask not "What do I crave?" but "What will best maintain this temple for God's service?"

3. **Return to Eden's diet where possible**: Fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and legumes remain God's ideal; these support optimal health

4. **Avoid unclean foods**: The biblical distinctions between clean and unclean animals remain valid principles of health

5. **Practice temperance in all things**: Even good foods can be harmful in excess; self-control is a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23)

6. **Depend on Christ for power**: Victory over appetite comes not through willpower but through surrender to Christ (John 15:5)

### Steps Toward Change

For those convicted about health but struggling with long-standing habits:

1. **Pray for desire**: Ask God to change your wants, not just your willpower
2. **Learn why**: Understanding the reasons strengthens resolve
3. **Make gradual changes**: Replace harmful items with healthier alternatives
4. **Find support**: Share your journey with fellow believers
5. **Trust the process**: God completes what He begins (Philippians 1:6)

## Appeal

> _"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."_ (1 Corinthians 6:20)

Dear friend, your body is not your own. It was purchased at Calvary with a price beyond calculation—the precious blood of Jesus Christ. The same Lord who died to save your soul now asks to dwell within your body by His Spirit.

How will you respond to this astonishing privilege? Will you continue practices that defile His temple? Or will you, like Daniel, purpose in your heart not to defile yourself?

The choice is not about rules—it's about relationship. It's about honoring the One who gave everything for you. It's about preparing body, soul, and spirit for the coming of our Lord.

By God's grace, may we present our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to God—not in our own strength, but through the power of Christ who lives within us. For "faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it" (1 Thessalonians 5:24).
