## Slide 1 – Q1: The Consequence of the Fall

- **Question:** Because of the Fall, what comes to every man?
- **Key Text:** 1 Corinthians 15:22 – “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ
  shall all be made alive.”
- **Key Text:** Romans 5:12 – “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the
  world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
  sinned:”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Nature of Death

- The inevitable consequence of the Fall is death.
- Death is not just biological; it is separation from God, the Source of Life.
  - **Psalm 36:9** – “For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall
    we see light.”
- God warned Adam that disobedience would cut humanity off from life.
  - **Genesis 2:17** – “But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou
    shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
    surely die.”
- Once Adam fell, the sentence of mortality began to work in the entire human
  race.

## Slide 3 – Q1: Solidarity in Adam

- By natural birth, we partake of Adam’s fallen nature.
- We inherit weakness and decay; we have no inherent immortality in ourselves.
  - **Job 14:1–2** – “Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of
    trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a
    shadow, and continueth not.”
- We are dependent entirely on the breath of God to exist.
  - **Genesis 2:7** – “And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground,
    and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
    soul.”

## Slide 4 – Q1: Application (Righteousness by Faith)

- Since “in Adam” we find condemnation, we must be found “in Christ” to find
  life.
- **Righteousness by Faith:**
  - Adam brought death; Christ (the Second Adam) brings life.
  - Faith unites us to Christ so His victory becomes ours.
  - **Romans 5:19** – “For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners,
    so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.”
- **Justification:**
  - This is the free gift of God to the believer, countering the death inherited
    from Adam (Romans 5:18).

## Slide 5 – Q1: The Sanctuary Connection

- **The Altar of Sacrifice:**
  - In the earthly sanctuary, the death of the victim showed that sin requires a
    life.
  - **Romans 6:23** – “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is
    eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”
- **Christ Our Substitute:**
  - The innocent died for the guilty.
  - **Hebrews 2:9** – “But we see Jesus… crowned with glory and honour; that he
    by the grace of God should taste death for every man.”
  - Because He died our death, He can offer us His life.

## Slide 6 – Q1: Illustration

- **Title:** The Broken Mold
- Imagine a potter using a mold with a deep crack in it.
- Every vessel poured into that mold comes out with the same defect—a crack.
- Adam is like that broken mold; every descendant is born "marred" and subject
  to breaking (death).
- **The Solution:**
  - We cannot fix the crack by polishing the vessel (human works).
  - We must be re-molded in the image of Jesus Christ (regeneration).

## Slide 7 – Q2: The Condition of Man in Death

- **Question:** In what condition is man while in death?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 9:10 – “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
  with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,
  in the grave, whither thou goest.”

## Slide 8 – Q2: Unconsciousness and Silence

- The Bible describes death as a state of unconscious sleep and inactivity.
- **Thoughts Perish:**
  - There is no conscious joy or torment immediately upon death.
  - **Psalm 146:4** – “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in
    that very day his thoughts perish.”
- **No Praise in the Grave:**
  - If the righteous went straight to heaven, they would praise God; but
    Scripture says they are silent.
  - **Psalm 115:17** – “The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down
    into silence.”

## Slide 9 – Q2: The Sleep of Death

- Jesus referred to death as “sleep,” implying a rest until the resurrection.
  - **John 11:11, 14** – “…Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may
    awake him out of sleep… Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.”
- **Protection Against Deception (Spiritualism):**
  - Knowing the dead are unconscious protects us from the lie that spirits of
    the dead communicate with the living.
  - **Ecclesiastes 9:5** – “For the living know that they shall die: but the
    dead know not any thing…”
  - **Isaiah 8:19** – “And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that
    have familiar spirits… should not a people seek unto their God? for the
    living to the dead?”

## Slide 10 – Q2: Application (Sanctuary & Resurrection)

- **The Blessed Hope:**
  - Our hope is not in natural immortality, but in the Resurrection at the
    Second Coming.
  - **John 11:25** – “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:
    he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:”
- **Hidden with Christ:**
  - While the dead sleep in the dust, their life is preserved by Christ in the
    Heavenly Sanctuary.
  - **Colossians 3:3** – “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in
    God.”
  - When Christ completes His work of Atonement, He will call His people forth.

## Slide 11 – Q2: Illustration

- **Title:** The Unconscious Patient
- Consider a patient under general anesthesia for surgery.
- They drift into deep, dreamless sleep. Hours pass, but to them, it feels like
  a single second.
- **The Lesson:**
  - One moment they close their eyes; the very next conscious moment, they are
    waking up.
  - So it is with the believer: they close their eyes in death, and their very
    next conscious thought is seeing Jesus coming in the clouds.
  - The time in between is as nothing to them.
