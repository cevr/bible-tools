# Bible Study: Temperance

## Introduction

Temperance is far more than mere abstinence from alcohol—it is the Spirit-wrought mastery of every appetite and passion, bringing the whole being into harmony with God's will. In an age of excess and self-indulgence, the biblical call to temperance stands as a vital preparation for those who would meet their Lord with clear minds and sanctified bodies.

## Core Truths

### Temperance as a Fruit of the Spirit

The apostle Paul places temperance among the highest graces of Christian character:

> _"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."_ (Galatians 5:22, 23)

**Temperance**: Self-control or self-mastery in all things—the governance of appetites, passions, and desires by sanctified reason and the indwelling Holy Spirit.

Notice that temperance is not produced by human willpower alone, but is a **fruit of the Spirit**—evidence that Christ dwells within. True temperance flows from a surrendered heart, not from gritted teeth and clenched fists.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for temperance is _egkrateia_, meaning "self-control" or "mastery from within." It shares a root with the word for "strength" or "power"—suggesting that true self-control is not weakness, but divine strength ruling the inner life.

### The Athlete's Principle

Paul draws a powerful illustration from the athletic competitions of his day:

> _"And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things."_ (1 Corinthians 9:25)

Ancient athletes training for the Grecian games practiced strict discipline in diet, sleep, and habits—all for a perishable crown of olive leaves or laurel. How much more should Christians, striving for an incorruptible crown, exercise self-mastery in **all things**!

Paul's personal testimony reveals his own practice:

> _"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."_ (1 Corinthians 9:27)

[Q] **"Isn't Paul being harsh on the body? Doesn't God love us as we are?"**

Paul is not promoting self-hatred or asceticism for its own sake. He recognizes a profound spiritual truth: the appetites, if left ungoverned, will master the will and drag the soul into sin. God indeed loves us as we are—but He loves us too much to leave us there. The body is not evil, but it must be the servant of the sanctified mind, not its master. Paul "keeps under" (literally, "bruises" or "disciplines") his body so that his physical desires do not disqualify him from the race of faith.

## Deeper Truths

### The Devastating Effects of Intemperance

Scripture paints a vivid portrait of alcohol's consequences:

> _"Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine."_ (Proverbs 23:29, 30)

Here is a sevenfold curse: **woe, sorrow, contentions, babbling, causeless wounds, bloodshot eyes**—all the bitter harvest of indulgence. Fermented wine promises pleasure but delivers misery.

[ILL] Consider a man who discovers a beautiful spring of water in the wilderness. At first, its waters seem refreshing. But unknown to him, the spring flows through poisoned soil upstream. Day by day, as he drinks, the poison accumulates in his body until it destroys him. So it is with alcohol and every intemperate habit: what seems pleasant at first slowly corrupts body, mind, and soul—until "at the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder" (Proverbs 23:32).

### Why Leaders Must Be Temperate

God gave specific commands regarding those in positions of responsibility:

**For Kings and Rulers:**

> _"It is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted."_ (Proverbs 31:4, 5)

**For Priests:**

> _"Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation... that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean."_ (Leviticus 10:8–10)

Alcohol clouds judgment and blurs moral distinctions. Those who lead others—whether in government, in the church, or in the home—must maintain clear minds to discern right from wrong and to deal justly with those under their care.

[DYK🔎] The command to Aaron in Leviticus 10 came immediately after his sons Nadab and Abihu offered "strange fire" before the Lord and were consumed. Many scholars believe intoxication may have contributed to their fatal presumption—hence the solemn warning that follows.

### Daniel's Example: Purpose and Purity

Among the most inspiring examples of temperance is young Daniel in Babylon:

> _"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank."_ (Daniel 1:8)

Notice the language: Daniel **purposed in his heart**. Before the test came, the decision was made. Temperance begins with a settled principle, not a moment-by-moment struggle.

Daniel and his companions requested a simple test:

> _"Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink."_ (Daniel 1:12)

**Pulse**: Plant-based foods—grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits. The original diet given to humanity in Eden (Genesis 1:29).

The result was remarkable:

> _"And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat."_ (Daniel 1:15)

After three years, when the full examination came:

> _"In all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm."_ (Daniel 1:20)

[Q] **"But didn't Paul tell Timothy to drink wine? Doesn't this prove moderate drinking is acceptable?"**

Paul wrote: _"Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities"_ (1 Timothy 5:23). Several points illuminate this passage:

1. **Two kinds of wine**: Scripture speaks of unfermented grape juice—"the pure blood of the grape" (Deuteronomy 32:14)—which was commonly preserved and used throughout the ancient world. Fermented wine, by contrast, is warned against: "Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright" (Proverbs 23:31). The word "wine" in Scripture can mean either fermented or unfermented.

2. **Medicinal context**: Paul's counsel was for specific stomach ailments—a limited, therapeutic use, not recreational drinking.

3. **Harmony with Scripture**: Paul would not contradict his own teaching that drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom (1 Corinthians 6:10) or his warnings against the "works of the flesh" (Galatians 5:19–21).

[DYK🔎] In Genesis 40:11, the butler describes pressing grapes directly into Pharaoh's cup—fresh, unfermented juice. This "wine" cheers both God and man (Judges 9:13) and represents the blessings of the harvest. By contrast, fermented wine represents decay and corruption—substances in the process of breaking down.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and the Sanctified Mind

The prohibition against wine for priests ministering in the sanctuary reveals a deeper principle: to approach God and discern spiritual truth requires a clear, unclouded mind.

In the earthly sanctuary, priests needed full mental faculties to distinguish "between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean" (Leviticus 10:10). Today, believers are called to be a "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9), and our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19).

The sanctuary teaches that God desires not merely outward conformity but inward purity—a mind cleansed and sharpened by His Spirit to understand His will. Intemperance dulls the spiritual senses, making it difficult to hear God's voice or respond to His leading.

### The Great Controversy and Appetite

The battle over appetite reaches back to Eden. Satan's first successful temptation involved the appetite: "the tree was good for food" (Genesis 3:6). Christ's first wilderness temptation was also appetite: "Command that these stones be made bread" (Matthew 4:3).

Where Adam failed, Christ conquered. By fasting forty days and maintaining perfect self-control, Jesus demonstrated that through dependence on God, the appetites can be mastered. He "was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Hebrews 4:15).

The victory Christ won is available to every believer:

> _"There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."_ (1 Corinthians 10:13)

### Righteousness by Faith and Temperance

True temperance is not legalism—a grim attempt to earn salvation by what we avoid. It flows from faith that works by love (Galatians 5:6). When Christ dwells in the heart by faith, His power subdues the clamoring appetites and brings every thought and desire into captivity to His will (2 Corinthians 10:5).

This is the mystery of godliness: "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27). The one who abides in Christ finds that the attractions of sin grow dim while the beauty of holiness grows bright.

[ILL] A child may cling to a poisonous berry, thinking it a treasure. The parent does not simply snatch it away, leaving empty hands. Instead, the parent offers something better—a ripe apple, a sweet grape—and the child gladly releases the poison for the wholesome gift. So God does not merely forbid; He offers something infinitely better than sin's fleeting pleasures: "pleasures for evermore" at His right hand (Psalm 16:11).

## Practical Application

### The Company of Intemperance

Paul lists drunkenness among the gravest sins:

> _"Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before... that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."_ (Galatians 5:19–21)

And again:

> _"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God."_ (1 Corinthians 6:10)

Drunkenness is not a minor weakness to be excused, but a soul-destroying sin that bars entrance to heaven—unless repented of and forsaken through Christ's power.

Regarding fellowship, Paul counsels:

> _"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard."_ (1 Corinthians 5:11)

This is not cruelty but wisdom. Association with those who persist in sin without repentance weakens our own moral resolve and sends a message that such behavior is acceptable among Christ's followers.

### Practical Steps for Temperate Living

1. **Purpose in your heart beforehand** (Daniel 1:8)—decide your principles before temptation arrives.

2. **Recognize temperance as a fruit of the Spirit**—seek the indwelling of Christ rather than relying on willpower alone.

3. **Guard what enters the mind and body**—the eyes, ears, and appetite are gateways to the soul.

4. **Choose wholesome alternatives**—replace harmful habits with health-giving ones.

5. **Remember your calling**—you are a temple of the Holy Spirit, called to glorify God in body and spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20).

6. **Associate with those who strengthen your resolve**—"He that walketh with wise men shall be wise" (Proverbs 13:20).

## Appeal

Beloved, we live in the closing hours of earth's history. The third angel's message calls for a people who "keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12). This final generation must have clear minds and sanctified bodies to receive the seal of God and stand without a mediator during the time of trouble.

The world offers its intoxicating pleasures—but they bite like a serpent and sting like an adder. God offers something infinitely better: the pure, life-giving streams of His grace, the joy of communion with Him, and the hope of eternal life.

> _"Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."_ (1 Corinthians 10:31)

Will you purpose in your heart today, as Daniel did, to live temperately—not in your own strength, but by the indwelling power of Christ? He who conquered appetite in the wilderness will conquer it in you, if you will surrender to Him.

_"Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen."_ (Jude 24, 25)
