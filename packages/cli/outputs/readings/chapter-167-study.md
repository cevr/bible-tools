### Chapter 167: Religion in the Home

### Q1. How well acquainted is God with the life of each person on earth?

**"Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought
afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all
my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it
altogether." Psalm 139:2-4.**

**Answer:** The Scriptures reveal that God possesses absolute omniscience
regarding the human experience. He does not merely observe us from a distance;
He is intimately familiar with our daily habits, our secret motives, and the
unspoken language of our hearts.

- **God's Scrutiny and God's Care:** To the unrepentant sinner, this truth may
  be terrifying, for "all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with
  whom we have to do" (Hebrews 4:13). However, to the believer resting in
  Christ, this is a source of profound comfort. God knows our frame; He
  remembers that we are dust (Psalm 103:14). He understands our struggles
  against sin and provides grace exactly where we are weak.
- **The Sanctuary Record:** In the context of the _Investigative Judgment_, this
  text reminds us that our lives are being recorded in heaven.
  - _Investigative Judgment:_ The phase of Christ's ministry in the heavenly
    sanctuary (beginning in 1844) where the lives of professed believers are
    reviewed before the universe to verify their faith and repentance prior to
    the Second Coming (Daniel 7:9–10; 2 Corinthians 5:10).
  - Every word and thought is weighed. This underscores our desperate need for
    the covering of Christ's righteousness. We cannot hide our defects, but we
    can confess them. When we do, Jesus, our High Priest, blots them out with
    His blood.
- **Religion in the Heart:** True religion is not a public cloak worn at church;
  it is the atmosphere of the soul when no one but God is watching. If we
  realize God is present in our homes, our words to our spouses and children
  will be seasoned with grace.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a master weaver watching an apprentice work on a
loom. The weaver sees every thread, every knot, and every potential mistake
before it is fully made. If the apprentice tries to hide a mistake, the fabric
is ruined. But if the apprentice works under the weaver's eye, asking for help,
the master can turn even a broken thread into part of a beautiful pattern. So
God watches us—not to catch us, but to perfect us in love.

### Q2. What is the beginning of genuine wisdom?

**"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have
all they that do His commandments." Psalm 111:10.**

**Answer:** The world often mistakes intellectual knowledge or cunning for
wisdom. However, the Bible defines wisdom as a moral alignment with the Creator.

- **The Fear of the Lord:** This is not a trembling terror of punishment, but a
  holy, reverential awe of God’s character and authority. It is the attitude of
  a created being who recognizes the infinite majesty and love of the Creator
  (Revelation 14:7).
- **Obedience and Understanding:** The text links "understanding" directly to
  "doing His commandments."
  - Spiritual understanding is not gained merely by reading theology, but by
    _living_ the truth.
  - "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine" (John 7:17).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** We must avoid the error of thinking we keep
  commandments to _earn_ wisdom or salvation. Rather, because we have received
  the life of Christ through faith, we are empowered to obey. A home built on
  this "fear of the Lord" will reverence God’s law—not as a burden, but as the
  law of liberty and happiness (James 1:25).

**[ILL] Illustration:** A lighthouse keeper understands the ocean not just by
reading charts, but by respecting the power of the waves and keeping his light
burning. If he loses respect for the ocean (lacks "fear"), he becomes careless,
and ships wreck. A wise home respects God’s moral laws (the Ten Commandments) as
the safety barriers that protect the family from the shipwrecks of sin.

### Q3. How are parents instructed to bring up their children?

**"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord." Ephesians 6:4.**

**Answer:** This counsel strikes at the heart of the parents' duty to reflect
the character of God to their children.

- **Provoke Not to Wrath:** Parents must not rule with arbitrary power,
  harshness, or inconsistency. When discipline is administered in anger, it
  breeds rebellion in the child. The "wrath of man worketh not the righteousness
  of God" (James 1:20). The home should not be a place of tyranny but a refuge
  of love.
- **Nurture and Admonition:**
  - _Nurture (Paideia):_ Training, discipline, and education given with
    tenderness.
  - _Admonition (Nouthesia):_ Mild rebuke, warning, and putting sense into the
    mind.
- **The Atmosphere of Grace:** Just as God treats us with longsuffering and
  kindness to lead us to repentance (Romans 2:4), parents are to win the hearts
  of their children. We are to model _Sanctification_—the daily growth in
  holiness—so that our children see Christ in us. If we are impatient and
  fretful, we misrepresent our Heavenly Father.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Consider a gardener. He does not scream at a rosebush to
make it grow, nor does he violently yank it upward. Instead, he prepares the
soil, waters it, provides sunlight, and gently prunes the dead leaves. "Nurture"
is this gardening process. A child, like a tender plant, needs the sunshine of
love and the water of consistent instruction, not the storm of parental anger.

### Q4. How important is it that parents teach the Word of God to their children?

**"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and
thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when
thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou
liest down, and when thou risest up." Deuteronomy 6:6, 7.**

**Answer:** This passage outlines the method for transmitting the covenant of
grace to the next generation.

- **First, In the Heart:** Note the order: The law must first be in the
  _parent's_ heart.
  - _The New Covenant:_ "I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in
    their hearts" (Hebrews 8:10).
  - You cannot give your children what you do not possess. If the parent has
    only a theoretical or legalistic religion, the child will sense the
    hypocrisy. The parent must experience the converting power of the Holy
    Spirit daily.
- **Diligent Teaching:** The Hebrew implies "sharpening" or "impressing" the
  truth. This is not occasional preaching, but constant, incidental instruction.
  - _Sitting, Walking, Lying Down, Rising Up:_ Religion is not confined to the
    Sabbath hours. It is the fabric of daily life. Every sunrise, every meal,
    and every trial is an opportunity to point the child to Christ.

**[ILL] Illustration:** If you have a pitcher of water and you want to fill a
cup, the pitcher itself must contain water. If the pitcher is dry, you can tip
it over the cup as much as you like, but nothing will come out. Parents must be
filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18) so that the living water naturally flows
out to their children in every conversation.

### Q5. What is the value of careful early instruction?

**"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not
depart from it." Proverbs 22:6.**

**Answer:** This is one of the most encouraging promises in Scripture regarding
the influence of the home.

- **"Train Up":** The word implies dedicating or initiating. It suggests guiding
  the early habits and bending the will toward God before sin hardens the heart.
- **"The Way He Should Go":** This is not merely a career path, but "The Way" of
  the Lord (Acts 18:25)—the path of self-denial, service, and faith.
- **The Promise:** While children have free will, the impressions made in
  childhood are deep and lasting. Even if a child wanders into the "far country"
  like the Prodigal Son, the memory of a holy, loving home and the prayers of
  parents act as a restraint and a beacon calling them back.
- **Co-operating with God:** Parents are co-workers with God. By establishing
  habits of obedience, temperance, and reverence early, they lay a foundation
  that the Holy Spirit can use to build a character for eternity.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Consider a young sapling tree. While it is green and
tender, you can gently bend it to grow straight by tying it to a stake. But if
you wait until it is an old, gnarled oak, no amount of force can straighten it.
Early training bends the "twig" of the child’s character toward the "Sun of
Righteousness" (Malachi 4:2).

### Q6. How early was the Bible taught to Timothy?

**"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to
make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus." 2 Timothy
3:15.**

**Answer:** Timothy is the New Testament example of successful home religion.

- **"From a Child":** The Greek word implies infancy. Before a child can read,
  they can learn of God through the love, voice, and actions of the mother and
  father.
- **Wise unto Salvation:** The Bible is not given merely to make us historically
  smart, but savingly wise.
  - _Role of Scripture:_ It reveals our sin and points us to the remedy.
  - _Role of Faith:_ Notice the verse says the Scriptures save "through faith
    which is in Christ Jesus."
- **Christ-Centered Teaching:** We must teach our children the Bible in a way
  that centers on Jesus. The stories of the Old Testament are not just moral
  fables; they are shadows pointing to the Cross. The "faith of Jesus"
  (Revelation 14:12) is the key that unlocks the power of the Word.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A map is useless unless you know where the destination
is. The Bible is the map, but Christ is the destination and the Guide. Timothy’s
mother and grandmother (2 Timothy 1:5) didn't just show him the map; they walked
the path of faith with him, leading him by the hand to the Savior.

### Q7. Why did God confide in Abraham and commit important trusts to him?

**"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after
him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment."
Genesis 18:19.**

**Answer:** God chose Abraham to be the father of the faithful because He knew
Abraham would not keep his faith private.

- **"Command His Household":** This does not imply dictatorial force, but the
  spiritual authority of a faithful leader. Abraham combined love with firmness.
  He did not allow idolatry or sin to flourish in his camp.
- **Justice and Judgment:** These are the very foundations of God's throne
  (Psalm 89:14). Abraham taught his family that God is holy and that His law
  must be obeyed.
- **Public Witness:** A well-ordered, religious family is the greatest argument
  for the truth of the Gospel. Abraham's household was a light to the heathen
  nations around him.
- **Justification and Works:** Abraham was justified by faith (Genesis 15:6),
  but his faith was made perfect by his works (James 2:22). His obedience in
  managing his family was the evidence of his saving faith.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A captain of a ship is responsible for the safety and
conduct of his crew. If he allows mutiny or laziness, the ship is in danger.
Abraham was the "captain" of his large household. He took responsibility to
ensure that everyone under his roof knew the sailing orders of the Captain of
our Salvation.

### Q8. Wherever Abraham journeyed, what was his constant practice?

**"And there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the
Lord." Genesis 12:8. (See Genesis 13:4; 21:33.)**

**Answer:** Abraham left two things wherever he went: a tent and an altar.

- **The Tent and the Altar:** The tent showed he was a stranger and pilgrim on
  earth (Hebrews 11:9–10). The altar showed he was a citizen of heaven.
- **The Family Altar:** This represents the daily worship of the household.
  - _Sanctuary Connection:_ In the ancient sanctuary, the priest offered a
    morning and evening sacrifice (Exodus 29:38–39). So in the home, the father,
    as the priest of the household, should gather the family morning and
    evening.
- **Atonement:** The altar signifies that the family rests on the
  _Atonement_—the blood of Christ. We cannot go through a single day safely
  without confessing our sins and inviting the presence of Jesus.
- **Calling on the Name:** This implies prayer and public acknowledgment of God.
  A home without prayer is a home without a roof—exposed to the storms of the
  enemy.

**[ILL] Illustration:** Imagine a house with no connection to the power grid. It
has lamps and appliances, but they do not work; the house is dark and cold. The
"Family Altar" (worship) is the connection point to Heaven's power. Morning and
evening prayer "switches on" the light of God's presence in the home.

### Q9. Should we thank God for our food, and health and all that we have?

**"In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
concerning you." 1 Thessalonians 5:18.**

**Answer:** Gratitude is the natural outflow of a heart touched by grace.

- **"In Everything":** We thank God not only for the pleasant things but for the
  trials that refine our character.
- **The Source of All Good:** "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
  above" (James 1:17). Recognizing God as the Giver of our food, health, and
  shelter destroys pride. We have nothing that we have not received (1
  Corinthians 4:7).
- **Protection against Apostasy:** Romans 1:21 reveals that the downward spiral
  of sin begins because people "glorified him not as God, neither were
  thankful." A complaining spirit is the first step away from God.
- **Health and Temperance:** Thanking God for our food implies we eat to His
  glory (1 Corinthians 10:31). We should offer simple, healthful food that
  sustains the "temple of the Holy Ghost," rather than indulging in appetites
  that becloud the mind.

**[ILL] Illustration:** A beggar who receives a royal banquet and eats it
without a word of thanks to the King is considered rude and unworthy. We are all
beggars before God. He feeds us daily with physical bread and the Bread of Life
(Jesus). Saying grace at meals and offering prayers of thanksgiving is the
politeness of a soul that realizes its dependence on the King of Kings.
