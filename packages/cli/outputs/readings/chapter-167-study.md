# Bible Study: Religion in the Home

## Introduction

God's plan for human salvation begins in the most intimate sphere of earthly life—the home. Before there was a church, a school, or a nation, there was a family. In Eden, God established the home as the first institution of human society, and it remains the primary school of character where heaven's principles are to be lived, taught, and modeled. This study explores how genuine religion transforms family life and how faithful parents become God's appointed teachers for the next generation.

## Core Truths

### God's Intimate Knowledge of Every Life

The foundation of religion in the home begins with a profound truth: **God knows us completely**.

> _"Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether."_ (Psalm 139:2-4)

**Downsitting and uprising**: God observes our daily routines—our resting and our rising, our private moments and public actions. He understands our thoughts before we think them, our words before we speak them.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word translated "compassest" (_zarah_) means to winnow or sift grain. David pictures God as carefully examining every step of our path, every action of our lives, with the precision of a farmer separating wheat from chaff.

This divine omniscience is not meant to terrify but to comfort and convict. If God knows all things, then:

- Our hidden struggles are seen by One who can help
- Our secret prayers are heard by One who can answer
- Our private choices are observed by One who holds us accountable
- Our family life, behind closed doors, matters eternally

### The Beginning of Wisdom

True religion in the home must be built on **reverential fear of the Lord**—not slavish terror, but holy awe and loving respect.

> _"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments."_ (Psalm 111:10)

**Fear of the Lord**: This is the proper acknowledgment of who God is—His holiness, power, justice, and love—combined with a desire to honor Him in all we do. It produces obedience, not from compulsion, but from love.

**Good understanding**: Notice the connection—true understanding comes to those who _do_ God's commandments. Obedience unlocks spiritual comprehension (John 7:17). Parents who walk in God's ways gain wisdom to guide their children.

[Q] **"Isn't fear incompatible with love? Doesn't perfect love cast out fear?"**

John speaks of slavish fear—the terror of punishment (1 John 4:18). But reverential fear is entirely compatible with love; indeed, it flows from love. A child who truly loves his father fears to grieve him. A wife who deeply loves her husband fears to dishonor him. So the Christian who loves God supremely fears to displease Him. This holy fear is the atmosphere of heaven itself, where angels veil their faces in God's presence (Isaiah 6:2-3).

## Deeper Truths

### The Divine Commission to Parents

God has entrusted parents with a sacred responsibility—to raise children for His kingdom.

> _"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."_ (Ephesians 6:4)

**Nurture** (_paideia_): Training, discipline, instruction—the entire process of child-rearing. It includes correction, teaching, and modeling.

**Admonition** (_nouthesia_): Verbal instruction, warning, counsel—placing truth in the mind through direct teaching.

Paul addresses _fathers_ specifically, emphasizing that spiritual leadership in the home is a paternal responsibility, though mothers share fully in the work (Proverbs 1:8; 31:26). Notice the balance:

- **Negative warning**: "Provoke not your children to wrath"—harsh, arbitrary, inconsistent discipline crushes the spirit and breeds rebellion
- **Positive instruction**: "Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord"—patient, loving, consistent training in God's ways

[ILL] Consider a gardener training a young vine. He does not wrench the tender shoot violently toward the trellis—this would break it. Rather, he gently guides it day by day, securing it with soft ties, directing its growth toward the light. So parents must train children—not through harsh force that provokes resentment, but through patient, loving guidance that directs young hearts toward heaven.

Religion in the home is not merely a set of rules but **love in action**—"love that flows out in all the home intercourse, showing itself in a thousand little expressions of thoughtfulness, kindness, unselfishness, and gentle courtesy."

### Diligent Daily Instruction

The instruction of children in God's Word is not to be occasional but **continual and integrated** into daily life.

> _"And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up."_ (Deuteronomy 6:6, 7)

Notice the progression:

1. **"In thine heart"**—Parents must first possess what they would impart. Cold, lifeless instruction from parents who do not live the truth will be rejected.
2. **"Teach them diligently"**—The Hebrew _shanan_ means to sharpen, as one sharpens a blade by repeated strokes. Truth must be impressed again and again.
3. **"Talk of them"**—Not formal lectures only, but natural conversation woven through daily activities.

**Four teaching moments**:

- "When thou sittest in thine house"—home conversations
- "When thou walkest by the way"—travel and errands
- "When thou liest down"—evening devotions
- "When thou risest up"—morning worship

[DYK🔎] In ancient Israel, the Jewish people took this command so literally that they wore phylacteries (small boxes containing Scripture verses) on their foreheads and arms, and placed mezuzahs (Scripture containers) on their doorposts. While these became mere outward forms for many, the original intent was beautiful—that God's Word should pervade every aspect of life.

### The Power of Early Training

> _"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."_ (Proverbs 22:6)

**Train up** (_chanak_): This word was used for the training of a horse—beginning with the bridle in a young colt's mouth to accustom it to direction. The earlier the training begins, the more natural obedience becomes.

**In the way he should go**: Literally, "according to his way"—suggesting that wise training considers the child's individual temperament, gifts, and needs while directing all toward godliness.

**When he is old, he will not depart from it**: This is a general principle, not an absolute guarantee that removes human free will. Yet it affirms the powerful, lasting influence of early instruction.

No man ever said that he began the service of God too young. No parent ever regretted bringing up children to love, fear, honor, and obey God.

### Timothy's Example: Faith Transmitted Through Generations

> _"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."_ (2 Timothy 3:15)

Timothy's father was Greek (likely not a believer), but his mother Eunice and grandmother Lois were women of genuine faith (2 Timothy 1:5). Through their faithful instruction, Timothy knew the Scriptures "from a child"—the Greek _brephos_ refers to infancy.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "from a child" (_apo brephous_) suggests Timothy's Scripture education began in the very earliest years—perhaps from the time he could first understand words. The Jewish custom was to begin formal Scripture instruction at age five, but informal teaching began at the mother's knee.

This knowledge of Scripture, combined with the living faith he witnessed in his home, qualified Timothy for remarkable usefulness in God's cause. **His home instructors had cooperated with God in preparing him for a life of service.**

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Home as Sanctuary

In the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the home is a primary battleground. Satan knows that if he can corrupt family life, he can corrupt society, the church, and ultimately the world.

But God has provided a way for the home to become a sanctuary—a place where heaven's principles govern, where Christ dwells, where angels love to minister.

This connects with the sanctuary service itself:

- **The altar of sacrifice** finds its parallel in the family altar, where daily worship ascends to God
- **The table of showbread** represents the daily feeding upon God's Word together
- **The candlestick** symbolizes the home as a light in darkness to neighbors and community
- **The altar of incense** represents the prayers of parents ascending continually for their children

Just as the earthly sanctuary was the dwelling place of God among His people, so the Christian home becomes a dwelling place of the Divine Presence when families honor God.

### Abraham: Model of Household Religion

> _"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment."_ (Genesis 18:19)

Why did God confide His plans to Abraham? Why entrust him with such sacred promises? Because **God knew Abraham's character**—specifically, his faithfulness in family leadership.

Notice the elements:

- **"He will command his children"**—not suggest, not merely invite, but command with loving authority
- **"And his household"**—including servants and all under his care
- **"After him"**—his influence would continue beyond his lifetime
- **"They shall keep the way of the Lord"**—resulting in actual obedience

Wherever Abraham journeyed, his constant practice revealed his priorities:

> _"And there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord."_ (Genesis 12:8; see also 13:4; 21:33)

Before Abraham built a house for himself, he built an altar for God. His family worship was:

- **Consistent**—wherever he went
- **Public**—visible to his household and neighbors
- **God-centered**—calling upon the name of the Lord

[ILL] Abraham's altar was his family's spiritual anchor. In a land of idolatry, that simple pile of stones with its ascending smoke declared to all: "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." Every home needs such an altar—a fixed time and place where the family gathers to meet with God.

### Righteousness by Faith in Family Life

The principles of righteousness by faith transform family religion from cold duty to living experience. Parents cannot manufacture holy children through rules and discipline alone. Only Christ, dwelling in the hearts of parents and children by faith, can produce genuine godliness.

This means:

- **Parents' first need** is a living connection with Christ themselves—they cannot give what they do not possess
- **Children must be led to Christ**, not merely to outward compliance—the goal is heart transformation
- **Family worship should reveal Christ**—His love, His grace, His power to save from sin
- **Discipline must be redemptive**, pointing to God's loving correction rather than mere punishment
- **Victory over sin is possible** for every family member through Christ's indwelling power

The home becomes a school of character where family members learn to depend wholly upon Christ, to confess faults to one another, to extend and receive forgiveness, and to grow together in grace.

## Practical Application

### Establishing the Family Altar

Family worship should be:

1. **Regular**—morning and evening, as Abraham's altar suggests (Genesis 12:8). "Let the father, as priest of the household, lay upon the altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice, while the wife and children unite in prayer and praise."

2. **Brief but meaningful**—long, tedious worship breeds resistance, especially in children. A few well-chosen verses, a short explanation, earnest prayer, and perhaps a hymn create sweet memories.

3. **Adapted to all ages**—include children in reading, prayer, and song. Ask questions that engage young minds.

4. **Prepared**—a few minutes of planning transforms family worship from monotonous duty to "the most pleasant and attractive incident of the day."

5. **Consistent**—not abandoned when schedules are busy or circumstances difficult.

### Weaving Scripture into Daily Life

Beyond formal worship, let God's Word flow naturally through:

- **Mealtime conversations**—thanking God and discussing His blessings
- **Discipline moments**—connecting correction to biblical principles
- **Nature observations**—pointing to the Creator's wisdom and love
- **Current events**—viewing the world through Scripture's lens
- **Bedtime routines**—brief prayers and Bible promises

### Practical Safeguards

- **Parents must model what they teach**—children detect hypocrisy instantly
- **Correction must be balanced with affection**—discipline without love produces either rebellion or broken spirits
- **Faith must be made attractive**—religion that is presented as joyless duty repels young hearts
- **Individual differences must be respected**—each child needs personalized guidance
- **Prayer for children must be constant**—only God can convert the heart

### Gratitude as Family Culture

> _"In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."_ (1 Thessalonians 5:18)

Thankfulness should pervade family life:

- Give thanks at meals for food, health, and all blessings
- Express gratitude for one another
- Thank God in adversity as well as prosperity
- Model contentment rather than complaint

## Appeal

_"If ever there was a time when every house should be a house of prayer, it is now."_

The forces arrayed against Christian families have never been stronger. Entertainment, technology, cultural pressures, and the spirit of the age assault the home from every side. Satan knows his time is short, and he targets the family with relentless determination.

But greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4). Christ offers to dwell in every home that will receive Him. "In such a household Jesus will love to tarry."

**Will you establish—or reestablish—the family altar in your home?**

Perhaps worship has grown cold or been neglected. Perhaps you feel inadequate to lead your family spiritually. Perhaps your children seem resistant to spiritual things.

Take courage. Begin where you are. Start simply. Be consistent. Pray earnestly. God who knows your downsitting and your uprising, who understands your thoughts afar off, will meet you. He will give wisdom to those who ask (James 1:5). He will work on hearts that have seemed hardened.

The home you build today will echo into eternity. Your children, and your children's children, may be shaped by the atmosphere you create. Like Timothy's grandmother Lois and mother Eunice, your faithful instruction may prepare workers for God's kingdom.

> _"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it."_ (Proverbs 22:6)

Begin today. Gather your family. Open God's Word. Bow your hearts in prayer. Heaven is waiting to bless every home that will become a sanctuary for the Most High.
