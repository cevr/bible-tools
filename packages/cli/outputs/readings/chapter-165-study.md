### Q1. What principle of justice should govern us in our intercourse with one another?

"Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine
hand to do it." Prov. 3:27.

**Answer:**

The Bible establishes a high standard for our daily interactions. The principle
here is **active benevolence**. It is not enough for the Christian merely to
refrain from harming others; the law of God requires positive action to help
those in need.

- **Stewardship of Power:** The text specifies, "when it is in the power of
  thine hand to do it." God gives us resources—time, influence, money, or
  physical strength—not for selfish hoarding, but to be channels of blessing. We
  are stewards of God’s grace (1 Peter 4:10).
- **The Debt of Love:** The verse speaks of good being "due" to others. While we
  may not owe a legal debt, the Bible teaches that we owe a debt of love to our
  fellow man because of how much God has loved us. "Owe no man any thing, but to
  love one another" (Romans 13:8).
- **Righteousness by Faith Connection:** A heart that has been justified by
  faith is a heart in which the love of God is shed abroad (Romans 5:5). When
  Christ dwells within, His character of self-sacrificing love is **imparted**
  to the believer. We do good not to earn salvation, but because the life of
  Jesus inside us naturally flows outward to others.

[ILL] **The Reservoir and the Channel:** A reservoir that only takes in water
and never releases it becomes stagnant and breeds disease (like the Dead Sea). A
channel receives water only to pass it on to the fields below, staying fresh and
giving life. The Christian is called to be a channel, instantly passing the
mercy received from heaven to those around them.

### Q2. What general rule of recompense is given in the Scriptures?

"Judge not, that ye be not judged, for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be
judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again." Matt.
7:1, 2.

**Answer:**

Here Christ lays down the law of **spiritual reciprocity**. This is often called
the "Golden Rule" in reverse. The attitude we maintain toward the faults and
failings of others determines the standard by which we ourselves are measured.

- **The Danger of a Critical Spirit:** To "judge" in this context means to
  condemn harshly, to attribute evil motives to others, or to hold a censorious
  spirit. This spirit is the opposite of the spirit of Jesus, who came not to
  condemn, but to save (John 3:17).
- **Divine Mirror:** If we are exacting, severe, and loveless toward others, we
  demonstrate that we do not understand the grace of God. We cannot claim the
  mercy of the Gospel while practicing the severity of the law against our
  neighbor.
- **Definitions:**
  - **Recompense:** A repayment or reward; getting back an equivalent for what
    has been given.
  - **Mete:** To measure out (as one measures grain).

[ILL] **The Echo:** If a man stands before a mountain and shouts, "I hate you!",
the echo returns, "I hate you!" If he shouts, "I love you!", the echo returns,
"I love you!" Life is often an echo. The measure of grace or judgment we send
out to the world often comes back to us, both from men and ultimately in the
final judgment of God.

### Q3. Should one, in any case, render evil for evil?

"Recompense to no man evil for evil." Rom. 12:17. "Not rendering evil for evil,
or railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing." 1 Peter 3:9.

**Answer:**

No. The Scriptures are absolute on this point. Retaliation and revenge have no
place in the Christian life.

- **The End of the Law of Retaliation:** The Old Testament civil code allowed
  "an eye for an eye" to limit vengeance in civil court, but Christ abolished
  personal retaliation entirely (Matthew 5:38–39).
- **Overcoming by the Blood:** The natural heart says, "He hit me, so I will hit
  him back." This is the spirit of the world. The spirit of Christ suffers long
  and is kind (1 Corinthians 13:4). To return blessing for cursing requires a
  miracle of grace. It is the strongest evidence that a person has been born
  again.
- **Sanctuary Application:** When we are reviled, we are to look to our High
  Priest, Jesus. "Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
  he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously" (1
  Peter 2:23). We leave the "recompense" in God's hands.

[ILL] **The Sandalwood Tree:** It is said that the sandalwood tree imparts its
fragrance even to the axe that cuts it down. So the Christian, filled with the
Spirit of Christ, responds to the sharp blows of persecution or insult with the
fragrance of prayer and forgiveness.

---

### Q4. What is said of those who render evil for good?

"Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house." Prov.
17:13.

**Answer:**

To return evil for evil is human; to return good for evil is divine; but to
return evil for _good_ is diabolical. This represents a deep hardening of the
heart and a dangerous spiritual condition.

- **Ingratitude:** This was the sin of Judas, who betrayed the Son of God with a
  kiss after three years of receiving only love and truth.
- **The Consequences:** The text warns that "evil shall not depart from his
  house." This suggests a lingering curse or consequence. When we reject the
  influence of the Holy Spirit (the ultimate "Good" given to us), we leave
  ourselves open to the control of the enemy.
- **Practical Warning:** We must be careful not to bite the hand that feeds
  us—whether it be parents, benefactors, or God Himself.

---

### Q5. Will all men be rewarded irrespective of character?

"Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked
and the sinner." Prov. 11:31.

**Answer:**

No. The Bible teaches that rewards are based strictly on the character formed
during this life. There is no universal salvation where character is ignored.

- **Defined by Character:** God does not look merely at our profession (what we
  claim to be), but at our character (what we are).
  - **Righteousness:** This is not our own generated goodness, but the character
    of Christ received by faith and lived out in obedience.
  - **Wickedness:** This is the refusal to submit to God's law and the rejection
    of His remedy for sin.
- **Two Recompenses:**
  - The righteous receive the gift of eternal life (Romans 6:23).
  - The wicked receive the "wages" of sin, which is death.
- **Certainty:** The phrase "much more" emphasizes the certainty of the
  judgment. If God disciplines His own children (the righteous) to purify them,
  how surely will judgment fall upon those who willfully reject His law?

[ILL] **The Coin Press:** A mint presses an image onto metal coins. If the metal
is too hard or brittle to receive the image of the king, it is discarded. In
judgment, God looks for the image of His Son impressed upon the soul. If the
character is not there, the "coin" is counterfeit.

### Q6. Will each man's work be fully brought to light and tested?

"Every man's work shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare it, because
it shall be revealed by fire: and the fire shall try every man's work of what
sort it is." 1 Cor. 3:13.

**Answer:**

Yes. Every action, motive, and secret thought will eventually be exposed and
tested by the standard of God’s law.

- **The Fire of Judgment:** Fire burns away dross and reveals the purity of
  gold. In the final judgment, all hypocrisy, pretense, and outward show will be
  consumed. Only that which is built on Christ and wrought by the Holy Spirit
  ("gold, silver, precious stones") will endure.
- **Investigative Judgment:** Before Christ returns, there is a work of
  investigation in the heavenly sanctuary (Daniel 7:9–10). The books are opened.
  This is not to inform God, but to demonstrate to the universe who has truly
  accepted the wedding garment of Christ’s righteousness.
- **Sanctification:** This is why the "imparted" righteousness of Christ is
  vital. We must not only have a title to heaven (justification) but a fitness
  for heaven (sanctification). The fire tests "what sort it is"—the quality of
  the character.

[ILL] **The Building Inspector:** A builder may hide faulty wiring or poor
foundations behind beautiful drywall and paint. The house looks perfect to the
casual observer. But when the earthquake comes or the inspector opens the walls,
the truth is revealed. God is the inspector who sees behind the "drywall" of our
public reputation.

---

### Q7. Will partiality be shown in decisions rendered?

"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" Gen. 18:25. "Justice and
judgment are the habitation of thy throne; mercy and truth shall go before thy
face. Ps. 89:14. "Who will render to every man according to his deeds;" "for
there is no respect of persons with God." Rom. 2:6, 11.

**Answer:**

God is absolutely impartial. He cannot be bribed, He is not impressed by wealth,
social status, or race, and He does not show favoritism.

- **Respect of Persons:** This phrase means "face-taking"—judging based on the
  external appearance. God looks on the heart (1 Samuel 16:7).
- **According to Deeds:** While we are saved _by_ grace _through_ faith, we are
  judged _according to_ our works. Why? Because works are the infallible
  evidence of faith. A faith that does not produce obedience is dead (James
  2:20).
- **Balance of Justice and Mercy:** Psalm 89:14 shows that God’s throne is built
  on justice. He cannot ignore His law to save a sinner, for that would be
  unjust. Instead, through the Atonement, "Mercy and truth are met together;
  righteousness and peace have kissed each other" (Psalm 85:10). God is just,
  and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus (Romans 3:26).

### Q8. May we not in reality decide for ourselves what our recompense shall be?

"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil." Deut.
30:15. "Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the
way of death." Jer. 21:8.

**Answer:**

Yes. While God is the Judge, He has given every human being the power of choice
(moral agency). In a very real sense, we write our own sentence by the choices
we make each day.

- **The Two Ways:** There are only two paths: the narrow way leading to life,
  and the broad way leading to destruction (Matthew 7:13–14). We are deciding
  today where we will be in eternity.
- **Freedom of Will:** God does not force salvation upon anyone. He draws us by
  His Spirit, He convicts us of sin, but the final decision rests with the human
  will.
- **Righteousness by Faith:** To choose "life and good" is to choose Christ. It
  is to surrender the will to Him so that He may work in us "both to will and to
  do of his good pleasure" (Philippians 2:13).

[ILL] **The Voter:** Imagine an election where you cast a vote every single day.
A vote for self is a vote for death. A vote for Christ is a vote for life. The
final result is simply the tally of the life's direction.

### Q9. Will the cases of any be overlooked in the judgment?

"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that everyone may
receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it
be good or bad." 2 Cor. 5:10.

**Answer:**

No one is exempt. The word "all" is inclusive. Kings and slaves, rich and poor,
believers and skeptics must all face the judgment seat.

- **The Record Books:** God keeps an accurate record. "For God shall bring every
  work into judgment, with every secret thing" (Ecclesiastes 12:14).
- **The Standard:** The standard in the judgment is the Law of God (James 2:12).
- **Our Advocate:** The only hope in this judgment is to have an Advocate. If we
  have confessed our sins, Jesus stands as our representative. He covers our
  past sins with His blood (Justification) and points to His work in our hearts
  (Sanctification) as evidence that we are His.
- **Definition:**
  - **Judgment Seat:** From the Greek _bema_, a raised platform where a judge or
    ruler sat to render decisions.

---

### Q10. What shall determine the nature of the reward in each case?

"Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
also reap." Gal. 6:7.

**Answer:**

The law of cause and effect applies to the spiritual world as much as the
physical world. The nature of the reward is determined by the nature of the seed
sown during life.

- **God is Not Mocked:** Men may fool one another; they may even fool
  themselves; but they cannot fool God. He knows the seed (the motive) behind
  every act.
- **Natural Consequence:** Judgment is not an arbitrary act of an angry God
  striking out. It is the harvest. If you plant thistle seeds, no amount of
  prayer will make them grow into wheat. If you plant seeds of selfishness and
  sin, the only possible harvest is death.
- **Sanctuary Truth:** In the earthly sanctuary, the blood of the sacrifice
  recorded the sin. In the heavenly sanctuary, our sins are recorded. We are
  sowing records in heaven every day.

[ILL] **The Garden:** A gardener cannot plant weeds all spring and summer and
expect to harvest prize-winning vegetables in the autumn. The harvest is simply
the multiplication of the seed. One sin (seed) can produce a harvest of misery.

---

### Q11. Define the harvest of the wrong doer.

"For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption." Gal. 6:8.
"Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil." Rom. 2:9.

**Answer:**

The harvest of sin is **corruption**.

- **Sowing to the Flesh:** This means living to satisfy selfish desires,
  appetites, and passions, independent of God's will.
- **Corruption:** This word implies decay, ruin, and ultimate destruction. Sin
  carries the seeds of its own death. It destroys the conscience, ruins the
  health, and separates the soul from God, the source of life.
- **The Second Death:** The ultimate harvest is eternal separation from God,
  resulting in the cessation of life (Romans 6:23). This is the "strange act" of
  God—cleansing the universe of sin by allowing sin to ripen into its full,
  destructive fruit.

---

### Q12. What shall be the recompense of the righteous?

"But he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."
Gal. 6:8. "But glory, honor, and peace to every man that worketh good." Rom.
2:10.

**Answer:**

The harvest of the righteous is **life everlasting, glory, and peace**.

- **Sowing to the Spirit:** This describes the life of the born-again believer.
  They yield to the Holy Spirit's promptings, study God's Word, and rely on
  Christ's power. They sow acts of kindness, obedience, and faith.
- **Life Everlasting:** This is not just endless existence, but a quality of
  life—sharing the very life of God.
- **Peace:** The wicked have "no peace" (Isaiah 57:21), but the righteous enjoy
  peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1).
- **Righteousness by Faith:** Notice that the reaping is "of the Spirit." We do
  not produce eternal life by our works; we reap it as a gift from the Spirit,
  yet the sowing (our cooperation and faith) is necessary to receive the
  harvest.

### Q13. What scripture brings to view the cases of all as decided forever, and the time when it is accomplished?

"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be
filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that
is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly." Rev. 22:11, 12.

**Answer:**

This solemn decree marks the **Close of Probation**. It occurs shortly before
the Second Coming of Christ.

- **Fixed Character:** At this moment, intercession in the heavenly sanctuary
  ceases. Christ steps out of His role as Mediator and assumes His role as King.
  The door of mercy is shut (as in the days of Noah).
- **"Let him be...":** This indicates the permanence of character. Those who
  have neglected the work of sanctification will remain filthy forever; there is
  no second chance or "purgatory" after this point. Those who are holy (settled
  into the truth intellectually and spiritually) will remain holy.
- **Urgency:** This event takes place _before_ the plagues fall and _before_
  Jesus appears in the clouds. We do not know when this moment will arrive for
  the world or for us individually.

[ILL] **Setting Cement:** Wet cement can be molded, shaped, and smoothed. But
once it sets, it becomes as hard as stone. You cannot change its shape without
breaking it. Our characters are currently like wet cement—capable of being
shaped by the Spirit of God. At the close of probation, the character "sets" for
eternity.

### Q14. Then with what force is the subject under consideration brought home to each heart?

"For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we
neglect so great salvation?" Heb. 2:2, 3.

**Answer:**

The subject of just recompense forces us to realize the **impossibility of
escape** if we ignore God's plan of redemption.

- **The Logic of Judgment:** If God punished violations of the Old Covenant
  (mediated by angels/Moses) with strict justice, how much more serious is it to
  trample upon the blood of the Son of God?
- **Neglect:** The verse does not say "if we _reject_," but "if we _neglect_."
  We do not need to actively fight against God to be lost; we simply need to
  drift, to delay, and to neglect the daily relationship with Jesus.
- **The Great Salvation:** The gospel is "great" because it saves us _from_ sin,
  not _in_ sin. It provides pardon for the past and power for the present. To
  neglect this is to choose the "recompense of reward" for sin rather than the
  gift of eternal life.
- **Appeal:** Today is the day of salvation. Let us sow to the Spirit that we
  may reap life everlasting.
