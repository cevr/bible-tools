# Reading 165: The Just Recompense

## Introduction

God's government operates on principles of perfect justice—every action has its
corresponding consequence, every choice its fitting reward. This study explores
the biblical principle of recompense: how God deals with humanity according to
their deeds, and how this truth should shape our treatment of others today. Far
from arbitrary punishment or reward, God's justice flows from His unchanging
character and invites us to choose life through faith in Christ.

## Core Truths

### The Foundation: Do Good While You Can

_"Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of
thine hand to do it."_ (Proverbs 3:27)

God's justice begins with a positive command: **actively do good**. Before
addressing judgment or punishment, Scripture calls us to generosity and fairness
in our dealings with others.

- This principle assumes we have opportunity and ability to help
- Withholding due good is itself a form of injustice
- Our treatment of others becomes the measure by which we are measured

**Measure for Measure**: Christ declared a sobering principle of divine
justice—_"with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again"_
(Matthew 7:2). The harsh judge invites harsh judgment upon himself; the merciful
receive mercy (Matthew 5:7).

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "measure" (_metron_) refers to a measuring container
used in ancient markets. Christ's hearers would have instantly pictured
merchants who used generous or stingy measures—and understood that God uses our
own "container" to measure back to us.

### The Prohibition: Never Repay Evil for Evil

Scripture is emphatic on this point:

- _"Recompense to no man evil for evil."_ (Romans 12:17)
- _"Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but contrariwise
  blessing."_ (1 Peter 3:9)

This is not mere passivity but **active blessing** in place of retaliation. The
Christian response to injury is not indifference but deliberate kindness.

[Q] **"But isn't it natural—even justified—to repay those who harm us?"**

Natural? Yes. Justified? No. The natural heart cries for vengeance, but the
renewed heart reflects the character of God, _"who maketh his sun to rise on the
evil and on the good"_ (Matthew 5:45). Christ on the cross prayed for His
murderers. This is the standard—not human inclination, but divine love working
in us.

Those who render evil for good face a solemn warning: _"evil shall not depart
from his house"_ (Proverbs 17:13). Betrayal of kindness attracts lasting
consequences.

## Deeper Truths

### The Universal Judgment: None Overlooked

_"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may
receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it
be good or bad."_ (2 Corinthians 5:10)

This is not selective justice. Every human being—righteous and wicked alike—will
give account:

- _"Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the
  wicked and the sinner."_ (Proverbs 11:31)
- _"Every man's work shall be made manifest... the fire shall try every man's
  work of what sort it is."_ (1 Corinthians 3:13)

**The fire** here represents the penetrating nature of divine judgment—nothing
hidden, nothing forgotten, every motive laid bare.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "judgment seat" (_bema_) was familiar to Paul's readers as
the raised platform where Roman magistrates rendered verdicts. Paul uses this
civic image to emphasize that Christ's judgment is official, authoritative, and
final.

### The Impartial Judge

_"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"_ (Genesis 18:25)

Abraham's question is rhetorical—of course He will! God's throne rests on
justice and judgment; mercy and truth go before His face (Psalm 89:14).

- _"Who will render to every man according to his deeds"_ (Romans 2:6)
- _"For there is no respect of persons with God"_ (Romans 2:11)

No partiality. No favoritism. No bribes. No exceptions for the powerful or
overlooking of the humble. This should comfort the oppressed and sober the
oppressor.

[ILL] Consider a farmer at harvest. He does not argue with the ground about what
grows—he planted corn and corn comes up; he planted thistles and thistles
appear. The harvest is simply the mature form of the seed. So it is with our
lives: _"whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap"_ (Galatians 6:7). God
is not mocked. The harvest always matches the seed.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Law of Sowing and Reaping

This is not arbitrary divine punishment but the outworking of eternal law:

| **Sowing**               | **Reaping**                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| _"Soweth to his flesh"_  | _"Of the flesh reap corruption"_ (Galatians 6:8)        |
| _"Doeth evil"_           | _"Tribulation and anguish"_ (Romans 2:9)                |
| _"Soweth to the Spirit"_ | _"Of the Spirit reap life everlasting"_ (Galatians 6:8) |
| _"Worketh good"_         | _"Glory, honour, and peace"_ (Romans 2:10)              |

**This is the character of sin itself**—it contains its own destruction. And
righteousness contains its own reward—communion with God and eternal life.

### The Sanctuary Connection

In the Most Holy Place ministry, Christ as High Priest examines every case in
the investigative judgment. The books are opened (Daniel 7:10); nothing escapes
review. Yet this is not a search for reasons to condemn but an examination
demonstrating that God's grace has been effective in the lives of those who
trusted Him.

For the repentant believer, this judgment is good news: Christ Himself is our
Advocate (1 John 2:1), and His blood speaks mercy over every confessed sin. The
recompense we deserve falls on Him; the righteousness He earned is credited to
us.

### The Final Sealing

_"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be
filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that
is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly."_ (Revelation
22:11-12)

A moment comes when probation closes—when character is fixed forever. This is
not God arbitrarily shutting a door but the natural culmination of lifelong
choices. Each person has decided their eternal destiny by the direction of their
life.

## Practical Application

### We Choose Our Own Recompense

_"See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil."_
(Deuteronomy 30:15)

God places the choice in our hands. He does not coerce. He sets before us two
paths and pleads with us to choose life. The recompense we receive flows from
the path we walk.

**This truth calls us to:**

1. **Self-examination**: What am I sowing daily? In thought, word, action—am I
   sowing to the flesh or to the Spirit?
2. **Generous treatment of others**: Do I withhold good when I have power to
   help? Do I measure to others as I wish to be measured?
3. **Refusal to retaliate**: When wronged, do I seek vengeance or respond with
   blessing?
4. **Urgent decision**: Probation will close. Today is the day of salvation.

[Q] **"If it all comes down to our works, how is this different from
salvation by works?"**

Excellent question. The harvest of reaping what we sow is real—but _what_ we sow
reveals _whom_ we trust. The one who sows to the Spirit does so because the
Spirit lives within, producing fruit (Galatians 5:22-23). The righteous works
are not human effort earning salvation but Christ living His life through the
surrendered believer. We are saved by grace through faith—and that faith
inevitably produces works as evidence of its reality (James 2:17-18). The
judgment reveals whether our profession was genuine.

---

## Appeal

_"For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompence of reward; how shall we escape, if we
neglect so great salvation?"_ (Hebrews 2:2-3)

The writer of Hebrews brings this question with earnest force: **How shall we
escape?** If lesser revelations brought sure consequences, how much more the
full revelation in Christ? There is no escape through neglect. Only through
receiving the great salvation—trusting wholly in Christ's sacrifice and
intercession—can we face the judgment with confidence.

Today, God sets before you life and death. The choice is yours. But the
consequences are certain. _"Be not deceived; God is not mocked."_

Will you sow to the Spirit? Will you trust in Christ's righteousness rather than
your own? Will you treat others with the mercy you wish to receive? The harvest
is coming. The Judge stands at the door. But He comes not as an enemy seeking to
condemn—He comes as a Savior longing to reward His faithful children with
everlasting life.

Choose life, that you may live.
