# Bible Study: Divine Healing and the Prayer of Faith

## Introduction

Throughout Scripture, God reveals Himself as Jehovah-Rapha—"the Lord that healeth thee" (Exodus 15:26). From the wilderness wanderings to the ministry of Christ and the apostolic church, healing has been intimately connected with faith, obedience, and relationship with God. This study examines the biblical principles governing divine healing, the conditions upon which God's healing power operates, and how believers today may experience this precious gift.

## Core Truths

### God's Original Design: Obedience and Health

From the beginning, God linked physical well-being to spiritual faithfulness. This was no arbitrary decree but reflected a deeper truth: sin itself is the root cause of all disease and death.

> _"And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee."_ (Exodus 15:26)

> _"Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them... And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness."_ (Deuteronomy 7:11, 15)

**Obedience**: Willing submission to God's revealed will, not as a means of earning favor, but as the natural response of a heart transformed by grace.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word "rapha" (to heal) appears over 60 times in the Old Testament and encompasses physical, emotional, and spiritual restoration. God's healing is always comprehensive—He treats the whole person.

### Prayer as the Channel of Healing Power

Scripture records numerous instances where earnest prayer brought divine intervention:

**Moses for Miriam** (Numbers 12:13): When Miriam was struck with leprosy for speaking against Moses, his immediate response was intercession—"Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee."

**Elijah for the widow's son** (1 Kings 17:21-22): The prophet stretched himself upon the child three times, crying unto the Lord. God heard, and life returned.

**Hezekiah's personal plea** (Isaiah 38:1-5): Facing death, Hezekiah "turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord." God added fifteen years to his life.

**Jeroboam's withered hand** (1 Kings 13:6): Even this rebellious king experienced restoration when "the man of God besought the Lord."

[Q] **"Why did God heal Jeroboam, an idolatrous king who had just built golden calves?"**

This account reveals God's character beautifully. Even in judgment, mercy triumphs. The healing was not an endorsement of Jeroboam's sins but a demonstration of God's willingness to respond to any sincere cry for help. It was also a witness to the power of the true God over the idols Jeroboam had established. Sadly, Jeroboam "returned not from his evil way" (1 Kings 13:33)—showing that receiving God's mercy without repentance brings greater condemnation.

### The Danger of Misplaced Trust

> _"And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians. And Asa slept with his fathers."_ (2 Chronicles 16:12-13)

Scripture does not condemn the use of physicians absolutely—Luke himself was "the beloved physician" (Colossians 4:14). The condemnation here is that Asa sought **only** the physicians, excluding God entirely. After a lifetime of trusting God in battle and national crisis, Asa's heart had grown cold, and in his affliction, he turned everywhere except to the One who had delivered him so many times before.

[ILL] Consider a child who, having fallen and scraped his knee, runs past his loving father to seek comfort from a stranger. The father is not jealous of medicine or bandages—he would gladly provide these. But to be bypassed entirely, as though he were unconcerned or unable to help, wounds his heart. So it is when we seek every earthly remedy while neglecting the Great Physician who loves us most.

## Deeper Truths

### Christ: The Perfect Revelation of God's Healing Love

> _"And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."_ (Matthew 4:23)

Jesus' healing ministry was not incidental to His mission—it was central to it. Every miracle revealed the Father's character and foreshadowed the ultimate restoration God desires for His children.

> _"Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses."_ (Matthew 8:17)

[DYK🔎] This quotation from Isaiah 53:4 uses language of substitution. The Hebrew words "nasa" (took/bore) and "sabal" (carried) are the same words used for bearing sin. Christ took upon Himself not only the guilt of sin but its consequences—including sickness and death. His healing ministry was not mere compassion (though it was that too); it was a demonstration of His atoning work.

### The Role of Faith

> _"And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."_ (Luke 8:48)

The woman with the issue of blood touched Christ's garment, but it was not the cloth that healed her—it was the faith that led her to Christ. Faith is the hand that grasps the healing Christ offers.

[Q] **"If healing depends on faith, does that mean the sick person is to blame when healing doesn't come?"**

This is a sensitive but important question. Faith is indeed necessary (Matthew 13:58; 17:19-20), but faith is not a work we perform to earn healing. Rather, faith is the attitude of humble dependence on God's will and power. Sometimes the most profound faith is demonstrated not in demanding healing but in trusting God's wisdom when healing is delayed or withheld. Paul prayed three times for his "thorn in the flesh" to be removed; God's answer was not healing but "My grace is sufficient for thee" (2 Corinthians 12:8-9). This was not a failure of faith but a triumph of it.

### The Gift of Healing in the Church

> _"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings."_ (1 Corinthians 12:28)

God placed healing gifts within the church as part of the body's normal function. This was not limited to apostolic times:

> _"And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature... And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils... they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."_ (Mark 16:15-18)

The commission extends to "them that believe"—not merely the Twelve. Wherever the gospel is preached in faith, these signs may follow.

### The Biblical Method: Anointing and Prayer

> _"Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."_ (James 5:14-15)

Note the elements:

- **The sick person initiates**: "let him call"—faith must be active
- **Plural elders**: corporate prayer has power (Matthew 18:19)
- **Anointing with oil**: symbolic of the Holy Spirit's work
- **In the name of the Lord**: all healing comes from Christ's authority
- **The prayer of faith**: confident trust in God's power and goodness
- **Forgiveness connected with healing**: physical and spiritual restoration are linked

[DYK🔎] Oil in Scripture symbolizes the Holy Spirit (1 Samuel 16:13; Zechariah 4:1-6). The anointing in James 5 is not medicinal but sacramental—a visible sign of the invisible work of the Spirit. It also echoes the sanctuary service, where anointing oil was used for consecration (Exodus 30:25-30).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### Healing and the Sanctuary

The sanctuary service reveals that atonement addresses both sin and its consequences. The leper who was cleansed came to the priest, who offered sacrifices and pronounced him clean (Leviticus 14). This teaches us:

- **Sin is the root cause of sickness** (not necessarily personal sin, but sin's presence in the world)
- **Forgiveness and healing are connected** in God's plan of redemption
- **Christ our High Priest** ministers both pardon and restoration in the heavenly sanctuary

In the outer court, Christ's sacrifice dealt with the penalty of sin. In His ongoing ministry in the holy places, He continues to heal—spiritually, emotionally, and physically—as we bring our needs to Him in faith.

### Conditions for Healing

Scripture reveals several conditions that affect whether healing is granted:

**1. Confession of sin**: "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed" (James 5:16). Unconfessed sin creates a barrier to God's blessing.

**2. Right motives**: "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts" (James 4:3). Do we want healing to serve God more fully, or merely to continue in self-serving ways?

**3. Faith in God's power and goodness**: "Because of your unbelief" (Matthew 17:20). Sometimes unbelief in either the sick person or those praying hinders divine power.

**4. Submission to God's will**: Not every request for healing is granted. Paul's thorn remained. Sometimes God has purposes we cannot see. True faith says, "Nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).

[Q] **"Why doesn't God heal everyone who asks in faith?"**

This touches the mystery of divine providence. Several factors may be involved:

- Unconfessed sin creating a barrier
- The sickness may be a consequence of willful choices the person shows no intention of changing
- God may be accomplishing a higher purpose through the suffering (2 Corinthians 12:7-10)
- The timing may not be right (God's delays are not denials)
- It may not be God's will in this particular case

What we can know with certainty: God loves us perfectly, He is able to heal, and He will ultimately restore all things. If healing does not come now, we may trust that our loving Father has reasons beyond our present understanding.

### The Great Controversy Context

Satan brought disease into the world through tempting humanity to sin. Jesus' healing ministry was a direct assault on Satan's kingdom—a demonstration that God's power exceeds that of the enemy. Every healing foreshadowed the ultimate restoration when "there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain" (Revelation 21:4).

When we pray for healing, we participate in this cosmic conflict, claiming ground for Christ's kingdom. Yet we must remember that complete healing awaits the resurrection. Until then, we live by faith, trusting God's wisdom in all things.

## Practical Application

### For Those Seeking Healing

1. **Examine your heart** - Is there unconfessed sin? Cherished bitterness? Unwillingness to forgive others? (Mark 11:25-26)

2. **Seek the Lord first** - Before pursuing every medical option, make God your primary physician. This does not mean rejecting medicine, but prioritizing prayer and spiritual preparation.

3. **Call for the elders** - Follow the biblical pattern. Don't be ashamed to ask for anointed prayer.

4. **Exercise faith** - Come expecting God to work, not demanding a specific outcome, but trusting His goodness whatever comes.

5. **Submit to God's will** - Be willing to accept His answer, even if it differs from your request.

### For Those Praying for the Sick

1. **Examine your own faith** - Jesus asked, "Believe ye that I am able to do this?" (Matthew 9:28)

2. **Pray with compassion** - Jesus was "moved with compassion" (Matthew 14:14). Let love flow through your prayers.

3. **Claim God's promises** - Pray specifically, using Scripture as the foundation of your petitions.

4. **Leave the results with God** - Your responsibility is to pray in faith; the outcome belongs to divine wisdom.

### Living in Health

While seeking divine healing when sick, believers should also cooperate with God's natural laws of health:

- Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, water, and trust in divine power—these are the true remedies (Exodus 15:26 principle)
- Honor your body as the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)
- Avoid those things that weaken and destroy health

[ILL] A farmer who prays for a harvest but refuses to plow, plant, and water has misunderstood prayer. God works through means. So with health—we pray for God's blessing while cooperating with His natural and revealed laws. The same God who heals miraculously also heals through rest, nourishment, and proper care. Faith does not make us passive but partners with God in the work of restoration.

## Appeal

Beloved, our God is Jehovah-Rapha, the Lord who heals. He healed in the days of Moses, in the ministry of Christ, in the apostolic church, and He heals today. "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever" (Hebrews 13:8).

Are you suffering in body? Call upon the Great Physician. Confess every known sin. Seek anointing according to Scripture. Exercise faith—not in your own worthiness but in Christ's boundless love and power.

And if healing tarries, do not lose heart. Our Saviour knows what it is to suffer. He "bare our sicknesses." Every groan of pain, He hears. Every tear, He bottles. And a day is coming—soon, beloved, soon—when He will wipe away all tears and make all things new.

> _"Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth."_ (Jeremiah 33:6)

Until that glorious day, let us trust wholly in the One who bore our infirmities, live in obedience to His healing laws, and pray with faith for one another. Whether He heals now or reserves our full restoration for the resurrection morning, we are safe in His hands—hands that were pierced for our transgressions, and stretched out still to heal, to save, to restore.
