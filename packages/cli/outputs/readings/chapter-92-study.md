# Bible Study: The "Sign" of Loyalty

## Introduction

In the final conflict between good and evil, every soul must choose whom they will serve. Revelation presents two opposing marks—the seal of God and the mark of the beast—representing two rival authorities, two systems of worship, and two eternal destinies. This study examines the biblical evidence for what constitutes God's seal of loyalty, why it centers in His law, and how the Sabbath commandment uniquely identifies the Creator-God and His authority to command.

## Core Truths

### The Final Test: Two Marks, Two Allegiances

Scripture reveals that the closing scenes of earth's history will witness a universal test of loyalty. The third angel of Revelation 14 gives the most solemn warning found anywhere in the Bible:

> _"If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God."_ (Revelation 14:9, 10)

This warning implies a clear alternative. While the whole world wonders after the beast (Revelation 13:8), a distinct company refuses this worship:

> _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:12)

The contrast is unmistakable: those who worship the beast receive his mark; those who refuse are identified as commandment-keepers who trust in Jesus. The mark of the beast and the keeping of God's commandments stand as opposing signs of allegiance.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for "mark" (charagma) in Revelation 13 was used in the ancient world for the imperial stamp on documents and the brand on slaves—signifying ownership and submission to authority.

### The Seal of the Living God

While one group receives the beast's mark, another receives God's seal:

> _"And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice... saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads."_ (Revelation 7:2, 3)

These sealed ones are later seen victorious:

> _"And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having His Father's name written in their foreheads."_ (Revelation 14:1)

The Father's name in their foreheads indicates more than a visible symbol—it signifies that God's character is reproduced in their minds and lives. They have received God's seal, which stands in direct opposition to the beast's mark.

### What Is a Seal?

To understand God's seal, we must grasp what a seal represents biblically. In Daniel 6:8, the purpose of a seal is stated plainly:

> _"Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed."_

A seal authenticates, validates, and makes unchangeable. When applied to law, a seal contains three essential elements:

1. **The name** of the lawgiver
2. **The title** or position of authority
3. **The territory** or realm of jurisdiction

Consider the seal of any civil government. A presidential or royal seal would include the ruler's name (e.g., "Elizabeth"), title (e.g., "Queen"), and domain (e.g., "of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"). Without these elements, a seal has no authority.

[DYK🔎] Ancient Near Eastern kings used cylinder seals rolled onto clay tablets to authenticate official documents. These seals were so authoritative that forging one was punishable by death—the seal represented the king himself.

## Deeper Truths

### The Seal Within God's Law

The prophet Isaiah connects God's seal directly with His law:

> _"Bind up the testimony, seal the law among My disciples."_ (Isaiah 8:16)

This remarkable statement indicates that God's seal is found within His law. But which commandment contains the seal—the name, title, and dominion of the Lawgiver?

**Examining the First Commandment:**

> _"Thou shalt have no other gods before Me."_ (Exodus 20:3)

This commandment speaks of "Me," but does not identify who "Me" is. Any deity could claim this prohibition. It contains no seal.

**Examining the Third Commandment:**

> _"Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain."_ (Exodus 20:7)

This names "the LORD thy God" but does not establish His authority or jurisdiction over other claimants to worship. Heathen nations also called their gods "Lord" and "God."

**Examining the Fourth Commandment:**

> _"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy... For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."_ (Exodus 20:8-11)

Here alone we find the complete seal:

- **Name:** The LORD (YHWH, Jehovah)
- **Title:** Creator ("the LORD made")
- **Dominion:** "Heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is"—the entire universe

The fourth commandment alone identifies the God of the Decalogue as the Creator of all things. No false god can make this claim. No human authority possesses this jurisdiction. The Sabbath commandment is God's seal embedded within His law.

[ILL] Imagine receiving an important legal document. You examine the signature, but it only says "signed" with no name. You look for an official stamp, but it only mentions a title—"Governor"—with no indication of which state or nation. Such a document would carry no authority. But when you find a seal bearing "John Smith, Governor of California," the document becomes binding within that jurisdiction. So it is with God's law: the fourth commandment alone bears the complete seal of divine authority, identifying who gave the law, His right to give it (as Creator), and the extent of His dominion (all creation).

### The Sabbath as God's Sign

God explicitly declares the Sabbath to be His sign of the covenant relationship:

> _"Moreover also I gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them."_ (Ezekiel 20:12)

> _"It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He rested, and was refreshed."_ (Exodus 31:17)

The Sabbath is a **sign** of two vital truths:

1. **God's creative power**—"The LORD made heaven and earth"
2. **God's sanctifying power**—"I am the LORD that sanctify them"

Both creation and redemption are memorialized in the Sabbath. The same power that called worlds into existence is the power that transforms sinners into saints. As Ezekiel states, the Sabbath was given "that they might know" the true God. Weekly Sabbath observance anchors the mind to the Creator, making idolatry impossible as long as the Sabbath is faithfully kept.

[Q] **"Isn't the Sabbath just for the Jews?"**

Scripture refutes this clearly. The Sabbath was instituted at Creation, before any Jew existed: _"And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His work"_ (Genesis 2:3). It was made "for man"—not merely for the Jew—as Jesus declared (Mark 2:27). The prophet Isaiah shows that in the new earth, "all flesh"—every nation—will worship before God from one Sabbath to another (Isaiah 66:22, 23). The Sabbath spans from Eden before sin to the new earth after sin is forever destroyed—a sign for all humanity in all ages.

### The Sabbath in the New Testament

Some suggest the New Testament abolishes or changes the Sabbath. But examination reveals the opposite:

Jesus kept the Sabbath throughout His earthly ministry, stating plainly: _"The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath"_ (Mark 2:27, 28). Christ claimed Lordship over the Sabbath—not to destroy it, but to restore its true meaning.

Jesus anticipated Sabbath-keeping decades after His resurrection when He warned His followers: _"But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day"_ (Matthew 24:20). This instruction concerned the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70—nearly forty years after the cross.

The apostle Paul, often misunderstood on this point, affirmed the Sabbath's continuance: _"There remaineth therefore a rest [Greek: sabbatismos—'a keeping of a Sabbath'] to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from His"_ (Hebrews 4:9, 10). The Sabbath remains for New Testament believers as it was for Israel.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word "sabbatismos" in Hebrews 4:9 occurs only here in the New Testament and means specifically "a Sabbath-keeping" or "Sabbath observance"—not merely general "rest." Early church fathers understood this to refer to literal Sabbath worship.

### The Attempted Change

If the Sabbath bears God's seal of authority, the enemy's strategy becomes clear: attack the seal. Through the apostate religious system symbolized as "the beast," Satan has attempted to change God's law:

> _"And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws."_ (Daniel 7:25)

Notice the precision: "think to change." The beast power cannot actually change God's eternal law—only presume to do so. And what has been the target? The Sabbath commandment—the only commandment dealing with "time."

A comparison of God's law as given in Exodus 20 with its altered form in the Roman Catholic Catechism reveals:

- The second commandment (forbidding images) has been removed
- The fourth commandment (Sabbath) has been drastically altered—the seventh-day specification eliminated
- The tenth commandment has been divided into two to maintain the number ten

[DYK🔎] The Roman Catholic Church openly claims responsibility for changing the day of worship from Saturday to Sunday. The _Catholic Mirror_ of December 23, 1893, stated: "Reason and common sense demand the acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives: either Protestantism and the keeping holy of Saturday, or Catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday. Compromise is impossible."

### A Remarkable Confession

Remarkably, honest Catholic and Protestant scholars alike acknowledge that Sunday observance has no biblical foundation:

**Catholic admission:** "Sunday is a Catholic institution, and its claims to observance can be defended only on Catholic principles... From beginning to end of scripture there is not a single passage that warrants the transfer of weekly public worship from the last day of the week to the first." —_Catholic Press_, Sydney, Australia, August 1900

**Protestant acknowledgments:**

Baptist scholar Dr. E.T. Hiscox, author of the _Baptist Manual_, declared: "There was and is a command to keep holy the Sabbath day, but that Sabbath day was not Sunday... I ask, where can the record of such a transaction be found? Not in the New Testament, absolutely not."

The _Protestant Episcopal_ explanation of catechism states: "The day is now changed from the seventh to the first day... but as we meet with no Scriptural direction for the change, we may conclude it was done by the authority of the church."

These are not Seventh-day Adventist sources—they are honest admissions from other communions that Sunday worship rests on church tradition, not biblical command.

[Q] **"But doesn't worshiping on Sunday honor Christ's resurrection?"**

While Christ's resurrection is foundational to Christian faith, God never authorized a change of His holy day to commemorate it. Scripture provides a memorial for Christ's death, burial, and resurrection—baptism: _"Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life"_ (Romans 6:4). God does not leave humanity to devise our own methods of worship. The golden calf was intended to honor God, but it was abomination because it substituted human invention for divine command (Exodus 32:5, 6).

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Central Issue: Authority

The great controversy between Christ and Satan has always centered on authority. Who has the right to command? Whose law will govern the universe?

Satan's original rebellion challenged God's authority: _"I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High"_ (Isaiah 14:14). In the final conflict, through the beast power, he seeks worship and obedience that belong only to God.

The Sabbath-Sunday issue is not about calendar technicalities but about authority. By observing the day God commanded, we acknowledge His right to rule our lives. By observing a day He never commanded, substituted by human authority, we (perhaps unknowingly) acknowledge that human tradition supersedes divine command.

The issue will not remain hidden. The third angel's message ensures that every soul will understand the stakes before the final test comes. No one will receive the mark of the beast in ignorance. The warning is given precisely so that all may choose intelligently.

### Sanctuary Connection

The Sabbath connects intimately with the sanctuary message. The ark of the covenant, resting in the Most Holy Place of God's temple, contained the Ten Commandments—including the Sabbath commandment (Exodus 25:16; 1 Kings 8:9).

In Revelation's end-time vision, John sees _"the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament"_ (Revelation 11:19). The revealing of the ark in heaven corresponds with the proclamation of the commandments on earth—including the Sabbath truth.

Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary aims to prepare a people who, by His grace, keep God's commandments from the heart. The seal placed in their foreheads represents the completion of sanctification—God's character fully reproduced in His people. The Sabbath, as the sign of sanctification ("that I am the LORD that sanctify them"), is central to this work.

### Righteousness by Faith and Sabbath-keeping

True Sabbath-keeping is impossible apart from righteousness by faith. The Sabbath is not merely refraining from labor but entering into God's rest:

> _"For he that is entered into His rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from His."_ (Hebrews 4:10)

To keep Sabbath properly requires ceasing from our own works—not just physical labor, but our works of self-righteousness, our efforts to earn salvation. The Sabbath proclaims that just as God completed creation without human help, so Christ completes our salvation without human merit.

[ILL] A child cannot earn his parents' love by working for it—the relationship itself is gift. But once the relationship exists, the child's obedience flows naturally from love. So with Sabbath-keeping: it is not a work that earns God's favor but a sign that we have ceased from our own works and entered into the rest of faith. We rest because He has finished the work. We obey because He has transformed our hearts.

Attempting to keep the Sabbath as a legal requirement, by mere external compliance, misses its spiritual meaning. But neglecting Sabbath observance because "we are saved by grace" equally misses the point. Those saved by grace delight in obedience: _"This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments: and His commandments are not grievous"_ (1 John 5:3).

## Practical Application

### Understanding Loyalty Today

The final conflict depicted in Revelation has not yet reached its climax. Sunday laws that would compel worship against conscience have not yet been enacted worldwide. Thus no one living today has received the mark of the beast in the prophetic sense.

But today is the day of preparation. Those who love God will:

1. **Study to know the truth.** Many sincere Christians observe Sunday in ignorance, having never examined the evidence. As this message spreads, each person becomes responsible for the light received.

2. **Respond to present light.** When conviction comes regarding God's Sabbath, faith responds with obedience. Delay hardens the conscience and makes future obedience more difficult.

3. **Trust Christ for power to obey.** Every command of God is also a promise. The One who commands the Sabbath also enables its keeping. Human effort alone will fail; divine power makes obedience possible.

4. **Practice Sabbath-keeping spiritually.** Beyond abstaining from secular work, enter into the rest of faith. Let the Sabbath remind you weekly that salvation is God's work, not yours. Cease from anxiety and self-effort; rest in Christ's finished work.

5. **Worship in spirit and truth.** Gather with believers for worship, Bible study, prayer, and fellowship. Use Sabbath hours for spiritual refreshment, nature, family, and ministry to others.

### The Character Sealed

Those who receive God's seal are not merely outward Sabbath-keepers. Revelation describes their character:

> _"In their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God."_ (Revelation 14:5)

They are truthful—no deceit in their speech. They are "without fault"—not sinless perfection in human strength, but complete surrender to Christ's transforming power. They _"follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth"_ (Revelation 14:4)—total devotion to Jesus.

This is the sealing work: God's character reproduced in His people. The Sabbath, as the sign of sanctification, marks those in whom this transformation is complete.

## Appeal

> _"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb."_ (Revelation 15:2, 3)

Dear friend, the path of loyalty leads to the sea of glass. But the journey requires choices—daily surrender to God's will, moment-by-moment trust in Christ's righteousness, faithful obedience to all His commands.

The Sabbath is not a heavy burden but a blessed gift—twenty-four hours weekly for rest, worship, and communion with our Creator and Redeemer. It is the sign of His creative and sanctifying power in our lives.

As the final conflict approaches, where will you stand? Will you honor the seal of the living God, or yield to traditions of human origin? The choice must be made individually, consciously, deliberately.

Christ stands ready to give you victory. He kept the Sabbath perfectly and offers you His righteousness. He lived the life you could not live and died the death you deserved. Through faith in Him, His obedience becomes yours.

> _"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."_ (Revelation 14:12)

May you be among that faithful company—not trusting in your own strength, but resting wholly in Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath, who alone can seal you for eternity.
