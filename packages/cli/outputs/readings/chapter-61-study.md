### Q1. What wonderful promise did Jesus make concerning His Second Advent?

“Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My
Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you, I go
to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also." John
14:1-3.

**Answer:** This passage, spoken by Jesus just before His crucifixion, provides
the bedrock of the Christian hope. It establishes that the Second Coming is not
merely a theological event, but a deeply personal reunion.

- **A Personal Promise:** Jesus pledges, "I will come again." This is not a
  spiritual manifestation or a metaphor for death, but a literal return of the
  same Person who left.
- **The Preparation:** Christ went to the heavenly sanctuary to "prepare a
  place." This corresponds to His work as our High Priest. While He prepares the
  heavenly mansions, His Spirit is preparing a people on earth to inhabit them.
- **The Ultimate Goal:** The climax of the plan of salvation is restoration of
  face-to-face communion: "that where I am, there ye may be also."

**Righteousness by Faith:** We can claim this promise only through faith. Just
as we trust Him to prepare the physical place in heaven, we must trust Him to
prepare our hearts here on earth. We have no title to those "mansions" based on
our own merits; our title is the **imputed righteousness** of Christ
(righteousness credited to our account).

> **Definition:**
>
> - **Imputed Righteousness:** The perfect life of Jesus credited to the
>   believer’s account, giving them the legal right (title) to enter heaven
>   (Romans 4:22–24).

**[ILL]** A bridegroom builds a home for his bride. The home is proof of his
love and intention to marry. The bride does not build the house; she receives it
as a gift. However, while she waits, she prepares herself for the wedding. So
Christ prepares heaven for us, while we, by His grace, prepare to meet Him.

### Q2. What will follow the signs of Christ's coming?

“And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great
glory." Luke 21:27.

**Answer:** Following the distress of nations and signs in the sun, moon, and
stars, the climax of history arrives.

- **Visible to All:** The text says, "They shall see." It will not be a secret
  rapture or a hidden event. It will be the most public event in human history
  (Revelation 1:7).
- **The Clouds:** In Scripture, clouds often represent the presence of God and
  the angelic host (Psalm 104:3; Matthew 25:31).
- **Power and Glory:** He came the first time in humility and weakness as a
  babe; He comes the second time as the conquering King of Kings.

**The Great Controversy:** This event marks the definitive end of Satan’s rule
over this planet. The "power" displayed here breaks the hold of the grave and
delivers God's people from the dominion of the enemy.

### Q3. At His ascension, how was Christ's return promised?

“And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men
stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven." Acts 1:10, 11.

**Answer:** The angels at the ascension gave specific details about the nature
of Christ's return to guard the church against deception.

- **"This Same Jesus":** It will not be a different entity, a spirit, or a new
  prophet. It is the Jesus who bears the scars of the crucifixion in His hands
  (Zechariah 13:6).
- **"In Like Manner":**
  1.  **Personally:** He went up in person; He returns in person.
  2.  **Visibly:** They saw Him go; we will see Him come.
  3.  **In the Clouds:** A cloud received Him; He returns with clouds.

**[ILL]** If a loved one leaves on a train and says, "I will return on this same
track," you do not look for a letter in the mail or a phone call to replace
their arrival. You go to the station to meet the person. The Second Advent is
the return of the Person, Jesus Christ.

### Q4. With what words does Paul express the blessed hope of Christ's Second Advent for His people?

“Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and
our Saviour Jesus Christ." Titus 2:13.

**Answer:** Paul calls the Second Coming the "Blessed Hope." It is the event
that gives meaning to the entire Christian life.

- **The Great God:** Paul affirms the deity of Christ. We are waiting for God
  Himself.
- **The Context of Grace:** The verses immediately preceding this (Titus
  2:11–12) explain that the "grace of God" teaches us to deny ungodliness and
  worldly lusts.
- **Sanctification:** The hope of His appearing is the strongest motivation for
  holy living. If we truly expect to see a Holy God, we will—by His grace—seek
  to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.

---

### Q5. What does Peter say about this awaited event?

“We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the
power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of His
majesty." 2 Peter 1:16.

**Answer:**

- **Not a Myth:** The Christian hope is not a fairy tale or a philosophical
  concept. It is grounded in history and eyewitness testimony.
- **The Transfiguration:** Peter refers here to the Mount of Transfiguration
  (Matthew 17:1–5), where he saw a miniature representation of the Second
  Coming—Christ glorified, with Moses (representing the resurrected saints) and
  Elijah (representing the translated saints).
- **Certainty:** Because the apostles saw His majesty then, we can have absolute
  confidence in the prophecy of His return now.

---

### Q6. When He returns, will most of the inhabitants of earth be prepared to meet Him?

“Then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven: and then shall all the
tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the
clouds of heaven with power and great glory." Matthew 24:30. "Behold, He cometh
with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him: and
all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him." Revelation 1:7.

**Answer:** Tragically, the majority of the world will not be ready.

- **Universal Mourning:** Instead of rejoicing, "all tribes" (the general
  population of the earth) will mourn. They realize too late that they have
  rejected the only means of salvation.
- **Those Who Pierced Him:** This refers historically to those who crucified
  Him, but spiritually to all who have rejected His grace and persisted in sin
  (Hebrews 6:6).
- **The Reality of Judgment:** The glory of God is a consuming fire to sin.
  Those who have clung to sin rather than Christ cannot endure His presence
  (Hebrews 12:29).

**Righteousness by Faith:** Preparation is not about earning a spot in heaven,
but about being fitted for it. We need **imparted righteousness** (Christ’s
nature lived out in us) to be comfortable in the presence of a Holy God.

> **Definition:**
>
> - **Imparted Righteousness:** The character of Christ produced inside the
>   believer by the Holy Spirit, resulting in a life of obedience and victory
>   over sin (Sanctification) (Galatians 2:20).

---

### Q7. Why will many not be prepared for this important event?

“But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth His
coming," and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with
the drunken; the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not
for Him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and
appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing
of teeth." Matthew 24:48-51.

**Answer:** The "evil servant" represents those who profess to serve God but
whose hearts are unchanged.

- **The Cause:** The internal belief: "My Lord delays." Loss of urgency leads to
  a return to the world.
- **The Result:**
  1.  **Lack of Love:** "Smite his fellow servants." When we lose sight of
      Christ's return, we become critical, harsh, and unloving toward others.
  2.  **Worldliness:** "Eat and drink with the drunken." They seek satisfaction
      in the pleasures of the world rather than in Christ.
- **The Surprise:** The coming of Christ overtakes them like a thief because
  they were not watching.

**[ILL]** A student who believes the final exam is far away may party and
neglect their studies. When the exam day arrives suddenly, they fail—not because
the teacher is cruel, but because they were unprepared.

### Q8. What will the world be doing when Christ returns in the clouds of heaven for His own?

“But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For
as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,
and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the
coming of the Son of Man be." Verses 37-39. "Likewise also as it was in the days
of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they
builded," but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day
when the Son of man is revealed." Luke 17:28-30.

**Answer:** The world will be absorbed in the ordinary affairs of life,
oblivious to the approaching crisis.

- **Normalcy Bias:** Notice the list of activities: eating, drinking, marrying,
  building, planting. These are not inherently sinful things. The sin was that
  they were _wholly absorbed_ in these things to the exclusion of God.
- **The Close of Probation:** In Noah's day, the door of the ark was shut
  _before_ the rain started (Genesis 7:16). So too, before Christ appears, the
  "door" of probation will close. The world continued its routine, not knowing
  their fate was already sealed.
- **Sanctuary Application:** We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
  Just as the Israelites afflicted their souls while the High Priest was in the
  Most Holy Place, we should be prioritizing spiritual preparation over worldly
  gain.

### Q9. Who is it that blinds men to the message about salvation through Jesus Christ?

“In whom the god of this world [Satan] hath blinded the minds of them which
believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image
of God, should shine unto them." 2 Corinthians 4:4.

**Answer:**

- **The Enemy:** Satan ("the god of this world") actively works to distract and
  blind human minds.
- **The Method:** He uses the cares of this life, false doctrines, and worldly
  allurements to prevent the "light of the glorious gospel" from penetrating the
  heart.
- **The Goal:** To prevent men from seeing the "image of God" in Christ.
  Salvation is the restoration of the image of God in man (Genesis 1:27;
  Colossians 3:10). Satan hates this image and seeks to erase it.

---

### Q10. How important is it that we now prepare our lives to meet Christ when He returns?

“Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall
be; but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall
see Him as He is." 1 John 3:2.

**Answer:** Preparation is vital because the Second Coming is a harvest, not a
planting time. We harvest then what we grow now.

- **Identity:** We are "now" the sons of God by faith (Galatians 3:26).
- **Likeness:** "We shall be like Him." This implies that the work of grace in
  the heart must be completed.
- **RBF Connection:** Justification makes us sons of God now; Sanctification is
  the process of becoming "like Him" in character. When He appears, He reflects
  His image in His people.

---

### Q11. Will the return of Christ be a time of reward?

“For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and
then He shall reward every man according, to his works." Matthew 16:27. "And,
behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as
his work shall be." Rev. 22:12.

**Answer:** Yes, Christ brings His reward with Him.

- **Judgment by Works:** While we are saved by _grace alone_ through faith
  (Ephesians 2:8), we are judged by our _works_. Why? Because works are the
  inevitable fruit of saving faith. A faith that does not produce obedience and
  love is dead (James 2:26).
- **The Investigative Judgment:** Before Christ returns to give the reward,
  there must be a judgment to determine who receives it. This work goes on now
  in the heavenly sanctuary (Daniel 7:9–10). When Christ returns, the
  investigation is over; the rewards are ready to be handed out.

> **Definition:**
>
> - **Investigative Judgment:** The phase of Christ’s ministry in the heavenly
>   sanctuary where the lives of professed believers are reviewed before the
>   universe, affirming who has remained in Christ and is safe to save (Daniel
>   7; 8:14).

---

### Q12. Who will receive the promised salvation when Christ returns?

“So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look
for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation." Heb. 9:28.

**Answer:**

- **"Looking for Him":** Salvation is for those who eagerly anticipate His
  return, living in a state of readiness and relationship.
- **"Without Sin":**
  1.  **Christ's Role:** At His first coming, He came _with_ sin—not His own,
      but bearing ours as the Lamb of God. At His second coming, He comes _apart
      from_ sin, as the conquering King. The sin problem has been dealt with.
  2.  **The Believer's State:** This also implies the condition of His people.
      Through the final atonement work of the High Priest, their sins have been
      blotted out (Acts 3:19), and they stand before Him cleansed by His grace.

---

### Q13. What strong motivation should His return have on our lives right now?

“We know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him
as He is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He
is pure." 1 John 3:2, 3.

**Answer:** The hope of the Second Coming is the most powerful engine of holy
living.

- **"Purifieth Himself":** This does not mean we save ourselves. It means we
  actively cooperate with God's work. We choose to separate from known sin, we
  choose to spend time in prayer, and we choose to obey His word.
- **"Even as He is Pure":** The standard is not the culture around us, nor other
  Christians, but Christ Himself.
- **Practical Application:** We cannot purify our own hearts, but we can choose
  to turn away from impurities (impure media, dishonesty, anger) and ask God to
  create in us a clean heart (Psalm 51:10).

**[ILL]** If a guest of great honor is coming to your home, you clean the house.
The scrubbing doesn't invite the guest (the invitation was already sent), but
the cleaning prepares the environment to receive them with honor.

---

### Q14. To whom are these crowns of life promised?

“For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I
have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all
them also that love His appearing." 2 Tim. 4:6-8.

**Answer:**

- **"All Them That Love His Appearing":** The crown is not reserved for apostles
  like Paul alone, but for every humble believer who loves Jesus and longs for
  His return.
- **The Good Fight:** The Christian life is a battle—not against people, but
  against "principalities and powers" and the "lusts of the flesh." Victory is
  promised to those who fight in God's armor (Ephesians 6:11).
- **Kept the Faith:** It is not enough to start the race; we must finish it. "He
  that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved" (Matthew 24:13).

### Q15. What will the waiting ones say when Jesus comes the second time?

“And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him,
and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for Him, we will be glad
and rejoice in His salvation." Isa. 25:9.

**Answer:** This is the shout of victory from the righteous. Note the language
of relationship:

- **"Our God":** They know Him. They recognize Him because they have communed
  with Him daily in prayer and through His Word.
- **"We Have Waited":** Patience and endurance characterized their faith. They
  did not give up during the delay or the persecution.
- **Rejoicing:** While the wicked wail (Revelation 1:7), the righteous rejoice
  because their redemption has come.

---

### Q16. Has the exact time of Christ's coming been revealed?

“But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My
Father only." Matt. 24:36.

**Answer:**

- **God's Secret:** The exact date of the Second Advent is not revealed.
- **Against Date-Setting:** Any teaching that sets a specific calendar date for
  Christ's return is contrary to Scripture.
- **Purpose:** God withholds the date so that we may be in a state of constant
  readiness, living by faith rather than by a countdown clock.

---

### Q17. In view of this fact, how does Christ tell us to prepare for that glorious event?

‘Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come." Verse 42.

**Answer:**

- **Watchfulness:** To "watch" implies spiritual alertness. A watchman on the
  wall does not sleep; he scans the horizon.
- **Active, Not Passive:** Watching is not sitting idly. It involves prayer,
  studying the signs of the times, and working to save souls while probation
  lingers.

**[ILL]** A soldier on guard duty at night must stay awake. If he sleeps, the
enemy may slip in. Our enemy, Satan, walks about as a roaring lion (1 Peter
5:8); therefore, we must watch.

---

### Q18. What warning has Christ given that we might not be taken by surprise when He returns?

“And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with
surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon
you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of
the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before
the Son of man." Luke 21:34-36.

**Answer:** Jesus warns against three specific dangers that dull spiritual
perception:

1.  **Surfeiting:** Overindulgence in food or pleasure (intemperance).
2.  **Drunkenness:** Literally with alcohol, or spiritually with the wine of
    Babylon (false doctrines).
3.  **Cares of this life:** Anxiety over finances, status, or survival.

- **Health and Holiness:** There is a direct link between our physical habits
  and our spiritual readiness. A mind clouded by intemperance cannot discern the
  voice of the Holy Spirit.
- **Accounted Worthy:** We are accounted worthy only through the merits of
  Christ. We "stand" before the Son of Man not because we are sinless in
  ourselves, but because we are clothed in His righteousness and have allowed
  Him to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

---

### Q19. What special attribute should the waiting ones develop?

“Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the
husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience
for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish
your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh." James 5:7, 8.

**Answer:**

- **Patience:** The waiting time may seem long, but God is not slack concerning
  His promises (2 Peter 3:9).
- **The Harvest Principle:** God is the Husbandman (Farmer). He is waiting for
  the "precious fruit"—a people who fully reflect the character of Christ.
- **Early and Latter Rain:**
  - _Early Rain:_ The outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost (and at conversion)
    to germinate the seed.
  - _Latter Rain:_ The final outpouring of the Holy Spirit to ripen the grain
    for harvest just before the end. We must pray for this power to finish the
    work of overcoming sin.

---

### Q20. What has been the attitude of too many Christians toward the Second Advent of Christ?

The belief of the Christian Church in the second coming of Christ appears in
Christian literature from the origin of the so called Apostles' Creed down
through to very recent times.

**Answer:** While the _doctrine_ of the Second Coming has been officially held
by almost all Christian churches throughout history (recited in Creeds), the
_vitality_ and _urgency_ of the hope have often been lost.

- **Formalism:** Many say, "He will come," but live as if this world is their
  permanent home.
- **Spiritualizing:** Others have turned the Second Coming into merely a
  spiritual experience at death, denying the literal return of the King.
- **Our Duty:** We are called to be the "people of the Book" who not only
  believe the doctrine but live the life of expectation, proclaiming the Three
  Angels' Messages to prepare the world for this great event. We must revive the
  "Blessed Hope" in our hearts today.
