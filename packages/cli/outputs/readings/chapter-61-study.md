# Bible Study: Christ's Second Coming

## Introduction

The return of Jesus Christ stands as the crowning hope of all Scripture—the moment when faith becomes sight, when the long night of sin ends, and when God's people are gathered home forever. This promise, given by Christ Himself on the night of His betrayal, has sustained believers through every trial and persecution for two thousand years. Understanding this blessed hope rightly prepares us not merely to wait, but to be ready.

## Core Truths

### The Personal Promise of Jesus

The doctrine of Christ's return rests not on human speculation but on the solemn pledge of our Lord Himself. On the eve of His crucifixion, knowing His disciples' hearts would be troubled, Jesus spoke words of eternal comfort:

> _"Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."_ (John 14:1-3)

Notice the certainty in Christ's words: "I **will** come again." This is not speculation or hope—it is divine promise. Jesus stakes His character as the Truth (John 14:6) upon this return.

[DYK🔎] The phrase "I will come again" in Greek (_erchomai palin_) is in the present tense, indicating an action so certain it is spoken of as already in progress. Jesus was essentially saying, "I am coming"—expressing the absolute certainty of His return.

### The Manner of His Coming

At Christ's ascension, angels confirmed both the certainty and the manner of His return:

> _"This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven."_ (Acts 1:10, 11)

Consider what the disciples witnessed:

- **A literal, bodily departure**—not spiritual or symbolic
- **A visible ascension**—they watched Him go
- **A personal Jesus**—"this same Jesus"
- **A cloud received Him** (Acts 1:9)

His return will mirror His departure: literal, visible, personal, and in the clouds. This truth guards against deceptions claiming Christ has come secretly or spiritually.

> _"Then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory."_ (Luke 21:27)

> _"Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him."_ (Revelation 1:7)

### The Blessed Hope

The apostles did not view Christ's return with dread but with eager anticipation. Paul called it "that blessed hope":

> _"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."_ (Titus 2:13)

Peter defended this teaching against skeptics, grounding it not in fables but in eyewitness testimony of Christ's majesty:

> _"We have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty."_ (2 Peter 1:16)

[Q] **"Isn't this hope just wishful thinking—something to comfort grieving hearts?"**

Peter anticipated this objection. The Second Coming rests on the same historical foundation as Christ's first coming—eyewitness testimony, fulfilled prophecy, and divine revelation. The same Jesus who literally came the first time, died, and rose will literally return. To deny one is to undermine the other.

## Deeper Truths

### Why Many Will Be Unprepared

Scripture reveals a sobering reality: when Christ appears, most of earth's inhabitants will mourn rather than rejoice:

> _"Then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."_ (Matthew 24:30)

> _"All kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him."_ (Revelation 1:7)

Why this mourning? Christ identifies several causes:

**1. Delayed expectation leading to spiritual carelessness:**

> _"But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delayeth His coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for Him."_ (Matthew 24:48-51)

The servant who says "My Lord delayeth" does not deny Christ's return—he postpones its urgency. This attitude leads to mistreating others and worldly indulgence.

**2. Absorption in ordinary life without spiritual preparation:**

> _"But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away."_ (Matthew 24:37-39)

[ILL] Consider a man so absorbed in renovating his house that he ignores the fire alarm. He paints, measures, and plans—all good activities in themselves—while smoke fills the halls. His focus on temporal things blinds him to imminent danger. So it is with those consumed by "eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building" (Luke 17:28). These activities are not sinful, but when they crowd out preparation for eternity, they become fatal distractions.

**3. Satanic deception:**

> _"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."_ (2 Corinthians 4:4)

Satan actively works to blind minds to salvation's truth. His most effective strategy is not blatant evil but subtle distraction—keeping people too busy, too comfortable, or too skeptical to seriously consider eternity.

### The Return as a Time of Reward

Christ's Second Coming is inseparably connected with judgment and reward:

> _"For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every man according to his works."_ (Matthew 16:27)

> _"Behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be."_ (Revelation 22:12)

[DYK🔎] The word "reward" (_misthos_) in Greek means "wages" or "what is due." Christ comes not to determine our reward but to deliver it—the judgment has already occurred in heaven before His return (Daniel 7:9-10, 13-14; Revelation 14:7). This is the investigative judgment, when every case is decided before Christ leaves the heavenly sanctuary to return.

### Who Will Be Saved?

Salvation at Christ's return is not automatic for all who profess faith. Hebrews identifies the recipients:

> _"So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation."_ (Hebrews 9:28)

Two elements are present:

1. **Christ's sacrifice**—He bore sins once for all
2. **Active anticipation**—"them that look for Him"

The word "look" (_apekdechomai_) means to eagerly await with outstretched expectation. It describes not passive waiting but active, longing preparation.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary Connection

Christ's promise "I go to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2) takes on deeper meaning when understood in light of the heavenly sanctuary. Jesus ascended to minister as our High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16; 8:1-2).

In the earthly sanctuary service, the high priest ministered daily in the holy place, then entered the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement to complete the work of cleansing and judgment. Only after completing his work did he emerge to bless the waiting congregation (Leviticus 16:17, 23-24).

So Christ ministers now in the heavenly sanctuary. His "preparing a place" involves not merely constructing mansions but completing the work of atonement—intercession, judgment, and the final blotting out of sins. When that work concludes, He will lay aside His priestly garments, put on His kingly robes, and return in glory.

[DYK🔎] The Jewish people waited outside the sanctuary on the Day of Atonement, watching for the high priest to emerge. His appearance meant atonement was complete—their sins were forgiven. Similarly, God's end-time people wait for Christ to emerge from the heavenly sanctuary, signaling that the work of salvation is finished (Hebrews 9:28).

### The Purifying Hope

The Second Coming is not merely a future event to anticipate—it is a present power that transforms:

> _"We know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure."_ (1 John 3:2, 3)

Here is righteousness by faith in practical operation:

- **"We shall be like Him"**—the goal of sanctification
- **"He that hath this hope"**—living faith, not mere intellectual belief
- **"Purifieth himself"**—active cooperation with divine grace
- **"Even as He is pure"**—Christ's own character as the standard

[Q] **"Doesn't this teach salvation by works—that we must purify ourselves to be saved?"**

Notice carefully: it is "this hope" that produces purification. The believer does not purify himself in order to gain hope; rather, genuine hope in Christ's return produces purification. It is like saying, "Every person who truly loves health exercises regularly." The exercise doesn't create the love of health—it demonstrates and strengthens it.

Christ dwelling in the heart by faith produces obedience (Galatians 2:20). Those who truly believe Jesus is coming will, by that very faith, be transformed into His image. This is imparted righteousness—not human effort but divine power working within.

## Practical Application

### How Then Shall We Live?

Christ and the apostles provide specific counsel for those awaiting His return:

**1. Watch—maintain spiritual alertness:**

> _"Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come."_ (Matthew 24:42)

Watching involves staying spiritually awake, maintaining connection with heaven through prayer and Scripture study, and keeping our eyes fixed on eternal realities.

**2. Guard the heart against worldly entanglements:**

> _"Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares."_ (Luke 21:34)

**Surfeiting** (excessive eating), **drunkenness** (intoxication), and **cares of this life** (anxiety, worldly concerns)—these are the snares that trap souls. Note that only one is outright sinfulness; the others are legitimate concerns carried to sinful extremes.

**3. Pray always:**

> _"Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man."_ (Luke 21:36)

Prayer is not merely asking for things—it is maintaining the connection with heaven that keeps us ready.

**4. Cultivate patience:**

> _"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh."_ (James 5:7, 8)

[ILL] The farmer plants seed in spring but does not harvest until autumn. Between planting and harvest, there is waiting—not idle waiting, but purposeful labor: weeding, watering, watching. He cannot rush the harvest, but he can prepare for it. So we cannot hasten Christ's return by anxiety, but we can prepare by faithful cultivation of our spiritual lives and patient endurance.

### What We Do Not Know

> _"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only."_ (Matthew 24:36)

God has intentionally concealed the exact timing of Christ's return. This is not cruelty but wisdom:

- It keeps every generation watching
- It prevents presumption (assuming we have more time)
- It encourages daily readiness rather than last-minute preparation
- It tests the genuineness of our faith and love

Those who truly love Christ will be ready for Him whenever He comes—whether in their lifetime or not.

## Appeal

> _"And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation."_ (Isaiah 25:9)

What a moment that will be! To look up and see Jesus—the One we have loved though we have not seen Him (1 Peter 1:8)—descending in glory, surrounded by angels, coming to receive us as His own.

> _"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing."_ (2 Timothy 4:8)

The crown is promised not merely to those who believe in His appearing, but to those who **love** His appearing. Is this your heart's deepest longing—to see Jesus face to face? To be done with sin forever? To dwell in His presence for eternity?

If so, let this hope purify you today. Let it draw you into deeper communion with Christ through prayer and His Word. Let it loosen your grip on earthly things and strengthen your hold on eternal realities. Let it give you patience in trial, courage in temptation, and joy in anticipation.

Jesus is coming. This same Jesus—the One who healed the sick, welcomed sinners, and died for your sins—is coming again. And He is coming for you.

Are you ready to meet Him?
