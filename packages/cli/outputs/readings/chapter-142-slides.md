## Slide 1 – Q1: Devoted Things

- **Question:** How does the Lord regard the things that have been devoted, or
  dedicated, to His service?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 27:28 – “Every devoted thing is most holy unto the
  Lord.”

## Slide 2 – Q1: The Nature of Holiness

- **Separation from the Common:**
  - Scripture teaches a distinct separation between the common and the holy.
  - When an object, money, time, or a building is "devoted," it passes into the
    sacred sphere.
- **Exclusive Use:**
  - To be holy means to be set apart exclusively for God.
  - Just as sanctuary vessels were not for common use, the church is not for
    merchandise or common meetings.
  - Daniel 5:23 – “But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
    they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy
    lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them...”
- **Transfer of Ownership:**
  - Dedication implies God now owns the building, not the pastor or
    congregation.
  - Treating the church casually infringes on God’s property rights.

## Slide 3 – Q1: The Believer as Devoted

- **The Believer as a Temple:**
  - This principle extends to the Christian; we are bought with a price.
  - 1 Corinthians 6:19–20 – “What? know ye not that your body is the temple of
    the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your
    own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and
    in your spirit, which are God's.”
- **Application:**
  - We must treat our bodies and minds with the same reverence as a physical
    sanctuary, kept clean from sin.

## Slide 4 – Q1: Illustration

- **The King's Goblet:**
  - Imagine a crystal goblet set aside solely for a King's use.
  - If a servant used it to feed a dog or dig in the dirt, it would be an insult
    to the King.
  - The goblet is glass, but its _assigned purpose_ makes it "most holy."
- **Lesson:**
  - We are vessels set apart for the King of Kings.
  - The church building is set apart for His worship.
  - To use either for common purposes is an insult to the Owner.

## Slide 5 – Q2: Christ’s Regard for the House of God

- **Question:** Did Christ exhibit regard for the sanctity of God's house?
- **Key Text:** Mark 11:15–17 – “And they come to Jerusalem; and Jesus went into
  the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and
  overthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that sold
  doves; and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the
  temple. And He taught, saying unto them, Is it not written My house shall be
  called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of
  thieves.”

## Slide 6 – Q2: Key Points & Cleansing

- **Zeal for Reverence:**
  - Jesus displayed holy zeal against irreverence; grace does not negate the law
    of reverence.
- **Cleansing the Soul Temple:**
  - Christ’s act was a type of His work to cleanse the believer.
  - 1 Thessalonians 5:23 – “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I
    pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the
    coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
- **Removing Distractions:**
  - Buying and selling turned the house of God into a marketplace.
  - Noise and bargaining have no place where God’s voice is to be heard.
- **A House of Prayer:**
  - The primary purpose of the church is communion between the sinner and the
    Savior.
  - Secular conversation interrupts this work of intercession.

## Slide 7 – Q2: Illustration

- **The Audience Chamber:**
  - If you were meeting a head of state to plead for your child's life, you
    would not bring items to sell to others in the waiting room.
  - You would be focused, quiet, and earnest.
- **Lesson:**
  - The church is the audience chamber of the Monarch of the Universe.
  - We are there to plead for the lives of sinners.
  - The atmosphere must reflect the seriousness of this mission.

## Slide 8 – Q3: Not for Jews Only

- **Question:** How can it be proved that the words of Scripture, quoted by
  Christ, do not apply to the Jewish temple alone?
- **Key Text:** Isaiah 56:7 – “Even them [the sons of the stranger] will I bring
  to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer; their burnt
  offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon Mine altar; for Mine
  house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.”

## Slide 9 – Q3: Universal Worship & Righteousness

- **For All People:**
  - The "sons of the stranger" (Gentiles) are included.
  - Ephesians 2:14 – “For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath
    broken down the middle wall of partition between us.”
- **Joyful Worship & Righteousness by Faith:**
  - True reverence is not gloomy; it is the fruit of Righteousness by Faith.
  - We are "joyful" because our sacrifices are accepted through Christ.
  - Hebrews 13:15 – “By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
    God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.”
- **Living Sacrifices:**
  - Romans 12:1 – “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
    that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
    which is your reasonable service.”

## Slide 10 – Q4: Prophetic Statement

- **Question:** Give another prophetic statement of this matter, relating to the
  same time.
- **Key Text:** Malachi 1:11 – “For, from the rising of the sun even unto the
  going down of the same, My name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in
  every place incense shall be offered unto My name, and a pure offering; for My
  name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.”

## Slide 11 – Q4: Incense and Pure Offering

- **Universal Reverence:**
  - God's name is to be "great" globally; where He is known, He is feared.
- **Incense: The Merits of Christ:**
  - Incense represents prayers mingled with Christ’s righteousness.
  - Revelation 8:3–4 – “And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a
    golden censer... And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers
    of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.”
  - **Righteousness by Faith:** Our prayers are only acceptable when mixed with
    the fragrance of Christ's merits.
- **A Pure Offering:**
  - God does not accept worship from those cherishing sin.
  - Psalm 66:18 – “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.”

## Slide 12 – Q4: Illustration

- **The Embassy:**
  - A diplomat's embassy is treated as sovereign territory, even in a foreign
    land.
  - It represents the home government and commands respect.
- **Lesson:**
  - Every Christian church is an embassy of Heaven on earth.
  - It represents God’s government in enemy territory (the world).
  - It demands the respect due to the Kingdom it represents.

## Slide 13 – Q5: Conduct in God's House

- **Question:** How should we conduct ourselves in the house of God?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 5:7 – “But as for me, I will come into thy house in the
  multitude of Thy mercy; and in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy
  temple.”

## Slide 14 – Q5: Mercy, Fear, and the Sanctuary

- **Multitude of Mercy (Justification):**
  - We enter only because of His mercy, not our goodness.
  - This is **Justification by Faith**: coming as beggars clothed in Christ’s
    righteousness.
  - Romans 3:24 – “Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
    that is in Christ Jesus.”
- **In Thy Fear:**
  - Realizing the cost of mercy (Christ's life) produces reverence ("fear"), not
    flippancy.
- **Toward the Holy Temple:**
  - Our eyes lift to the Heavenly Sanctuary where Jesus ministers.
  - Hebrews 8:1 – “...We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand
    of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.”

## Slide 15 – Q5: Illustration

- **The Pardoned Criminal:**
  - If a judge pardons a criminal sentenced to death, the criminal does not
    leave the court joking or dancing.
  - He leaves with humble gratitude and solemn joy.
- **Lesson:**
  - We have been spared by grace.
  - This mix of gratitude and awe is the "fear" and "mercy" David describes.

## Slide 16 – Q6: The Inducement to Worship

- **Question:** Has Christ given us an inducement to worship Him in His house?
- **Key Text:** Matthew 18:20 – “For where two or three are gathered together in
  My name, there am I in the midst of them.”

## Slide 17 – Q6: Key Points

- **The Real Presence:**
  - The presence of Christ constitutes the church, not numbers or talent.
- **"In My Name":**
  - Gathering in surrender to His authority and truth.
- **Christ in the Midst:**
  - Just as the Shekinah dwelt in the sanctuary, Christ is spiritually present.
  - If we saw Jesus walking in the pews, it would end sleeping, texting, and
    whispering.
  - Our behavior should reflect faith in His actual presence.

## Slide 18 – Q7: Regarding the Place

- **Question:** If Christ is present, how ought His people to regard the place
  which He thus honors?
- **Key Text:** Joshua 5:15 – “And the Captain of the lord's host said unto
  Joshua, loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest
  is holy.”

## Slide 19 – Q7: Holy Ground

- **Physical Acts of Reverence:**
  - Internal attitude is demonstrated by external actions.
  - We must "remove" the dust of the world (business, politics, gossip) before
    entering.
- **Recognizing Authority:**
  - Joshua, a great leader, humbled himself before the Commander.
  - In church, all human distinctions fade; all bow before Christ.
- **Preparation:**
  - Rushing into God's presence with a mind full of stress is like walking on
    holy ground with muddy shoes.

## Slide 20 – Q7: Illustration

- **Removing Shoes:**
  - In many cultures, removing shoes keeps the home pure from the dirt of the
    street.
- **Lesson:**
  - Spiritually, we must leave the "mud" of the work-week outside the church
    door.
  - We are entering the Father's house.

## Slide 21 – Q8: Words of Caution

- **Question:** What words of caution does the "Preacher" give us?
- **Key Text:** Ecclesiastes 5:1 – “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house
  of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for
  they consider not that they do evil.”

## Slide 22 – Q8: The Sacrifice of Fools

- **"Keep Thy Foot":**
  - Guard your steps; do not rush in carelessly.
- **Ready to Hear:**
  - The church is a place to hear God's voice from His Word.
- **The Sacrifice of Fools:**
  - Religious activity without heart obedience.
  - **Obedience and Faith:** True obedience comes from the heart.
  - Romans 6:17 – “But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye
    have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.”

## Slide 23 – Q9: Why God Rejected His People

- **Question:** Name one of the reasons why God rejected His chosen people.
- **Key Text:** Jeremiah 7:30 – “For the children of Judah have done evil in My
  sight, saith the lord; they have set their abominations in the house which is
  called by My name, to pollute it.”

## Slide 24 – Q9: Pollution of the Sanctuary

- **Mixing Holy and Profane:**
  - Bringing "abominations" (idols/worldliness) into God’s house.
  - Today's idols: fashion, intellect, politics, entertainment styles.
- **Sanctuary Message Application:**
  - We live in the time of the cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary.
  - Daniel 8:14 – “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred
    days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”
  - If Jesus is cleansing the record of sin above, we should not bring the
    practice of sin into the church below.

## Slide 25 – Q10: Instruction on Treatment

- **Question:** What instruction had the lord given His people regarding their
  treatment of His earthly dwelling place?
- **Key Text:** Leviticus 19:30 – “Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My
  sanctuary; I am the Lord.”

## Slide 26 – Q10: Twin Pillars of Worship

- **Time and Space:**
  - God links the holiness of _time_ (Sabbath) with the holiness of _space_
    (Sanctuary).
  - Sabbath = God as Creator; Sanctuary = God as Redeemer.
- **Commanded Reverence:**
  - "I am the Lord" – The command rests on sovereign authority.
- **Practical Application:**
  - Enter quietly.
  - No whispering or secular talk.
  - Modest dress that glorifies God, not self.
  - Training children to respect God's house.

## Slide 27 – Q11: Acceptable Service

- **Question:** How are all required to serve God?
- **Key Text:** Hebrews 12:28 – “Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot
  be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with
  reverence and godly fear.”

## Slide 28 – Q11: Grace and Reverence

- **Acceptable Service:**
  - Defined by God’s truth, not human preference.
- **Reverence and Godly Fear:**
  - Being careful not to offend a holy God.
- **The Source is Grace (RBF):**
  - "Let us have grace."
  - We cannot manufacture reverence; it is the result of grace in the heart.
  - One saved from eternal death by Christ's blood will naturally be reverent.

## Slide 29 – Q12: David’s Frame of Mind

- **Question:** In what frame of mind does David desire to worship? and what
  does he call the temple?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 5:7 – “But as for me, I will come into Thy house in the
  multitude of Thy mercy; and in Thy fear will I worship toward Thy holy
  temple.”

## Slide 30 – Q12: Key Points

- **Humble Dependence:**
  - David relies on the "multitude of mercy," not his status as king.
  - We are saved by grace alone, through faith alone.
- **"Thy Holy Temple":**
  - It is not "our meeting house"; it is God's property.
  - Acknowledging God's ownership changes how we treat the facility.
  - We are guests in the King's house.

## Slide 31 – Q13: Where God is Feared

- **Question:** Where, does he say, is God especially to be feared?
- **Key Text:** Psalm 89:7 – “God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the
  saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about Him.”

## Slide 32 – Q13: Corporate Reverence

- **The Assembly of the Saints:**
  - There is a unique manifestation of God in the corporate body.
  - Acts 2:1 – “And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
    one accord in one place.”
- **"Greatly to be Feared":**
  - Collective worship should be the most majestic and solemn event of the week.
- **Modeled on Heaven:**
  - Those "about Him" in heaven cry "Holy, Holy, Holy."
  - Isaiah 6:3 – “And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
    Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.”

## Slide 33 – Q13: Illustration

- **Library and Courtroom:**
  - We whisper in a library out of respect for readers.
  - We stand in court out of respect for the judge and the law.
- **Lesson:**
  - How much more should we show respect in the assembly of the saints?
  - We are in the presence of the Judge of all the earth and the Author of our
    salvation.

## Slide 34 – Q14: Performances in God's House

- **Question:** Should any performance which does not relate to the service of
  God, be conducted in a house dedicated to His service?
- **Key Note:** “It is God's plan that His people come together in His house to
  worship and praise Him, and to study His Holy Word... Far too often the people
  of God reserve for the Sabbath hours various activities which could be done on
  other days.”

## Slide 35 – Q14: Exclusive Use

- **Answer: No.**
  - A building dedicated to God is for His service _only_.
  - Secular concerts, politics, or social entertainment lower the standard of
    holiness.
- **The Sabbath Principle:**
  - Business meetings and social planning during Sabbath hours violate the
    sanctity of the place and time.
- **Proper Focus:**
  - Praise, Study of the Word, Seeking victory over sin.

## Slide 36 – Q14: Illustration

- **The Operating Room:**
  - A hospital operating room is kept sterile for saving lives.
  - We would not hold a party or board meeting there.
- **Lesson:**
  - The church is God's hospital for saving souls.
  - It must be kept spiritually "sterile"—free from worldliness—so the Great
    Physician can work on hearts.
