# Reading 82: Penalty for Transgression

## Introduction

The Old Testament prescribed severe penalties for sin—stoning for idolatry, blasphemy, rebellion, and adultery. Yet today, the church does not execute such punishments. Has God changed His view of sin? Has the death penalty been abolished? This study reveals that the penalty remains unchanged, but the timing and execution have been committed to Christ, who alone has authority to judge. Understanding this truth illuminates both God's justice and His mercy in this present age of grace.

## Core Truths

### The Severity of Sin in the Old Dispensation

Under the theocratic government of Israel, certain sins demanded immediate capital punishment:

> _"And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage."_ (Deuteronomy 13:10)

**Idolatry** was punishable by death because it struck at the very foundation of Israel's covenant relationship with God—the first commandment.

> _"And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death."_ (Leviticus 24:16)

**Blasphemy**—treating God's holy name with contempt—warranted the same penalty.

> _"If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother... all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die."_ (Deuteronomy 21:18-21)

**Persistent rebellion** against parental authority was not mere juvenile disobedience, but a pattern of deliberate, incorrigible defiance that threatened the moral fabric of society.

> _"The adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death."_ (Leviticus 20:10)

**Adultery** violated the sacred marriage covenant and the seventh commandment.

[DYK🔎] These penalties were not enacted by individual families taking vengeance, but by the congregation acting as God's appointed judicial body. The requirement of multiple witnesses (Deuteronomy 17:6) and thorough investigation protected against false accusations—showing that even in judgment, God demanded justice and due process.

## Deeper Truths

### The Death Penalty Has Not Been Abolished

Some imagine that New Testament grace has cancelled the penalty for sin. Scripture declares otherwise:

> _"For the wages of sin is death."_ (Romans 6:23)

**Wages**: The Greek word _opsōnion_ denotes a soldier's pay—something earned, deserved, and certain. Sin earns death as surely as labor earns wages. This principle has not changed from Eden to eternity.

[Q] **"If the death penalty still stands, why don't Christians execute sinners today?"**

The answer lies not in a change of God's standard, but in a change of _administration_. Israel was a theocracy—God ruled directly through His law and appointed judges. The church today is not a civil government with authority to execute criminals. Rather, ministers of the gospel serve in an entirely different capacity:

> _"Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."_ (2 Corinthians 5:20)

**Ambassadors**: An ambassador represents his sovereign in foreign territory. He does not execute judgment—he extends terms of peace. Gospel ministers are sent not to condemn the world, but to offer reconciliation while mercy lingers.

### Vengeance Belongs to God Alone

> _"Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."_ (Romans 12:19)

God has never delegated final vengeance to human beings in this gospel age. The cross revealed that God Himself would bear the penalty sin deserves, offering pardon to all who believe—while reserving ultimate judgment for Himself.

[ILL] Consider a governor who has authority to pardon condemned criminals. During a period of amnesty, he sends messengers throughout the land inviting all prisoners to accept pardon and freedom. The messengers do not carry swords—they carry pardons. But when the amnesty closes, the governor himself will execute the sentence upon all who refused mercy. So it is with God in this present age: He sends ambassadors of reconciliation, not executioners. But judgment is certain for those who spurn His grace.

### The Son Has Been Given Authority to Execute Judgment

> _"For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man."_ (John 5:26-27)

Christ alone possesses:

- **Life in Himself**—self-existent, underived life
- **Authority to execute judgment**—as the Son of man who lived among us, was tempted in all points, and understands human weakness

This same Jesus who wept over Jerusalem, who forgave the woman taken in adultery, who said "neither do I condemn thee"—this same Jesus has been appointed Judge of all the earth.

[DYK🔎] The title "Son of man" appears over 80 times in the Gospels. It connects Christ to Daniel 7:13-14, where "one like the Son of man" receives dominion, glory, and a kingdom. Jesus is qualified to judge because He shares our humanity yet lived without sin—He knows both our frailty and our possibility.

### The Appointed Time of Execution

> _"Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgment upon all."_ (Jude 14-15)

The judgment is certain. The timing is appointed. Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of this coming. The very man who "walked with God" and "was not, for God took him" (Genesis 5:24) testified that the Lord would come to execute judgment.

## Principles and Great Controversy Themes

### The Sanctuary and the Timing of Judgment

The sanctuary service illuminates why judgment is delayed:

- **Outer Court (Cross)**: Christ bore the penalty of death that sinners deserve. "The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all" (Isaiah 53:6). Here mercy opened a door of escape.

- **Holy Place (Daily Ministry)**: Christ intercedes for those who come to God through Him (Hebrews 7:25). This present age corresponds to His priestly work—applying the merits of His sacrifice to repentant sinners.

- **Most Holy Place (Judgment)**: Before Christ returns to execute judgment, He first examines every case in the investigative judgment (Daniel 7:9-10). The books are opened. Every name professing faith in Christ is reviewed. Those found clothed in His righteousness are vindicated; those who rejected His grace are left to face the penalty themselves.

The delay of execution is not indifference to sin—it is opportunity for salvation.

### Righteousness by Faith and the Penalty of Sin

The gospel does not pretend that sin's penalty has been waived. Rather, it declares that Christ paid the penalty in full:

> _"The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."_ (Romans 6:23)

**Justification**: When we believe, Christ's death is credited to our account. The penalty we deserved, He bore.

**Sanctification**: The same Christ who died for us now lives in us, empowering us to overcome the very sins that once condemned us. We are not merely forgiven—we are transformed.

[Q] **"Doesn't this mean we can sin freely since Christ paid the penalty?"**

Paul anticipated this objection: "Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?" (Romans 6:1-2). True faith produces a hatred of sin and a love for righteousness. Those who presume upon grace while clinging to sin have never truly received it.

## Practical Application

### What This Means for Us Today

1. **We must not minimize sin.** The severity of the Old Testament penalties reveals how seriously God views transgression. Sin is not trivial—it cost the life of God's Son.

2. **We must embrace this day of mercy.** Christ's ambassadors still extend the offer of reconciliation. The door of the ark stands open. But it will not remain open forever.

3. **We must leave vengeance to God.** When wronged, we are not to take matters into our own hands. "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath" (Romans 12:19). God sees. God remembers. God will repay.

4. **We must prepare to meet our Judge.** The same Jesus who offers mercy today will execute judgment tomorrow. "Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel" (Amos 4:12).

5. **We must share the message of reconciliation.** As ambassadors, we are not sent to condemn the world but to plead with sinners to be reconciled to God while time remains.

## Appeal

> _"Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."_ (2 Corinthians 6:2)

The wages of sin have not changed. Death still awaits the unrepentant. But today, a pardon is offered—purchased by the blood of Christ, sealed by His resurrection, applied by His intercession.

Will you accept the Ambassador's message? Will you be reconciled to God through Jesus Christ?

The Judge who will one day execute sentence is the same Saviour who now pleads, "Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).

Do not delay. The door of mercy stands open—but the day of judgment approaches. Choose life. Choose Christ. Choose now.
