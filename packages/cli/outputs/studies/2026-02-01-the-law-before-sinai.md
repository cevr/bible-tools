  Continuation of Reading 72 (Law before Sinai). The question 'was the law
  before Sinai?' is based on a misunderstanding of what the Law IS. The Law is
  love - love to God and love to fellow man (Matt 22:37-40). Before sin, the law
  didn't need codification - beings that are inherently loving don't need to be
  told to be loving. After sin entered through the knowledge of good and evil,
  doing evil changes us fundamentally - we become incapable of doing only good,
  incapable of being fully loving, as self becomes the predominant force.
  Humanity faces two major problems: (1) sin leads to death, and (2) we cannot
  stop sinning. God is most interested in fixing problem 2 - which is what being
  partakers of the divine nature enables (2 Peter 1:4). Salvation summarized:
  the opportunity to be partakers of the divine nature. Sanctification is what
  truly saves us. Salvation is a gift we did not merit, purely by God's grace,
  yet if we do not allow God to sanctify us He cannot bring us to Him - since
  His presence would destroy us. Key verses: Matt 22:37-40, 1 John 4:8, Rom
  7:18-19, 2 Peter 1:4, Rom 6:23, Heb 12:14, Exodus 33:20.

# Bible Study: The Law Before Sinai

**The law IS love—God's character expressed. Ask "Did the law exist before Sinai?" = asking "Did love exist before Sinai?"**

---

## The Question Behind the Question

- common question: "Did the law exist before Sinai?"
- question itself reveals misunderstanding
- when you understand what law IS, answer becomes self-evident
- [→] so what IS the law?

---

## What IS the Law?

- **law = love** — not primarily a list of rules
  - "On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (Matt 22:40)
  - love to God (commandments 1-4)
  - love to fellow beings (commandments 5-10)

- **Jesus confirmed this directly** (Matt 19:16-17)
  - rich young ruler: "what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?"
  - Jesus's answer: "keep the commandments" — then lists love-to-neighbor commands (vv. 18-19)
  - when asked "which commandments lead to life?" Jesus points to love
  - [→] in Jesus's own words, eternal life and love-commandments are inseparable

[DYK🔎] Hebrew "torah" doesn't mean "rules" — means "instruction, teaching." God's law was always loving instruction, not arbitrary restriction.

- **God IS love** (1 John 4:8)
  - law = expression of God's very character
  - [→] asking "Did law exist before Sinai?" = "Did God exist before Sinai?"

---

## Before Sin — Love Was Nature

- consider unfallen beings — angels, unfallen worlds
  - do they need stone tablets saying "Thou shalt not kill"?
  - **beings that are inherently loving don't need commands to be loving**

[ILL] Mother doesn't need written law forbidding harm to her newborn — love itself prevents it. Law is within her, written on heart by nature.

- before sin, all creation operated from this principle
  - law wasn't absent — unnecessary to codify
  - love was their nature
  - righteousness was default state
  - harmony with God effortless

[DYK🔎] Ten Commandments mostly negative form ("Thou shalt NOT..."). Negative commands only necessary when violation possible. Before sin, such prohibitions meaningless.

[→] so what changed?

---

## What Sin Did — Why Law Became External

- **tree of knowledge** — Adam and Eve gained what they sought
  - "knowing" evil in Hebrew = experiencing it, becoming part of you
  - nature became corrupted
  - self replaced love as operating principle
  - became incapable of doing ONLY good

- **Paul's testimony**:
  - "For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not" (Rom 7:18)
  - "For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do" (Rom 7:19)
  - even an apostle couldn't consistently produce good
  - not defeatism — diagnosis

- **why Sinai was necessary**:
  - sin corrupted internal nature → law MUST become external
  - sin had corrupted nature — love no longer default
  - needed external instruction — internal nature unreliable
  - law diagnoses sin — "I had not known sin, but by the law" (Rom 7:7)
  - law points to Christ — "schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ" (Gal 3:24)

- **law didn't originate at Sinai** — love has always been God's character
  - Sinai = God codified His character for fallen beings
  - now we could recognize our failure to uphold it

[DYK🔎] Law given at Sinai exactly fifty days after Exodus — parallels Pentecost, fifty days after resurrection. Sinai: law on stone tablets. Pentecost: law on human hearts (Jer 31:33). External law pointed to internal transformation God always intended.

[→] this new reality was tested immediately — in the very first family

---

## Recap — The First Test: Cain and Abel

- in our last study we saw Cain and Abel as the first visible distinction between two approaches to God
- after the Fall, every human faces the same choice they faced
- **two classes of people — two religions — persist to this day**

### Abel — Faith and Obedience (Genesis 4:4)

- brought a lamb — "firstlings of the flock"
- recognized he was a sinner needing a substitute
- followed God's requirement to the letter
- accepted that the problem was IN him and the solution had to come from OUTSIDE him
- [→] this is the posture that receives transformation — the one who says "I cannot fix myself"

### Cain — Self-Effort and Human Judgment (Genesis 4:3)

- brought "fruit of the ground" — product of his own labor on the cursed earth
- substituted his own judgment for God's explicit requirement
- offered God the work of his own hands
- represents those who believe they can meet the standard on their own terms
- [→] Cain offered "self" — the very principle that replaced love after the Fall

[ILL] Two patients with the same deadly disease. One admits he is helpless and takes the doctor's prescribed medicine — he is cured. The other insists he can heal himself with his own remedies — he gets worse. The second patient hates the first, because the first man's cure exposes the second man's failure. Cain hated Abel because Abel's faith exposed Cain's self-reliance.

- **these two responses define every person's stance before God**
  - every religion, every era, every individual
  - God's way (faith + obedience) or my way (self-effort + human reasoning)
  - this is not an ancient story — it is the ongoing human condition

[→] Cain's failure exposes the two problems every human faces

---

## The Two Problems of Humanity

- **Problem 1: sin leads to death**
  - "The wages of sin is death" (Rom 6:23)

- **Problem 2: we cannot stop sinning**
  - "In me dwelleth no good thing... the evil I would not, that I do" (Rom 7:18-19)

- most teaching focuses on Problem 1 — forgiveness, penalty paid, justification
- **God is supremely interested in solving Problem 2**

---

### The Danger of God's Presence

- "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live" (Exod 33:20)
  - not because God is cruel
  - **holiness and sin cannot coexist**
  - light doesn't "choose" to destroy darkness — nature of light

- "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord" (Heb 12:14)
  - absolute statement: without holiness, no man shall see Lord
  - not arbitrary — protective reality
  - God cannot bring unholy beings into presence without destroying them

[Q] **"But doesn't forgiveness solve the problem?"**
→ Forgiveness addresses record of sin — not nature that produces sin.

[ILL] Doctor forgives your medical debt but doesn't cure your disease. Financially free but still dying. → Forgiveness alone cannot bring us safely into God's presence. We need transformation.

[→] Christ's ministry addresses both problems together

---

### Christ Addresses Both Problems

**The Paralytic (Mark 2:1-12)**

- four friends lower paralyzed man through roof
- Christ's first words: "Son, thy sins be forgiven thee" (Mark 2:5)
- scribes object in hearts: "Who can forgive sins but God only?"
- Jesus responds:
  - "Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?" (Mark 2:9)
  - "But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins... Arise, and take up thy bed" (Mark 2:10-11)
- **proved authority to forgive through power to heal**
- paralytic needed both — forgiveness AND power to walk
- Christ gave both, inseparably
- physical healing demonstrated spiritual reality: Jesus doesn't merely pardon — He empowers

**The Woman Caught in Adultery (John 8:1-11)**

- scribes and Pharisees bring woman, seeking to trap Jesus
- accusers depart, convicted by conscience
- Jesus speaks two statements, two gifts:
  - "Neither do I condemn thee" — forgiveness (Problem 1 solved)
  - "Go, and sin no more" — empowerment (Problem 2 solved)
- didn't say "You're forgiven; try harder"
- **granted her power to live differently**
- forgiveness and transformation inseparable in Christ's ministry

[DYK🔎] Greek "sin no more" (mēketi hamartane) = present imperative with negative particle — indicates cessation of ongoing action. Jesus commanded her to stop pattern of sin — implying He gave power to do so. He never commands the impossible.

[→] what IS this transformation God offers?

---

## The Divine Solution — Partakers of Divine Nature

- "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust" (2 Pet 1:4)
- **God offers us participation in His own nature**

- God's solution is NOT:
  - forgive guilt and stop there
  - overlook the problem
  - lower the standard

- God's solution IS:
  - **transform sinner into His likeness**
  - **share His divine nature with fallen beings**
  - **make us capable of dwelling in His presence**

[DYK🔎] Greek "partakers" (koinonos) = sharer, partner, companion. We become partners with God in His own nature — sharing His love, holiness, character. Most intimate union possible between Creator and creature.

---

### This IS Sanctification

- **partaking of divine nature = sanctification**
  - God restoring love as our operating principle
  - God replacing self with His character

- **salvation comes THROUGH sanctification**
  - "God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth" (2 Thess 2:13)
  - not salvation THEN sanctification — salvation THROUGH sanctification
  - sanctification is not separate from salvation — it is the very means of it
  - Spirit's sanctifying work + belief of truth = how God saves

- common understanding vs. biblical reality:
  - salvation = escaping hell? → salvation = being transformed into God's image
  - goal = heaven as location? → goal = God's presence as relationship
  - focus = forgiveness of past sins? → focus = transformation enabling future holiness

- **justification** deals with sin's penalty
- **sanctification** deals with sin's power
- **glorification** deals with sin's presence
- all three necessary, all three gifts
- sanctification = process making us capable of what salvation offers

[Q] **"Doesn't this make salvation dependent on our works?"**
→ Sanctification is God's work IN us, just as justification is God's work FOR us. We don't sanctify ourselves — we allow God to sanctify us.
→ We cannot earn salvation (purely grace)
→ We can resist transformation (God respects freedom)
→ Salvation requires cooperation (yielding to God's work)

[ILL] Patient doesn't earn healing by taking medicine — but refusing medicine prevents healing. We don't earn sanctification, but resisting it prevents us from receiving what God freely offers.

- **the paradox of grace**:
  - salvation entirely a gift, purely by grace through faith
  - yet: if we don't allow God to sanctify us, He cannot bring us to Himself
  - His presence would destroy us
  - not limitation of God's love — reality of what we need
  - we need more than pardon; we need transformation
  - God offers both; we must accept both

[→] this completes salvation's arc

---

## The Circle Closes — Law Written on Hearts

- **before sin**: love was nature; law dwelt within; no external codification needed
- **after sin**: love replaced by self; law had to become external at Sinai — gracious diagnosis
- **through Christ**: God offers His divine nature; sanctification restores love as operating principle
- **in glory**: law written on hearts again; Eden restored

- "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people" (Jer 31:33)

- "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes" (Ezek 36:26-27)
  - new heart — stony → flesh (receptive, alive)
  - new spirit — God's Spirit within
  - result: "cause you to walk in my statutes"
  - not merely forgiveness — transformation that produces obedience

- **law on tablets was always meant to lead us back to law on hearts**

- when divine nature fully restored:
  - won't need to be told not to murder — love prevents it
  - won't need to be told not to steal — love prevents it
  - won't need command to worship God — love compels it

- gospel's glorious conclusion:
  - not merely forgiven sinners — transformed saints
  - not merely pardoned criminals — beloved children bearing Father's character
  - not merely escaping hell — becoming fit for heaven, for God's presence

---

## Key Truths

- **law IS love** — God's character in relational principles (Matt 22:37-40; 1 John 4:8)
- **Jesus equates eternal life with commandment-keeping** — "if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments" (Matt 19:17); then lists love-to-neighbor commands
- **before sin, law didn't need codification** — unfallen beings naturally love
- **sin fundamentally changed humanity** — cannot consistently do good (Rom 7:18-19)
- **law had to become external** — Sinai was gracious response to broken internal nature
- **Cain and Abel represent two universal responses to God's law** — self-effort and human judgment (Cain) vs. faith and obedience to God's requirements (Abel); these two classes persist in every era (Gen 4:3-4)
- **two problems**: sin leads to death; we cannot stop sinning
- **Christ addresses both together** — paralytic's healing, adulteress's pardon
- **God most interested in Problem 2** — forgiveness alone cannot prepare for His presence (Exod 33:20; Heb 12:14)
- **salvation comes THROUGH sanctification** — Spirit's work + belief of truth (2 Thess 2:13)
- **salvation = becoming partakers of divine nature** — this IS sanctification (2 Pet 1:4)
- **remains gift of grace** — cannot earn it; must allow God to work
- **circle closes** — law within before sin → law external after sin → law on hearts through Christ (Jer 31:33; Ezek 36:26-27) → Eden restored

---

## Appeal

- God not merely offering forgiveness for yesterday's sins
- God not merely offering heaven as future destination
- **God offering Himself** — His nature, character, love written on your heart

- love IS the law
- when we become partakers of divine nature, love becomes who we ARE — not just what we do

- question "Was law before Sinai?" misses the point
- law has always been — because God has always been, and God is love

- **the real question**: Will you allow that love to transform you?
